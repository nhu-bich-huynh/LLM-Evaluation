"Text"
"For all that, however, today' s debate, in my opinion, is a far cry from being needless repetition."
"It is, on the contrary, particularly important as today Parliament is to decide if, as is urged by the conclusions of the Cologne Council, it is going to proclaim this text, jointly with the Council and the Commission, at the European Council meeting in Nice, which is less than a month away now."
"This is quite clearly a major political decision and a fresh opportunity to show the citizens of Europe the whole scope of this initiative."
"I understand that the position advocated by your Committee on Constitutional Affairs - and let me congratulate the Committee' s rapporteurs, Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, who have just spoken - urges you to adopt the text of the Charter as it stands and, therefore, to mandate your President to proclaim the Charter on behalf of Parliament in Nice, alongside the Presidents of the Council and of the Commission."
"As you know, this position is in line with that adopted by the Heads of State and Government at the Biarritz European Council who unanimously and unreservedly approved the Charter, and I can only urge you, therefore, on behalf of the Council, to follow suit, perhaps giving you a few reasons to do so."
"The Council Presidency sees this Charter as symbolising a twofold success."
"A success, in the first place, in terms of the method adopted: that of a body, the Convention, made up of Members of the European Parliament, national parliaments, the European Commission - and let me take this opportunity to greet Mr Vitorino, who brought all his competence to bear - and of personal representatives of the Heads of State and Government, the whole body subject to the enlightened chairmanship of Mr Roman Herzog, the former President of both the Karlsruhe Court and the Federal Republic of Germany."
"I feel that the diversity and the quality of the appointed Members represented an unquestionable asset."
"I find similarly extraordinary the twofold concern which the Convention had - to work with the utmost transparency and interaction with the public, particularly through the Internet."
"So, with a concern for openness which paid off in the end, in the course of its work the Convention heard from the major European non-governmental organisations, both sides of industry in Europe and, importantly, too, for the future, the candidate countries."
"This transparency and openness actively contributed to the gradual improvement of the various versions of the draft Charter and enabled the final version to be the right one."
"I know that the Convention experiment already clearly appears to be one of the avenues - one, but not the only avenue - which Europe could follow up in future in order to be more transparent and in touch with the opinions of European citizens."
"Members of the European Parliament, particularly in our previous debate, have already expressed the wish to repeat the experiment."
"I, personally, have no doubt that such an opportunity will present itself."
"The second and main success, is the result which the Convention achieved."
"The Charter is primarily - and this is rare enough to be worthy of note, as I have seen particularly in the preparations for the IGC - a clear and well-organised document."
"Combining around fifty articles, which, in fact, makes for a short text, subdivided into six chapters with titles that ring true, and could perhaps be a new motto for Europe: dignity, freedoms, equality, solidarity, citizens' rights, justice, it unquestionably answers the requirements for concision and clarity and thus, also, the concerns and expectations of our fellow citizens."
"So, the Charter is a perfectly consistent text."
"The authors of the text managed to fulfil a twofold requirement that was not easy to satisfy: firstly, to avoid creating law out of nothing and, secondly, to give us a precise snapshot of the scope of fundamental rights in force within the European Union, while also giving us a dynamic picture with potential for further development."
"I am convinced, however, that the Charter will make its mark most especially by the strength of its content."
"Firstly, it precisely restates the fundamental rights laid down, in the main, in the European Convention on Human Rights."
"In this respect, the authors of the Charter were careful throughout, as was also stipulated in the specification, to avoid any risk of conflict between the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, responsible for ensuring compliance with the Convention, and that of the European Court of Justice, in particular by adopting the wording used by the Council of Europe Convention when this seemed sufficiently finalised."
"Similarly, in the general provisions, Article 52(3) stipulates that, insofar as the Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ""the meaning and scope of those rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said Convention."""
"It is my sincere opinion that in so doing, the authors of the text have with great precision minimalised as far as possible the risk of having conflicting case law in the two courts in Luxembourg and Strasbourg."
"Moreover, at a time when we have just celebrated the 50th anniversary of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, I think we can safely leave it to the judges of both institutions to fuel and continue the dialogue they already maintain, which is undoubtedly adequate guarantee against any risk of the two-speed Europe of human rights that some people have mentioned."
"Quite obviously, the Charter does not confine itself to merely restating pre-existing rights, with a little updating."
"This would have been somewhat disappointing."
"It also enshrines many new rights which are not included in the Convention and which are necessitated by developments in our societies, be it in terms of technological development, the emergence of new dependencies, or even the increasing complexity of our state and administrative systems."
"It is particularly important that European citizens should know, for example, that the European Union prohibits all human cloning for reproductive purposes or that it guarantees its citizens protection of their personal data."
"I am of course pleased to see, finally, the importance the text attaches to economic and social rights."
"France argued forcefully for this section to be a substantial one, but it was also the will of many other Member States, the European Parliament and a good many Members of the national parliaments, which can only be gratifying to the Council Presidency."
"At stake were the Charter' s innovatory strength and driving force as well as consolidation of the European social model, which we value so highly."
"First of all, I must stress the importance of including a chapter entitled ""Solidarity"" ."
"Let me, once again, congratulate President Herzog in person, who, I believe, was behind this."
"This value, this solidarity, is indeed what best sums up the European social model, which is consubstantial with the construction of the European Community."
"This is the solidarity which the Charter guarantees through the right to free education, the right of workers to be informed and consulted, the right to collective bargaining and action, including the right to strike, even if it was not easy to get it included in the text, but also through the right to protection against unjustified dismissal, the right to social protection and the ban on children working."
"I shall also stress Article 23, which is particularly clear in stipulating equality between men and women, and stating that this must be ensured in all areas, and that the principle of equality shall not prevent the adoption of measures providing for specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex."
"Overall, I should say that this text unquestionably marks the greatest collective advance in terms of affirming social rights, both because of the importance of the rights enshrined and also because these rights are included for the first time in the same text as civic and political rights, thereby officially signposting the indivisible nature of all fundamental rights."
"It is true, nonetheless, that it has been possible to make a number of criticisms regarding the content of the Charter."
"There are some, for example, who denounce the text as reflecting the political choices of those advocating a liberal Europe and criticise the obligation for consensus as the method adopted within the Convention for adopting the Charter."
"These are criticisms put forward in a recently launched appeal from some Members of Parliament, especially Members of the European Parliament, calling for the Charter to be revised."
"As to the method, let me remind you that the Convention itself determined its own rules of procedure, without any external pressure, and that the rule of consensus seemed to be a particularly constructive option in a body as diverse as the Convention."
"I am sure the Convention members that are to speak here will be able to confirm that."
"I feel that this decision has most certainly contributed towards producing a text which I believe to be well-balanced and ambitious."
"The European Trade Union Confederation, for its part, saw fit to complain about what it considers to be some omissions, such as the lack of any reference to the right to a minimum income, for example."
"I should therefore like to make a few things clear once again."
"The purpose of the Charter was to collate the fundamental rights, not, at this stage, to form a social treaty - regrettable as that may be, and it may be something that will come in time - and the Convention' s mandate, as stipulated in the initial specification, did not entitle it to create completely new social rights out of nothing."
"I am certain there will be further stages along this road."
"Moreover, the Charter is not the only initiative launched by the French Presidency in the social field, quite the contrary."
"Indeed, the French Presidency has set the promotion of a more mutually supportive Europe at the top of its priorities."
"So, as you know, the Presidency, on the basis of the conclusions of the Lisbon Council, has launched the initiative of a social agenda, intended to determine what action the European Union will undertake in the next few years in order to take existing needs in to account, providing, in particular, a qualitative and quantitative improvement in employment, as well as greater social cohesion."
"I feel that these two approaches, the Charter and the social agenda, complement each other and properly reflect our determination to place social matters at the heart of the construction of Europe."
"I should, moreover, also like to point out some grounds for satisfaction for the Presidency, and I believe for other institutions too, in the overall position adopted by the European Trade Union Confederation, which stresses the connection between the Charter and the social agenda and which concludes that the Convention' s proposed Charter, adopted by the Heads of State and Government, ""represents an important step towards the construction of a social and a citizens' Europe"" ."
"I feel this is a significant statement - one that I welcome."
"The Heads of State and Government were alive to this determination when they, if not adopted - that is still to come in Nice - at least approved the text of the Charter."
"The balance arrived at by the authors has met with general approval, and the Presidency has no desire to reopen the debate, no more than, I believe, your rapporteurs do."
"Let me now, in conclusion, turn to the matter of the legal status of the Charter, which has already been mentioned."
"I clearly heard your rapporteurs once again expressing the desire to see the Charter form the preamble to a constitutional treaty and you know that I, personally, am in favour of this, but I should like to point out, because we are bound to be extremely precise regarding what is happening today, that the European Council in Biarritz was forced to note that the majority of Member States were not willing to discuss the matter of incorporating this Charter into the Treaties, at least for the time being."
"I can assure you, then, since it will not be possible to pose this question officially until after Nice, that the French Presidency fully intends to strive to include this perspective in the conclusions of the Nice European Council."
"The fact remains that several individuals, Members of the European Parliament in particular, have suggested that explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights be included in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which already refers to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"They have thus pointed out what is really a paradoxical situation, whereby the Treaty on European Union would not mention a new text actually belonging to the European Union even though it already refers to an existing text belonging to the Council of Europe."
"You know that, in a personal capacity, I have shown my openness to this proposal, and even my support for it, and I would reiterate that here."
"However, once again on the basis of its bilateral contacts, the Presidency is forced to acknowledge that several Member States do not wish to see this."
"I should, moreover, like to inform the European Parliament that, on the initiative of the Presidency, a debate was held yesterday within the Preparatory Group for this issue."
"They inform me that the discussion was not entirely conclusive, perhaps signifying that some of the governments might be inspired by a clear statement of views from the European Parliament as a whole."
"I am convinced then, that this Charter, by virtue of its clarity, its coherence and its content, will come to the fore as the benchmark text which the European Union so badly needed."
"I can only, therefore, on behalf of the Council Presidency, urge you once again to adopt the Charter of Fundamental Rights with a view to its joint official proclamation in Nice."
"I am convinced that this will be one of the highlights of this European Council bringing the French Presidency to an end."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of the main tasks of the directly-elected members of the European Parliament, which represents the 370 million citizens of the European Union, is to bring the unifying structure of Europe closer to its people."
"That is why it was so important and why Parliament was right not only to invest so much hope in a new Charter of Fundamental Rights for the European Union but also to help so intensively and constructively to bring it about."
"It is a huge feather in this institution's cap - as is the fact that the groups stood side by side here - that we managed to secure 16 places for European Parliament representatives at the fundamental rights convention."
"The result before us is proof positive of the fact that giving the European Parliament a say was the right move."
"Allow me at this point to offer my warmest thanks and acknowledgement to those who represented us at the convention under the leadership of our fellow member, Mr Méndez de Vigo."
"Ladies and gentlemen - and I mean everyone involved from the European Parliament - made a decisive contribution; as a result, the difficult instructions of the Cologne European Council were carried out successfully in a very short space of time and with the maximum possible attention."
"I should like on behalf of our group to offer express thanks not only to all the members of our group but, most of all, to Vice-President Ingo Friedrich, who coordinated our work."
"But our special thanks must go to all the members of the convention, especially its chairman, former president of the Federal Republic of Germany, Roman Herzog, to whom I should like at this point to wish a speedy recovery."
"With the exception of the British delegation, our group unanimously supports the Charter."
"The draft before us is a balanced text which has already been applauded on all sides as an example of European consensus."
"Obviously, the Charter will not please everyone."
"No compromise can."
"But Europe will only progress and find its feet if we are all prepared to help bring about a good result."
"And that is what has happened with the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights has drawn on a multitude of European and national legal sources."
"It pays homage to the spiritual, religious and moral heritage of our continent and to the indivisible, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity."
"The Charter presented to us is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law."
"By placing the individual, people as individuals, at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship of the union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice, the Charter creates comprehensive transparency."
"It clearly sets out our citizens' rights for them and clearly sets out the legal positions which the institutions, bodies and agencies of the European Union must comply with and respect when acting on behalf of the people of Europe."
"The Charter before us is, to my mind, a huge success and may, as I read in one of the European broadsheets on 26 September 2000, become the calling card for Europe."
"As I pointed out during discussions on how to handle the Charter henceforth during the plenary debate on the Biarritz EU summit of 3 October this year, what is at issue now is the future of the European Union from this point on."
"In saying yes, we are instructing you, Madam President, to proclaim the Charter with the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission at the EU summit in Nice in a few weeks' time."
"Although, in our view, even this solemn act in Nice cannot but be a step along the way."
"The European Union has long been more than an economic community."
"If we, as the representatives and trustees of the citizens of the European Union and of Europe as a whole, wish to continue with the unification of our continent in an ambitious and committed manner, then the solemn proclamation cannot but be a first step along the way."
"We in the European People's Party are jointly and firmly committed to including the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Treaties as quickly as possible so that it can become a Charter of direct and unassailable rights for the people of the European Union."
"Mr President-in-Office, you have taken a stand here and I hear what you are saying but let me say quite clearly on behalf of the European People's Party that we expect an ambitious result from Nice - an ambitious result on the conditions for enlargement of the European Union and an ambitious result for the Charter, which is why I again call on the Presidency of the Council, on behalf of the members of the European People's Party, to ensure that a timetable is drawn up for transposing the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the EU Treaties."
"I wish the French Presidency every success here."
"If you are successful, it will be a joint success for the European Parliament and all the people in the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the history of European integration there are certain moments that can be considered as points of historic change, and this is one of them, because the adoption of the Charter by Parliament will be one more step towards realising the dreams and plans of the founding fathers."
"I would like to remind you that the first time that the declaration of rights was discussed was at the Congress of Europe in The Hague in 1948, and that was the origin of the European Convention on Human Rights of the Council of Europe."
"Now, as the European Union, we are once again affirming that this is a community of values. We have given real substance to European citizenship, which is recognised in the Treaty on European Union, and we have consolidated our area, not only as an internal market, but also as a legal area in which fundamental human rights are recognised."
"For socialists and social democrats from across Europe, the adoption of the Charter also represents the fulfilment of a commitment to our electorate; we contested the elections with a manifesto containing twenty-one priorities, and a fundamental one among them was to push for a European Charter of Rights in order to enshrine the fundamental civil, economic, social and cultural rights of the citizens of the Union."
"The European Summit in Cologne, under the German Presidency of Chancellor Schröder, proposed specifically on the one hand, the outline, which became a Convention and, on the other hand, that this Charter should be drawn up."
"It gave the Convention a mandate and nominated a former President of Germany, Roman Herzog, as chairman of this body."
"I think that this needs to be highlighted today because the work that we have carried out is not the exclusive property of any political family, and this gesture does credit to the German Presidency at the time and shows that we all need to move forward together in achieving fundamental values."
"I think that we have also done this in the European Parliament."
"I have had the opportunity to express my admiration for the work carried out by Íñigo Méndez de Vigo, as chairman of the European Parliament delegation."
"I would also like to point out the crucial role played by my colleague Mrs Pervenche Berès, when she led the delegation from the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"I think that we can all be proud of this success, which is a shared one."
"Today Europe is more than just a common market, and what is more we have a fundamental piece of what should be a future constitution."
"However, despite all the efforts that have been made, there is still a fundamental step that we need to take in order to feel satisfied - and I say this thinking about the Nice Summit - which is the last point mentioned by the President-in-Office of the Council: the inclusion of the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty."
"I think that, apart from the repeated personal support of the President-in-Office of the Council, there is a series of factors in favour of this."
"Currently, the majority of Heads of State and Government belong to our political family."
"Others do not, but they are in favour of this inclusion and of a reformed and democratic Europe."
"The Charter provides the Union with an essential legitimacy as a community of values, and we need to emphasise this, because we have also experienced events that show that Article 7 needs to have a much more solid support."
"Our governments need to obtain tangible results in Nice that they can offer to our citizens - institutional matters are important but, as the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner are well aware, they are difficult to sell to public opinion."
"The Charter also sets out the Copenhagen criteria, which we consider to be fundamental in the membership negotiations. I would also say, thinking about the countries that are negotiating with us, that it also offers them guarantees with regard to us; that is to say, it is not merely a declaration, but a factor that fits perfectly into the negotiation process."
"Therefore, my Group still thinks that it is absolutely essential to include a reference to the Charter in Article 6(2) of the Treaty."
"As I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council is going to have a very busy weekend with the next meeting, I ask him to pass on a message to that meeting, so that the Ministers of Foreign Affairs can pass it on to the Heads of Government."
"It is as follows: if the European Council in Nice does not succeed in integrating the Charter in this way, I am afraid that the European Parliament will have difficulty approving the reform of the Treaties."
"I think that this is a positive message that the President-in-Office of the Council must give to his colleagues, because we still have time to include the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaties."
"After Nice we will be able to start talking about the European constitution."
"For now, the important thing is for this stage to be consolidated."
"This is our proposal."
"Madam President, allow me, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs and all those who have contributed to the Convention."
"They have shown that European issues can be worked with in a new and exemplary way, a way superior to that of the Intergovernmental Conference because of its open and democratic method of working, involving full public control and opportunities for citizens to participate."
"The fact that European cooperation is not only based upon economic agreements has been mentioned in this Chamber on a number of occasions."
"This has become additionally clear in the course of last year."
"The growth of xenophobic and anti-democratic movements brings the issue of common European values to a head."
"As the European institutions acquire ever more power over citizens, it is also important to place limits upon this influence."
"The proposed Charter is unique in the way it gives a central place to the citizen and her rights."
"Naturally, political compromises have also been made. There has been give and take but, on the whole, what we have here is a catalogue of common and modern rights which give clear and concrete form to the European community of values."
"Because there is a certain amount of concern about this, it is important to point out that the Charter supplements, rather than competes with, the Council of Europe' s Charter of Human Rights."
"It is therefore important that, no later than in Nice, the legal opportunity should be created for the EU to sign the Council of Europe' s Convention."
"At the Nice Summit, the Charter will be accepted in the form of a political declaration."
"This must not be transformed into a mere ceremony with the vaguest of declarations."
"People are tired of this type of event."
"It must be made clear that the Charter is to be regarded as morally binding."
"As soon as possible after the Summit, the Swedish Presidency must also establish the procedures for working on the Charter' s continued status, the objective being that, following certain changes, it should become binding and part of a future European constitution."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is a key stage in the construction of Europe, has given rise to much discussion."
"Some think it a success and others now think it a thwarted ambition."
"Many people thought that Europe at long last had the opportunity to emerge from the single free-trade area and the liberal rut in order to establish the foundation of a People' s Europe."
"Everything conspired to strengthen this hope: the formation of the Convention which established a new precedent in relation to the usual intergovernmental method, the public debates and the full set of texts available on an Internet site that was accessible to everyone, as well as the fact that the opinion of civil society was consulted."
"Transparency was no substitute, however, for the democratic deficit, as the NGOs were only given five minutes to speak and their points were only rarely taken into consideration."
"So, yes, some progress was made, but not enough to compensate for the omissions."
"It took many weeks of battling to incorporate the right to strike into the Charter."
"The right to employment was transformed into the right to work."
"The right to health, social security, accommodation or a minimum income either do not feature, or are expressed only as a token of social cohesion."
"Freedom of the press is no longer 'guaranteed' , only 'respected' ."
"Minority rights are the minimum possible."
"Discrimination between European and third country residents is ratified, as is the freedom of movement laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, or the right to live as a family, even though this is recognised in international law."
"A great many rights, including political rights, become subject to a European preference in place of national preference."
"So what has become of our sacrosanct principle that the law shall be universal, indivisible and unique?"
"What has become of European citizenship, the heart of this Europe of equality for all citizens?"
"We are left with a feeling of bitterness."
"This Charter is the extension of a liberal Europe which is opposed to the social Europe of the citizens."
"What attitude can we possibly adopt now with regard to this text which is no better than nothing since it falls short of existing rights?"
"The Charter as it stands is in no position to become 'meaningful' for the citizens of Europe."
"All it brings is an added value; it does not remotely meet their expectations or their requirements."
"As regards fundamental rights, is it possible to accept a minimal common denominator at a time when Europe wishes to set itself up as a role model for human rights?"
"We must refuse to be satisfied with this minimalist Charter to which the Social Democrats of Europe appear to have resigned themselves."
"The Charter cannot serve as a smokescreen for the French Presidency in order to conceal an IGC that is on its last legs."
"At the European Summit in Nice, in December, civil society resolved to mobilise in order to make itself heard and to forcefully express its desire for a charter offering the citizens of Europe genuine guarantees."
"We must support these actions and, rather than accepting a shaky text, we must call upon the Convention to continue working after Nice, involving new procedures and extensive public debate."
"It is not just our rights and our freedoms but our democracy which is at stake here."
"Madam President, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a very important project for the future of European integration and it has my support."
"Why?"
"First, because it secures the rights of our citizens vis-à-vis the institutions and bodies of the European Union."
"Secondly, because it plugs a gap in the protection of fundamental rights for people living in the Union."
"Thirdly, because the Charter also ensures that the current level of protection in the European Human Rights Convention also applies in the Union; in fact, at some points, it goes even further than the European Human Rights Convention."
"Fourthly, because the Charter - and this is particularly important for me - is based on indivisible civil and political human rights and fundamental social rights."
"As a member of the convention, I argued for even further-reaching social rights, especially for the right to work and to a minimum, subsistence-level income to be enshrined in the Charter which, given the current social charter, it should have been."
"Nonetheless, I share the overall appraisal of the European Trade Union Confederation that, despite the narrow interpretation of social rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is an important step on the road towards a social Europe and a citizens' Europe and is a decided improvement over the present situation."
"Madam President, I think that what we need now, especially in the run up to Nice, is a comprehensive public debate with our citizens on the text of the Charter; we must also consider how to give them the opportunity to agree to this Charter."
"I personally am in favour of a European referendum on the Charter, as this would enable the very citizens of Europe to give us democratic authorisation to press ahead and build up Europe."
"Madam President, great importance is often attached to the signing of charters, and this often assumes legendary status."
"Such was the case with the Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, signed in Strasbourg during a European Council, which appeared to have discharged the institutions' undertaking to resolve the issues related to the protection of workers' dignity."
"And then the recantation: in actual fact, in Maastricht, Great Britain did not sign the social chapter, going back on the profuse rhetoric which it had lavishly dispensed when proclaiming the vital importance of signing the Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers."
"Well then, let us endeavour to ensure that this situation is not repeated in the case of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"To this end, besides the signatures, it is important for there to be effective political undertakings implemented within the timeframe - every day - by all the countries and political forces."
"The Charter cannot be amended and this gives rise to a democratic deficit, leading us to support the Biarritz conclusions not to consider it to be legally binding."
"In fact, if it were possible to amend the Charter, if it were admitted that the Charter does not provide for duties and does not provide fully for rights, things would be easier: the Charter does not go far enough in protecting the natural family or safeguarding children; it disregards the need for rules to regulate every new global information technology; it discriminates between private and public education; with regard to safeguarding the environment, it disregards the protection of health and animal rights; it is too general with regard to consumer protection and leaves the door open to the marketing of extremely harmful foodstuffs."
"In addition, there are political gaps in the Charter such as the fact that it does not tackle the issue of political refugees."
"Therefore, we feel that the Charter is only important as a position of principle, as a starting point for a debate: a debate which we consider useful for the future but which has yet to develop, which must take place alongside the unification process."
"We will assign to this Charter the value of a political declaration, committing ourselves together: we will therefore vote for the recommendation and the Alleanza Nazionale will enter into a democratic debate that will supplement and finalise the content of the Charter over the coming months, and which will evolve alongside the accession process and the new European citizenship."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe this Charter is nothing more than the umpteenth example of the ability of the European Union and its Member States to proliferate empty texts and declarations of intent."
"This Charter, as you know, has no legal basis, nor does it provide for any body capable of enforcing compliance with the rights and principles it proclaims."
"This Charter is just another empty text, and the appeals from Mr Barón Crespo and others to include a reference to the Charter in Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not going to change a thing."
"We are aware, in the Austrian case, for example, that Europe went outside the scope of the Treaty in responding with bilateral measures, and it was not empowered, there being no authorisation under Articles 6 and 7, to ensure respect for the fine principles to which it claims to adhere."
"The issue is more important than that."
"The Cologne Council had the bright idea of thinking up a bone to keep the dog busy, the dog in question being the European Parliament, and so it invented this Charter, and Parliament, as it is increasingly accustomed to doing, threw itself upon the proffered bone and gave it a good chew, to such an extent that we are, today, completely under the illusion that we are taking part in some historic event."
"Yet the real issues before us are the blank pages of the French Presidency' s executive summary, the issue of the Commission and the issue of the weighting of votes within the Council, and Parliament, which has always adopted a strong line with the weak and a weak attitude towards the strong and which is going increasingly downhill in its way of approaching matters, can find nothing to say about this planned destruction of the Commission."
"It is going along with this sideways shift which is turning the executive Commission into a sub-council, an underling of a Council which is and will be stronger yet."
"What is actually on the agenda of the Nice Summit is the slide towards intergovernmentalism firmly anchored in the texts."
"You can accept the situation, you can let off steam by producing great empty texts, but that is the reality of the situation and it is distressing to note that the small countries of the European Union, in persisting in wanting one Commissioner per Member State, are supporting the plan of undermining the Commission."
"We are currently conspiring to kill off the Commission, a murder with a willing victim, since the Commission fell in with the Council' s proposals last week."
"So let us either lament or pretend to rejoice, let us celebrate this great event which is actually just a perfectly empty great event."
"I think we ought to remind ourselves of that."
"Whether we vote for this Charter, against it, or abstain altogether, nothing will change."
"Mrs President, you would not believe that Mr Dupuis and I were talking about the same text."
"Behind the vote on the Charter, there is an ill-concealed agenda to create the first part of a constitution for what might be called a United States of Europe."
"The Charter will not, of course, be written into the Treaty until after a special constitutional conference in 2004 but, as it receives the solemn signature of the Commission, the Council and Parliament, the European Court of Justice will already be acquiring a new source for its judgements, and the Court of Justice' s representative has, of course, already given notice that it will draw inspiration from the Charter."
"The Commission' s representative at the Turin Convention attaches judicial significance to the document."
"It is therefore absurd for the Danish Government to maintain that there is no trace of anything new in the Charter."
"In that case, what purpose is served by the text?"
"Naturally, the Charter contains innovations in relation to existing law. For example, there is a ban on discrimination against national minorities, which is good, and there is new wording on positive discrimination in favour of the under-represented sex and new rules on cloning, the protection of personal data and the right of access to documents."
"The problem is not the content but the aim, which is to go one better than the national constitutions and the European Declaration of Human Rights."
"The European Court of Justice will become our new Supreme Court and constitutional court, including in all issues relating to fundamental and human rights, and it will also become the chief interpreter of the European Declaration of Human Rights."
"In the Convention, I tabled amendments to the effect that the Charter should conform to the national constitutional courts and the Court of Human Rights."
"The very fact that it was not possible to adopt these amendments witnesses to the aim of creating a constitution."
"Unfortunately, I must therefore vote against the Charter."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this vote which Parliament is about to declare in order to enable you, Madam President, to proclaim this Charter on behalf of this House, is a significant one."
"Now that we have had the single market, it is now time for a Europe of rights The concept of citizenship within the European Union is a relatively new one."
"Let us remember that this was originally an initiative from Felipe Gonzales, who proposed this fine idea."
"Since then, it has been expanded upon and brought to life."
"Until now, it existed only in the form of an anthem, a passport, but now, I feel that with this Charter, it also will have some substance, the definition of rights as they are stated in this fine text."
"It is a fine text because it is readable, clear, precise and framed with an eye to the future - well, we shall see, but in the meantime, as of right now, it is possible to read it as if it were a legal text, and that is what we sought to achieve."
"For women, too, it is a text that represents some progress since it is couched in gender-neutral terms."
"It is also, however, a text whose content we can be proud of, as it is well balanced."
"The first right it stipulates is the right to dignity."
"How can we fail to recognise that in the twenty-first century, once the concept of dignity has been set forth, the key thing is the indivisibility of the whole package of rights?"
"So individual rights and citizens' rights are included, but also social rights."
"I am well aware of how difficult the Cologne mandate was."
"Some say it was a balanced mandate, others that it was inadequate, but it was a mandate whose dynamic force we used to the full, and even almost exceeded."
"Some Members of this House, including in my own political family, in the widest sense, will deplore the lack of reference to a minimum income, the right to accommodation or the lack of any explicit reference to the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights in the general provisions of the text."
"I would, however, urge them to read the text carefully."
"Going on the speeches that I have heard this morning, I am not sure that everyone has read this text properly and grasped its full scope."
"Let me briefly discuss the scope of the text."
"I would urge those that are of the opinion that the text does not go far enough as regards social rights to consider the legal status of the texts we currently have available to us on social rights at the European level."
"The Charter has actually been drawn up as if it were a text which might become binding."
"It goes well beyond the texts with which we identify in political terms but which, from the viewpoint of the legal instrument implementing them, even if they, of course, are based on common policies, do not, however, in legal terms define any real rights which might, eventually, be recognised by a judge."
"You have to realise that this is a text which must be brought to life."
"To adopt an expression used by Catherine Lalumière, I would say that we have to ""put it into orbit"" ."
"In order to do so, we all need to work hand in hand, on the basis of, I hope, the largest possible vote by this House."
"This means that we must all get involved, Members of the European Parliament, members of the national parliaments, the Council, of course, the national government, but also that same civil society which supported us in the process of drawing up the text."
"If I might briefly turn to the legal status of the text, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you referred to the work of the IGC last night."
"My impression was that, even though several governments did not want it, there might still be a clear majority in favour of a reference in Article 6."
"That is not the be all and end all for this Charter' s status."
"It will ultimately have to have its rightful place as the preamble to a constitution, but that is a matter for our long-term institutional development."
"In the short term, we remain committed to its being referred to in Article 6."
"This is the mandate we have given our representatives."
"As far as Parliament is concerned, the phase we are about to enter is the outcome of a long struggle, one we undertook as early as 1975 and which has been continually highlighted through our resolutions, our Spinelli draft treaties, our draft European constitutions."
"When we come to vote, I would hope that we shall be able to have the maximum number of Members in the House in order to give you the maximum support, Madam President, when you proclaim the Charter."
"Mrs President, the Charter includes a number of welcome points."
"The right to good administration, which Mrs Malmström also talked about, is one of the most important advances of all."
"That right does not exist in other international documents, and it is absent from the constitutions of many Member States."
"Access to a more open administration is one of the most practical improvements the Charter can offer our EU citizens."
"The Charter also opens the way to minority rights because Article 22 says that the European Union must respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity."
"Such respect, combined with a ban on discrimination, creates a basis for securing the position of minorities in the future."
"The method of working has been a success."
"It has been so successful that, in his speech last Friday, the Finnish Prime Minister singled out the method as a way of coming up with ideas in anticipation of a future EU constitution."
"This is something I consider to be important."
"It is also important, however, that the EU should subscribe to the Conventions on Human Rights."
"The two belong together."
"Finally, I am delighted to note that children too are mentioned."
"I hope that this provides a basis for Commissioner Vitorino to take measures to ensure that the EU can make a contribution before this autumn's summit on the position of children."
"I am also very proud to see that a representative of my parliamentary group in my own country, Gunnar Jansson, played a very important role when this Charter was drawn up."
"I believe he has contributed to the clarity to which Mrs Berès referred in this Chamber."
"The Charter is clear and concise and could be a model for many other constitutions."
"I want to add my congratulations and thanks to Mr Méndez de Vigo and all those who worked on it."
"I not only thank them but envy them."
"An extraordinarily fine job has been done."
"We have a text here which states concisely what Europe is about and states what rights we uphold as citizens of this great Union."
"I am sad, indeed, to see the ranks of British Conservatives have lined up against the idea of making the institutions of the Union answerable to breaches of the rights of the citizens of the Union."
"It is a sad thing that the party of Churchill and Maxwell Fyfe should have come to this point that, when we at last try to ensure that the institutions of the Union are not the tyrants of Brussels but persons subject under Article 51 to the obligations binding on all institutions of the Union, the British Conservatives say ""no""."
"I am not sure yet, because I have not heard from them, how far Mr Blair's hounds will be let free from the leash to speak out for this brilliant project."
"I hope that Mr Martin, who did such a fine job in helping at this convention, will be persuading his colleagues that the time has come not merely to adopt this Charter but to make it part of our law, binding upon those who govern us, not merely a proclamation but a binding part of the Treaties."
"Perhaps the best we can do for the time being is get it mentioned in Article 6 but that will only be for starters."
"It is not a perfect document; we all know it is not a perfect document."
"Nothing in life is perfect and it is also not perfect to declare rights but not uphold them effectively."
"I do note that there are articles about the presumption of innocence and about the principles of legality and the right to defence."
"As I said last night - I will say it again today - there are too many failings in that respect all across this Union and sometimes, in our eagerness to develop judicial and police cooperation, we neglect the importance of ensuring that the innocent are not made the passive victims, the collateral damage of a war against crime."
"Let us not merely adopt these rights but make them real in the hearts and in the experience of our citizens and let us make them part of our law."
"Madam President, I do not underestimate the very important ambition of establishing a community of humanitarian values or the fact that civil, political and social rights have been placed on a par for the first time in this type of text. I also see the method instigated with the Convention as innovatory with regard to ensuring greater information and greater transparency."
"Despite all that, however, there is a major source of dissatisfaction."
"There is a significant gap between our initial ambitions and what we have actually achieved."
"It is, of course, possible to highlight this or that article, to welcome the genuine progress made in affirming a number of new rights relating to developments in our societies or in reaffirming crucial fundamental rights."
"It is also possible to pinpoint articles which fall a long way short of the rights acknowledged elsewhere, particular in social issues."
"We should not be drawing up lists of advantages and disadvantages, Madam President."
"Last time, you spoke of the glass being half full or half empty."
"We should instead be looking at the Charter in terms of its overall approach and ambition and asking ourselves whether it actually lives up to the demands and expectations of the citizens of Europe and whether it provides them with adequate support to confront the challenges of the age."
"Well, I have read the text."
"I have read it again and again."
"It is, indeed, a text that is easy to read."
"I have heard the arguments put forward by my fellow Members, but I still think that the Charter contains some ambiguous provisions that are very dangerous and that the common denominator is still the lowest possible one."
"Finally, in spite of the innovative approach of the Convention method, which I have mentioned, things must be stated openly."
"The citizens of Europe have continued to be insufficiently informed and if they had been consulted, as should have been necessary, in order to contribute towards drawing up the Charter, then its content would almost certainly have been rather different."
"It is never too late to set things right."
"Nice should not be just the finish line for the Charter, an opportunity to express self-satisfaction."
"It would be wise to also make it the starting point for the widest possible ""citizens' debate"" regarding this so important issue of fundamental rights."
"Finally, precisely because the decision on the Charter is a major political decision, I am with those Members of the House that think it premature for Parliament to declare its opinion today."
"Madam President, the draft European Parliament resolution on the Charter of Fundamental Rights has the same ambiguous foundation as the work of the body itself."
"In both cases, we are asked to approve texts without being told what they are to be used for."
"Are we talking about a political declaration?"
"Is it an addendum to the Treaty?"
"Is it the first part of a future constitution?"
"We will find out at a later date, after Nice, no doubt."
"This uncertainty introduces a fundamental flaw into the consent given at the close of work within that body or in today' s votes."
"Some Members are trying to set their minds at rest thinking that a vote in favour does not commit us to anything, given that the Charter is going to remain nothing more than a formal declaration."
"A mistake!"
"Because, at the very least, if this text is in fact adopted as it stands - and that is a crucial condition, to which I shall return - it will become binding, by virtue of the Court of Justice case law."
"There are two aspects in this process which I find fascinating."
"Firstly, the Charter adopted in this way would take us directly to the sort of standardised Europe which the overwhelming majority of Members of this House claim to abhor and which the voters do not want at all."
"Tomorrow, however, the Court of Justice is going to be able to interpret these rights in detail and the Court' s case law is going to be applied in a standardised fashion throughout Europe, depriving each national democracy of its right of autonomous decision."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you will not be able to claim that you did not know this."
"The second fascinating aspect is that we are today discussing human rights and citizens' rights, a subject over which the European Union has no form of jurisdiction."
"Yet the Cologne Council, with the assistance of the Convention, doing a magnificent job of creating confusion, managed ultimately to make every one forget that this area lay within the jurisdiction of the national parliaments, and that jurisdiction is being gradually spirited out of the hands of these parliaments."
"On the basis of the current treaties, today' s debate actually has no legitimacy whatsoever, and that is a poor omen for a Europe which claims to wish to ensure that fundamental rights are respected."
"I therefore think, and I am addressing my remarks to the Council Presidency in particular at this point, that if the governments meeting in Nice adopt the Charter as a political declaration, they should preface it with some introductory note to the effect that defining and developing citizens' rights lies, in all instances, within the exclusive remit of the national parliaments."
"Madam President, this year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"I feel that the present Charter is nothing but a poor imitation in that it raises legal concerns such as the point in Article 2, Paragraph 2, where it states ""No one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed"" ."
"But how can anybody be executed if they have not first been condemned to death?"
"The phrase is excessive, superfluous, absurd!"
"Then it mentions religious rites without establishing any restrictions."
"For example, the Italian Constitution lays down the limits of public morality and the European Convention lays down the limit of the rights of others and public safety."
"Are satanic or orgiastic rights permitted or not?"
"This is not clear at all."
"Then, on the political side, it fails to recognise the right of the self-determination of peoples, and there is no clear definition protecting the natural family."
"Finally, I feel that, while this procedure which prevents not only any parliament but also the European Parliament amending the Charter, and even prevents it amending the draft decision, on the one hand proclaims the citizens' rights, on the other, it denies the rights of the citizens' representatives, of the Members of this Parliament, who are not even allowed to table an amendment."
"This is why, since I am in favour of the Europe of the citizens, I do not feel fully represented by this Charter, and I will therefore not vote for the motion."
"Madam President, in answer to the question as to whether Parliament should participate in the official promulgation of the Charter I would simply say 'no' ."
"It really is a waste of time!"
"Whose interests are we serving by declaring this Charter?"
"Not the citizens of the Member States, because most of the rights in the Charter are worded so vaguely that any interested party, the institutions included, can interpret it at will."
"What is more, no provision whatsoever has been made for an effective system of legal protection, should the Charter become legally binding, God forbid."
"In addition, the document is packed with rights that do nothing to curb the powers of the institutions."
"As such, the Charter is directed primarily at the Member States, but they have incorporated all the necessary fundamental rights in their own constitutions."
"Each Member State is a signatory to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which provides an additional guarantee for the effective protection of fundamental rights."
"So what can a Charter of this kind bring to the situation, apart from serious confusion?"
"According to Joseph Weiler, the citizens of Europe will soon be suffering from an excess of fundamental rights protection rather than any shortfall in this area."
"I could not agree with him more."
"Having too much in the way of fundamental rights protection is just as damaging as having too little."
"The Charter has turned into a prestige project."
"As an institution, the European Parliament has the interests of the citizens at heart, and should therefore have no truck with it."
"Madam President, I have championed the Charter of Fundamental Rights from the outset."
"And I have always advocated its being legally binding."
"However, that does not change the fact that I am unable to join in the predominantly euphoric appraisal of the convention as an instrument of future constitutional development."
"Apart from the substantive problems already raised today, merely having national parliamentarians on board is no substitute for an in-depth debate of constitutional questions by the national parliaments."
"I would also advise the House not to misconstrue the instrument of the convention as a deus ex machina of the European Union."
"Just one last word to the President-in-Office: as a former member of a supreme court, I can assure you that if the jurisdiction of various supreme courts overlaps, this will quickly give rise to diverging case law and diverging case law is only to be expected."
"We must not, under any circumstances, lose sight of this problem."
"Mr President, today in the vote at 12 noon we will conclude a process that began in 1984 when this Parliament approved the draft Treaty on European Union, which already contained the request for a declaration of rights, a process that we continued in 1989 with the De Gucht Resolution."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights has always been a priority for this Parliament, because it has wanted the principles and values that unite Europeans to be reflected in a text."
"This is particularly important at the present time, when we are beginning an ambitious process of enlargement."
"The second reason is because the Charter of Fundamental Rights is an essential factor in the move towards political union."
"Thirdly, Mr President, and surely this is the most important reason, because a Charter of Fundamental Rights is going to increase the feeling of belonging to the European Union."
"For all these reasons, my group, as its chairman, Mr Poettering, has already said, is going to vote in favour of this Charter."
"Moreover, this Charter reflects the opinion of Parliament, as we set it out in our Duff/Voggenhuber Resolution on 16 March."
"The Charter has been drawn up with the participation of a delegation from Parliament and, as chairman of this delegation, I would like to thank all its members for their work, their commitment and their support over all these months."
"It is true, as one of the speakers said, that we have to make an effort to inform people about the Charter, an effort that can begin in this Parliament."
"When listening to the speeches from some members, one realises that this information is more necessary than ever."
"Some people should read the Charter before they speak to prevent them from saying the things that they say."
"Mr President, allow me to say a few words on the effects of the Charter."
"I think that there is a false debate."
"I think that the reference to Article 6 is logical and I think that the President-in-Office of the Council should take note of what Mr Barón Crespo said."
"The chairman of the group to which the majority of governments in the European Union belong said quite clearly that Parliament - or in any event, his group - will not approve the reform of the Treaty of Nice if no reference is made in Article 6."
"The Charter is going to have effects, whether or not it is in the Treaty."
"In fact; it has already had effects."
"If you read the report of the three wise men on the situation in Austria, you will see that the Charter is mentioned on three occasions."
"This report was drawn up between 29 August and 6 September, when the Charter had still not been drafted."
"Therefore, the Charter, whether or not it is included in the Treaties, whether or not it is in Article 6(2), will bind the Commission - and I would like to highlight the important work done by Commissioner Vitorino in drawing up the Charter - will bind Parliament and will bind the Council, and it will have effects, Mr President, whether some Members of this House like it or not."
"Mr President, colleagues who have argued this morning that this Charter does not reflect this or that right strongly enough or indeed at all, or say that it is not Christian Democratic enough or Socialist enough, or Green enough, seem to have missed the whole point of the Charter."
"This is a Charter that brings together rights that belong to no party and to every party."
"It is a fusion of existing European values in a contemporary and imaginative way."
"All sections of the House who are interested in the development of the European Union should welcome that."
"As the Commission says in its excellent communication, and as Mr Moscovici has reminded us this morning, this Charter is unique because it brings together civil, political, economic and social rights in a way that is not contained in any other human rights or fundamental rights charter that exists in the world."
"It is also, the Commission points out, contemporary because it deals with issues such as bioethics, genetic engineering and data protection as well as access to information."
"So it is a good step in the right direction."
"The convention and its chairman, Mr Méndez de Vigo should be congratulated for it."
"The big question that now divides us is what this Charter is for."
"For me it has three purposes."
"Firstly, to say to the citizens: Europe is not simply something that happens to you, it is a community that gives you rights, that gives you guarantees, that gives you protection in certain circumstances."
"Secondly, to say to the institutions: you have a duty, that is expressed in this Charter, to deal with the citizens in a certain way."
"When you pass legislation, when you take administrative actions, when you draw up documents, you have to abide by the contents of this Charter."
"Thirdly, it says to both existing Member States and to applicant states that when you become a member of the Community you become a member of a community of values."
"There are certain conditions that you must maintain and attain to be or to remain a member of the European Union."
"That is a very clear message, not just to the applicant states but to the existing states."
"If you think of the fragile political situation in one or two of our Member States, that is an important message to be setting out at this time."
"How will the Charter be used?"
"I agree with colleagues who say the Court is not going to ignore a Charter that has been proclaimed solemnly by the three institutions: the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"It is going to bear that Charter in mind when making judgments."
"That is to be welcomed, not feared as Mr Bonde seems to think."
"Mr Dupuis and even my own European minister have implied that this is a vacuous or empty document."
"I cannot accept this."
"This is a major step forward in the building of Europe."
"I welcome it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a Charter for Europe and for the citizens of the European Union is a fine thing."
"I say this as a federalist, well aware that that the principle we shall have to refer to one day will be the principle of subsidiarity in order to attain greater freedom for the peoples of Europe, including my own people, the people of the Val d'Aosta, which has always encouraged federalism in Italy and in Europe."
"It must of course be pointed out, however, that the Charter is only the starting point and not the finishing line."
"I would like to stress how important it is to refer to the national minorities and cultural and linguistic differences in the chapter on equality."
"In order to provide an international guarantee for the linguistic minorities, we have to make progress in terms of a genuine European constitution."
"Mr President, the content of the Charter could have been better."
"The issue of its legal status could have been resolved now rather than in the dim and distant future."
"What prevented the achievement of both results is, Minister, the same thing that will prevent the achievement of a satisfactory outcome in terms of democracy and effectiveness at Nice: the obligation to reach unanimity on every single part of the text."
"Those who are more backward and more reactionary have, once again, triumphed over those who are fighting to see fundamental rights applied to all people and for an effective, legally binding response to new issues such as the risks of science, the rights of the new citizens, the right to a healthy environment etc. Consequently, we are once again left disappointed and dissatisfied."
"We will, of course, vote for the Charter, but we will do so with the feeling that it will not succeed in arousing that enthusiasm and that sense of participation by the citizens of Europe which are so necessary and, as usual, it will be the governments - and some governments more than others - who will have to bear the historical responsibility."
"Mr President, it would be hard to deny that, for some years now, the social policies of the States of the Union have been conditioned by economic and monetary policies, by budgetary concerns, by the Stability Pacts and by the flexible and precarious nature of employment, in homage to the great god of the marketplace and to competition, his inseparable companion."
"The divide between those who have much and those who have little or nothing is growing ever wider, while, precisely in the name of these sacred principles, those who have much are exacting increasing sacrifices from those who have little or nothing."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights, with its constant referral to national laws and practices for the actual implementation of social rights, is liable to render irreversible this subordination, this unfair system of the wealthy few, this model of a liberal free trade society which is rising like a phoenix from the ashes of European social democratic ideals with striking speed."
"This Charter on social rights is a step backwards compared to the laws of many of the Member States and, thanks precisely to the referrals to these laws, it will serve as a tool to alter them or limit their effectiveness."
"Civil and political rights are empty, formal rights if they are merely listed in a document and not based on actual social rights."
"It appears that the century which is coming to a close, with all its battles to emancipate the under-privileged social classes, has been in vain and has taught us nothing."
"We cannot pretend that this Charter is an initial step towards a Union based on increasing solidarity."
"Rather, it is the bare minimum in terms of future social policies."
"I only hope that it will not be incorporated into the Treaties and that movements calling for a fairer Europe, in which there is a genuine increase in solidarity, will flourish in civil society, in the trade unions and in political organisations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Parliament is marking a new, important stage in the European Union's journey, towards a more united and - I hope - fairer and more honest Europe."
"I am going to vote for this Charter, not because I am sure that it will be correctly and effectively implemented but because it would be impossible to disagree with the principles behind it."
"Some serious incongruity does remain, arising from concerns which I share: I refer to those Community countries in which the right to life is and remains solely and exclusively a statement of principle, where human life is extinguished indiscriminately as early as conception;"
"I refer to the European consumers, upon whom the Charter confers a large number of new, important rights, yet who are being fed meat from the remnants of mad cows, and this is an example of that capitalism which grows fat on the back of the poor;"
"I refer to those factory workers who have the right to a stable job, yet who have no future because, in the name of globalisation, their jobs have been moved to wherever it is least expensive to run the firm;"
"I refer to students and university teachers and the right to education, and I refer to the crumbling, obsolete structures of many countries which renounce this duty;"
"I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to the freedom of expression and the right to express an opinion, and I refer to the many people who are crammed into the European prisons solely because they think differently to others;"
"I refer to the right to housing and to an acceptable quality of life; I refer to the young people who, in the name of often mafia-like interests, are deprived even of the right to love."
"I am concerned by all these and other matters, but I will vote for the Charter, even if it is utopian, for we are all called upon to bring about a revolution and the revolution will not take place if the seed is not planted, the seed of sensible ideals."
"Mr President, in the recommendation which is the subject of this debate Parliament approves the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"It then goes on to instruct its President and the Presidents of the Council and the Commission to proclaim the Charter of Nice."
"But this Charter is clearly aimed at furthering the ever-closer union of the peoples of Europe."
"According to the co-rapporteur, Mr Duff, this is a major step towards improving the quality of European integration."
"As a representative of my people in England, and not the European peoples, I can only say that I have no mandate to further European integration - and if it truly represents its people neither does the UK government."
"In fact the bulk of the people in the United Kingdom are wholly opposed to further integration."
"Therefore, as a democrat, so am I. I dissociate myself from this initiative and will vote against."
"Mr President, the Charter gives visible form to existing rights, at the same time as historical steps are being taken on behalf of Europe."
"Ultimately, the debate is about whether the EU is to be founded upon normal constitutional principles."
"The Charter fills a gap in EC law and strengthens the individual' s protection against infringements by European police, by authorities which combat fraud and by authorities which regulate competition."
"In spite of the fact that, in practice, we now already impose penalties, there are no normal opportunities for investigating infringements of human rights, and such opportunities are necessary in a society governed by law."
"Every individual - woman, man, employee and entrepreneur - must be protected against possible political and administrative injustices perpetrated by the EU."
"There are no respectable arguments for opposing this particular requirement."
"Anyone who unlawfully suffers prejudice due to the European Union' s legal remedies must be entitled to have the matter legally examined."
"If it is going to be possible to develop a competitive, enlarged Europe, the latter must be founded upon constitutional principles."
"Broad political support is required for the individual' s right to have injustices legally investigated."
"How, otherwise, will a legal area of 500 million people be able to operate?"
"The Charter constitutes a balanced and solid basis for enlargement."
"There are many misunderstandings concerning its material content and consequences."
"These misunderstandings must be cleared up."
"For those who feel the need to do so, I recommend reading the explanations in Convention 49 and also studying that case law from both courts which is bound up with the Treaty."
"The Charter will influence the development of law in the EU and, gradually, it will probably acquire more and more support."
"I believe the court should particularly allow itself to be influenced by those paragraphs concerning freedom of trade, entrepreneurship and copyright."
"Finally, I want to say a warm thank-you to our skilled delegation leader, Mr Méndez de Vigo."
"Mr President, the proposal and adoption of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights should meet with very broad consensus."
"In my opinion, the only people who can justify voting against the adoption of the Charter are those who are against the European Union, as some of those who have spoken today clearly are."
"I do not understand how anyone can reject the Charter because it does not cover everything which they would like it to."
"The hopes of no one person here have been fully realised because the Charter cannot mirror the views of one section of the population alone, it must be the common point of reference of all those who feel that they are European citizens, in respect for the differences of others and peaceful co-existence."
"Could we have done better?"
"I think so, if only because not everything I proposed was accepted."
"In this case, would it be better not to do anything?"
"Should we reject the Charter?"
"Certainly not!"
"I repeat, this Charter turns the Union into a Community of rights; it is a step forwards in the process of constitutionalisation of the Union and it is the first international document to contain, according to the principle of the indivisibility of fundamental rights, civil and political rights, economic and social rights and new rights, all together."
"I fail to understand those who say that it is useless and that it is made up of nothing but generalisations and fine words."
"To assert this is to disregard the history of the institutions: 'liberty, equality, fraternity' are also fine words, but they formed the basis of many of Europe's legal systems."
"It is on the basis of formulae such as these articles that, in time, our law-courts guaranteed our fundamental rights."
"Let us leave it to cynical reactionaries to maintain that only strength or money count for anything and that anything else is merely words."
"No, the words which embody our principles, our values and our fundamental rights are powerful if we embrace them and apply them to our civil lifestyles."
"Therefore, let us adopt the Charter and take the words it contains seriously, let us prevent them being diluted, undervalued or ignored."
"We must take our rights seriously if we want governments to respect them and legal systems to guarantee them."
"Mr President, I have long been among the sceptics."
"Parts of the Charter are to be welcomed, but others are a source of misgivings on the grounds of principle."
"What, for me, was the deciding factor was an appeal from Europe' s fastest growing progressive democratic movement, the French Attaque, which characterises the Charter as an instrument de régression sociale or tool of social regression."
"Attaque notes that the Charter involves a step backwards in relation to the Member States' , the UN' s, the Council of Europe' s and the ILO' s rules already in force."
"Attaque also notes that it ignores trade union rights and that, in actual fact, it is about establishing the free movement of capital."
"When Europe' s fastest growing progressive democratic movement, which has its roots in France, home to the first democratic revolution, and which cannot be suspected of anything resembling Scandinavian-style Euroscepticism, is so adamant about rejecting the draft Charter, it is impossible for me to vote in favour of it."
"Mr President, I can continue where Mr Gahrton left off."
"I think there is a problem in maintaining that social rights must be indivisible and universal and then, at one and the same time in the section headed 'Solidarity' , referring to national legislation and practice."
"In this way, it is precisely what is universal and indivisible in these areas that is weakened."
"It is that part of the content I have problems with. However, I also have problems with the structure we are in the process of setting up."
"If we really want to reinforce human rights at European level, we ought instead to employ our energy on strengthening the work of the Council of Europe and on having the EU ratify the European Convention on Human Rights and the corresponding conventions on cultural and social rights, instead of slowly developing a system to compete with the Council of Europe, as we are now in the process of doing. Indeed, the Council of Europe represents the whole of Europe, or all European States."
"We have only fifteen of them - as yet."
"Finally, there is the problem of wanting to establish a constitution without democratic backing."
"That will not get the voting numbers up at the next elections to the European Parliament."
"Mr President, the Charter that is now on the table for our approval is a project we can be proud of."
"For the first time since the European Union was established we have here the basis of a constitution, a constitution for the supranational structure that is the European Union."
"It is a sound document in our view, and we feel it does justice to our standards and values as Christian Democrats."
"It articulates to good effect the right to human dignity and integrity of the person."
"The same applies to respect for the family and family life, and the way in which the rights of children, the elderly and the disabled are formulated."
"In this way, the Charter provides additional protection for the most vulnerable members of Europe' s society, and that is to be welcomed."
"The Charter also strikes the right balance."
"In addition to the social rights, which are well articulated, the text also cites the right to have the freedom to conduct a business and to choose an occupation."
"It therefore strikes the right balance between those rights that are particularly dear to the hearts of the trade unions, and the rights that are more likely to be asserted by employers organisations and small and medium-sized organisations."
"My third observation concerns the rights of citizens from third countries."
"Here too we have articles that protect citizens against discrimination, for example on the labour market."
"That was another of our group' s aspirations."
"The pièce de résistance of the Charter is Article 21, the big anti-discrimination article."
"This prohibits discrimination in sixteen areas."
"I regard it as the jewel in the crown of this Charter."
"This article will prove much needed, considering the way things are going and given the amount of discrimination, racism and xenophobia at large in our Member States."
"Mr President, it was a great honour to be able to work with my colleagues in the European Parliament and from the national parliaments on drawing up this Charter."
"We would like to thank Roman Herzog and Iñigo Méndez de Vigo for steering the convention to such outstanding effect and we sincerely hope that the Charter will be endorsed in Nice with the signature of our President Nicole Fontaine."
"Above all, let us hope that our European citizens will frequently turn to this Charter when their rights come under fire."
"It is intended to be for their benefit, and we hope they will take this on board with gratitude."
"Mr President, on 6 December I am going to attend a demonstration in Nice called by the European trade union movements and the NGOs."
"Sixty thousand people are expected from the ETUC organisations alone."
"This rally is not a demonstration against the Charter."
"There appear to be people from among these circles who are under this impression and who would probably be inclined to, but they have completely missed the point."
"It is a demonstration for a social and democratic Europe of the citizens."
"The Charter is part and parcel of the shift in this direction, and of the dynamics at work for a strong and social Europe."
"As you know, the social and economic fundamental rights are particularly dear to my heart."
"The EU Charter must be firmly rooted in the Council of Europe' s Social Charter as well as the ECHR."
"Shall I tell you what struck me last week when Prodi and Verheugen presented the progress report on enlargement?"
"It was the little table at the back concerning the ratification of fundamental rights conventions."
"If you compare it with a table of the current Member States, they appear to score lower than the candidate countries, at least when it comes to the Council of Europe' s revised Social Charter."
"I must say I find that extremely embarrassing."
"The new Charter will have legal force, even if it is not yet binding."
"The Court of Justice made this crystal-clear at its last assembly on 2 October."
"However, the institutions that are about to commit the solemn act of signing up to the Charter must not just leave it to the lawyers to deal with."
"For a start, they must incorporate an amendment to Article 6 of the EU Treaty."
"They must set a course for the articles of the Charter to be included, in a binding manner, in the Treaty, and there is a need for supervisory procedures, reporting obligations, independent experts and complaints procedures."
"The Council of Europe, along with the Court of Human Rights, has a wealth of experience of such forms of supervision, and we can build on these."
"All in all, we must get the message across that Nice will not be the end of the road for the Charter, but only the beginning."
"Fundamental Rights, the heart of Europe: the rallying cry of the ETUC and the NGO contingents will remain highly topical in the coming months."
"That is what we will take to the streets of Nice for."
"Mr President, national constitutions either fail to incorporate social fundamental rights, individual freedom rights and environmental protection or do so to an unsatisfactory extent."
"Some proponents of a European constitution or a Charter, by way of an interim step in this direction, see this as an opportunity to make up lost ground in one fell swoop."
"There are other proponents of a European constitution who see things differently."
"They want a propaganda document, the main aim of which will be to describe the current European Union and justify the future development of a single European superstate, and from which no new rights whatsoever ensue from the point of view of EU citizens."
"I support the first aim and reject the second."
"The draft Charter of Fundamental Rights within the European Union is a vague compromise between these two conflicting views, with the second taking precedence over the first."
"For some rights it will even mean a retrograde step."
"That is why this document is not yet ready for decision-making."
"In the short term, it is far more important for the European Union to give its commitment to the already existing European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of Europe."
"In the meantime, the draft Charter can serve as an interesting subject for debate amongst the parties, trade unions, environmental organisations, churches and the many other groupings in the Member States and the candidate states of the Union, regarding future cooperation between European nations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, power requires control."
"The European institutions have power and, for the sake of our citizens, we must set limits on this power."
"It is high time that we plugged the gaps in the protection of European fundamental rights."
"The debate as to whether the Union should not simply accede to the European Convention on Human Rights just as the Member States do has gone on for years."
"I, for one, am delighted that, for a variety of reasons, the Union has not acceded to the Convention on Human Rights"
"As it stands, the Charter which we shall be voting for today - I hope by a large majority -, will clearly afford us better protection of our fundamental rights which is more in keeping with the times than acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights would have done."
"Just under one-third of the Charter contains the same guarantees as the Convention on Human Rights."
"The rest, for the most part, ups the ante when it comes to citizens' political rights, economic and social rights and, last but not least, the issues of tomorrow - environmental, health and consumer protection."
"The Charter must become European law if it really is to do its job."
"The step which we are taking today is just one step on the long road ahead."
"The solemn proclamation must pave the way for binding European constitutional law."
"Does today's step mark the start of a movement which will end in a European superstate?"
"No, it does not."
"The demand for fundamental Union rights, combined with the request that the treaties be constitutionalised, does not mean that a United States of Europe lies at the end of the road."
"But we do need a constitutional text for Europe as quickly as possible, a text for our citizens containing clear, comprehensible statements on Europe, telling them what rights they have, where the Union has taken over responsibility, what powers the Member States should exercise, including in the future, and how Europe intends to do its job, with every guarantee that the rule of law will protect their human rights."
"We must keep working on this."
"We must move in this direction."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, first of all I wish to associate myself with the congratulations quite rightly heaped on all those who participated in the Convention, especially Mr Méndez de Vigo and my colleague, Mrs Pervenche Berès. I should also like to emphasise, with considerable pride, the active and committed participation of Commissioner António Vitorino."
"I wish to focus on three points that have already been raised by other Members here this morning."
"First of all, there is the commendable way in which this Convention functioned."
"This is merit that should be retained and encouraged for future projects, specifically future revisions of the European Union Treaties."
"Secondly, I wish to focus on the binding nature of this Charter."
"The European public would not understand if Europe were to move faster in making improvements to the market and the currency but more slowly in effectively establishing its rights of citizenship and its basic rights."
"Thirdly, I wish to emphasise, as has already been done, that the Nice conclusions and, specifically, the revision of the Treaty, should include this reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Article 6(2)."
"The pomp and circumstance surrounding the signing and the proclamation of the Charter are not enough; these rights must be effectively put into practice."
"That is why, once again, we urge and insist that the Presidency should be able to exercise the role of teacher towards its peers in the Council."
"Lastly, I have two proposals: firstly, the signing and ratification of this Charter of Fundamental Rights by their parliaments should be part of existing Community rules for candidate countries."
"Secondly, the Nice conclusions should establish a precise timetable for future presidencies to be able to move from this Charter to the Treaty, and I would suggest that the deadline should be set to coincide with ratification by all parliaments of the new revision of the Treaties that will result from Nice."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Charter which we are preparing to vote upon today with Europeanist conviction is certainly a step forward towards the political integration of Europe, in which we firmly believe."
"However, as has been pointed out many times, the text does not have the legal status of a treaty."
"This is why we need to take further steps forward."
"The final objective is to establish a European Constitution, a fundamental law for a Union, which cannot stop at simply having a single currency but must become a political entity with genuinely common foreign and defence policies, an interlocutor on a par with the United States which will be able to take up the great challenge of globalisation in which the countries of the continent of Asia are also set to become protagonists in the coming years, starting with China."
"Therefore, Mr President, the Charter only represents the start of what is going to be a difficult, time-consuming task, but a task which, at the same time, excites enthusiasm."
"The text which we are going to adopt today, parts of which, being the result of a compromise - as President Poettering said - fail to satisfy us, must be instrumental in triggering a large-scale debate on the future and on the future European Constitution."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights must confer binding legal status upon the rights and establish the levels of responsibility of the Union, the States and the regions, and it must bear the people's seal of approval."
"This is why it has to be debated and endorsed by this and the national parliaments."
"In the conviction that the Europe of the future must increasingly safeguard individual rights and the rights of the family and that it must prevent the return of new forms of racism and anti-Semitism, the Members of Forza Italia and the European People's Party will vote for the recommendation accompanying the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Mr President, first and foremost, I want to say thank you to the participants in the Convention, both from Parliament and from the Commission and the Council."
"I think some very skilful work has been done."
"The Charter we are to approve today both strengthens and gives visible shape to the common fundamental rights and values our community is to be based upon."
"It is a Charter which, to a large degree, accords the human being a central place."
"I want to highlight a couple of important points."
"Firstly, I think it is good to have made it clear that the Convention on Human Rights and the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg are to be respected."
"It is important that these two bodies should not lose their authority."
"At the same time, I think it is important to state that the common values must be established with reference to the different cultures and traditions we have in Europe."
"I believe it is important to keep this in mind if we are to obtain the necessary backing for the Charter from Europe' s citizens."
"I also want to highlight a particularly positive feature of the Charter, namely its concern with the issue of establishing very far-reaching provisions to rule out discrimination against minorities."
"That is something which I think is very much to be welcomed."
"I also think it is good to have been far-sighted enough to have included new areas of protection in the picture."
"I am thinking both of the environment and of biotechnology."
"I believe that adopting the Charter in Nice will be a powerful signal to certain applicant countries of the seriousness with which the EU regards respect for the fundamental freedoms."
"Finally, I must say that I am very pleased that the Charter is being adopted in Nice as a political document."
"I believe it will be a good basis for the dialogue we must have with the people of Europe about Europe' s future development."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, one thing is clear: if one of the groups here in the House or one of our more than 100 political groupings had written the Charter, it would have be very different on a great many points."
"What we needed was a European consensus and that is what we have got."
"This is the most modern fundamental rights document in the world today and it really does deserve our special appreciation."
"As far as I can see, the convention has extracted everything worth its weight in fundamental rights from over 31 legal sources."
"It has clarified the bedrock of values of the European Union and I call on all those who have spoken and who, for example miss the lack of political responsibility in the Charter - heaven forbid - to appreciate the fact that, as stated in the preamble, this text has been formulated in an awareness of the spiritual, religious and moral heritage of the Union."
"Allow me to make one further point."
"Unfortunately, it proved impossible to secure sufficient coverage in the Charter for the rights of minorities."
"The European Parliament delegation wanted to take account of ethnic minorities but failed to persuade the convention as a whole."
"In my view this is a failing and it should have been mentioned."
"And a word to our critics."
"It is standard practice for journalists to criticise politicians."
"That is all well and good and that is how it should be, but I should like to turn the tables for once and give our critics, i.e. the journalists, a taste of their own medicine: you have failed right along the line."
"We have been working on this text of fundamental rights publicly and transparently for nine months and the whole of the European press has failed to tell our citizens anything about it."
"Mr President, I shall not dwell at length on the impact of this Charter at the various levels."
"Within Europe, the European citizen knows that Europe is now not just an economic entity; within the candidate countries, no country will be able to aspire to join the European Union without ensuring that its national legal system adheres to the principles of the Charter; and finally, on the world scale, this is the message sent out by Europe."
"There are, however, other effects, particularly on our internal legal system."
"I shall, of course, add my voice to those of the men and women wishing to include a reference to the Charter in Article 6, and to actually incorporate the Charter itself into the Treaties at a later date."
"Indeed, how is it possible for a single moment to think that Parliament' s adopting the Charter will not have any legal implications?"
"Traditionally, the national parliaments are the guardians of public freedoms, yet here we have a rather unusual method because in parliamentary law, there is no legislation by proclamation."
"We shall shortly be officially adopting this Charter as formally as possible and, I would hope, with the largest possible majority, and there will be any number of courts to draw conclusions from it even if it is not incorporated into the Treaties in the immediate future."
"There is yet another effect it will have, and this is on our own working methods."
"Let me give you an example of this."
"My fellow members on the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs did me the honour of appointing me rapporteur on the issue of respect for human rights within the Europe Union."
"I have, of course, to take the 'pre-' and 'post-' Charter situations into account."
"Once adopted by this House, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will serve as a benchmark for my report and, as far as I can with my own personal and intellectual resources and those of the people assisting me, I shall carry out an evaluation, right by right and country by country, of the extent to which the Charter is respected in the fifteen countries of the European Union."
"We, the Members of the European Parliament, are accountable for the regulations that we adopt with a philosophy which must not be that of zero infringement of human rights."
"We need not be naively optimistic, we shall surely find instances of human rights violations, but collectively we have a duty to ensure that it is possible to bring a legal case against such infringements, that there is a suitable court to prosecute such crimes, and a public administrative body to investigate them and prevent them recurring."
"This, in any case, will be the your rapporteur' s working philosophy, ladies and gentlemen, once we have adopted, as we are shortly about to do, the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Mr President, the first problem, as I see it, with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, no matter how noble its intention, is the internal inconsistency of a document which, while referring only to European Union institutions, strays into areas of jurisdiction where the EU has no current competence - with potentially undesirable consequences."
"For instance, in the area of criminal law the abrogation of the right to extradite fugitives to countries which allow the death penalty could mean that Europe becomes a sanctuary for American murderers."
"The enshrining of the double jeopardy principle would be embarrassing to the British government who have now decided they will abolish it."
"Secondly, anti-discrimination provisions are ludicrously wide-ranging and open to abuse."
"These rights open the door for demands for homosexual marriage and adoption, and language discrimination clauses might prohibit the refusal to employ EU doctors in the United Kingdom who do not speak English."
"They might even threaten the Thatcherite trade union reforms in the United Kingdom of the eighties."
"Most worrying is the Orwellian possibility under Article 52 of the suspension of fundamental rights when the interests of the European Union are at stake."
"We have already seen the case of Bernard Connolly whose critical book regarding the Commission was suppressed by the Court of First Instance."
"Are we to see a situation come about in which only politically correct statements about the EU will be tolerated in future?"
"This Charter is not only potentially damaging but unnecessary given the fact that we already have the European Convention on Human Rights which was supported in 1950 by the great Conservative, Winston Churchill, and Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"We have witnessed the hypocrisy in this House when the left-wing were not prepared to support my motion on the Italian royal family's rights being restored."
"We already see the effects of judicial activism in Britain taking powers from our national parliament."
"We could now see unelected judges extending this considerably in Europe."
"All this will do is to establish a competitive jurisdiction between the European Court of Justice and the Court of Human Rights and play into the hands, or should I say the pockets, of already overpaid litigation lawyers."
"Lastly, it will fuel claims that the EU is hell-bent on proclaiming a federal constitution with a charter as its first chapter."
"Mr President, with the vote on the Charter we are setting off once again along the road towards a European Constitution."
"The Union is a giant of the world's economy but it still lacks a soul. Although the Free Trade Area is growing and the democratic deficit is being reduced, the risk that competitiveness will start to conflict with mutual support and that a free market will encourage nostalgia for the past in social and territorial contexts which feel that their traditions and security are under threat is also on the increase."
"The Charter has many supporters but also many enemies, and we have heard the opinions of those who do not want a political Europe."
"This difference of opinions is one of the rights to freedoms recognised by the Charter itself."
"However, the Charter's enemies highlight the political significance but also the legal status, which does not conflict with the Treaties but reinforces the democratic perspectives."
"For some the Charter does not go far enough and for others it goes too far."
"The Members of the European People's Party, which has Christian Democrat origins, are convinced that the reference to Europe's spiritual and moral heritage will strengthen the cohesion of a Union which values cultural and political differences."
"The method followed by a transparent, open convention and the work carried out by Mr Méndez de Vigo and other Members deserve our full support."
"Now we expect Nice to produce a strategy which will make Europe a union of economic, social and political rights."
"Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, first of all the Commission would like to endorse the comments made by the President-in-Office, Mr Moscovici, and to welcome the key contribution made by the Members of the European Parliament to the debate and indeed to the Convention, particularly the role played by Mr Méndez de Vigo in the Praesidium of the Convention drafting the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I should also like to highlight the very important role played by President Herzog, who not only urged us to draft the Charter as if it were to become a binding text, an essential condition, but also had a crucial role to play in the political negotiations, enabling us to arrive at a consensus which, I believe, we can present to the citizens of Europe as a shared European vision regarding the role of fundamental rights in our shared venture to see the emergence of the European Union of the twenty-first century."
"A great deal has already been said on the matter of the added value of this Charter."
"I should just like to stress two points which the Commission sees as essential."
"Firstly, the principle that rights are indivisible."
"The principle that political, economic and social rights are indivisible cannot be seen as a minor matter or a way of settling accounts with the past."
"Quite the opposite."
"The principle of the indivisibility of fundamental rights is a political compromise with regard to the future, especially at a time when some people think that untrammelled globalisation or the hegemony/dominance of the financial markets must be guaranteed by sacrificing citizens' social rights."
"It is important to state that this Charter is not a slave to any particular ideology."
"It is subject only to the key concept of the worth of the human being within the construction of Europe in the first place, and secondly to a certain vision of the social model, a social model in which solidarity and respect for fundamental rights are compatible with economic competitiveness at world level."
"This is no minor matter; it is a political Charter for the future."
"There is a second added value, which is the principle that fundamental rights are universal."
"In this respect I should like to point out that here, for the first time, a European Union document is making it perfectly clear that the rights listed in the Charter are, for the most part, applicable to all individuals regardless of nationality or even right of residence."
"This is an important amalgamation at a time when the European Union is required to define the legal status, in terms of rights and duties, of third country nationals legally resident within the European Union."
"Obviously, this Charter is just a beginning."
"I see it as a foundation stone providing a basis for social development, even insofar as its legal status is concerned."
"I think the objective of ensuring the indivisibility of fundamental rights is critical, and that the Council, the Commission and Parliament should make special efforts to publish and distribute the Charter among European citizens, but I am quite sure that, above and beyond the political instructional quality of the Charter, its legal impact is going to make itself felt, particularly with regard to the institutions proclaiming it."
"I am convinced that the Commission, the Council and Parliament itself will not be able to ignore the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union when acting, in future, in a legislative or executive capacity."
"I am convinced, moreover, that the European Court of Justice will not be able to ignore the Charter either."
"In this respect I am disappointed to hear the criticisms of legal activism which have been made, as I, in fact, wonder whether the greatest incentive to activism is not specifically provided by Article 6(2) of the Treaty, which refers to the vague, abstract concept of the shared constitutional tradition of the fifteen Member States, instead of referring to a Charter containing 48 clear, readable articles."
"Finally, you are aware that the Commission is of the opinion that the Convention has drawn up a text which is destined, sooner or later, to be incorporated into the Treaties."
"We might even describe the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaties and recognition of its binding legal status as a two-step process."
"It is destined to be incorporated in to the Treaties and the Commission thinks this should be fully realised as part of the reorganisation of the treaties we proposed at the Intergovernmental Conference, which we hope the European Council will be able to approve in Nice."
"In the immediate future, however, it would be inconceivable if, on the very day on which the Heads of State and Government are to formally proclaim the Charter, they were to fail to make reference to it in Article 6(2) of the Treaties."
"I place my faith in the French Presidency' s commitment to obtaining as early as Nice a consensus which at least recognises the reference to the Charter as the inspiration for fundamental rights within the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I could not possibly improve upon Antonio Vitorino' s speech, so I shall briefly speak to stress the quality of the debate in this House, which has no parallel except for the debate held within the Convention, and I should like to congratulate those Members of the European Parliament who participated in it, especially Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mrs Pervenche Berès."
"Listening to this debate, I am pleased to see what appears to be a clear majority in Parliament in favour of this text, even if there a number of you still have to be won over."
"Some find the text excessively binding, even too advanced in relation to a number of reforms which it would be liable to dismantle, while others find it devoid of content or not sufficiently binding."
"I deduce from this that, perhaps, the text is an accurate reflection of this Europe of ours, which progresses by means of compromises between diverse concepts, diverse nations, diverse traditions, and here I think Galileo' s expression might be used, ""Eppure si muove"" (and still it moves)."
"I shall refer only to some of the salient points of this debate."
"Firstly, Mr Dupuis, quite frankly I do not believe that this is an empty text."
"I believe, on the contrary, as Mr Vitorino has said, that it reflects a shared vision of our European Union, giving it, as Mr Barón Crespo said, fundamental legitimacy and, personally, I am convinced that it is a major contribution towards meeting the expectations of our fellow citizens."
"They need meaning, they need values, and they need recognition of their rights."
"With all its imperfections and limitations, this text meets these needs."
"This is also true of the candidate countries, whose citizens are also hungry for rights and values."
"The Charter therefore, I am convinced, properly belongs to the political acquis communautaire."
"You naturally raised the subject of the legal status of the Charter in the course of the debate."
"Let me assure you, as President-in-Office of the Council, that I have clearly receive your message, especially the message expressed very forcefully by Mr Barón Crespo."
"Let me repeat, however, that if we had from the outset insisted that the Charter must be binding, then the text would have been disappointing."
"It was a clear-cut choice between either a substantial text which was liable not to be binding in the short term or a text which perhaps had some chance of being binding in the short term but which would have lost any content."
"I further note that there appears to be no clear majority within the European Council in favour of granting it a binding status."
"We are building a major political edifice, and every brick in the wall counts."
"I therefore believe that a reasonable approach would be to consolidate the foundation we have in this Charter and then to make ready for the next level."
"I have no doubt that it will come about in due course."
"The Commissioner has just mentioned the spirit in which the Charter was drawn up, with a view to its being made, one day, a binding text."
"Just like him, I am convinced, firstly, that it will have singular effects in the immediate short term and, secondly, that it will shortly become binding."
"As to the method adopted, my feeling is that compromise has not served to lessen the power of the text and that it has, on the contrary, made it possible to bring out a certain unity and even unanimity regarding the values and rights we share."
"I think the criticism that the citizens of Europe were not sufficiently involved in the process to be unfair in part."
"Never in the history of European construction has the principle of transparency been applied with such determination and with such success."
"Let me remind you that ETUC, for example, representing 60 million employees in Europe, was consulted, that several hundred NGOs were consulted, that citizens had the opportunity to simply submit their contributions and that some of their proposals were adopted by the Convention."
"In conclusion I turn to the main aspect, the content of the Charter, in order to say that, in my view, the Charter' s content is truly significant - i.e. meaningful for the citizens - and ambitious."
"The Convention chose to include fundamental rights inspired by various texts of the Council of Europe, the Treaties and Member State constitutions."
"The human rights included in the Charter are powerful ones."
"I am thinking, for example, of the inviolability of human dignity, the right to life with the prohibition of the death penalty."
"These are modern propositions."
"The ethical issues and freedom-related issues connected to the new technologies and science are dealt with."
"I am thinking, for example, of the right to the integrity of the person, the protection of personal data, and, as Mrs Berès pointed out, it is my conviction that social rights must not be denigrated."
"The Charter affirms the social values of European construction."
"It guarantees that the European Union respects and shall respect the implementation of these values within States. That will help to increase citizens' confidence in the European Union."
"The Charter, furthermore, pays special attention to some of the more vulnerable categories of the population, such as the disabled, children or the aged."
"It also most forcefully affirms the equality of men and women in all areas, as well as the principle of non-discrimination."
"These rights are, I feel, expressed with unusual strength, and this is something on which the European Union can pride itself."
"Finally, the Charter adopts the founding principles of the European Union, highlighting the fundamental freedoms of the Community whilst emphasising the value of European citizenship."
"Here too, in specifying a right to good administration, the Charter means to be ambitious."
"In the course of this debate, I have heard a number of telling phrases: the Charter has been described as a bone thrown to keep the dog that is the European Parliament quiet, or indeed as a flimsy attempt to conceal the fights relinquished by a French Presidency that is on its last legs, seen especially in of the way in which it conducted the IGC."
"I shall not take the trouble to answer these harsh assessments, which I do not necessarily share and which, indeed, I hope to see proved wrong when we adopt the Nice Treaty."
"The point I wanted to make in mentioning all this is that Nice is a vital stage."
"In particular I think we need to tie in Article 6, and also Article 7, and I am hopeful that we shall arrive at reforms on both these points."
"Nice is a vital stage, but it is not a finish line."
"It is, instead, a phase in the construction of Europe, and I believe that the Charter will be one of the major components of this phase, and I am delighted to see Parliament' s options on this score taking shape."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Turkey"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:"
"A5-0297/2000 by Mr Morillon on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the 1999 Regular Report from the Commission [COM(1999) 513 - C5-0036/2000 - 2000/2014(COS)] on Turkey's progress towards accession;"
"A5-0303/2000 by Mr Seppänen on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the proposal for a Council Decision [COM(2000) 479 - C5-0454/2000 - 2000/0197(CNS)] amending Decision 2000/24/EC so as to establish an EIB special action programme in support of the consolidation and intensification of the EC-Turkey customs union."
". (FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, on 13 December 1999, the Helsinki European Council decided to grant Turkey the status of applicant country for accession to the European Union and to set up an accession partnership and a single financial framework in order to help Turkey' s application progress in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria."
"This is the spirit in which the preparatory work for this report was carried out within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and I should like, at this point, to thank all my fellow members for the contribution they made towards finalising this report, which, like the Commission, concludes that Turkey does not currently fulfil the Copenhagen criteria."
"We must applaud the remarkable efforts Turkey has made, since the Helsinki decision, in devising a programme to develop its judicial framework in order to meet EU demands in a more satisfactory manner, with particular regard to human rights."
"One example is the report drawn up under the responsibility of Mr Demirok, Secretary of the Turkish Supreme Coordination Council for Human Rights, who has proposed a very wide-ranging raft of reforms to the Constitution."
"However, we must also note and acknowledge that an awareness of the importance of these reforms has caused considerable upheavals in the various political parties and in Turkish public opinion."
"Turkish citizens are realising that Turkey' s accession to the EU will require not only the 'painless' revision of their institutions but also a partial renunciation of sovereignty, to which they remain jealously attached, and a radical change in habits and outlook."
"This is why Parliament has proposed the setting up of a Europe-Turkey Forum involving expert representatives of the Turkish community and appointed MEPs who would consider in depth the issues involved."
"Turkish accession is too important a matter for the future of the Union and of Turkey itself for a decision to be taken in smoke-filled back rooms or behind closed doors."
"Lengthy debates will be needed, both in the European Parliament and in the national parliaments, and that is why it is generally accepted that the road will be long and difficult."
"The establishment of the Forum proposed by the European Parliament should allow us to overcome the initial obstacles encountered on this road."
"The European Parliament will have to tell its Turkish partners very clearly in the debates in that Forum that they need have no fear of any European desire to interfere in their internal affairs and that, on the contrary, it is proposing a contract, the precise details of which are being thrashed out, in the accession partnership, Commissioner, and, of course, in the Convention on the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It will be up to the Turks to accept it or refuse it."
"As matters stand, it is also up to the European Parliament to tell the Turkish people that there are, today, at least three conditions for accession which Turkey must meet."
"Firstly, the need for identity must be respected: this need has been demonstrated particularly clearly in Europe by its citizens who wish to preserve their origins in the face of the ineluctable progress of globalisation."
"Aware that its diversity constitutes its wealth, Europe is determined to recognise this need for identity, and that is why it insists on the rights and also the obligations of minorities."
"It is in this spirit that it is prepared to help Turkey find a solution to the Kurdish problem in particular."
"The second problem, which will clearly have to be solved as soon as possible, concerns Cyprus."
"It is hard to understand today how it can remain divided by a wall, while in many other places, notably in Berlin and Sarajevo, and even more recently, between North and South Korea, such walls have crumbled over the past decade."
"Finally, since the fight against terrorism may now be deemed to be over, the influence of the Turkish army in the drawing up of political decisions should be gradually reduced."
"I spoke of the three preconditions."
"In 1987, Parliament acknowledged the Armenian genocide."
"There are some people who would like to make the Turkish Government' s acknowledgement of this genocide a further condition for accession."
"This would run counter to the spirit and the letter of the process defined in Copenhagen for all candidate countries."
"I have suffered too much, alongside all the communities of Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the tragic consequences of the systematic resurrection of former atrocities to believe that a peaceful and stable future can be built except by ceasing to stir up the embers of past resentments."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, of the two reports before us today, the one by Mr Morillon is more political in nature, whereas mine is more technical."
"The Council is proposing that Turkey be added to that group of countries that can be granted loans from the European Investment Bank, so that these credits may be backed by a European Union guarantee."
"The Council is proposing with unanimity that Turkey should join the group of recipients of guarantees, and Parliament' s Committee on Budgets is also unanimous in this."
"Unanimity does not mean that we are all satisfied with the state of Turkish democracy or that country' s treatment of human rights; we are not."
"As Turkey has submitted its application for membership of the European Union, it will certainly be very aware of the criteria for membership as laid down at Copenhagen."
"As the European Union agreed at Helsinki that Turkey should join that group of countries with which membership would be negotiated, the human rights situation in Turkey is not just that country's internal affair."
"Through its application for membership, Turkey has given the Union the right to adopt a position on its internal affairs."
"There has been a huge temptation to impose conditions on loans to Turkey, with reference to issues of democracy, but there has been no opportunity, technically speaking, to do so in this report."
"The issue here is just to supplement the earlier Council Decision 2000/2024/EC."
"If we had wanted to impose conditions they would have had to be imposed last year when the earlier decision was adopted."
"We did not know then that Turkey would be selected to join the group of recipients of guarantees, as a consequence of positive developments."
"Besides, conditions could not have been imposed exclusively by a decision of the European Parliament."
"I would like to focus attention on how little Parliament is able to influence the work of the European Investment Bank and how badly the European Union monitors that work in general."
"The Guarantee Fund in the EU budget, which guarantees the loans to Turkey, comes under the category of compulsory expenditure, and the Council, as a result, did not need to take account of Parliament's positions."
"In the European Parliament we would in general like to impose conditions on European Investment Bank loans as far as environmental considerations and the social protection of the citizens of non-member countries are concerned, and, in the case of Turkey, this also concerns a respect for human rights."
"But the present legal basis for the Guarantee Fund does not make that possible."
"Better cooperation is needed between the institutions of the EU."
"The problems associated with the monitoring and examination of the management of the European Investment Bank also stem from the fact that there are only representatives of the Member States in its governing body, and some of them want to prevent the Commission and the European Parliament from taking a stand on bank matters."
"As a result, the European Investment Bank is one of the last havens in the world of banking. The ripples of social debate do not reach its shores."
"Finally, I would like to draw your attention to something the Commission already knows and, for that reason, I would like to draw the attention of the Council in particular to it. I refer to the fact that the 2001 Guarantee Fund is not large enough to meet all the commitments made."
"That may also be true for 2002."
"If we are to keep to these commitments, we must amend the residual reserve for guarantees."
"That is the only matter on which Parliament can give its legal opinion."
"The Council is granting more loans and offering guarantees than there are legal preconditions for."
"- (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, you requested a debate on the European Union' s relations with Turkey, and you are aware of the importance the Council attaches to strengthening this relationship, which has gained new currency since this country' s candidature was recognised in Helsinki."
"The debate on the two reports presented by Mr Morillon and Mr Seppänen comes at precisely the right moment, as the Commission has just submitted two very important reports to us, firstly, its latest report on the progress made by Turkey along the road to accession and, secondly, its proposal for an accession partnership agreement with Turkey."
"I shall begin, with your permission, with Mr Morillon' s extremely interesting report, which deals with the whole range of Euro-Turkish relations and, more specifically, with the progress report presented by the Commission in 1999, a few weeks prior to the Helsinki European Council."
"In recognising Turkey' s candidature, the European Council was following the recommendations made in the Commission' s report, whose analysis I believe we can all endorse."
"Since then, both the European Union and Turkey have taken steps to put the Helsinki decisions into practice."
"I am, of course, thinking of the work undertaken within the Association Council with a view to bringing Turkish legislation into line with the acquis communautaire."
"More especially, however, as indeed Mr Morillon pointed out, I am thinking of the efforts made by Turkey to adapt to European standards and practices, particularly in the area of respect for human rights and consolidation of the rule of law."
"There is still, as we are aware, a lot of work to be done, but I feel that Turkey is starting to get used to the idea of reforms."
"It is therefore up to us Europeans to support this country on its very long and difficult road to accession."
"In this respect, I have no doubt but that the determination of each and every one of us to help Turkey progress along the path of democratisation will in the end prevail."
"Who could do this better than the European Parliament?"
"I can therefore only be delighted at the proposal you have made to establish a Europe-Turkey Forum of human rights, thereby enabling Turkish citizens to size up the European prospects being opened to them, as well as Europe' s requirements."
"Having said that, I am of course aware that Turkey' s candidature continues to raise questions."
"I have noted reservations on the part of many people, not just within the European Parliament, but also in all the Member States."
"I have taken note of your wish, as expressed most clearly by Mr Morillon, to be fully involved in the destiny of Euro-Turkish relations."
"I wish to make myself perfectly clear on this point."
"I do not think that anyone is trying to dodge the issue in this respect, quite the opposite."
"A good many discussions have already taken place, right here in the European Parliament as well as within the national parliaments of Member States."
"These discussions have occasionally been difficult but also, I am convinced, profitable."
"For its part, the French Presidency has no intention of shirking this legitimate concern for transparency, information and debate."
"I feel that Mr Morillon' s excellent report bears witness to your determination to bring Turkey' s pre-accession process to a successful conclusion, while exercising the utmost vigilance, quite legitimately, regarding the still considerable reforms which this country has yet to undertake."
"We all agree that negotiations cannot in any case commence, let me stress that fact, until Turkey has met the Copenhagen political criteria in full."
"That is why I took careful note of the suggestions made by Mr Morillon regarding the preconditions for Turkey' s accession, which are certainly worth looking into."
"We are indeed all aware, yourselves, the Council Presidency and also, I believe, the Commission, whose latest report on the progress achieved in Turkey stressed once again the efforts this country still needs to made, the reforms still to be implemented in areas as crucial as respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and minority rights, in particular, areas in which, as we can only regret, progress is still too slow and even inadequate."
"We must, however, also beware, as your report wisely emphasises, of setting new, extravagant conditions on Turkish candidature."
"Let me stress the fact that Turkey must be treated on an equal footing with the other candidates. It is, in my opinion, a fundamental principle which was laid down Helsinki, and one which must govern the strengthening of Euro-Turkish relations."
"For, generally speaking, I think it would be regrettable if we were to give Turkey the impression that we are going back on the commitments we have given and on the principles we ourselves laid down in Helsinki."
"That is why, in the same spirit, the European Union must fulfil the commitments it has made with regard to this country, which I think it imperative to meet, particularly in terms of financial aid."
"The French Presidency has made this one of its objectives and I believe we are making progress."
"This House has, of course, on several occasions been invited to give an opinion on this matter, be it the MEDA Programme or the financial regulations proposed by the Commission to ensure Euro-Turkish rapprochement and to support the customs union, but there are also the European Investment Bank projects, which are essential in order to support Turkey' s economic development and to continue the reconstruction work undertaken following the earthquake."
"I am pleased, in this respect, with the conclusions the report presented by Mr Seppänen on the EIB special action programme in support of the consolidation and intensification of the EC-Turkey customs union."
"When it last held the presidency, in 1995, France spared no effort in order to conclude this customs union agreement, which has since been in force since 1 January 1996."
"It must, however, be acknowledged that the funding allocated to Turkey since then has not always reflected the level of commitments which the Union made at that time."
"Progress has been made, however, particularly in the course of the last year, and I am pleased to see the increase announced by the Commission in appropriations allocated to this country."
"It is indeed important that the financial resources made available to Turkey should match up to the objectives that have been set."
"For its part, the Presidency would like to see this special action programme of EIB loans adopted by the Council very soon, probably as early as the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Ministers of Economic and Financial Affairs on 27 November."
"I would add that we are all awaiting with keen interest the proposal announced by the Commission for a single regulation intended to coordinate all sources of Community aid to Turkey, in line with the plans made in Helsinki."
"It is only natural to standardise the arrangements for pre-accession aid to that country with those applicable to the other candidates according to the Phare Programme model."
"Parliament will, of course, have the opportunity to deliver an opinion on this matter, when the time comes."
"As you know, however, this pre-accession aid will be more particularly intended to help Turkey achieve the objectives laid down in the future accession partnership agreement."
"This is a key instrument in the pre-accession strategy for this country, and its importance was rightly highlighted in the recent Commission report."
"This is a proposal which is going to be examined in detail by the competent Council bodies, so you will understand that I cannot, in my capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, afford to pre-judge the situation."
"Without prejudice to the debate due to start this week, I think I may safely say, however, that the Commission has presented a very constructive and very demanding proposal, both for the European Union and for Turkey."
"In this respect, I am delighted to see that their proposal is in line with many of the very welcome recommendations made by Mr Morillon. I am thinking of the intensified work to achieve democratisation, particularly in the area of the separation of powers or of declaring an end to the state of emergency in a number of Turkish provinces."
"The Presidency' s preference is for this draft to be adopted very quickly, indeed, if possible, as early as 20 November, the date of the forthcoming General Affairs Council, and, as I have already mentioned, for it to comply with the very specific decisions adopted in Helsinki."
"It will then be up to Turkey to take its inspiration from this in order to work out its own national programme to integrate the acquis and in order to implement the reforms, all the reforms necessary, with the support of the European Union."
"Major prospects are opening up to us, and we know the task will be long and complex."
"Let us be demanding, let us be vigilant, but at the same time, let us remain consistent with the logic of our decision, making a bet on Turkey, having confidence in its determination for rapprochement with the European Union, and let us therefore assist Turkey to boost its ability to implement the necessary reforms which we quite legitimately expect of the country."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by extending my warmest thanks to Mr Morillon and Mr Seppänen for their highly constructive and politically intelligent reports and to say that this debate is taking place at a most auspicious time, a time when we are in a position to set relations between the European Union and Turkey on what may prove to be a decisive course."
"As you know, not only has the Commission recently submitted the progress report for the year 2000; it has also proposed an accession partnership for the very first time in the history of our relations."
"I am delighted to be able to report that the Turkish Government has since acknowledged this accession partnership as the basis for further cooperation, giving us good cause to hope that we will achieve precisely what we set out to achieve, i.e. that our policy will help the forces of reform in Turkey give new impetus to the reform process and press on with reform in a bid to achieve membership of the European Union."
"This draft resolution highlights our common objective of bringing Turkey closer to the European Union."
"We must constantly repeat in no uncertain terms that it is in our strategic European interest to anchor Turkey solidly and permanently in our community of values."
"We want Turkey to be a modern, open state in which democracy and human rights are respected, the rule of law applies and minorities are protected and respected."
"We can already see that the Helsinki process has set a series of interesting and important developments in motion."
"In Turkey itself, the first signs of the incipient reform process, a process of fundamental and comprehensive political reform, are beginning to show."
"Relations between Greece and Turkey have improved considerably."
"Just a few days ago, the Greek and Turkish foreign secretaries confirmed that both countries wished to agree on and implement further confidence-building measures, both bilaterally and under the aegis of NATO."
"And finally, negotiations on Cyprus have been resumed under the aegis of the United Nations."
"So far, five rounds of talks have taken place."
"That in itself is a huge success."
"However, the Commission stands by what it has clearly stated in its progress report, i.e. that Turkey, like every other candidate country, must meet the Copenhagen criteria during the process of rapprochement."
"For the moment, we are focusing mainly on the political criteria, because accession negotiations are out of the question until all the political criteria have been met."
"I repeat: accession negotiations are out of the question until we are sure that the political conditions have been met; which is not the case at present."
"Concerns have been voiced on several occasions here in the House."
"I agree: we should be worried that there is too little respect for human rights and the rights of minorities, we should be worried about the constitutional role of the army and we are still extremely worried about the situation of the population of Kurdish origin and about the state of emergency in the four remaining provinces in the south-east."
"However, as I have said, the Helsinki process is already showing positive developments and positive results."
"The most important thing, as far as I am concerned, is that Helsinki triggered a debate in Turkey, a public debate on the conditions of Turkey's accession to the EU, a debate which is supporting and bolstering the forces of reform in Turkey."
"For example, the Human Rights Committee in the Turkish national assembly has reported on torture in Turkey and the Turkish government has passed a resolution to bring the Turkish constitution and the Turkish legal system into line with the values of the European Union."
"What is important is that everything which being announced and discussed in Turkey is actually being put into practice."
"I think that the accession partnership which we have tabled is the best way of supporting this process and of ensuring that the European Union is able to exert the necessary influence on the process itself."
"We have listed the short- and medium-term priorities which Turkey needs to implement under a national programme in order to meet the Copenhagen criteria and on which financial support will then be based."
"The political section of our report describes the fundamental and comprehensive political reforms."
"They include constitutional guarantees of freedom of opinion, assembly and religion, the abolition of the death penalty, and end to torture, reconciling the role of the military with the rules of play of a democratic society, lifting the state of emergency in the south-east of the country and guaranteeing cultural rights for all Turks, irrespective of their national origin."
"I have stressed time and again in my contacts with the Turkish Government that the European Union expects Turkey to give a firm undertaking that it will take action to implement these reform objectives."
"And I must say that I am convinced that the Turkish Government is firmly resolved to take a decisive approach to the reform projects needed."
"President Sezar clearly stated why Turkey had no alternative but to embark on this process of reform in his address to the Turkish Government last month and I fully endorse what the Turkish President said."
"Turkey must become a full democracy, not only because the European Union insists on it but because the Turkish people deserve it."
"What all this means is that we still have a great deal of work to do."
"That also applies to meeting the economic criteria and the capacity to adopt the acquis communautaire."
"Here too, I agree in the main with Mr Morillon's report."
"As you know, the Commission proposed a directive in July, setting out the legal basis for the accession partnership and creating a uniform financial framework."
"This text has been submitted for you to take a stand on it."
"I should like to take this opportunity of asking you to support this proposal."
"Without a legal basis, the accession partnership will not have what I for one am sure will be a positive political impact, because we will be unable to pass a resolution on it."
"We are calling on Turkey, as a candidate for membership of the European Union, to engage in a process of comprehensive reform."
"But that means that we too must be prepared to support Turkey's process of reform, just as we are supporting all the other candidate countries with substantial funding."
"As a possible contribution to this, the Commission has proposed that the European Investment Bank grant Turkey a line of credit of EUR 450 million, to be used mainly to improve the competitiveness of the Turkish economy on the internal market."
"Completion of the necessary political reforms will be one of the focal points - if not the focal point - of relations between the Union and Turkey."
"I am delighted that you will be exchanging views on this question with your Turkish counterparts in the joint parliamentary committee next week."
"I also welcome the proposals in this report on stepping up parliamentary cooperation and strengthening civil society."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Seppänen, on his report, which is so useful in the general context of the debate on Turkey' s accession to the Union."
"Here we are talking about establishing a special programme to consolidate the Customs Union, extending the mandate of the European Investment Bank so that it can cover new loans to Turkey in the 2000-2004 period amounting to EUR 450 million."
"The report was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Budgets."
"Given that this special programme of EUR 450 million, of which the European Union is guaranteeing 65%, specifies that at a provisioning rate of 9 % only EUR 26 million will have to be transferred from the reserve to the Guarantee Fund, there will only be a budgetary impact in the event of a default, because in that case the guarantee would have to be called in."
"With these loans from the European Investment Bank we are supporting investment in Turkish industry and in its infrastructures in terms of transport, energy and telecommunications."
"All this is in order to increase Turkey' s competitiveness within the Customs Union and thus reduce the negative impact that the dismantling of trade barriers is having on the Turkish economy."
"The fundamental issue regarding Turkey is not, therefore, considered in the Committee on Budgets, and this must be very clear."
"The fundamental issue of Turkey' s accession continues to be a political issue and it is the responsibility of other parliamentary committees."
"Customs Union and the loans from the European Investment Bank have been operating with Turkey for many years."
"The aim now is to give the boost that is needed towards future accession."
"I repeat that the only serious problems that we could have would occur if the macro-financial aid promised reached the maximum amount established, as in this hypothesis the residual reserve for guarantees would be reduced to practically zero for 2001 and 2002."
"Let us remember that it is in the interests of the European Union to fund nuclear safety projects in third countries in the framework of Euratom."
"A zero level of residual reserve could lead to definite problems in funding those investments."
"The general situation that the report sets out is part of a situation of Parliament/Council negotiation for the 2001 budget, in which the European Parliament wishes to extend its rights to information and consultation in the case of external commitments by the Union that have a financial impact."
"This is the position that the Group of the Europe People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats advocates and that Parliament adopted at first reading."
"Let us hope that it leads to tripartite dialogue and conciliation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, may I start, on behalf of my group, by warmly congratulating the two rapporteurs on their reports."
"A report on Turkey is no easy task because there are always so many contradictory developments."
"There have been positive developments, such as the new minister for Europe, such as the new special secretariat-general for European affairs attached to the prime minister's office, but there have also been regrettable shortcomings as far as Turkey's preparations for accession are concerned."
"Nothing has been done about abolishing the death penalty, and very little has been done to set minority and human rights on a solid legal basis, even if a few UN conventions have been signed."
"It does not augur well that a person who offers no unconditional guarantee that more will be done about human rights has been elected as chairman of the human rights committee in parliament."
"The same goes for the Kurdish question."
"There have been a few vaguely positive signs here."
"Reports in the Kurdish language may be allowed on television and radio and a certain degree of recognition of the Kurdish culture could follow."
"On the other hand, a number of mayors have been arrested and the Hadep party have trouble in Kurdish areas in the south-east."
"Surely these contradictions alone illustrate the struggle within Turkey itself between progressive forces and reactionary forces, which simply have no interest in moving towards Europe. And that is a pity."
"The Commissioner is quite right."
"We must and we should do everything we can to support and back the positive, progressive forces within Turkey."
"I should like here, quite openly, to touch on the so-called Armenian question."
"At a meeting which I, unfortunately, was unable to attend, my group decided by a majority to support Amendment No 25."
"As far as the content is concerned, there is little to say against this motion. Unfortunately, however, a number of people are using the motions on Armenia and the massacre of the Armenians as a pretext to question, in a roundabout way, the very notion of Turkey's joining the European Union."
"I think that is wrong and I think it is dangerous. Nonetheless, I would urge Turkey to take this issue seriously, whatever the outcome of the vote."
"We all have to come to terms with our own history and with the actions of our antecedent countries and states openly and honestly."
"I think that Turkey should take a fresh approach and that it and Armenia should commission their historians to analyse what happened in order to uncover, explain, take a clear stand on and clearly admit what happened."
"I think that would be the best way out of this tricky situation, because it is far easier to undertake this sort of analysis yourself than it is to impose it from outside."
"In this sense I should like to revert to what the Commissioner said."
"He said that it was in our strategic interest to anchor Turkey solidly and permanently in the European community of values - I think those were his words."
"That is what is at stake here and Turkey too should acknowledge it."
"Even if Parliament is critical and even if Parliament is perhaps more critical than the Council and the Commission can ever be, we trust that Turkey will choose this way forward and will become a member of the European Union just as soon as it has put its house in order."
"Mr President, the European Liberal Group strongly welcomes the Morillon report which we find skilful, frank and forceful."
"We will resist the efforts, some of them fairly spurious, to upset the balance the report successfully achieves, especially those amendments which seek to set up the European Parliament as a tribunal upon the past."
"Turkey is clearly the place for a debate on the past as part of its general self-examination concerning fundamental rights."
"Such a self-appraisal will amount to a veritable cultural revolution."
"We should be satisfied that process is proven to have started."
"The Morillon report and the accession to partnership commit the European Union to Turkey's candidature."
"It is now up to Turkey to show that it is committed to membership."
"The European Parliament will play its part in fostering relations with political parties, the NGOs and the press, as well as developing its tricky and sometimes fraught relationship with the Grand National Assembly."
"European Liberals are certainly prepared to play their part in bringing closer the prospect of Turkish membership and the spreading of prosperity, stability and security to all European peoples."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Morillon I must congratulate you on your report. Unfortunately, however, you have not, and therefore we have not, managed to solve all the problems."
"In the first place, it is clear that the strategy of accepting Turkey' s candidature was the right one."
"It was the correct strategy, as the Commissioner commented, because the debate which has taken place in Turkey today in order for it to become a member of the European Union is tantamount to a debate in favour of radical reform of the political situation in the country."
"We are at an important historic phase for Turkey, which has made the transition from the phase of debate to the phase of practical action, i.e. the implementation of reforms of the Constitution and the law, such as, for instance, an amnesty for prisoners of conscience."
"This is the phase which Turkey is now facing."
"We must be perfectly clear, we cannot move on to any further stages without Turkey making the transition from debate to practical action."
"That is exactly what the Morillon report states."
"Then, there is the Cyprus situation."
"On this subject we have to tell Turkey that its refusal to accept the rulings of the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg cannot be tolerated."
"There have been a number of rulings against Turkey. Turkey must without further ado fall in line with the rulings of the European Court of Justice as a token of acceptance of international relations as defined by us, and not just by them."
"We now come to the basic problem."
"A variety of strategies are considered within the European Parliament and within the Member States."
"Some are in favour of the candidature and the accession of Turkey, and want this candidature to involve a radical reform of Turkish society."
"Then there are those that are opposed to the country' s accession, who take advantage of the essential debate on Turkish policy and reforms to create a great division between Turkey and Europe."
"Turkish society obviously perceives this contradictory attitude."
"That is why the final problem to be resolved, the Armenian genocide, is of such importance."
"There is no one here, least of all myself, who would deny the fact that genocide was perpetrated against the Armenians during the last period of the Ottoman Empire."
"It is a clear fact, just as it is clear that Turkey, like any civilised society, should get used to the idea of facing up to its past, however terrible it may have been."
"This is one of the indispensable conditions in terms of ideology and civilisation needed for any country to join Europe."
"There is another matter, and if we have to vote on it today, the majority of my Group will vote in favour of this resolution."
"I am not certain, personally, that this is a useful move, because I wish to take the debate to Turkey."
"In other words, I propose that the European Parliament should itself hold a debate on the Armenian genocide, the majority will follow on and we shall continue the debate in Turkey."
"Mr President, I should like to start by extending my express thanks to Mr Morillon and Mr Seppänen for their reports."
"Mr Morillon, in my view, your report is an exceptionally realistic and responsible report."
"We have indeed seen a number of interesting symbolic acts on the part of the Turkish Government since the Helsinki Council resolution several months ago."
"However, nothing has been done to change the horrendous situation in Turkish jails, discrimination against the Kurds or Turkey's policy on Cyprus."
"The constitutional role of the Turkish military, which is irreconcilable with the rule of law and democratic mores, has become, without doubt, one of the keys to future relations between the EU and Turkey and will only be resolved if the military relinquishes its power."
"There may well be differences of opinion on the Morillon report within my group, but one thing is clear - and I imagine this is true of the other groups - and that is that we have no intention whatsoever of mitigating our criticism on these issues."
"Compromise is possible almost everywhere, except here."
"The most important and tangible result so far is that a debate has begun and a certain degree of political differentiation has started to emerge in Turkey."
"We must acknowledge and actively support this."
"Nonetheless, what we are looking for here is not just compliance with the Copenhagen criteria but compulsory democratic standards."
"Turkey's membership on this basis, rather than for the geo-strategic reasons put forward by the USA or NATO, would enrich the European Union and represent a significant step towards a united Europe."
"I have not overlooked the problems which this might cause, such as the fact that, geographically, the EU would then stretch well beyond Europe into what are highly unstable regions from the point of view of security policy."
"The fact that the strategic aspects of the prospects of European integration have been addressed neither by the governments nor, Commissioner, by the Commission, and have not been discussed with Parliament in connection either with Turkey's candidate status or with current enlargement to the east is, in my view, unacceptable given the implications."
"In my experience - the experience, I may add, of a life which knows just as much about radical social change as the refusal to recognise the need for it in time -, there is no substitute for critical candour."
"Anything else would simply play into the hands of those in the EU and in Turkey who oppose this membership."
"And that is where, Commissioner Verheugen, I start to lose the plot in your progress report."
"When you visited Turkey in March, you at least referred to the Kurdish problem by name, as you did here today."
"Your report makes no mention of this problem per se."
"I think that is a tragic step backwards in comparison with the old Commission's 1999 report."
"Truth is where the concept corresponds with its reality."
"At least that is what Mr Hegel believed."
"I have yet to see any real progress in Turkey, but I do believe it is possible."
"But, in my book, the Commission report is a real step backwards."
"Colleagues, please sit down and stop talking!"
"We are still in the debate."
"(Interjection from Mr Ferber: Tell them in German) President."
"There is no point, Mr Ferber, because some people have taken their headphones off and, like you, speak Bavarian rather than German!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the explanatory statement of General Morillon' s report states that the decision on Turkey' s accession is too important for the future of the Union and of Turkey itself to be concluded in smoke-filled back rooms or behind closed doors."
"I fully agree with this statement, but I would say that the decision by the Helsinki European Council to grant Turkey applicant country status was not preceded by the essential debate - both public and parliamentary - that General Morillon' s explanatory statement also calls for."
"Turkey' s candidature has always divided European opinion and I find it surprising that there is still an ongoing debate on the reasons for changing the traditional position of reserve with which this candidature has always been viewed. There is, of course, the geographical problem."
"Have we forgotten that only a small part of Turkish territory falls within the European continent?"
"What new doctrine on the European area allows us to frame this new concept of external borders that would result from including Turkey in the European Union?"
"Europe' s borders are now peaceful but, if Turkey does one day join the European Union, Europe will have a new border; not just an extra-European border, but a border of war and conflict."
"One only needs to think of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Armenia and Georgia."
"Furthermore, how can we resolve the conflict with the common democratic model that Europeans accept and wish to see, which results from the countless restrictions we see in Turkey on people exercising their fundamental rights, of which the maintenance of the death penalty is merely the worst example? And what of the Kurdish question, which arises from the fact that the Turkish State does not respect the basic rights of cultural identity of the millions of Kurds that live there?"
"Lastly I do not feel that questions have been asked concerning the size of the actual population represented by Turkey' s candidacy and the difficulties that this will cause, not only in terms of the Union' s geography but especially in terms of the already delicate balance between large, medium-sized and small Member States."
"I shall conclude as I began: the idea and purpose of my speech have been to draw attention to the fact that changes on this scale should not take place without a democratic, ongoing debate, otherwise the deficit in citizenship and participation that many Europeans feel with regard to the model of European construction will continue to grow."
"Mr President, the Morillon report in itself provides a perfect illustration of the basic contradictions in the European attitude to Turkey."
"This motion for a resolution contains anything and everything, with, in the first place, a great many illusions and a great many ritualistic recitals, which are, fortunately, immediately overtaken by reality, and this Turkish reality obviously does not match European illusions or dreams."
"The suggestion that the Europeans are going to bring about, I quote, ""a radical change in habits and outlook"" in the Turks is both extremely naive and extremely self-important."
"What arrogance on the part of the European Union to seek to foist its own values, institutional principles and political culture on the Turkish nation!"
"The twentieth century has, however, proved the extent to which forms of constructivism and state control, cut off from reality, and ideologies of all sort could lead to disaster."
"Let us therefore leave the Turkish nation their right to self-determination, their right to decide their own future, their right to be different, and their right to retain values of civilisation that are patently not our own."
"So the only real preamble which we should all be bound by is a recital taking into consideration the obvious facts of the situation."
"Turkey is not a European country, its culture is not European, and its values are not European."
"Turkey must not, therefore, join the European Union."
"That is no obstacle, moreover, to Europe' s developing economic, diplomatic, political and peaceful relations with a free and independent Turkey."
"Such a clear stance would, among other things, at least have the merit of no longer blowing hot and cold with regard to Turkish Governments, no longer telling them, ""yes but later"" , ""yes but on certain conditions"" , ""yes but this or that"" ."
"Europe' s contradictions and prevarications only lead to incomprehension and humiliation."
"We cannot play about with the dignity of nations."
"We shall therefore vote against this report, just as we have voted against all the reports seeking to make Turkey a member of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report troubles me."
"The problems are so serious as to preclude Turkey's accession in the foreseeable future."
"I should like to table three reservations: Turkey has not even started to resolve the problem of the minorities living there."
"Secondly, there is no end in sight to the dispute with Greece over the island of Cyprus, which still smoulders on."
"And thirdly, Turkey's criminal justice system, based as it still is on the death penalty and police torture, is unworthy of a western democracy."
"Horrific pictures of serious maltreatment of detainees by the police were recently broadcast on German television."
"In other words, Turkey still has a long and difficult way to go and it obviously needs our help along the way."
"We aim to help Turkey become a free democratic country in which the rule of law prevails."
"The Council should consider whether granting Turkey candidate status has done more harm than good here."
"It will have done more harm if Turkey's expectations of accession have been raised and cannot be met because of the political situation."
"The Islamic forces will certainly know how to make political capital out of any such disappointment."

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTES"
"Paciotti Report (A5-0279/2000)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Madam President, I voted for the Paciotti report, principally because this directive is intended to protect the identities, personal data, first names, surnames, addresses and characteristics of the citizens of the European Union."
"Pensioners and elderly people, whom it is my pleasure to represent at Parliament are all too often considered to be numbers, but the elderly do not want to be treated like numbers; they want to be treated like real flesh and blood people."
"This is my principle motive for supporting this directive, although I regret that Amendment No 65, tabled by Mr Ferri and Mr Fiori, which called for the supervisory monitoring body to be made up of a body of several members, was not accepted."
"Madam President, I feel it my duty to stress that we are being called upon to regulate, through the Paciotti report and other directives and regulations which will be tabled before us, a great power: the power of information technology."
"Data collection is not a painless operation and different types of database exist: confidential databases, CID databases, services databases - in short, there is an enormous amount of power."
"I would stress that in entrusting this huge power of monitoring the European databases to a monocratic body - notwithstanding the total respect and confidence which we have in the Guarantor - we would appear to have momentarily shifted our focus from the central concern of the human person which, in respect of the power of information technology, must be provided with a reference framework of guaranteed rights and freedoms."
"In my opinion, the proposal to establish a collegiate body would have responded better to this need."
"However, when we come to discuss the power of information in the future, we must realise that more widespread control, and the consequent provision of a greater guarantee for the human person, is a necessity."
". (FR) The Paciotti report is a first step towards attempting to make up the backlog which has accumulated as regards defending privacy and personal data."
"To this extent, the creation of an ""independent supervisory body"" is a positive move."
"However, none of the key questions of safeguarding personal rights and freedoms has been dealt with in a truly explicit fashion and the text, which is often technically confusing, lends itself to divergent interpretations."
"What is more, it does not go so far as the French legislation on computer technology and freedoms."
"Other proposals should have been included."
"It should be made mandatory to officially declare the existence of all databases; there must be a ban on merging databases (particularly in the fields of private life, health, social situations, etc.) in order to prevent gigantic databases being created; and, also, employees working with personal data must be given the means to withstand pressure from their employers by the establishment of a code of ethics and a conscience clause of the type that journalists have."
"Finally, citizens must be given the means to protect their own privacy themselves by allowing a free choice of encryption in data transmission."
"In this context, encryption techniques must be guaranteed by independent bodies."
"These few key provisions must be taken into consideration if we are to truly protect personal data."
"We therefore abstained."
". I welcome this report and will vote for it."
"European citizens are worried about the protection of their privacy, and those worries are not unjustified."
"Every day, enormous amounts of personal data are captured, sorted and processed."
"Such is the case in connection with credit card payments, tracing the movement of mobile telephones, storing telephone connections, surfing on the internet, processing other data taken, for instance, from forms previously filled in etc."
"On the EU level, the threat of possible abuse of personal data is being countered by two directives, namely Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and Directive 97/66/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector."
"Neither of them applies to the EU institutions."
"And yet there is a need for a set of data protection rules, for the institutions not only process internal data (such as data relating to their autonomous activities, budget and staff reports) but also data collected from citizens in the performance of EU duties (e.g. granting subsidies, investigating competition cases, public tenders, statistical research and studies, data relating to the preparation and implementation of legislation)."
"This report should go some way to filling this vacuum."
"Duff/Voggenhuber recommendation (A5-0325/2000)"
"Madam President, how could the Pensioners' Party not vote for the Charter of Fundamental Rights?"
"It is the first document of such importance in the whole world to contain an article - Article 25 - entitled 'The rights of the elderly', which reads: ""the Union recognises and respects the rights of the elderly to lead a life of dignity and independence and to participate in social and cultural life"" ."
"At last, an important association of States, the most important association in existence, the European Union, and the most important body, the only body directly elected by the people - the European Parliament - recognises that the elderly as such have rights."
"This is why I was extremely happy to vote for this Charter."
"Arlette Laguiller, Armonia Bordes and Chantal Cauquil voted against the Charter, being aware that charters afford no real protection for workers in this class-ridden society where the only thing that counts is the balance of power."
"This Charter refuses to include such basic rights as the right to a decent retirement pension, the right to a minimum wage, to decent housing, to health care."
"What is more, exemptions are possible to the article prohibiting children' s work before they have finished their compulsory schooling. This is a serious state of affairs when it is known that, in a number of European countries, an intolerable number of children are working, being exploited and being denied the right to a proper education."
"The text does not offer any additional protection and gives governments and the wealthy classes further arms to attack in these areas."
"The right to strike, for example, is acknowledged only with the proviso that it is limited ""in accordance with national laws and practices"" ."
"The Charter therefore has no binding force upon countries whose legislation does not go quite so far as the minimum contained in the Charter."
"In countries whose legislation is more favourable to workers, however, the Charter may be cited to oppose the national legislation in courts of law."
"Instead of pulling human rights and social rights up to a higher level, the Charter will enable actions that will effectively reduce them to the lowest common denominator."
"Madam President, I did not take part in the vote on the Charter of Fundamental Rights because I do not agree with the procedure: Parliament has been unable to propose any amendments either to the text of the Charter or even to the text of the recommendation."
"We had no choice but to take them or leave them."
"I do not consider this procedure to be correct and so I judged it appropriate not to take part in the vote."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is a far cry from the Declaration of Human Rights of the UN, the European Convention on Human Rights and the constitutions of many Member States of the European Union."
"The claim that this is the first time reference has been made to social rights does not stand up: there are references to social rights in international conventions such as the international labour conventions."
"For example, we note that:"
"Article 15 states that ""everyone has the right to engage in work"" but does not recognise the right to a paid job,"
"Article 16 recognises the freedom to conduct a business, the first international text to do so,"
"Article 28 allows employers to take anti-strike action (lock out) and sideline workers organisations in negotiations with employers,"
"Article 3 leaves abundant scope for every form of genetic experimentation,"
"Article 14 recognises the right to education but interprets it simply as being a right to free attendance applicable only to compulsory education."
"The Charter has diminished, not extended people's rights, for obvious reasons."
"Those who dreamed up this Charter are banking on using this weighty document to pursue their aggressive policy against everything the working classes have fought, sacrificed and died for over the past 150 years."
"If the Charter is adopted at the forthcoming summit in Nice, either by incorporating it into the Treaties or simply by proclamation, it will be a step backwards."
"There is no doubt that its ultimate purpose is as a precursor to an impending European Constitution which, in turn, will be the jewel in the crown of the EU's attempt to become a federation in which the institutional arrangements are such that decisions are taken by the minority of strong members but apply to everyone, the main purpose being to serve the interests of private monopolies in the European Union, at the expense of the workers and the people in general."
"We are well aware of the fact that the Charter may represent a step forward on certain issues for some countries."
"However, for most countries and in comparison with international provisions already in force, it represents a step backwards."
"Our aim must be to progress, not to go from bad to worse."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against this text, which is both useless and dangerous."
"(FR) The adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights would be justified if we already had a European State based on a constitution adopted by universal suffrage, but that is not the case today."
"The rights contained in the Charter are already included in national constitutions and safeguarded by national parliaments close to the nations of Europe and their cultures."
"Moreover, the Charter is a compromise based on the lowest common denominator, which will be detrimental to social advantages acquired by law in a good number of European Member States."
"The right to housing, for example, has been reduced to the right to ""housing assistance"" , while the right to work has been replaced by the ""right of access to placement services"" ."
"No restriction has been placed upon freedom of expression, implying that it would not henceforth be possible to bring prosecutions against criminal statements, such as incitement to racial hatred and violence."
"Finally, the Charter does not provide any articles devoted to the duties which are, nonetheless, the counterpart of rights."
"We do not, therefore, see any reason to adopt a text of this sort today, unless it is to conceal the automatic failure of the Intergovernmental Conference and the European Council in Nice."
"(FR) In my speech this morning, I presented the principles justifying my opposition to the Charter. Moreover, the members of the SOS Democracy Intergroup have notified me that they fully endorse these principles."
"I should now like to list my reservations concerning a number of specific articles. I previously had occasion to table amendments on these in the course of my work as a member of the Convention."
"These reservations may be classed in five main categories:"
"Articles trampling on State competences."
"Article 2(2) provides a typical example, ""No one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed."""
"This declaration does not fall within any sort of European jurisdiction."
"Its inclusion in the Charter, like the inclusion of many other similar articles, casts doubt on the accuracy of Article 51(2), which states, ""This Charter does not establish any new power or task for the Community or the Union, or modify powers and tasks defined by the Treaties."""
"Of course, if the Charter were to be made binding, then Article 2(2) would also thereby become binding, with far greater power than the European Convention on Human Rights, from which a country is still entitled to opt out."
"Articles establishing new obligations without justification."
"Several articles go further than the existing law."
"Article 19(1), for example, states that ""Collective expulsions are prohibited"" but does not specify that this ban may be suspended in the event of war or serious internal public order disturbances."
"Admittedly, Article 52(2) provides that ""Insofar as this Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said Convention"" , but this phrase is far too vague."
"We have just heard it stated that collective expulsions are prohibited in all cases."
"There is another new obligation, as Article 21 adds further instances of non-discrimination to those already laid down under Article 13 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community."
"Article 21(2) goes so far as to prohibit discrimination based on nationality within the scope of application of the Treaty Establishing the European Community and of the Treaty on European Union, which goes beyond any existing text."
"As a third example of this, Article 45 states that ""Freedom of movement and residence may be granted to nationals of third countries legally resident in the territory of a Member State"" , even though the law to this effect, as contemplated by Article 62 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, is not currently in force, and perhaps never will be if the conditions are not met."
"Articles setting unlawful constraints upon still developing situations."
"This applies particularly to the economic and social rights listed in Chapter IV of the Charter."
"Article 29, for example, states that ""Everyone has the right of access to a free placement service"" , but this is a statement that refers exclusively to the current circumstances, which may be assessed differently at a later date."
"Articles failing to recognise the natural laws of life in society."
"Even though the countries of Europe currently find themselves in an alarming demographic position, the Charter deals extremely lightly with the problems of the family."
"There is no statement, despite our requests, to the effect that a family is made up of a man and a woman raising their children, and that that is the basic unit of society."
"Article 24, on the rights of the child, even fails to say, once again in spite of our requests, that every child has the right to live with his or her parents."
"At the same time, the Charter is far too reticent on the existence of national communities and their right to frame their own regulations."
"For instance, the new requirement for non-discrimination on grounds of language, found in Articles 21 and 22, contradicts the French Constitution which stipulates that the language of the Republic of France is French."
"Articles obfuscating or distorting the Charter."
"I have already mentioned Article 51(1) which states, despite all evidence to the contrary, that the Charter in no way modifies powers or tasks defined by the Treaties."
"In point of fact, the Charter contains so many contradictions that, some day, someone will have to have the job of unpicking the tangle."
"In the same vein, I have mentioned 52(2) which claims that the meaning and scope of the rights in the Charter shall be the same as those in the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The fact is that this approximation is very hard to determine, as it is impossible to tell, when reading the Charter, whether one is dealing with an article which is supposed to be complying with the Convention, or an article which is deliberately distancing itself from it."
"Finally, let me also mention Article 52(1), which indicates that limitations on rights may be introduced if they ""genuinely meet objectives of general interest being pursued by the Union."""
"Were the Charter to become binding, a phrase such as this would put extreme limitations upon the sovereignty of States."
"More generally, we regret the fact that the preamble to the Charter did not put the document in perspective by pointing out that the European Union is an association of nations and that citizens have the fundamental right to have the decision they have taken democratically at national level respected."
"As I stated in the debate prior to this vote, my hope is that if the governments meeting in Nice wish to adopt this Charter as a political statement, they will preface it with an introductory statement to this effect and pointing out the basic jurisdiction of national parliaments over citizens' rights."
". SOS Democracy rejects the Charter of Fundamental Rights on three grounds."
"First, that it is unnecessary."
"Second, that it is undemocratic."
"And third, that it is likely to restrict, rather than enhancing, the freedom of Europe's peoples."
"We shall offer a brief explanation of these three objections in order."
"Ratifying the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms would be one of the most ambitious steps ever taken by the European Union."
"Before doing something of such magnitude, we should ask the question: where in Western Europe is the monstrous violation of human rights that this document would address?"
"We are dealing, after all, with 15 modern democracies, not with 15 Rwandas."
"Every Member State is already bound by the European Convention on Human Rights, the UN's Universal Declaration and a host of lesser accords."
"Why does the EU, as such, need to muscle in on this territory?"
"No one has yet answered that question."
"Indeed, Roman Herzog, president of the drafting convention, has gone out of his way to claim that the Charter will not create any new rights."
"If so, it seems strange to enact so great a constitutional revolution for such small purported gain."
"Human rights may not be under immediate threat in the EU, but accountable democracy is."
"The Charter will involve the European Court of Justice in a number of political decisions, in fields as diverse as employment law, extradition policy, immigration and the family."
"To the extent that no one has elected the judges, this represents a diminution of democratic government."
"More than this, the Charter will oblige the ECJ to strike down national legislative acts, or even provisions of state constitutions, in several new areas of policy."
"Since the ECJ, on the basis of the far more restricted text of the existing European treaties, has already displayed a worrying tendency towards judicial activism, this problem is likely to be especially acute."
"Even those who accept the case for a written EU constitution should hesitate as they contemplate some of the Charter's provisions."
"Of greatest concern is Article 52, which provides for the rights referred to elsewhere in the document to be set aside where they conflict with the ""general interest recognised by the Union""."
"This reintroduces the concept of ""raison d'Etat"" which the Council of Europe has spent the last half-century seeking to eradicate."
"The right of a government arbitrarily to set aside its own constitution is the defining characteristic of a tyranny."
"In Nazi Germany, for example, this provision existed under the so-called ""Enabling Act""."
"Less dramatically, but no less important, the Charter is badly drafted."
"Take, for example, Article 21, which prohibits ""any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation""."
"Taken literally, this article would mean that a socialist party would not be allowed to discriminate against conservatives who wanted to run as its candidates, or that an opera company would have to offer soprano roles to men."
"How such vaguely drafted provisions will be used in the hands of an activist court is anyone's guess."
"Human rights are already respected in the EU, and safeguarded by national constitutional provisions according to the different customs of the Member States."
"The Charter now provides a mechanism to circumscribe or override these rights, without even pretending to offer any new ones."
"It is a proud boast of many Europeans that we are free to do anything which is not expressly prohibited in law."
"Yet now it is proposed that we be ""given"" our rights by European judges."
"SOS Democracy rejects the notion that we should depend on the EU to bestow our own freedoms upon us."
"In the words of Aldous Huxley: ""Liberties are not given: they are taken""."
"- (SV) Chapter VII (General Provisions), Article 51(2) of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights states, 'This Charter does not establish any new power or task for the Community or the Union, or modify powers and tasks defined by the Treaties' ."
"It therefore also lacks any real significance in terms of people' s rights."
"The debate on this Charter has been eagerly applauded by EU federalists who wish to see it as the beginning of a constitution for the European Union."
"We nonetheless see a great danger in this Charter."
"It is in danger of undermining the Council of Europe' s work on human rights and of leading to a situation in which human rights are dealt with in different ways in European countries in the future."
"We are voting against this Charter because we do not want it at all."
"That does not mean that we are opposed to human rights as such."
"We believe, however, that these rights can be guaranteed by bodies other than the European Union."
"We believe that the draft Charter is a bad product which ought not to be taken any further."
"Instead, we urge the EU to ratify the European Convention on Human Rights, together with other conventions concerning social and cultural rights."
". (FR) The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union adopted today by the European Parliament is a highly significant document."
"Admittedly, there are still a number of shortcomings in both form and content."
"Admittedly, I personally would have preferred a Charter with a much more sizeable social component!"
"Admittedly, I would have liked to see it incorporated directly into the European Treaties!"
"Yet, we must not deny ourselves a good thing, nor must we deny the considerable work accomplished or the significant results arrived at today."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights is a document and a Charter shared by all the citizens of Europe!"
"What we have to do now is publish it widely, introduce it to everyone and get as many citizens as possible to consider its proposals."
"This is the way in which it will gradually pervade, through case law, all our national and European legal systems!"
"It is an extremely positive outcome both for the French Presidency of the European Union and for the European Parliament."
"Tomorrow we shall no doubt have to develop and complete it."
"Very quickly we shall have to incorporate it into the Treaties."
"Close upon the heels of the Charter, we must initiate work on a European Constitution for a democratic, transparent, efficient Citizens' Europe."
"Let me reiterate today, however, that we all have every reason to be proud of the conditions in which we have entered this phase, which is so crucial for Europe."
". I voted in favour of the Charter and agree that we should not be opposed to the rights enumerated within it."
"However, as I have stated before in this House, I am opposed to the Charter being binding."
"I and my government see it as a political declaration."
"We must ensure that the existing rights flowing from the European Convention on Human Rights, and supported by the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, are not diminished or brought into confusion."
"All Member States are signatories and have ratified the ECHR which has built up a considerable body of law and rights and has proven its ability to evolve with society."
"Therefore I support the Charter as voted today but I would not support it as a binding text."
"- (SV) Chapter VII (General Provisions), Article 51(2) of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights states, 'This Charter does not establish any new power or task for the Community or the Union, or modify powers and tasks defined by the Treaties' ."
"It therefore also lacks any real significance in terms of people' s rights."
"The debate on this Charter has been eagerly applauded by EU federalists who wish to see it as the beginning of a constitution for the European Union."
"I nonetheless see a great danger in this Charter."
"It is in danger of undermining the Council of Europe' s work on human rights and of leading to a situation in which human rights are dealt with in different ways in European countries in the future."
"I am voting against this Charter because I do not want it at all."
"That does not mean that I am opposed to human rights as such."
"I believe, however, that these rights can be guaranteed by bodies other than the European Union."
"I believe that the draft Charter is a bad product which ought not to be taken any further."
". (FR) I consider that the Charter of Fundamental Rights represents a valuable step forward."
"I nonetheless abstained from the final vote, because I feel that some social rights are expressed less clearly than the economic rights."
"Both the 'right to work' and the 'right to strike' are handled only indirectly."
"Europeans do have the 'right to work' (it would have been surprising if they did not); they have the right to take ""collective action"" to defend their social interests, ""including strike action"" ."
"Why not acknowledge the 'right to strike' directly?"
"Furthermore, I would have preferred a Charter that did not merely stipulate the 'rights' of citizens but also their 'duties' towards society."
"Article 17 very reticently states that ""the use of property may be regulated"" in the general interest."
"There is, however, no mention of social obligations relating to the right to property."
"The Charter lists the fundamental freedoms to which my fellow citizens are entitled, but there is no mention of a requirement upon anyone to respect the rights of others."
"A society which recognises only rights and not duties becomes selfish."
"(DE) Without underestimating the importance of fundamental rights to the citizens of the Union, the non-attached members in the European Parliament abstained during the vote for two reasons. First, because problems with the text of the Charter (such as the ban on the reproductive but not the therapeutic cloning of human beings) precluded a vote in favour and, secondly, because the convention as an instrument of future constitutional development would appear to be more than dubious."
"However, what worries us most is that the twin-track jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights will give rise to inconsistent case law, resulting in the unequal treatment of citizens in these sensitive areas, in breach of their fundamental rights."
"We are also convinced that merely having national parliamentarians on board is no substitute for an in-depth debate of constitutional questions by the national parliaments."
". One of the great criticisms of the EU in Britain is that it appears to go beyond what was intended when competences were granted to it, both in depth of detail and in scope of application."
"We, in the Conservative Party, are looking into ways of ring-fencing competence which will run with the letter and spirit of the Treaties and recognise the position of the Member States at the heart of the European political process."
"Enumerating and entrenching the inalienable characteristics of the system which guarantee rights to individuals and define the limits of the political process, across a number of Member States which comprise a single quasi-domestic legal area, offers a fruitful avenue to explore, to try to achieve these desirable ends."
"The problem with the Charter of Fundamental Rights is that it is hybrid, neither a legally entrenched system of rights nor a political code of conduct which draws together legal, economic and social rights in a manner, and this leads to confusion and lack of clarity."
". (FR) The main reason for my voting against adopting the Charter of Fundamental Rights is that I do not wish to be associated with a purely symbolic media stunt designed to send European public opinion a message of identity and hope that is largely built on pretence."
"The consensus method adopted by the Convention members has produced, as is generally the case when unanimity is enforced, a minimal Charter characterised by significant omissions and ambiguities."
"The original idea behind the Convention was to have a text adopted by consensus which could subsequently be made binding by the fifteen Member State governments when it was incorporated into the Treaties."
"In the end it was a fool' s bargain that was struck: the text is actually neither strong nor binding."
"The citizens of Europe have scant need of a formal declaration on the fundamental rights they are entitled to because these are recognised elsewhere in international conventions and in national law."
"I do not think that an outcome of this kind is going to convince many people of the value of developing the European Union."
"Let us move on to other matters."
"The Charter is an unsuccessful exercise. Politics is being smothered by too much symbolism and an excessive insistence on unanimity."
"If citizens are to feel involved in the European Union, its policies and institutions, then it is up to the Members of Parliament in particular to disclose more of the critical decisions, the contradictions, the divergent interests and projects driving the economic and social operators within the European arena."
"Everyday topical events, from maritime transport to animal meal, show us that the markets and economic operators must be much better regulated and controlled and that established short-term profit-making interests must be opposed."
"We need better European legislation to improve the quality of life for all and to improve social welfare systems."
"This is our priority fight in order to ensure that the affirmation of fundamental rights is put into practice in our political decisions."
". (FR) The Social Democrats promised us that Europe would cease to be just an economic market, a single currency and a liberalising machine."
"Enhanced with a ""Charter of Fundamental Rights"" , Social Europe would at long last take on a social character."
"But nothing of the sort has been achieved."
"This Charter represents a social step backwards as regards democracy and freedoms, falling short of the terms of the Treaties currently in force."
"Great pressure had to be exerted before the right to join trade unions and the right to strike were at last included."
"Except for a few general comments, women have the right to ""marry"" and ""found a family"" , while immigrants have the right not to be subjected to ""collective expulsion"" ."
"Social rights simply do not feature."
"There is no right to work, just the ""right to engage in work"" ; there is no right to social protection or accommodation, just ""the right to social assistance and housing assistance"" ; there is no right to a retirement pension or a minimum income; there is no ban on redundancies, just the ""right to protection against unjustified dismissal"" ."
"In fact, the fight against social exclusion is relegated to the level of assistance, instead of imposing a requirement for basic rights binding upon employers and states."
"Yet, on the other hand, the Charter of course gives the right to property and the freedom to conduct a business more than their due."
"For all the above reasons, this Charter must not be incorporated into the Treaties of the European Union, and we cannot accept the text as it is currently worded."
". (FR) The procedure adopted for framing and adopting the Charter of Fundamental Rights really only leaves the European Parliament with a simple choice: to either accept or reject the current Charter."
"Given that only have two options, my decision is unequivocally to vote in favour of the step forward which this Charter represents, however small that step forward may be in terms of the content and scope of the text."
"First of all we should take another look at the approach adopted."
"While the Convention method is a valuable one, and productive in terms of drawing up a basic text that is seeking a broad compromise, all the same nothing can justify depriving the European Parliament, the physical representatives of the peoples of Europe, of the opportunity to amend and enrich the text."
"Yet when a historian looks into the way in which the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen or other similar international declarations were drawn up, he perceives the extent to which parliamentary debate and the amendment process were able to lend inspiration, significance and also ambition to these fundamental texts which are still powerful today."
"At this time when debate in the institutions of Europe is being undertaken concomitantly with the Charter being adopted, all those men and women who, like myself, would like a European constitution and consider that this Charter may serve as the bare bones for the preamble to such a constitution should demand that the European Parliament be enabled to vote on the content, as part of its normal parliamentary business, which is basically deliberative."
"In connection with this institutional debate, it is essential to incorporate the Charter into the Treaties of the European Union so that the rights that have been declared can be guaranteed for all and the state policies required to implement them can be developed either by the Member States or by the European Union itself, without conflicting with the existing legal texts."
"It must be acknowledged that the law of free competition and the single market too often prevails over all other requirements and effectively flouts social rights and fundamental rights."
"We have seen too many declarations that were not followed up in practice."
"This is therefore the first priority: we must give this Charter real legal force."
"Next, the actual content of the Charter is ambiguous and inadequate on some counts."
"In the first place, there are discrepancies between the German and French versions which raise major questions about the references to ""religious"" or ""spiritual"" values."
"Personally, I am convinced that secularism is a liberating factor for the modern world."
"I deplore the ambiguity of these terms and also the lack of a clearer reference to secularity."
"Secondly, the right to work is not directly stated."
"Anyone can see that a provision stating that ""every person has the right to work"" is really not that ambitious."
"The difference between not prohibiting access to work and taking action to make it possible to work is more than just a shade of meaning."
"The Charter should have clearly stated the right to work, and indeed the right to housing, which was also expressed in a roundabout way, affording little protection."
"The Charter must be improved, and the European Parliament must propose a strategy enabling it to be updated and enriched."
". I will be voting for this report and wish to record my congratulations to Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber on their leadership of Parliament on this vital matter."
"I look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights being solemnly proclaimed in Nice."
". (NL) I would not wish to deny that there are things in the Charter that I am able to endorse."
"The same things are already to be found in the national constitutions, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and the European Social Charter."
"In fact there is not a great deal in the Charter, despite the pressure brought to bear by the trade union movement, the environmental movement and human rights organisations."
"This means that as a document, the Charter is surplus to requirements."
"It is a propaganda document that creates the impression that something worthwhile has been achieved, when in reality this is not the case."
"In addition, it is confusing from the legal perspective, as a result of which the powers of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg are in competition with those of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg."
"As such, the Charter is no more than an instrument of propaganda designed to show what a good thing it is that we have a European Union and that everyone should think themselves lucky."
"It does encroach on the national competences of the Member States but it does nothing for the European citizens."
"Unless it is amended in such a way as to shift the emphasis to social fundamental rights and the environment, I will be unable to vote in favour of adopting the Charter."
". (DE) The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is an important step towards defining the general, common values of the European Union."
"Nonetheless, I decided to abstain for the following reasons:"
"1."
"The Charter sets out important fundamental rights."
"However, in its present form, it fails to do justice to the demand for social justice, as I understand it, in several important areas."
"It does not include the right to work or the right to housing."
"Similarly, the social responsibility of ownership has been left out."
"It has already been assumed that the Charter might form the basis for a European constitution."
"That makes including fundamental social rights even more important."
"2."
"The Charter is the outcome of the work of a broad-based convention which sat in public."
"That is, without doubt, an improvement on how documents of such fundamental importance are usually drafted."
"Nonetheless, it does not substantiate the EU's claim to be a union of peoples and their citizens."
"If the Charter is to be an expression of the common values of the people of the European Union, those people must be given an opportunity to debate it."
"It should not therefore be decided and proclaimed at the Council summit in Nice; on the contrary, the summit should prompt a European debate on the Charter."
"That would give us a chance to restore a Europe of the people and of broad civil involvement."
"3."
"The Charter contains some lofty claims but imposes no concomitant obligation and cannot therefore be enforced by the citizens of Europe."
"The citizens' Europe we are striving for must establish such recourse."
"For these reasons I abstained from voting during the plenary session of the European Parliament."
". I voted for the Charter of Fundamental Rights as a declaration of intent."
"The basic clauses are not in dispute and should be supported by everyone."
"There will be no shift in the balance of power between the EU and Member States."
"This Charter is a declaratory document and clarifies the EU position - especially to those seeking to join the enlarged Europe."
"We must, however, stand firmly against any campaign for a legally binding Charter that would only create legal uncertainty."
"This document is clearly not one suited to become legally binding as it is not a legal text."
". (PT) I abstained in the vote on the Charter of Fundamental Rights because I felt that, before this was adopted or rejected, it was crucial to know what fate it would meet at the Nice European Council."
"In future, will its clauses have a merely symbolic value or will they become binding for Community institutions and, consequently, for the European public?"
"We are very familiar with the position held by the majority in this Parliament."
"In this catalogue of rights, the devotees of European federalism see the embryo of a future European Constitution, which the Member States' national constitutions will have to accommodate."
"We understand their position when they try to give a qualitatively diverse political meaning to a text on fundamental rights, which is not only vague and all-encompassing, but is also going to be of arguable usefulness in an EU that has no serious shortcomings, either in the legal status of its rights or in the way in which these rights are defended and implemented."
"Fortunately the prevailing tendency of national governments seems to indicate the sensible path to take, which is to see the Charter as having power that is merely political rather than binding."
"The great political debate on the Charter will therefore take place firstly between national governments and then, eventually, when this Parliament is confronted with their decision."
"Meanwhile, as I said at the beginning of this explanation of vote, the only approach I could adopt was to abstain from voting."
"- (SV) This text concerning a Charter of Fundamental Rights contains many important wordings central to the principle of human dignity and, as Swedish Christian Democrats, we warmly welcome these."
"Since there is a great deal of doubt in Sweden' s local authorities and county councils about the legitimacy and relevance of the Charter' s being made legally binding and about the extent to which the EU is in fact capable of fulfilling all the expectations the EU purports to guarantee, I have chosen to abstain from voting in this vote."
". In the debate in this chamber today, regarding the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights, the Commission representative stated that this Charter was a first step toward a legally binding document."
"Speaker after speaker, with a few exceptions, referred to the need for a Europe with constitutional rights."
"These statements confirm the concerns expressed within my country that this Charter is intended to be the preamble to a European Constitution."
"Recently our Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, clearly stated that the European Charter of Fundamental Human Rights should remain a political, not a legal document."
"Members of the Irish government have recently raised questions regarding whether Brussels threatens Irish identity and Mr Ahern, whilst affirming Ireland's EU membership as fundamental to its prosperity and economic success, firmly resisted any rapid movement to a more federal - centralised - Europe, as it would go well beyond what most Europeans currently wish for or are prepared to accept."
"In the light of Ireland's national position and in tune with the wishes of my constituents, I must vote against this Charter of Fundamental Human Rights which, despite being a simple political statement at this time is, by all evidence, intended to be the preamble to a European Constitution which will take precedence over the constitution of my country and the will of the Irish people."
". (FR) I voted, most decidedly, against the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights before us."
"I did so primarily to denounce the anti-democratic way in which it was produced."
"From start to finish, the framing of the Charter gave rise to a series of takeovers by force:"
"A semantic appropriation, at the outset, regarding the name of the body drafting the Charter."
"Established as ""a body"" by the Cologne Summit, it declared itself a ""Convention"" , a name with unfortunate connotations of 1793 when the French Revolution degenerated into the Reign of Terror under another ""Convention"" ."
"An appropriation of parliamentary authority."
"The Court of Justice is going to be able to impose the terms of this text, whose definitive version was finalised by a Praesidium operating in a far from transparent manner, upon the citizens of our countries, even though it will not even have been ratified by our national parliaments, who, nonetheless, have exclusive jurisdiction over human rights issues!"
"As for the Members of the European Parliament, they were not only refused the right to table amendments to the text of the Charter, but were also forced to vote on the Charter as a whole, which runs counter to the most basic democratic rules."
"A takeover instigated against a whole raft of fundamental rights which, worryingly, were discarded from the text."
"So, for example, the absolutely basic fundamental right of the child to live with its father and mother, even though such a provision was expressly and insistently requested by a number of ""Convention"" members, was not adopted."
"The basic right to a nation, which was also demanded and which is also fundamental, was also censored."
"Any references to the religious heritage of our nations, even though this is explicitly mentioned in the majority of the fundamental texts governing our States, including France, making reference to the Supreme Being, and even though such references were included in the initial text of the Charter, were eliminated following pressure from several sides but particularly, it appears, from the representatives at the highest level of some Member States, in the name of an obscurantism which mistakes the exclusion of any religious reference from the state sector for legitimate secularism."
"In the end, the haggling that this type of process inevitably leads to resulted in our weighing the notion of Europeans' ""religious heritage"" against the promotion of ""free enterprise"" ."
"No surprise as to what won the day."
"The limitations of the rule of consensus applied in this sort of context may be gauged by observing the Ubuesque and frankly grotesque choices it gives rise to."
"Ultimately there is nothing European about the text of the Charter."
"As it stands, it could be adopted by just about any country in the whole world."
"The lot of processes of this nature is to produce texts which necessarily boil down to the lowest common denominator."
"The value of the content of such an exercise, quite apart from its illegitimacy, given that the European Union has no jurisdiction in the field of human rights, cannot clearly be seen since, in Europe, our freedoms are protected remarkably well by the founding texts of our nations and by the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The method used, the cuts made and the ambiguity surrounding the very nature of the text, on the other hand, shed a harsh light on the new totalitarian agitators at work at the very heart of the process of European integration."
"Marinho Report (A5-0313/2000)"
"Madam President, Mr Marinho's document is a step towards establishing the future European criminal legal system."
"Pensioners are in favour of strengthening criminal law, European law especially, as well as national law, for I am afraid that crimes are no longer committed solely by our citizens but by people of other nationalities as well."
"Pensioners and elderly people fall victim to criminal acts more frequently than anyone else - not major crime, of course, of the sort leading to money laundering, which is what we are combating here, but those related petty criminal acts which make life difficult for everybody and the elderly in particular."
". (FR) Last night we examined four draft texts on combating organised crime which, on the whole, are to be welcomed, even if the reports and amendments from the European Parliament are themselves more questionable."
"These texts have two points in common."
"Firstly, they are mutually complementary, extending Europol' s competence, setting up a Provisional Judicial Cooperation Unit, improving reciprocal assistance in judicial matters between Member States and defining more clearly the conditions for the fight against money laundering which is the result, or the cause, or in any case a necessary component in a great many very serious crimes."
"Next, these texts are all based on initiatives by Member States, coming under either the third pillar of Article 67 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, where the Commission does not have the monopoly on the right of initiative."
"Let me point out in passing that seven of the reports presented during this part-session have been in response to national initiatives, proving that where this system is implemented, it is proving to be very productive."
"Moreover, it is developing forms of cooperation that give greater respect to national sovereignty, as is shown by the initiative of the French Republic dealt with in the Roure report, which manages to reconcile mutual assistance in judicial matters and respect for the key interests of the Member States."
"We supported these initiatives in general, except where the European Parliament amendments were tending to introduce too much of a federalist bias."
"We do, however, deeply regret the fact that a fifth text, the Ceyhun report on the two initiatives by the French Republic seeking to step up controls on illegal immigration was referred back to committee."
"The arguments put forward by the European Parliament are completely fallacious."
"The fact is, this House wishes to interfere with everything but draws the line at supporting the decisions which nonetheless lie at the heart of the responsibilities of States in order to protect their own peoples."
"Fortunately, in this field, the European Parliament still has only a consultative role until the Treaty of Amsterdam is fully implemented, yet it is still finding occasion to abuse this role by putting the brake on reasonable decisions."
". (FR) I have already expressed my views, this year, on the proposal for an amendment of the 1991 directive on money laundering."
"The European Parliament had already pinpointed the omissions in this directive, and the Commission recently tabled a proposal taking Parliament' s comments into consideration."
"The Council' s common position has not been officially recognised."
"The report under discussion today is a direct result of the commitment made at the European Council in Tampere, in October 1999, to combat this scourge of money laundering which amounts to between 2 and 5% of the world' s GDP every year."
"The French Presidency made this one of the priorities on its agenda, and has therefore planned a set of legislative measures to create a legal framework broad enough to encompass the crime of money laundering."
"We have had proposals, firstly, to extend Europol' s competence to cover money laundering - the Karamanou report - and, secondly, for a raft of measures to improve international cooperation in the field of mutual assistance in criminal matters - the Roure report."
"These two reports were put to the vote today, and I voted in favour of them."
"The Marinho report now seeks to extend the principle of the mutual recognition of national measures for the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime, established by the Joint Action 98/699/JHA in 1998, to decisions in the pre-court phase, especially those enabling the competent authorities to take rapid action to obtain evidence and seize easily transportable assets."
"These proactive measures are absolutely essential in order to combat this phenomenon, which has continually grown and taken on an international dimension."
"As Conclusion 51 of the Tampere European Council states, ""Money laundering is at the very heart of organised crime."
"It should be rooted out wherever it occurs."""
"I therefore voted in favour of the Marinho report, and in support of the endeavours of the French Presidency."
"- (DA) Even if we support the fight against money laundering and can therefore also endorse the need to equip the relevant authorities with the right tools for the job, we cannot vote in favour of Mr Marinho' s report."
"Because this report, together with the reports of Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Roure, which we are also voting on today, set the scene for harmonising the Member States' procedures under criminal law for establishing maximum and minimum penalties for money laundering, an indirect step is being taken towards developing a common European legal system with courts, police, judges, judicial system etc, a development we neither can nor wish to support."
"In any case, the fight against money laundering takes place on a number of levels and, to start with, we see no need to establish maximum and minimum penalties for this at Community level."
". (DE) Obviously it makes sense and we need to combat money laundering."
"However, there are differing interpretations as to how this can be achieved."
"If we set minimum penalties in this framework resolution, we shall come up against elementary rule of law problems."
"If we set minimum penalties, we shall be contradicting cleverly worked-out national criminal codes."
"We need to approximate, not unify our criminal codes."
"Under the rule of law and democracy, criminal codes represent very core of national sovereignty and the Member States should therefore be left to set them."
". I welcome this report."
"Special action against money laundering was proposed in Tampere in 1999."
"The European Council, noting that serious forms of crime increasingly have tax and duty aspects, called upon the Members States to provide full mutual legal assistance in the investigation and prosecution of this type of crime and for the approximation of criminal law and procedures on money laundering."
"It was accepted that the principle of mutual recognition should also apply to pre-trial orders, in particular to those which would enable competent authorities quickly to secure evidence and seize assets, which are easily moveable."
"Through this initiative the French Presidency proposes the adoption of a framework decision for the approximation of criminal law and procedures on money laundering (e.g. tracing, freezing and confiscating funds)."
"The adoption of this report and the French initiative will undoubtedly assist in the fight against money laundering."
"- (NL) There is often a fine line between business activities and white-collar crime."
"The drugs and arms trades, illegal waste dumping, leaving consumers non-plussed with poor quality products, banking secrecy and tax havens undoubtedly contribute to the much championed economic growth."
"Yet they clearly run counter to the interests of human beings and the conservation of our environment."
"The right to property appears almost to be sacrosanct."
"That was the case a century ago, and although there was a crack down, it is now back in full force."
"Therefore any move to improve our chances of depriving those who profit from illegal financial practices of their gains, is a step in the right direction."
"This subject has also been seized on with a view to enhancing cooperation between European police forces."
"It sometimes seems as though this objective takes precedence over the fight against white-collar crime."
"In practice, such cooperation could primarily be deployed, once in a while, for purposes other than the fight against money laundering."
"This has an adverse effect on the rights of citizens who do not commit such crimes."
"Therefore the best solution would be for banks and other enterprises to place their books fully in the public domain, and to develop democratic control over the economy."
". I congratulate my Socialist colleague, Mr Marinho, for his excellent report on strengthening the fight against international money laundering and organised crime."
"Crime is one of the greatest concerns of our constituents and many strongly support criminals being put under lock and key."
"We must be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime so that from Manchester to Madrid, our citizens are safe and are afforded full protection from criminals throughout Europe."
"Money laundering feeds the trade in drug-trafficking."
"Existing EU law is clearly not enough to stem the tide of the reported USD 590 billion which is laundered world-wide every year."
"We welcome the French Presidency's initiative aimed at improving cooperation between national authorities responsible for tackling money laundering and laying down uniform penalties."
"All Member States should treat money laundering as a criminal offence carrying a minimum sentence of four years' imprisonment."
"Further measures are being voted on by the European Parliament this week in our efforts to crack down on international crime."
"We are looking to extend the remit of Europol - the European Police Cooperation Unit - to cover serious international crime."
"We also want to remove legal barriers which prevent the extradition of suspected criminals accused of money laundering or other related offences involving illicit funds."
"This will be an important tool in allowing criminals to be tried across Europe."
"These reports are crucial if the single market is not to become a free market for criminals."
"The last thing we want is that the single market allows criminals to enter the single market unseen by the back door."
"These measures drafted by Socialist MEPs are an important step in combating international crime and I urge the House to support these reports."
"Karamanou Report (A5-0312/2000)"
"Madam President, I voted for the Karamanou report, whose objective is also of major importance: the creation of a European Police Office."
"However, a question mark has formed in my mind because, the other day, a pensioner, Mrs Lucia Boroni, said to me: 'I was walking down the road when someone ran off with my handbag."
"Then I saw a policeman nearby with a badge saying 'European Policeman' on his jacket, and I asked him: ""Why aren't you chasing that thief who has stolen my handbag?"""
"And the policeman replied: 'Because of the principle of not interfering in national responsibilities, the principle of subsidiarity."
"That thief was Italian: an Italian policeman should have been chasing him."
"I am the future European policeman'.'"
"I hope that this question mark remains nothing more than a question mark!"
"We shall see ..."
". Although we will support the report, we, as British Conservatives, have particular reservations regarding certain aspects of the report, as follows: extension of QMV - in respect of Europol the Council will act by a two-thirds majority in accordance with Article VI of the Treaty (Article 1 (1b) - Amendment No 3); centralising Europol's powers - the Court of Justice will have jurisdiction to rule on any dispute or conflict between Member States regarding the interpretation or application of the Convention (Article 1 (1d) - Amendment No 5)."
". While welcoming closer cooperation between the Member States' police forces both amongst themselves and through Europol, I share the rapporteur' s concerns about the lack of democratic accountability of Europol."
"As money laundering assumes vast proportions throughout the world it is clear that Europol should have the powers to combat it, with a view to devising a European strategy for police and judicial cooperation."
"However, it is vital that national parliaments and the European Parliament have access to information on Europol's activities in order to ensure political accountability and that there is a role for the European Court to ensure judicial accountability."
"Roure Report (A5-0314/2000)"
"Madam President, I voted for the Roure report, which is also a document which fights crime by adapting criminal legislation."
"However, also in this regard, I have to say that, last Saturday, I was in Curno, the municipality where I live, outside the bank where pensioners go to draw their pensions each month."
"I saw an extremely long queue of pensioners and elderly people."
"One of them, the last in the line, recognised me and asked me: 'Why is this queue so long?' ."
"I went to find out and came back to her with the reply: 'They are carrying out checks to make sure that none of the money is dirty, in observance of the new legislation' ."
"'I don't care,' said the pensioner. 'Clean or dirty, I need my pension money.'"
"There you are. This is an example of what I hope will not happen when this document is implemented."
". (ES) The parties that I represent in this House, Eusko Alkartasuna and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, fully support the Roure report on improving judicial cooperation in criminal matters, particularly in the area of combating organised crime, the laundering of the proceeds from crime and financial crime."
"We also support the future establishment of a convention to help combat organised crime and money laundering, and the various measures proposed in order to achieve those purposes."
"The idea of creating an area of freedom, security and justice in Europe is, obviously, an aspiration that we share."
"We feel that the strict limitation of the reasons for which the Member States may refuse to provide judicial cooperation solely to ""essential interests,"" thus excluding the notions of sovereignty, public order and national security in force up until now is a step forward, but is still inadequate."
"This is mainly because we still find it unacceptable for a State to be able to invoke a ""general interest"" in order to be able to deny judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"This shows, once again, that the Member States have a long way to go in understanding the meaning of shared sovereignty."
"Moreover, I should point out, as a Member representing Basques and Catalans, that there continues to be an emphasis on cooperation between States, without taking into account that in the EU other police forces operate that are not State bodies."
"This report and, in general, the area of freedom, safety and justice in Europe, is based on democracy and on the rule of law that should reign in the EU."
"Therefore, what most concerns me about the future of legal cooperation in the EU is that currently some States are proposing criminal reforms that are bordering on the violation of human rights."
"As you will be aware, the Spanish government has initiated a reform of criminal law to make sentences tougher for certain types of crimes."
"Specifically, this special legislation is considering sentences of up to ten years in prison for children of 14 years of age, not to mention other measures."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are convinced that Europe needs to construct the area of freedom, security and justice that we so often cite in our speeches."
"We will be the first to support it."
"However, I would like to draw your attention to the possible reforms of criminal law that could take place in various Member States such as Spain, for example, with the Partido Popular in power - which is taking advantage of a certain situation - because these reforms are still a concern for the Europe of freedom and democracy."
". I welcome Mrs Roure' s report on another initiative from the French Presidency - this time to step up cooperation in the legal area to ensure that no barriers are put in place to prevent the extradition of suspected criminals accused of money laundering or other related offences involving illicit funds."
"The draft convention proposes that banking secrecy may not be used as a reason to refuse a request from another Member State for information on somebody suspected of being involved in financial crime."
"In addition, the idea is that, on request, Member States should furnish details of all bank accounts held by suspects."
"The aim of the new convention is to oblige the Member States actively to pursue suspicious transactions."
"Gebhardt Report (A5-0317/2000)"
"Madam President, this is a document - which I voted for - which is intended to establish gradually, step by step, a European public prosecution service."
"In fact, a provisional cooperation unit is being set up, composed of a representative of the judges or police officers with equivalent competence from each of our 15 Member States."
"However, I would have hoped that this body would also have included representatives of the lawyers of each of the 15 States, for I feel that, at a time when we have to establish something new in the legal area, it would be beneficial to consult not only the judges who judge but also the lawyers, who have a great deal of experience in the field."
"And I am not saying this merely because my daughter has recently graduated as a fully-fledged lawyer."
"- (DA) The Gebhardt report' s undisguised intention to institutionalise judicial cooperation and make it into a supranational affair by setting up Eurojust is based upon a highly problematic premise."
"There is not just one, but there are fifteen different legal systems in the EU."
"Working these different legal traditions into the EU' s bureaucracies could lead to an élitist and non-transparent system without any form of democratic support."
"Nor will such a system be able to solve the problems faced by the Member States."
"We are also strongly opposed to the ambition to make the EU into a constitutional State by establishing 'independent legislative, executive and judiciary' bodies 'with counterbalancing powers' ."
"It is still the Member States, as constitutional States, which must be at the heart of European cooperation."
"That is why we are voting against the report."
"Langenhagen Report (A5-0310/2000)"
"Madam President, this is the only report which I voted against."
"I voted against this document because I was astounded to find that the explanatory statement of the rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen, clearly affirms that the procedures for implementing this programme, which has distributed EUR 665 million, have been irregular."
"I regret to say that it informs us that some of the members of the committees responsible for allocating the European funds for research in the sectors of hunting and fisheries also benefited from this research."
"I therefore feel that we should be much more careful in carrying out our financial activities in respect of research programmes than we are at present."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.52 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Turkey (continuation)"
"Mr President, as a member of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, I take a close interest in Turkey's accession prospects."
"I should like today to highlight Mr Morillon's call for a European-Turkish discussion forum in the House and for a debate on Turkey's accession prospects in the national parliaments in our Member States."
"This is important for Turkey, but it is even more important for the Member States themselves and for our citizens."
"Our governments agreed to Turkey's accession prospects in Helsinki."
"The people of Turkey were surprised by this decision and many still fail to understand it. This is because Turkey's own people have been offered no forum for discussion, with the result that the issue is being discussed subliminally, in ignorance and without any knowledge of the background to the Helsinki decision."
"This is giving rise to an anti-attitude which we cannot afford in the Union, given the large number of Turkish immigrants already living here, and which, given the increase in xenophobia, we must not afford."
"My Turkish counterparts in the Turkish Grand National Assembly are also complaining about this deplorable state of affairs in which no-one wants to talk to them openly, no-one from the national governments or parliaments and, to all intents and purposes, no-one from the European institutions."
"Of course there are informal discussions, but there are, to all intents and purposes, no official meetings."
"One almost gets the impression that there is a sort of gentlemen's agreement to talk about Turkey's accession only behind closed doors."
"What is everyone afraid of?"
"Was the Helsinki decision premature?"
"The initial euphoria of the Council and Commission has clearly waned."
"Apart from declarations of intent, so far Turkey has made no fundamental progress towards meeting the political criteria."
"Consequently, there is even more need now, almost one year on from Helsinki, for Turkey's accession prospects to be debated in our national parliaments and with our citizens."
"We owe it both to Turkey and to our own people, and this sort of discussion will perhaps help to integrate the Turkish immigrants already living in our midst."
"Mr President, if Turkey were a member of the EU, it would be the most populous Member State after Germany."
"It would be the first Member State geographically to bridge the gulf between Europe and Asia and to have a mainly Muslim tradition."
"Unfortunately, it is a country which is not only large but which also has an unstable feel about it when it comes to democracy."
"All these factors go to show that Turkey' s application for membership of the EU is one of the most important issues for the EU' s future."
"The Commission' s latest report on enlargement confirms that progress has been made but also highlights large deficits in terms of democracy, human rights and the treatment of ethnic minorities such as the Kurds."
"Turkey has not come so far as had been hoped."
"Torture is still practised, and the military plays far too large a political role."
"Turkey' s role in Cyprus is also unacceptable."
"My role here is to represent the members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists in the Committee on Budgets."
"It is, of course, economic considerations that are at issue."
"From an economic point of view, poverty, inflation and budget deficits are general problems, like the uneven social distribution of the results of economic progress."
"Major structural reforms are needed in these areas."
"Mr Seppänen' s report is about increasing the European Investment Bank' s powers and mandate to take action in Turkey."
"Seen from an institutional point of view, this issue is crucially linked to the Customs Union with Turkey, which has existed for many years."
"That Customs Union nonetheless needs to be strengthened by means of a special programme of measures from the European Investment Bank because the latter does not see Turkey as belonging yet to that circle of countries entitled to pre-accession aid."
"We see it as a matter of great urgency for the EU, through the EIB, to support development so that Turkey might as soon as possible set a practical process in motion with a view to fulfilling the Copenhagen Criteria."
"That is why the demands for democracy and human rights must also find expression in the EIB' s financing activity."
"In practical terms, this is about the opportunities for granting loans for projects in Turkey amounting to EUR 450 million between now and 2004."
"Certainly, Turkey is already entitled to loans in a number of connections, but the Commission now wants to invest in economic development, especially where the infrastructure is concerned, in order to strengthen the country' s economic competitiveness."
"Allow me to comment on the procedure in terms of principle, leaving aside the point at issue."
"This is a consultation procedure, but it would be reasonable, of course, for it to be a codecision procedure because these decisions can in actual fact lead to the Budget's having to be adjusted."
"That particularly applies at this stage when we are progressively committing more and more of the EIB' s resources, but without fully covering the financial risks we are taking."
"When the EIB grants loans to countries other than the Member States, Parliament ought also to be consulted about the political priorities to be set in what is a part of the Bank' s activity mainly motivated by foreign policy."
"The immediate Budget problem is that there is a danger of there being no margin left in the guarantee fund reserve."
"We are increasing the Investment Bank' s commitments, but we are not increasing the EU Budget' s loan guarantee reserve to the same degree, and we have undertaken to provide 65% finance if a loan cannot be repaid."
"The residual guarantee fund reserve is now so low that it may prevent the Union from using the EIB as an instrument if new events should occur, requiring initiatives of this nature."
"In spite of this concern, the Committee on Budgets nonetheless proposes that Parliament approve the Commission' s proposal."
"However, we back the rapporteur' s criticism that there is at present no effective assessment of the EIB' s loan operations and that there are deficiencies when it comes to public scrutiny and democratic control of the Bank' s activity."
"If we shall nonetheless be voting in favour of the proposal, it is because we think it important to contribute to more positive development in those areas where Turkey is still falling down, especially the economic area."
"Mr Morillon has written a good report stressing that neither religious objections nor geo-strategic considerations are the decisive factors for Turkey's accession."
"The challenge for Turkey in fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria is to reform not only the constitution but also its political and intellectual inspiration."
"In Western Europe ideas of pluralism and differentiated identities within the same State have led to recognition of cultural, linguistic and political rights and devolution."
"Turkey needs to adopt these modern European notions of diversity and the right to be different."
"The Kemalist ideology that was modern in 1930 is not so in 2000."
"Hence my amendments on the need for a political solution for the Kurdish people."
"It is unacceptable that the Commission omitted any mention of the Kurds from the accession partnership document, though they have been referred to in successive regular reports and Mr Verheugen mentioned them this morning."
"I hope Parliament and the Council will remedy that omission."
"It does not help Turkey or the European Union to fight shy of this issue, the biggest single cause of Turkey's poor human rights record."
"Until there is a solution for the Kurds there will be no fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria and I therefore call upon Parliament to pass my amendments, and on the Council and Parliament to insist that a solution for the Kurds is a key to unlocking the problems of Turkey fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as a member of the delegation to the parliamentary cooperation committees for relations with the three countries of the southern Caucasus - Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia - I wholeheartedly support Mr Morillon' s report, particularly Article 18, which calls on the Turkish Government to improve its relations with its neighbours in the Caucasus."
"While there is a special relationship between Azerbaijan and Turkey, this is far from being the case for Armenia, a country against which Turkey is maintaining a commercial blockade, which is not acceptable in a country which has been accepted as a candidate for membership of the European Union."
"The dispute relating to acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide should also be waived in order to enable diplomatic and trade relations to be normalised, especially as Turkey plays a key role in the project for the construction of an oil pipeline taking petroleum from the Caspian Sea to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean."
"Turkey also needs to take on board environmental considerations, particularly in schemes such as the construction of major dams, which will necessarily have an impact on the water systems of neighbouring countries."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate General Morillon on what is, under the circumstances, a most balanced report."
"We all know how difficult it is under such difficult circumstances to deal efficiently with successive efforts to serve political, economic and other purposes and interests at the expense of principles and rules of law and generally using two yardsticks and two sets of scales."
"That is why the frankness which runs through the Morillon report deserves special mention, although fewer excuses at some points in the report would, I think, have reflected the factors used to evaluate Turkey's progress towards accession more accurately."
"In this context, I would like to reiterate the basic conclusion in paragraph 22 that Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria and draw attention both to the fact that Turkey has been condemned on numerous occasions for acts and omissions in relation to human rights, democratic freedoms and its international attitude and to the European Parliament's recommendations that Turkey comply with the relevant European values."
"On the other hand, although paragraphs 9, 10, 12 and 17 expressly refer to infringements of these values by Turkey on numerous occasions, especially by the Turkish occupying army in Cyprus, which Turkey is called on to withdraw, the fact remains that it would have been preferable to roundly condemn Turkey's present and past responsibility for problems caused by its intransigence and the resultant impasse on the Cyprus question - where, it should be noted, there are clear signs of Turkey's intention to provoke a new heated crisis -, its failure to abide by international conventions with its expansionist policy towards Greece, its concealment of the historical truth of the Armenian genocide and its disregard for the fundamental minority rights of the Kurds."
"Something along these lines might have been more helpful, including for Turkey, because it would have sent a more accurate message to the forces in Turkey which really do intend to modernise the country and it would have supported their efforts to put conditions in place which guarantee its European prospects, giving them serious arguments with which to convince the many sceptics that those prospects are, in fact, well-founded."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office said this morning, this is a highly topical debate because it coincides with the documents presented by the Commission - the report on Turkey's progress and of course, more importantly, the accession partnership."
"This is the first serious step on the road towards Turkey's accession and the accession process can now move into the practical application stage."
"We, for our part, welcome this."
"Turkey, for all its differences, always was and still is an integral part of Europe."
"Old feuds cannot deny Turkey its place in the life of the Member States of the European Union."
"If Europe can accept Turkey for what it is and welcome it into the European family, with all its differences, it will, I think, have made a quantum political and cultural leap."
"It will have demonstrated that our values are catholic values which seek not to iron out the differences between the partners but to assimilate their differences and peculiarities."
"Of course, in order for there to be assimilation, there must be common ground."
"Our rapporteur has identified and brought Turkey's attention to this common ground in his really excellent report, for which I too wish to thank him."
"The common ground is democracy and it presupposes freedom of opinion, i.e. equal human and political rights for everyone, irrespective of national origin, and the right to choose a government in free elections, in truly free elections and only in free elections, something which is, of course, incompatible with autonomous centres of power, especially autonomous centres of excessive military power. What more could one ask of the Morillon report?"
"Only, perhaps, that it might have stated more clearly at this point that there can be no democracy in Turkey and there can be no accession by Turkey unless the military is stripped of its excessive, constitutionally-protected powers."
"Democracy is compatible with institutionalised civil functions for the armed forces; it is not compatible with fundamental military intervention in political life, irrespective of whether or not it is sanctioned constitutionally."
"It is only natural to expect a democratic country to display a peaceful attitude towards its neighbours, especially if they happen to be future partners."
"And from this point of view, the report is right to condemn the bombing of Kendakor by the Turkish air force and to highlight and reiterate the Turkish Government's obligation to support negotiations between Turkish and Greek Cypriots without preliminary conditions."
"What is worrying is that Turkish officials and the Turkish press seems to be taking a reactionary stand, rather than encouraging Turkey to move in this direction."
"I trust that Turkey will start to take a more serious view of things and understand just what its obligations are."
"Mr President, it is a matter of regret that our debate today has been marred by a small cluster of hostile amendments. These have been put forward by the TDI, GUE et al."
"I find them unseemly, ill-advised, untimely and inappropriate because these are amendments which use three words - ""genocide"", ""Muslim"" and ""Asian"" - in a way that is racist, derogatory and discriminatory and which causes impenetrable and false barriers to be erected against Turkey's accession to the Union."
"Muslims follow one of the three Abrahaminic faiths."
"Islam is the brother of Christianity and Judaism."
"""Asian"", in this context, is used as a racist term to be deplored and dropped."
"As regards genocide: Turkey is not responsible for the Armenian massacre."
"If we accept that, do we then place all of the Ottoman Empire's crimes against humanity at modern Turkey's door?"
"Indeed, the UN Convention of 1948 has not been broadened to include the Armenian tragedy."
"Until that happens I do not think this Parliament should act differently."
"I welcome Turkey's careful progress towards the Union and I support the Commission and the Morillon report."
"Turkey' s accession to the European Union is an issue that has become even more topical."
"Unlike some others, I am not stirring up the religious argument in order to put off this prospect."
"This cannot, however, be just a formality."
"I am thinking, instead, of acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide of 1915."
"In the country currently holding the Presidency of the European Union, the French National Senate recently at last proclaimed this significant act of public recognition, two and a half years after the French National Assembly."
"Acknowledging this act of genocide does not mean that the present-day Turkey is a barbaric nation."
"Quite the contrary, a nation only grows in stature by facing up to its past."
"How could Europe maintain its credibility with regard to the state violence perpetrated in the world today, even, at times, including genocide, if it were to embrace Turkey as a Member while brushing aside its history?"
"Furthermore, the ongoing denial and repression of the Kurdish people is as appalling as it is unacceptable."
"The Turkish parliamentarian, Leyla Zana, winner of the Sakharov Prize, and in prison since 1995 merely for haven spoken in Kurdish within the Turkish Parliament, is still languishing in prison."
"These are facts that the European Parliament has highlighted on a number of occasions. There is no justification for our omitting them today."
"Mr President, Paragraph 17 of Mr Morillon' s report states that the European Parliament 'calls on the Turkish Government to withdraw its occupation forces from northern Cyprus' ."
"I am myself the author of this wording in the form of Amendment 72, adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on 10 October 2000."
"I should particularly like to address Mr Verheugen, as the Commissioner with responsibility for enlargement, and also the French Presidency."
"Almost 40 per cent of Cyprus is occupied by foreign troops in the form of Turkish soldiers."
"Eleven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Nicosia is now Europe' s only divided capital."
"Historically, Cyprus - the island of Saint Paul and Saint Barnabas - has not previously been divided, but has now been so for 26 years due to a foreign invasion."
"The EU' s four freedoms cannot be applied to the whole of Cyprus following the partition."
"Is it possible for Turkey to begin membership negotiations at all without the four freedoms' being applied in Cyprus?"
"Must not Nicosia become a united city and Cyprus a united country?"
"Must not the occupying troops be withdrawn?"
"Previous speakers referred to the genocide in Armenia."
"This took place only 24 years before Hitler' s time and before the Second World War, when Hitler began the annihilation of the Jews."
"He himself referred to this genocide as if it were something forgotten."
"Turkey must come to terms with the truth."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Morillon has made a comment under Recital D in his report which should, I think, play an important role in this debate."
"Mr Morillon says that Turkey should try not to perceive the European Union as an exclusive Christian club which wants to keep it, Turkey, out."
"This premise presupposes that the opposite holds true within the European Union, i.e. that we are not an exclusive Christian club which wants, can or should exclude Turkey on relativistic religious or cultural grounds."
"The premise should be that a country with a laicistic constitution inhabited predominantly by Moslems which is based on the values on which the European Union itself is founded - i.e. freedom, equality and tolerance - could enrich the European Union."
"The European Union is not founded on religious values, it is founded on values which we owe to the Enlightenment and which, quite independently of the religious leanings of a person or a country and its inhabitants, find their way into the constitutions of the Member States and, as we have seen during today's debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, into the EU's perception of fundamental rights."
"This means that, as a democratic state under the rule of law with separation of powers and fundamental values as we understand them, Turkey will enrich the European Union."
"At the same time, however, it is clear from Mr Morillon's report that Turkey is nowhere near meeting these demands."
"The Copenhagen criteria are, admittedly, economic criteria, but they are also criteria which are centred around precisely these points."
"The question is, how far have tolerance, democratic rule of law, separation of powers and respect for the separation of powers been put into practice in Turkey?"
"And the answer is, as Mr Morillon's report makes clear, not far enough."
"Too little progress has been made and Turkey must do better."
"Mr President, this debate is not about how the European Union will integrate into Turkey; it is about how Turkey will integrate into the European Union."
"I agree with that entirely and I think that the report by the honourable Member shows how this can be achieved."
"I should therefore like to turn to the Commissioner and the President-in-Office and ask them, given their level of support for the Morillon report - as they themselves have said -, why they were so lacking in inspiration and loath to include in the accession partnership which they formulated issues such as the Kurds, the Cyprus question and peaceful, non-threatening coexistence with Turkey's neighbouring countries, issues which have been left out of the basic debate with Turkey."
"As far as the Armenian genocide is concerned I fully agree that it should not be a precondition to Turkey's accession."
"However, the debate here is about what we have to say and what we remember."
"Turkey will become an essentially democratic country once it learns to live with its past, just as democratic Germany has learned to live with its past - we asked the same of it."
"Mr President, I should like to offer General Morillon my warmest congratulations on his report, in which he has combined perceptiveness with clarity."
"In addition to explaining how far Turkey is from complying with the Copenhagen criteria, Mr Morillon also lists and enumerates what additional conditions Turkey must meet."
"They include the Cyprus question, the role of the Turkish army, especially the national security council, the all-powerful position of which is out of keeping with the principle of democracy, the Kurdish question, which is of paramount importance, and last but not least, the virulent conflict with Greece which Turkey must endeavour to defuse."
"Commissioner Verheugen has explained to the House that, first and foremost, the political criteria must be met."
"As you all know, our group was highly sceptical about Turkey's candidate status but we are delighted, now that Turkey has candidate status, that it is on the ball and has decided to engage in a process of reform in order to meet the demands of the European Union."
"Turkey is being responsible."
"I should like to mention a number of economic criteria, such as the high rate of inflation which was over 100% and which is still over 50%, the high national debt as the result of the strain on the national budget from military expenditure and the military conflict with the PKK, high real interest rates, the continuing predominance of the public sector, huge regional differences in Turkey, a prosperity differential within Turkey of 1:10, which the European Union will never be able to bring under control, different educational qualifications, illiteracy, which still affects 27.6% of women, i.e. problems which Turkey itself must resolve."
"The optimism of people such as deputy prime minister Mesut Yilmaz, who believes that the Maastricht criteria will be met as early as 2002, is to my mind exaggerated."
"Turkey must know that it has embarked on a difficult journey, that it will have to give up its sovereignty and will have to exert itself."
"We want to support it on this journey, not obstruct it and, above all, we want to keep our financial promises."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to speak in this debate in my capacity as the author of the report on the accession of Cyprus."
"Since both Turkey and Cyprus are candidates for membership of the European Union, it is increasingly clear that a solution to the Cypriot question is becoming a matter of internal policy."
"Commission Verheugen has confirmed that the Cyprus issue plays a very important part in the discussions currently being conducted with Turkey."
"Given the political and military presence of Turkey in the northern part of the island of Cyprus, this could not fail to be the case."
"Our rapporteur, Mr Morillon, deserves our congratulations for stipulating that a solution to the Cyprus problem must be one of the preconditions for Turkey' s accession."
"'It is hard to understand today,' he writes, 'how it can remain divided by a wall, while in many other places such walls have crumbled over the past decade.'"
"In order for this outdated wall to be brought down, it is now essential for Turkey to comply with the Security Council resolutions requiring it to withdraw its occupying forces from the northern part of the island."
"Paragraph 17 of our motion for a resolution explicitly calls for this."
"It is high time that Turkey listened to the Turkish Cypriots, the great majority of whom wish to overcome the divisions of the past and join Europe alongside the Greek citizens of Cyprus."
"If, on the other hand, Turkey continues to fuel the separatist, even annexationist impulses of the unofficial government of northern Cyprus, then it will be responsible for causing the proximity talks to fail."
"In the medium term, an attitude of this kind would be an insurmountable obstacle to Turkey' s accession."
"One of the three conditions stipulated in the Morillon report, a condition that the European Parliament will be adopting, would still remain unfulfilled."
"Once the Ankara Government has understood that the status quo is not acceptable to Europe or to the rest of the world, then considerable progress may be made: the island may be reunified, and a fair and lasting global settlement may be achieved tomorrow in compliance with international law."
"Mr President, there is much in this resolution on Turkey's progress towards accession which is commendable - in particular the call to the Commission to implement a properly resourced pre-accession strategy."
"But where is the real welcome for the Helsinki decision to accord Turkey candidate status?"
"Where is the recognition in the resolution of the remarkable efforts, and I quote here from the explanatory statement that accompanied the resolution, 'the remarkable efforts that Turkey is making to adapt its structures to EU requirements'?"
"In fact what a pity that Turkey was not discussed during the wider enlargement debate in the context of the other candidate countries."
"Of course peoples of Kurdish origins as well as other cultural and linguistic minorities must not be subjected to political, economic or other discrimination and must have the opportunity to express themselves freely, but this expression should be through entirely peaceful means and without intimidation and terrorism."
"We should remember that the removal of Turkey from the western orbit was a prime objective of Soviet policy throughout the Cold War period and that the PKK was supported as an instrument of this policy."
"Where is the demand in this resolution that the representatives of minorities should renounce violence?"
"Civil peace is a prerequisite for investment and economic progress."
"Terrorism has been a barrier to such progress."
"We should also be clear that the resolution of extraordinarily difficult problems such as Cyprus, which requires the assent of all the people of Cyprus, will not be helped by frustrating Turkish progress towards accession."
"After all Turkey, along with Greece and the United Kingdom, is one of the guarantor powers in relation to Cyprus."
"I detect increasing nervousness in this Parliament about the potential impact of the accession of Turkey on the Union."
"I might say there is increasing nervousness among the citizens of many of the current Member States about the pace and intensity of political integration within the EU and the leftist thread which runs through the fabric of this development and is increasingly visible."
"How much more desirable and acceptable would be the goal of a looser community of nation-states trading freely and acting in unison over a limited range of policy areas and how much easier it would then be to accommodate a country such as Turkey."
"Mr President, we cannot vote in favour of the Morillon report due because we are convinced that, contrary to what is being maintained and what many people in Turkey hope, the accession process will not improve the standard of living of the people."
"On the contrary, it will make it worse."
"The real purpose of the report finds expression in the draft resolution, with its references to Turkey's gross domestic product, the high level of trade with the European Union and the anti-grass roots, liberal, economic reforms to accelerate privatisation and strengthen the bases of a free market economy which the Turkish Grand National Assembly has passed at the request of the International Monetary Fund."
"The enthusiasm with which the resolution welcomes Turkey's intention to commit military capabilities under the common security and defence policy is in keeping with the general tone of the report."
"In other words, we are talking about increasing the degree to which Turkey is subject to the economic, political and military objectives of big business in the European Union."
"We have not, of course, overlooked the positive references in the resolution, such as the reference to human rights, despite the fact that it mistakes manipulation of the status quo for progress and ignores the 10,000-15,000 political prisoners."
"There are also positive references to Cyprus, with the call for the occupying forces to be withdrawn, to the need to implement the decisions of the European court, as in the Loïzidou case, to the need for a political solution to the Kurdish question and to the bombings in Iraq."
"But we are afraid that, yet again, they are no more than a wish list."
"Why is none of this included in the European Commission's report?"
"For us, the basic issue is this: despite numerous allegations to the contrary, not only has Turkey failed to improve the standard of living of its people, in certain sectors it has made it worse since customs union in 1995 and the declaration of candidate status in 1999."
"There can be no doubt that the accession process and accession itself will reduce their quality of life, especially in the economic and social sectors."
"There can likewise be no doubt that any funding which it receives will be used to strengthen its oppressive instruments and encourage the regime to continue with its present policy."
"Besides, we fail to recognise the sovereign circles of the European Union as defenders of human rights."
"Their actions to date have proven the contrary, which is precisely why our feelings of solidarity with the people of Turkey force us to oppose its accession and, by extension, the reports which advocate it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as several Members of this Parliament have pointed out today, the path to Turkey' s accession to the European Union will be long and hard."
"A number of speakers have expressed their concerns regarding the human rights situation and the treatment of minorities, particularly the Kurdish question, the heavy involvement of the military in political life, the legal system and capital punishment, all of which are very serious issues."
"We can but share these concerns, which were duly expressed by the Commission in its last annual report."
"At the same time, however, I feel we must not paint the situation blacker than it actually is."
"Progress has been made and encouraging signs can be seen."
"The Turkish Government has announced a whole raft of reforms. President Sezer has made a personal commitment to the process of modernisation in his country."
"I therefore think we must encourage the Turkish authorities to forge ahead in order to achieve the necessary compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria."
"At the same time, we must continue to be vigilant with regard to the actual implementation of the measures that have been announced."
"This, it seems to me, is precisely the balance advocated by Mr Morillon' s report."
"The strategy adopted in Helsinki last December marked a turning point in relations between the European Union and Turkey."
"It is within this balanced framework that we shall have to resolutely continue our work to promote rapprochement between the European Union and Turkey."
"So, in conclusion, let me say: let us be demanding, let us be vigilant, let us set our terms but, let us not be excessive in our demands, as we too must live up to our commitments and the European Union made an important decision in Helsinki."
"Mr President, I should like to close the debate by pointing out that there is, of course, a link between the Commission report on the progress that has been made, or not made, in Turkey and the accession partnership."
"Several speakers have criticised the fact that the Commission failed to address certain problems."
"I can only assume that these speakers have not read the report, because all the problems referred to here, which the Commission allegedly failed to address, are dealt with in the report."
"Nor is it correct to say that the Kurdish problem was not called by its name."
"Where the report talks about the Kurdish language, Kurdish culture, Kurdish settlements, Kurdish parties, it calls them Kurdish."
"Anyone who says that the concept or the word ""Kurdish"" does not occur has obviously not read the report."
"I must defend myself against the impression created here that the terminology of the 2000 report differs from that of the 1999 report."
"It does not."
"What is new is the accession partnership, and the accession partnership contains a very important stipulation: that the candidate country must deal with all the issues addressed in the progress report."
"In other words there is an internal link here."
"The accession partnership per se is a very balanced document, based largely on the Helsinki conclusions."
"Allow me to correct the erroneous impression, which one or two speakers are clearly under, that it is already a fact of life."
"We are at the proposal stage and I am not in a position this afternoon to tell you if this project will get beyond the proposal stage, especially if Parliament endorses proposals made here this morning and this afternoon."
"It is not my place to give Parliament advice or to criticise - nor shall I do so."
"My place is simply to point out any consequences which the decision may have."
"If you deal with the Armenian question in connection with the EU report - please read my lips: the Armenian question in connection with accession to the EU, then the project which we have discussed today will simply never get off the ground."
"If the Helsinki conclusions on resolving the Cyprus question are changed along the lines called for by some speakers in the House, i.e. that accession should depend upon resolving the Cyprus question, the project will again founder."
"We changed precisely this last year with the backing of a large majority in the European Parliament."
"We have said in the past that it is not a condition and all we can demand of Turkey is for it to do its best, in all earnestness, to find a solution."
"However, we must never forget that it will take two sides to resolve this issue, not just one."
"That is why you cannot demand more of Turkey than serious, constructive, credible effort and you can only demand that a solution be found by those who have made resolving the problem their overall objective."
"Finally, I feel that I should again point out that we made Turkey an offer with the Helsinki strategy."
"What we now need is to take the first step of the Helsinki strategy and I think it is unfair to evaluate this strategy as if it had already failed, even though the first step has yet to be taken."
"What we need now is to take the first step and it is your responsibility, as members of the European Parliament, to decide whether or not we can do so."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Euro-Mediterranean conferences in Marseilles"
"The next item is the oral questions to the Council (B5-0551/2000) and to the Commission (B5-0552/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the Euro-Mediterranean conferences in Marseilles in November 2000."
"The author of the questions - Mr Brok - would normally take the floor first, but he is in a meeting with the President and is on his way."
"As we are so short of time, would Mr Moscovici mind replying to the question before it is formally put, because he knows the content of the question?"
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I shall have to give my answer before Mr Brok returns from his meeting with the President because I myself will presently have to attend a meeting with the President. We are obliged to do this because of a very heavy schedule."
"I should like to thank Mr Brok for allowing me to give an assessment of the current state of the European Union' s Mediterranean policy since this is, as you know, the eve of the Fourth Conference of Foreign Ministers from the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, which is to be held in Marseilles."
"You will be aware of the importance the French Presidency attaches to enhancing the Mediterranean aspect of the European Union' s external relations. Indeed it has made this one of the priorities of its term in office."
"It is, moreover, the reason for our insistence on drawing up an assessment of the results of the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process, in order to be in a position, in Marseilles, to establish the necessary guidelines."
"Commissioner Patten, whom I must welcome, expressed some interesting avenues for investigation in this respect in his communication on reinvigorating the Barcelona process."
"Mr Brok referred to the common strategy on the Mediterranean Region, adopted in Feira in June."
"This was an important and useful contribution."
"This, however, unlike the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which unites the Fifteen Member States with twelve partners on the southern coast of the Mediterranean, is an instrument for discipline within the Union, to some extent, designed to intensify the coherence and coordination of all Community instruments and Member State policies with regard to the Mediterranean region."
"Priorities for the implementation of this common strategy have already been established by the Presidency and were presented to the Council of Ministers in September."
"The Presidency strove particularly to identify areas on which the European Union and its partners of the southern Mediterranean should concentrate their efforts in order to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process, particularly by intensifying political and economic dialogue, improving the effectiveness of Community aid, the implementation of sub-regional cooperation and South-South integration, and even intensifying initiatives in the field of justice and home affairs."
"This is indeed also our objective for the Marseilles Conference."
"In the course of the two days of the meeting, the Presidency aims to succeed in giving a new impetus to the process, with everyone on board."
"There is probably no need for me to outline in detail the political background of this conference, but I very sincerely believe that the current problems in the Middle East make this Euro-Mediterranean dialogue more essential than ever."
"The fact that the situation in the Middle East is difficult at present is not, therefore, a reason to lower our ambitions for the Marseilles conference."
"I am not, of course, saying that the current situation will have no impact on our meeting."
"I am thinking in particular of the Charter for Peace and Stability, which was discussed at great length among the 27 partners, but whose adoption probably calls for a regional environment where peace has been established."
"Mr Brok, who has now rejoined us, asked questions specifically about the delays noted in negotiations."
"Should we really use the term 'delay' ?"
"It is true that discussions have been lengthy and occasionally delicate, but I would say that this is understandable, considering the political context in the Middle East."
"The main thing, in my view, is that work is going forward and that the project is not being abandoned."
"In this respect, I believe that the 27 partners are resolved to adopt this text as soon as circumstances permit."
"Let us not forget that the Barcelona Process is a recent development, only five years old."
"Indeed, when we instigated the partnership in 1995, we were aware that we were undertaking a long-term project."
"There was plainly nothing easy about the task of bringing together, overnight, 27 partners as diverse as this against an often tense, and occasionally more than tense political background and within a framework as original as the Barcelona arrangement."
"Yet, we have managed to maintain dialogue even on occasionally sensitive subjects: stability, terrorism, emigration and human rights, for example."
"You may rest assured that we fully intend to continue in this way."
"Cooperation in the field of politics and security, known as the 'first aspect' of the Barcelona process is essential, even though we know it is the most sensitive and the longest to implement."
"There are also, however, the other 'aspects' of Barcelona, the economic and financial aspect on the one hand, and the social, cultural and human aspect on the other."
"This, indeed, leads me to highlight a fundamental principle of the European Union' s Mediterranean policy, and I shall thereby be giving a direct answer to Mr Brok' s question."
"I would like to raise the subject of the overall approach of the process of the parallel, balanced development of these three aspects, which underpins the spirit and originality of Barcelona, something we must preserve."
"And even if it is true that the economic aspect of Barcelona is the one that, despite the delays, is working best, the main thing is that we must not lose sight of this overall approach, without which the process would be consigned to being nothing more than just another free trade area, lacking in political or human vision in the long term and this would be unfortunate."
"Our Mediterranean partners are our direct neighbours."
"We have a great deal in common with them, a shared heritage, culture, trade and interests."
"Finally, as Mr Brok emphasised, we have common challenges, which we must meet together in order to deal with racism, intolerance and xenophobia."
"Great prospects are opening up, too, for cooperation in the areas of combating trafficking of all sorts, migration and enhancing the rule of law."
"We Europeans have experience that we can profitably share."
"It is furthermore in our own interests to support our partners in their process of structural reforms, upgrading and opening up their economies to competition."
"In Marseilles, therefore, this new impetus we wish to give the process must be based on all its political and economic components which are, let me reiterate, complementary and inextricably interlinked."
"It is true that the Barcelona process and the partnership are ambitious projects requiring resources appropriate to the allotted objectives."
"Mr Brok mentioned financial resources."
"They are, of course, never sufficient."
"The challenges are such, the needs of the southern countries are so great that the resources of the European Union will always appear to be inadequate, especially since the external commitments of the Union have increased to an extraordinary degree in the last few years."
"This is a debate which, as you know, we have had several times in the Council; a debate which I think I can say lies at the heart of the reform undertaken on the initiative of Commissioner Patten."
"The fact remains that the Council, particularly since 1995, has striven to allocate more extensive resources to the Mediterranean region, appropriate to the challenges of the partnership."
"Since 1995 the French Presidency has made particular efforts in this regard, especially at the European Council in Cannes, where we succeeded in restoring balance between the funding for Mediterranean policy and that properly allocated to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"This is the spirit in which the MEDA I programme was launched with EUR 3.4 billion committed between 1995 and 1999."
"The multiannual total must now be established for the period 2000-2006, and I can only hope - although I cannot put a figure on it at this stage - that it will match up to the ambitions of the European Union in its Mediterranean policy."
"You are aware that we are attempting at this very moment to reach an agreement between the fifteen Member States, if necessary by holding an Extraordinary Council meeting tomorrow in Marseilles."
"We have already managed to agree on the arrangements for the MEDA II financial regulation."
"I feel that the instrument we shall have in future will be more effective, more speedy, more transparent and therefore, ultimately, more credible."
"The programme' s administration will be simplified, and the rate of reimbursement and payment will be accelerated."
"Furthermore, there are still the EIB loans, which are essential to the development of our partner countries, particularly its major infrastructure projects."
"I feel that with an allocation of several billion euros for the Mediterranean region over the period 2000-2007, we shall be in a position to fulfil the expectations of our partner countries in the South over the next few years, and that is crucial."
"Today, on the eve of Marseilles, the French Presidency naturally wishes to see the European Union' s Mediterranean priority confirmed, including in financial terms."
"In fact, it is no longer just a matter, as it was in 1995, of restoring balance with Eastern Europe, but also of making ready for the future enlargement of the European Union."
"Let us not forget that Barcelona, like the rest of the European Union' s external relations, forms an integral part of the acquis communautaire and that therefore the candidate countries should make preparations for seeing the Mediterranean countries as privileged partners, since they are the privileged partners of this Europe of ours."
"This is a major challenge for the Europe of the future, whose centre of gravity will, indeed, be shifting towards the East of the continent, but this need not happen at the expense of relations with the South."
"In our opinion, this is one more reason to emphasise the Mediterranean dimension of a European Union that wishes to be an actor on the world stage and for which the Mediterranean region must and shall continue to be the 'uniting sea' or in Latin the 'mare nostrum' ."
"Mr President, it is a sign of the President-in-Office's competence that he has answered questions which I have not even asked."
"I should like expressly to thank the French Presidency of the Council for endeavouring to give the necessary momentum to the Barcelona process."
"This is a hugely important issue and I say that as someone who comes from central Europe."
"We in central Europe must understand that the debate on the Barcelona process is in our common interest, just as we expect southern Europeans to understand that enlargement to central and eastern Europe is in our common interest."
"If we look at it from this point of view and take account of all this, then we will be on the right and a reasonable path."
"What we are trying to do is to enlarge the European Union on one side and foster good neighbourly relations on the other."
"Both are in our common interest and the European Union is prepared to put its hand in its pocket for both."
"Of course, we will have to raise the question of how we are to continue funding the overall process, given the current financial perspectives and taking account of our policy in the Balkans, because there has been doubt for some time as to whether we will be able to last the course."
"Naturally, we hope that Mr Patten's concept will succeed and that the Commission will be able to implement these projects more quickly than has been the case in the past."
"It is of paramount importance that we understand the advantages of the Barcelona process, i.e. that, with our help, it will trigger the economic and social development needed in these countries, giving prospects to the people living in these regions."
"It also has something to do with preventing emigration."
"In the long run, social need should no longer be a reason - as in the European Union - to emigrate from anywhere in the Mediterranean and the desire to emigrate should be motivated by other considerations."
"I think we should help to bring this about."
"With proper economic and social prospects in place, there is a good chance of implementing human rights and democratising the community of states in the region."
"All this is obviously immensely important to us from the point of view of security policy."
"In other words, this is not just a chance for more trade and commerce, it is security policy par excellence and this is the message which we need to get across to our citizens if this process is to gain acceptance."
"Xenophobia and national and other forms of terrorism come under this heading and I hope that we shall have a chance to straighten things out here too."
"The worrying developments which we have witnessed in many states in North Africa in the past and, in fact, are still witnessing today, also come under this heading and I hope that we shall manage to bring all the countries of North Africa on board in this process without any whys and wherefores."
"The current situation in the Middle East is making abundantly clear what measures are needed in the form of joint policies and cooperation."
"I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my hope that neither of the two parties to the present conflict in the Middle East will take any unilateral action this week which might make a return to the negotiating table nigh impossible in coming weeks."
"We should try and help to give the people of Palestine the chance to decide their own fate, forge their own future and build their own state on the basis of agreement with and the security of the state of Israel."
"I trust that the European Union will prepare in Marseilles to push the Mediterranean process forward and that we will be able once again to take joint responsibility for what Mr Moscovici rightly called the mare nostrum."
"The Mediterranean is the mare nostrum; the three great monotheistic religions, two of which are now involved in conflict, developed along its shores."
"We must get back round the table on this very fundamental basis."
"I think that the European Union has a special role to play here and that the countries and the people in these regions are waiting for the European Union to exert its political influence because it can bring balance and credibility to bear there."
"I trust that the fact that this political influence is expected and we are expected to play a part there will help to get things moving in Marseilles and provide the necessary credibility, allowing us to make a contribution to peace in this region and enhance our own stability."
"Mr President, there is as you know a saying in English that when the star does not appear in a show it is rather like a performance of Hamlet without the first grave digger."
"In the temporary, but wholly understandable, absence of my honourable friend at the beginning of this debate I was tempted to say that this would be like Hamlet without the prince, but I am delighted that he is with us in order to contribute his wisdom and good sense to this extremely important debate which is taking place at the honourable Member's initiative."
"As the Minister said a moment ago, the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Marseilles this week takes place against the background of the persisting crisis in the Middle East peace process."
"We had all hoped that the circumstances would be a great deal better, and they almost were a great deal better."
"Many of us were delighted, even surprised, by the extent of the progress which seemed to have been made this summer at Camp David and we gave a great deal of applause to President Clinton and his administration for all they had done to move things forward."
"We came so close, which makes the difficulties, the tragedy of recent weeks, all the more sad."
"With the agency reports this morning and this afternoon the news continues to be grim."
"The current difficulties should encourage us to redouble our efforts to promote cooperation in the Euro-Mediterranean framework."
"Nobody would seek to deny that the Barcelona process and the Middle East peace process are interconnected."
"The breakthrough in Euro-Mediterranean relations at Barcelona was made possible partly by the breakthrough at Madrid and then the Oslo Accords."
"It is also true that setbacks in the pre-peace process have slowed down the progress of Barcelona."
"That is a fact that, alas, we have to live with. But we should not forget that the Barcelona process has progressed over five years."
"This has happened despite all the difficulties in the Middle East."
"One thing is abundantly plain."
"We must not allow the Barcelona process to become a hostage to the Middle East peace process."
"Barcelona has its own momentum."
"It has its own objectives which remain wholly valid."
"We all have an interest in demonstrating both resilience and ambition in Marseilles this week."
"The Commission has been encouraged by the generally positive reaction to the proposals that we set out on reinvigorating the Barcelona process, both in the European Union and among the Mediterranean partners."
"Perhaps I can just touch on some of the main elements in the strategic approach we have suggested that I hope will meet some agreement at Marseilles."
"Firstly, speeding up negotiation and ratification of the association agreements."
"First of all with Egypt but also Algeria, Syria and Lebanon."
"We in fact completed our negotiations with Egypt almost 18 months ago and I wish that we could now rapidly proceed to initialling the agreement and then in due course to full signature."
"I would also like to see us commencing more serious negotiations on association agreements with the other countries."
"We put forward the argument that we should tackle the sensitive issue of agricultural trade."
"We should review, in our judgment, what needs to be done to ensure that the agreements are fully WTO compatible by the end of the transitional period."
"We argue for enhancing south-south trade by encouraging the signature of free trade agreements between the partners."
"In this context the Commission undertakes to provide technical assistance on crucial items such as rules of origin and customs matters."
"We want to see the bringing together of policies on single market issues and agreement to introduce cumulation of origin side-by-side with the sub-regional free trade arrangements for all partners entering into free trade with each other and adopting the harmonised protocol on rules of origin."
"We also want to see an increase in the attractiveness of the region to investors."
"In addition to economic reforms, the newly created networks of cooperation among investment promotion agencies and among employers' federations will help, as should the introduction of a new regional risk capital facility."
"Reaching agreement on a new regional programme on justice and home affairs covering migration in the widest sense, the fight against organised crime and cooperation on judicial matters is another subject on which we hope we can have a good exchange of views."
"Then there is the issue which I know we had many opportunities of debating in this Chamber: that of improving the delivery of MEDA."
"The revision of the MEDA regulation and the reform already announced of the Commission's external aid system will help to achieve this and will also lead to more human resources being available."
"By decentralising the delivery of aid, we shall involve partners much more in all stages of policy formulation and implementation."
"We all have an interest in ensuring that MEDA is tightly focused on the right objectives."
"We intend to do that through a close dialogue with partners at all stages."
"But there is no escaping the fact that the partners who have faced up to the challenges inherent in the association process are the ones who should get most support."
"As far as human rights are concerned, we propose a structural approach looking at the performance of countries over time."
"But here again we should be frank."
"A country which has serious doubts raised about its record on human rights, democracy and the rule of law and is not prepared to discuss these matters transparently will not find it easy to fit into the new world pattern and it will be less likely to prosper in the longer term."
"I just want to say one more thing about MEDA and the reform of our external aid which is relevant to debates which Members are having elsewhere."
"In order to ensure that we deliver more rapidly in the Mediterranean and elsewhere in the world, we need - as Members accept rationally and intellectually - more resources to actually manage our programmes and the Commission has put forward what are sensible proposals for doing that."
"There are some Members who think that we should put those extra resources into the reserve until we have accomplished certain other objectives."
"I say to Members of Parliament, in all good faith, that there comes a moment when you have to trust us and when you have to let us try to do the job, because we cannot conceivably implement our plans more effectively if the people we need to manage them are not made amiable until we have actually demonstrated that we can manage things more effectively."
"It is a crazy situation to put us in so I beg all honourable Members who have any influence on these matters to recognise that, if we are to be serious about the reform process, then you have to give us the opportunity to demonstrate whether we can be as good as our word or not."
"If we cannot we will have to take the consequences, and the Commissioner for External Affairs will have to take the consequences in due course, but do not put us in a position in which the ends are willed but you do not give us the means until after we have demonstrated that we can achieve the ends."
"It makes no sort of sense whatsoever."
"It is an issue which is extremely important to all the Mediterranean countries and I hope I will be able to assure them this week that it is our firm intention to do a great deal better in the delivery of our programmes in future."
"I hope that all the Ministers who gather in Marseilles will recognise the need to agree on this set of realistic proposals to reinvigorate the Barcelona process precisely now that the Middle East is suffering serious difficulties."
"I will be glad to inform Parliament about the results of the Marseilles meeting at the earliest possible opportunity."
"We have committed in the past huge resources to this partnership."
"We have not managed them as well as we should have done but we have committed huge resources and that reflects the priority which Parliament, the Commission and the Council give to strengthening the partnership around our ""middle sea""."
"In the next few years the success of that partnership will be even more important than ever and I hope that, at Marseilles this week and in subsequent weeks, we manage to ensure that this whole enterprise has even more impulse and energy in it than it has had in the past."
"Mr President, five years on from the Barcelona Conference, it is time to take stock of the situation."
"Last March, the European Parliament approved a resolution which made a critical analysis of the policies and instruments of the Partnership, proposing some substantial changes."
"In June 2000, the Feira Council adopted a common Mediterranean strategy and, after proposing and obtaining endorsement for reform of the Meda regulation, the Commission recently tabled a document on reinvigorating the Barcelona Process."
"All this shows that we are aware of how inadequate the results achieved thus far have been, although I feel that the responses are not yet sufficient to deal with the situation, even though it is true that five years are certainly not a very long time over which to judge such complex processes."
"Nevertheless, the process which commenced in Barcelona, based on three pillars - political, economic and cultural - was subject to three constraints, now generally well recognised, and Commissioner Patten touched upon them in his speech."
"The first concerned the preference shown for free trade, which is linked to the process of economic and commercial liberalisation in terms of codevelopment, economic integration, social policies, cultural dialogue and the training and enhancement of human resources."
"The second constraint concerned the type of relationship there should be between the European Union and the Mediterranean partner countries."
"In fact, we observe that the still-prevailing bilateral dimension, which is anything but easy to negotiate and takes a long time to ratify, is in danger of increasingly shaping the economies of these countries on the basis of their trade with the Union, hampering the development of the south-south dimension, especially because of the partner countries' difficulty in establishing mutual cooperative relations."
"The third constraint concerns the regrettable involvement of the European and Mediterranean civil societies in this process, which is still too dominated by centralism and the almost exclusive role of the governments."
"I have stressed these aspects because they contain the key to reinvigorating the Process, and the enhancement of the Barcelona political agenda must be added to all this."
"It is, in fact, inconceivable that the agricultural policy, the control of migration flows and the debt should not be at the centre of the Euro-Mediterranean project now."
"As regards agriculture, I would like to point out that Parliament has undertaken to organise a conference next spring."
"Moreover, the tragic interruption of the Middle East Peace Process is changing the situation in the region."
"Unfortunately, the European Union had based its entire policy upon the success of the Oslo Accords."
"In fact, the Council's common strategy followed this line."
"On the other hand, the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference, which is to open tomorrow in Marseilles, is set against the backdrop of a tragic situation which will make Europe's role in the region even more sensitive and lead the Union to assume a more substantial political role in the Israel-Palestine conflict."
"The fact that, despite this situation, the 27 partners have confirmed their willingness to meet in Marseilles, at least for the moment, is already in itself an indication that all is not lost, although I agree entirely with Commissioner Patten that the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership policy must not become a hostage to the peace process."
"In fact, I will go further and say that, in the past, the peace process has served as an excuse for both Europe and for the Mediterranean partners not to be more courageous."
"This is why I feel that the debate taking place today could serve to make us aware that this policy is of key importance for the entire Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we would firstly like to congratulate our colleague Mr Brok on his initiative in promoting this debate before the meeting in Marseilles begins."
"As Commissioner Patten indicated, it is clear that the lack of consolidated peace in the Middle East is distorting the whole process that was outlined at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference and, in particular, the appropriate and correct application of the MEDA funds."
"The Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party obviously supports the Commission' s actions in favour of a Mediterranean policy, as outlined five years ago in Barcelona, and we want it to be consolidated."
"A few days ago, in Barcelona, at various meetings of the Círculo de Economía, the Secretary General of the Council, Mr Solana, told us that the priorities for European external activity are firstly with our neighbours, and our closest neighbours are the Mediterraneans."
"And we are not forgetting that the source of potential conflicts that we have in the medium term, due to demographic change, inequality of income, changing expectations and cultural differences, is also there."
"Our priority must therefore be to ensure the peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean and we have to make every possible effort to achieve this cooperation and to ensure that the funds allocated are used efficiently, according to what we might call the selfish generosity of the European Union."
"We have to be generous towards the Mediterranean, but from a selfish point of view, which is to safeguard the stability that we need so much for the people of the European Union, and for European society."
"Mr President, we presented the MEDA report at the beginning of September, and while this report, admittedly, allowed us to note some shortcomings, it was also, more importantly, an opportunity to proclaim loud and clear the determination of both this House and the Commission in Euro-Mediterranean matters."
"Commissioner Patten, I read your article in today' s issue of Le Monde."
"I concur completely with it."
"What Mr Moscovici has just said is precisely what you stated yourself."
"The fact, moreover, that we carried the motion in this House, with the enormous majority of 502 votes in favour and a paltry 17 against, shows that we are all unanimously in favour of renewing and boosting the Euro-Mediterranean Process."
"There are a number of points I would like to clarify, now that the Marseilles Conference is about to take place, in order to ensure that we get some answers, as it is not enough to repeat ritualistic phrases, given that we are all in agreement."
"We also need to take practical action and to get specific answers."
"Indeed, on Thursday evening, I assessed the situation with Mr Josselin, the French Minister responsible for these matters, and I know that the French Presidency is wholeheartedly behind the idea of promoting the process as we see it."
"I should like, first of all, to discuss the budget."
"Where do matters stand in this respect?"
"We have been told that roughly EUR 8 billion have been earmarked for the period 2000-2006, but this amount seems to fluctuate."
"So what, in the end, is the budget for 2001?"
"It seems that at least EUR 1 billion is needed annually, but for the moment this sum has not been allocated, and at the same time there is talk of EUR 200 million to be taken, supposedly, from the margin relating to appropriations for Kosovo and Serbia."
"It is far from clear."
"We do not need to create competition between all these various needs but to find new resources."
"I am in complete agreement with Commission Patten that, in order to do a proper practical job, the appropriations must be made available."
"I strenuously urge all my fellow Members to set aside the appropriations needed for us to be able to take action and to be able to consider the projects."
"Secondly, I should like to point out that we must give a boost to decentralised cooperation, which seems to be in a bad way."
"This is a major concern of local communities and non-governmental organisations."
"The forum that was held in Marseilles on 12 November made that quite clear."
"Next, we must increase the amount of appropriations for regional development in order to encourage relations and trade between regions, but also environmental protection, the fight against terrorism and drugs trafficking, emigration and integration, and to make progress towards human rights, as we have requested."
"We would ask what action the Commission intends to take in order to invite proposals for projects, with the involvement of civil society, and in order to process and monitor these projects."
"These are the important practical questions I wished to ask, and I should like to thank Mr Brok for allowing us to have this debate just before the Presidency and the Commission are due to discuss these issues."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I share the determination which has been expressed to give a new boost to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership forthwith."
"Even those behind the Barcelona process consider that it has broken down - that is the description which has been used - and it is a long way from having fulfilled its promises."
"In this respect, today' s motion for a resolution falls a long way short of the declared ambition."
"The peoples of the South are often critical and are concerned about this failure."
"I share their impatience, and even their disappointment and their anger, at the delays but also at the inadequacies of this partnership and at the initial damage it has caused."
"There are still extreme disparities between the two sides of the Mediterranean, which keep the peoples of the South in an explosive economic and social situation, with poverty and unemployment, particularly among young people."
"The path leading to an area of shared prosperity has, for the time being, stopped at the association agreements, which are governed by strictly economic and financial interests in denial of the needs of the people."
"These populations, however, are already suffering under the weight of the debt, the drop in the price of raw materials and imposed structural actions."
"The free trade area is in danger of considerably intensifying these imbalances, even though there is an urgent need, instead, for greater collaboration in order to meet needs."
"I am thinking in particular of public services, more especially in the areas of water, education, health, public transport and housing."
"This partnership will have no future unless it has the benefit of close cooperation with the representatives of the citizens concerned, the associations, the NGOs, the trade unions and civil society as a whole."
"Moreover, the dream of peace on both sides of the Mediterranean should be listened to and the wish granted at the earliest possible opportunity."
"The spiralling violence in the Middle East, the war being waged so violently and resolutely against the Palestinian people, whose right to statehood is still being denied by Israel, are all threatening the future of the entire region."
"The European Union must, as the Palestinian leaders expressly request, henceforth take bold action in order to put an end to the gunfire, to promote effective dialogue and actively militate in favour of applying the UN resolutions."
"The Marseilles Conference could have been used to this end."
"The failure - or, at least, the relative failure - of the Charter for Peace and Stability proves that it is not possible to achieve Europe' s ""security"" on the basis of marginalising the South and closing borders."
"These last few days in Marseilles, I have observed the great numbers of speakers addressing such comments to the Conference of Ministers, speaking in favour of cancelling debt and replacing free trade with relations of mutually supportive codevelopment..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, the different areas of the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue must, in my opinion, be tackled from the social, political and cultural perspectives, in continuation of that process - the Euro-Mediterranean Conference - which was set in motion in Barcelona in 1995 when we first started to talk about Mediterranean policy, although the complexity of the subject caused some difficulties even then."
"The world is moving inexorably towards globalisation and, as a result, is having to organise itself into large blocks which act as protagonists on the great stage of world competition."
"This is prompting the Europe of national States to form a single political, economic and commercial entity in order to organise and boost a market of over 350 million consumers and set it on a level with other markets."
"To this end, we need to establish suitable structures, which could be both political and economic."
"However, first and foremost, we need political strategies which are free of bureaucracy."
"Europe is the guardian of great values: peace, freedom and social progress, values which must be protected day in day out precisely because they are the result of victories won at the cost of great sacrifice."
"Europe's economic progress is now under threat from the current globalisation process, and our continent is in serious danger of a recession caused by competition from South-East Asia - where the cost of labour is a tenth of the cost of labour in Europe - the USA and Japan."
"The Mediterranean policy is now operating in a world of extremely varied interests and latent stabilisation, and it must therefore include certain elements such as the development of peace-keeping initiatives - but it must not, I would stress, be limited to this - and the creation of partnership projects which involve northern and southern Europe, precisely because the objective of making the Mediterranean an area of dialogue, tolerance and cooperation and a guarantee of peace and stability cannot be achieved without firm political will or without the lasting, well-balanced social and economic development of less-favoured peoples and the social development of the coastal peoples, improving their employment possibilities, in order to put an end to the multitude of problems caused by the tremendous number of emigrants leaving the Basin and now affecting all the countries of the Union."
"We are therefore convinced that the Union's Mediterranean policy must take account of the Mediterranean Basin and therefore treat the Mediterranean as a project, mindful of the fact that the rights of peoples take priority over the rights of individuals, if only because, when all is said and done, conflicts between nations harm the life and development of the individual citizens."
"Braudel's 'Mediterranean of a thousand things' , the ancient civilisations which, for years, have regarded each other with hostility across the Basin, now have the opportunity to start afresh, setting off along a common path which, through political will and the power of dialogue, will lay the foundations for genuine progress and economic and social development."
"Mr President, in Nice the European Union will need to strike a balance between integration and enlargement and in Marseilles it will need to strike a balance between its function in central Europe and its responsibility in the Mediterranean."
"We need to set priorities; in other words, we need to use the enlargement process to strengthen Europe from the centre outwards and force a stabilisation process in south-east Europe and in the western Balkans, but without neglecting the Barcelona process, which has been drifting for five years now."
"We can hypothesise as to whether a decisive, uniform EU policy in the Balkans might have prevented the Balkan war and the European Union might therefore have avoided the consequential costs of the war."
"Now, on the eve of Marseilles, we need to ensure that aid is not given to the Balkans at the expense of the MEDA programme or vice versa and that everything stays within the financial framework agreed in Berlin."
"With these conditions in place, it should be possible for the special council in Marseilles to reach a consensus which does more than just highlight the fault lines in the EU."
"We must ensure that the MEDA aid programme is not delayed by bureaucratic hurdles for which the Commission is to blame and that projects are identified more quickly in future by the Mediterranean countries involved."
"It is disappointing to see that the Mediterranean countries only called up just under a quarter of the EUR 4.7 billion budget of the MEDA I programme which expired in 1999."
"But this also illustrates that we need to estimate the absorption capacity of the countries bordering the Mediterranean more realistically."
"I therefore particularly welcome the Commission plan to speed up the association agreement and I think that the revision of the MEDA regulation was a very good move."
"So far, I have deliberately avoided making any link between the Euro-Mediterranean conference and the conflict in the Middle East."
"The very fact that this conference is even taking place and that Israel and the Palestinians have agreed to attend and the threat of boycott by the Arab League has come to nothing must qualify as a success."
"We can only hope that this conference in Marseilles does not turn into a platform for polemics, pushing the first important signs of a Mediterranean policy in the European Union and the revival of the Barcelona to one side."
"Mr President, tomorrow and the following day the Euro-Mediterranean Conference is to be held in Marseilles, attended by all the countries that signed the Barcelona Declaration, and I think that we can congratulate ourselves on this."
"It will be a success that will show that the Barcelona process, which began on the back of the Oslo agreements, has reached a sufficient level of maturity and solidity to prevent it from being caught up in the difficulties of the Middle East process."
"Moreover, by continuing it can make the best possible contribution, a secondary but significant contribution, to the resumption of dialogue in the Middle East."
"However, in all the evaluations that are now being made of five years of the Barcelona process, many people think that we can be satisfied simply that the process is continuing, due to the fact that there have been ministerial meetings attended by representatives from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Lebanon, etc. And this is, perhaps, a sad consolation."
"The evaluation is now a contrasting one and, of course, the strategic development of Euro-Mediterranean policy cannot depend on a temporary evaluation."
"It is continuity over time that can provide results, and positive results will be ultimately measured by the development of the countries of the southern Mediterranean."
"Those countries come up against a great deal of problems finding a place for their development and economic integration in the context of globalisation and we must do everything in our power to help restore balance to a situation characterised by gulfs between North and South."
"If current tendencies continue we can be pessimistic about the future."
"Today a European is statistically twice as rich as someone from the Maghreb, and in twenty years' time he will be twenty times as rich, if we do not manage to turn the situation around."
"In this respect, the proposal that the Commission has made for a new impetus is a positive one, and we fully agree with the two priorities that Mr Patten has set out in his speeches and repeated here this afternoon."
"We need to speed up the processes of the association agreements."
"Above all, we need to avoid having to make an evaluation of the application of MEDA in five years' time that leads us to conclude that only 26% have been used."
"However, this is not enough."
"We probably need to open up a more medium-term perspective and I can only list the three areas that I feel are essential in that respect: The first is European projects to structure a regional area in the southern countries."
"The second is an essential policy dealing with the human aspect of managing migration flows."
"The third is discussion and the quest for progress and consensus in developing a common agricultural policy in the Mediterranean, without which we will probably not be able to achieve a positive outcome in the medium term."
"Mr President, reinvigorating the Barcelona Process and giving it direction means not just concerning ourselves with the free market and economic and trade concerns but, in effect, relaunching a policy of cooperation and development and defence of human rights throughout the area."
"It means bringing about the necessary social reforms, focusing on employment, the need to revitalise the economy in the southern countries and the reduction and cancellation of debt as central issues. It means promoting economic, cultural and political exchange between the southern countries themselves as well as with the northern countries."
"It means ensuring that civil society plays a greater role."
"However, we must not ignore the fact that the Barcelona Process has entered a critical stage, caused not only by lack of impetus or a slow down in the European undertaking in respect of the events in the Balkans or enlargement, but also by the conditions of tragic open conflict in the Mediterranean which are holding back reinvigoration."
"The Palestinian question has once again become central."
"Commissioner Patten has said that we must not be hostages to the Palestine-Israel situation."
"That is true, but we cannot avoid it."
"If we do not tackle very soon the issue of the recognition of a Palestinian State, a State which can coexist with Israel, if military occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip does not cease, the issue cannot be resolved."
"It must be resolved, first and foremost, of course, in order to put an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people, but also in order to bring more stability to the region."
"I hope that when the Conference of Ministers of the Union meets in Marseilles, it will be able to adopt a position on this matter which is coherent with what is always pompously stressed, that human rights must not be violated."
"It is essential to reinvigorate the Process and we must do so, but we must do so in the knowledge that we cannot escape the central issue of the Mediterranean."
"Mr President, since the Barcelona conference and now on the eve of the Marseilles conference, as has already been said, a great deal has taken place in the Mediterranean region."
"It is true that this Conference is going to take place in a context of violence and of a peace crisis as a result of the conflict in the Middle East, but it is also true that holding the conference will enable us to keep the flame of the Euro-Mediterranean process burning and that it should not be contaminated by the tragic conflict."
"There are many common problems that are currently affecting the Euro-Mediterranean area: illegal immigration, poverty, foreign debt, human rights, drought and terrorism, which mercilessly destroys the lives of innocent individuals and families, as we are tragically experiencing in Spain, Algeria and the Middle East."
"Now more than ever we need to proclaim that only regional cooperation, dialogue with civil society, economic and cultural exchange, solidarity and mutual understanding can make the two shores of the Mediterranean a prosperous and peaceful area."
"The Commission and the Council need to urgently undertake what was agreed in Feira and they need to make a common policy for the development of the Mediterranean region viable."
"We cannot and must not waste our human resources, our agricultural, industrial or traditional craftsmanship resources which, along with such vital products as oil, gas and new technologies, should be basic tools for the development of a Mediterranean society that is much more balanced, fair and competitive than at present."
"Mr President, I will come back to the conflict in the Middle East; not two months ago, the Presidents of the Israeli Parliament and the Palestinian Assembly united in this House with the President of the European Parliament, in a plea for peace and harmony, and we all joined in hearty applause for that gesture."
"When weapons replace words, dialogue and understanding, the foundation and substance of democracy that is Parliament fails, and this is also our failure."
"It is a warning call to the European Union to play a much more active role in the Mediterranean area, which historically and culturally has enriched our European continent."
"It would be an error not to take on the leading role that history requires of us."
"In addition, I also think, Commissioner, that the borders that geo-politics demands should serve to prevent the free movement of those who make a way of life out of organised crime, the trafficking of arms, drugs and human beings and particularly terrorism, a way of life that is condemned by all civilised countries."
"Let us make borders a real filter for crime and criminals, and not a barrier to development, culture or the prosperity of peoples."
"The European Union needs a new culture of immigration and a better management of migration flows."
"The European Union is jointly responsible, with the countries of origin, for immigration and for organising those migration flows, which are so necessary for the development of the region."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every day that passes is punctuated by developments in the current crisis in the Middle East and every day that passes is a further indication, as if this were needed, that everything that happens in the South and around the Mediterranean is of direct concern to us, and affects our daily lives."
"When things go well in the South, peace is possible, democratic progress can be achieved, there is more economic development and less illegal emigration."
"In short, there is hope."
"When things go badly in the South, we have war, violence, fundamentalism - and this also affects the areas in Europe in which we live - not to mention the risk of a new oil crisis."
"Today, once again, we face the worst possible scenario."
"This is quite clear from looking at current events."
"Some of us have been saying all this time and time again for many years in this House."
"Unfortunately, for many years, too, factors such as the enlargement of Europe to the East, the Balkans crisis and wars have displaced the South in the minds of a great many Europeans, hence the repeated delays in Mediterranean processes and policies."
"We have seen cuts in appropriations and problems in harnessing these appropriations."
"The general negotiations are bogged down; there are delays in the negotiations for association agreements and even greater delays in ratification procedures."
"This creates the most serious disappointment in our partners in the South and our political influence, that of Europe, has suffered as a result, even though we continue to be, in spite of everything, the foremost financial backers of the South."
"We must therefore, as several of us have said this afternoon, immediately tighten up our political objectives with regard to the South, support the appropriations that have been committed, expedite the association agreements with the partner countries, make the Charter for Peace and Stability a priority once again, make great efforts to assist development and do something about the burden of debt of the poorest countries."
"At long last we must open up our markets to their produce, and standardise our regulations for the reception and asylum of persons immigrating into Europe."
"To sum up, we must restore Europe' s confidence in its determination to achieve a real partnership with the South."
"Everyone is aware of this."
"We must make a quantitative, but also a qualitative effort."
"The Commission and the Council claim to want this."
"We are willing to believe them, but the countries of the South need more than just promises and speeches, and it is up to us to give them those things."
"No doubt, Marseilles is our last chance for that."
"This is one of the major issues of the French Presidency."
"Mr President, the Marseilles Summit is intended to be a step further towards creating a free trade area, a sort of single market promoting membership of the WTO, as you describe it so well, Mr Patten, in today' s issue of Le Monde."
"It is the economic pillar which is brought to the fore."
"In this instance, as at the EU-Asia Summit meeting, ASEM III, in Seoul a month ago, the European Union is once again seeking to export its own economic model and its capital."
"Marseilles too, the other summit, brought together the members of associations, trade unions and political bodies from all around the Mediterranean, and these people were together attempting resolutely to find solutions to meeting the needs of their peoples."
"As far as I am concerned, this necessarily involves using new means, and hence cancelling debt."
"What is much more serious, however, at the very moment when we are calmly exchanging points of view, often very divergent ones, within this Chamber, more and more Palestinians are being killed."
"The European Union must, as a matter of urgency, strongly condemn the Israeli attacks on the Palestinian people, whose demand to live in peace in their own state is a legitimate one and one which must, therefore, be met."
"Mr President, Europe is sometimes in a great hurry, and sometimes being in a hurry makes you leave things behind."
"And I have seen that in all these documents on strengthening the Barcelona agreement we are forgetting some things."
"One of them is that liberalisation, a single market, cannot be established without taking care of some important aspects, such as people and culture or education."
"If we liberalise the markets and encourage a drive to integrate them while forgetting this, we run the risk of ultimately achieving colonisation rather than cooperation."
"Europe needs to think outside the principle of subsidiarity or go beyond it and realise that it needs to provide a great deal of aid in order to raise the level in the recipient countries, among both men and women, not only of basic education but also of minimum education, which in Europe is considered to be for all citizens."
"Therefore, we cannot just talk about products and the organisation of markets without thinking about those citizens."
"Secondly, I think that we are also forgetting another important subject, which is the environment."
"Europe has not produced any policies on desertification or on water that benefit the Mediterranean countries and we need to think about a Mediterranean environment policy that understands the location, the systems and also the climatic diversity of the Mediterranean."
"Policy as it is set out today could not be transferred to many countries of the southern Mediterranean."
"In this respect, we need to take into account that in Europe there is serious pressure from citizens of the north on the southern Mediterranean, through tourism."
"With the rise in crude oil prices there is going to be much more pressure on the Mediterranean."
"This translates into the consumption of the land, and a policy of environmental dumping, which is absolutely unacceptable."
"Also, we cannot demand that European citizens properly implement their environmental policy and not apply this to other countries."
"I have received a motion for a resolution, pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure, to close the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 11.30 a.m."
"Aid for reconstruction"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A5-0324/2000 by Mr Lagendijk, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the amended proposal for a Council Regulation concerning the European Agency for Reconstruction [COM(2000) 628 - C5-0526/2000 - 2000/0112(CNS)]"
"A5-0330/2000 by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the amended proposal for a Council regulation on assistance for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and amending Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89, Decision 97/256/EC and Regulation (EEC) No 1360/90 [COM(2000) 628 - C5-0525/2000 - 2000/0111(CNS)]"
"Mr President, Commissioner, it has taken the Commission a while to produce a final proposal on the delivery of aid to the western Balkans."
"As is known, a proposal was submitted back in May but we had to wait until September before there was a definitive proposal on the table."
"This had to do with the discussion within the Commission on the need to find an alternative way of delivering external aid."
"In other words, the proposal now on the table reflects this discussion, and as I see it, is also a first example of how we should do things in the future."
"This also means that the Commission' s new proposal was worth waiting for, because it sets out in clear and lucid terms how the European Commission proposes to deliver aid in future, both with regard to the general regulation for the Balkans and with regard to the proposal for the agency in Kosovo."
"To put it in a slightly grand way, perhaps it can also be deemed a kind of fresh start for the delivery of aid, based on the extraordinarily negative experiences we had in Bosnia, but also on our positive experiences in Kosovo."
"There is now a regulation on the table which, as I see it, equips the European Union to deliver aid in an efficient manner and on time, and to put EU funds to good use in the countries of the western Balkans."
"In this way, and this is very important - I will come back to it again shortly - a good balance has been struck between the Commission' s responsibility on the one hand and the need to involve the Member States in some way, on the other."
"It is a balance which, in my opinion, and I think also in the Commission' s view, could not always be found in the past, because all too often the Member States tried to get in on the act when it came to delivering aid."
"The proposals now on the table have been far more successful in striking this balance."
"Naturally, and I am coming now to the reports compiled by myself and by Mr Westendorp, there is room for improvement."
"Anyone who sees and reads the proposed reports will see that a number of improvements have been proposed to certain sections."
"For example, explicit attention is to be given to the construction of the civilian society, support for the media, and the important role fulfilled by education."
"I happened to be at a conference in Zagreb last week, when once again it became evident how important it is not to teach future generations of mini Balkans citizens - as it were - old stereotypes, or inculcate them with notions of 'the enemy' , and instead, to made a fresh start in this respect."
"I think it is important for the regulation to establish that the Commission will continue to spend money on this kind of project in the future, as it does now."
"However, there are two key aspects of policy I would like to focus on."
"The first relates - and I am sorry to have to bother the Commissioner with this again - to the finances."
"To be perfectly honest, if we manage to deliver a sound opinion on this regulation, today and tomorrow, then we will have completed one part of our work; the first half I would say."
"Then we will have it down on paper how things are supposed to be done in future."
"However, if, when it comes to December, we do not include the funds required to implement the regulation then all we are doing today is building castles in the air."
"This is not a reproach directed at the Commission."
"The Commission has been in a position to see that I am expressly calling for the assessment of the costs carried out by the Commission - the famous EUR 5.5 billion for the next seven years - to be explicitly included in this regulation, otherwise, to be blunt about it, what we are doing is pure hypocrisy."
"We cannot adopt a regulation here in Parliament knowing full well that the funds required to implement it will not be available."
"That is why this is stage one of the battle for an effective system of delivering aid to the Balkans."
"Stage two will take place in December when our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets, but ultimately Parliament as a whole, will have to opt for a sound financial basis for this regulation."
"That being the case, it is a shame that Mr Moscovici is absent at present, because as I see it, responsibility on that point falls specifically to the Council, and to the Member States, who must be prepared to recognise that what we, and what they, want to achieve through this regulation costs money, and that this money must be found in the European Union' s budget."
"The second point, the general point about delivering aid, concerns the balance that must be struck - hence the need for an amendment on this point - between the need for the European Union to maintain a high profile in the Balkans, on the one hand, and the need to support smaller projects as well, on the other."
"The fact of the matter is - and anyone who has been to the Balkans will confirm this - that the United States is extremely good at creating the impression that it is able to do a great deal more with a good deal less money."
"The fact that the European Union actually spends far more money but is nothing like as high profile, has led many people to conclude that there is a need to substantially raise people' s awareness of our activities in the Balkans."
"I would agree with this analysis."
"This almost inevitably means that a great deal of money will go to the large projects, i.e. to road and bridge building projects; to projects that can fly the flag for Europe."
"As I said, we need to do this to raise our profile."
"But be warned, this must not lead to a situation where, when it comes to drawing up priorities, all kinds of smaller projects, which we have supported hitherto, are sacrificed in the process."
"Hence my appeal for this regulation to strike a good balance between high profile activities, i.e. large projects, on the one hand, and continued attention to projects for democracy, on the other, i.e. projects to do with security, projects that are seldom as high profile, but which are all the more necessary to guarantee stability in the Balkans."
"Then there is the question of the agency in Kosovo."
"Seen in a positive light, I sometimes think, and hope, that the agency, by the manner in which it has operated to date, and in which it is to function in the future, ought to serve as an example of how aid should be delivered to the Balkans, and also to other parts of the world."
"I have drawn such positive conclusions from my various visits to the agency because as I see it, despite all - and I repeat, all - the mistakes that are made there, there can be no doubt that they have found a new and effective way to deliver aid."
"If we then talk about increasing efficiency, which is the overall objective of this regulation, and relate this to the agency in Kosovo, then we have no choice but to reduce the involvement of the Member States."
"In quite concrete terms, this means reducing the influence of the Governing Board associated with the agency."
"In the past, we have been highly critical of the way in which the Commission delivers aid, as this is often bound up in red tape."
"The procedures involved are often too complex, but we must not turn a blind eye, nor must we want to - and I hope the Member States do not do so either - to their part in this."
"All too often the Member States have tried to get in on the act where overseas aid is concerned."
"All too often this has led to delays, inefficiency, and the promotion of national interests."
"As far as I am concerned, and this is one of the key messages in my report on the agency, the role of the Member States in aid provision will be much reduced in future because there is evidence to show that their involvement causes delays."
"Lastly, Mr President and Commissioner, a final point."
"Some of my fellow Members are inclined to want to extend the activities of the agency still further than was the case hitherto."
"The agency is now based in Kosovo, and the Council has decided - rightly to my mind - to extend its scope to Serbia and Montenegro."
"I feel we will have to call it a day at that point because we can draw a lesson from the work that the agency is doing now, i.e. physical reconstruction, with a view to carrying out the same activities to good effect in Serbia and Montenegro."
"Delivering aid to the Balkans within the framework of CARDS, to countries such as Croatia, Albania, and Macedonia, demands other special qualities and other capabilities."
"I would therefore say: let the agency do what it is good at, i.e. physical reconstruction."
"It will prove very difficult to do this as effectively in Serbia."
"Let us confine ourselves to this and not dissipate our energies by extending the agency' s capabilities beyond the borders of former Yugoslavia."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am aware that the Balkans are not the most promising area for optimism."
"However, I do not believe I am being over-optimistic if I say that the European Union is harvesting the fruits of coordinated and persistent action."
"After the tragedy that the Balkans suffered, these fruits first appeared a few months ago in Croatia with free elections and a regime eager to respect human rights, and have now revealed themselves in Belgrade, where the citizens have confirmed their desire to live together in peace and freedom and to take their place in the family of Europe."
"We must not disappoint them in their expectations, and now more than ever these countries need our help."
"We must continue this process of stabilising the region and prepare them for a longer-term perspective of integration in the institutions of Europe."
"In doing this, of course, we are staking our credibility and our own stability."
"But if we want to help them, we must do so more effectively and in a more coordinated fashion than we have done so far; otherwise there will occur what Mr Lagendijk has called the loss of visibility of the European Union, which bears the largest financial burden in the Balkans and yet is far less visible than countries like the United States, which can react practically in real time to any need that arises in the country."
"So much so that when I was in Bosnia-Herzegovina and visited a village, they would greet me jubilantly with 'It is so good that you Americans are here to help us.'"
"The European Union' s action had become that invisible."
"In the report on aid to the western Balkans that I have drawn up, working in close collaboration with Mr Lagendijk, on the two topics that we are dealing with today - a fine example of cooperation between two committees - we have recognised a number of limitations. On the one hand there is a geographical limitation, which suggests that the agency' s action should be expanded to embrace not only Kosovo but all Yugoslavia."
"We have also found some functional limitations."
"First, the international organisations that carry out these operations, such as UNMIK in Kosovo or the office of the High Representative in Sarajevo, also need to benefit from this aid."
"In addition, there are several measures - I am referring particularly to the CARDS programme - that should go beyond reconstruction and extend to training, education and the reconstruction of civil society in close collaboration with NGOs."
"It is vital that NGOs should collaborate in this field, and also that there should be some coordination among them, if we really want their action to be more effective and to reach all parts of those regions."
"We must also highlight the media."
"The media in that region have often been responsible for the tragedy they have been through, so it is essential to have a completely free media that acts in accordance with the rules that prevail in our democracies."
"It is also very important to make the judiciary really independent."
"We have also come across some operational limitations, which are among the causes of the lack of visibility."
"Operational limitations in the aid management system."
"Sometimes there is too much bureaucracy, too much red tape, and too much vacillation when the aid is granted."
"Therefore it is important for the CARDS programme management committee to be a committee that confines itself to the general lines of multiannual planning and does not try to carry out everyday micro-management at too detailed a scale, because otherwise we may again have the same problems as in the past."
"It is also important that the work of the CARDS management committee and the work of the Kosovo Reconstruction Agency should not get mixed up, or be duplicated or overlap; instead there should be a perfect division of duties."
"It is also essential to strengthen the role of the European Parliament, and I believe that with the amendments, which are likely to be voted for tomorrow, the European Parliament will be able to perform a greater consultative role in a process of interinstitutional collaboration."
"Lastly, I want to mention the financial package."
"Mr President, you are perfectly aware that nowadays the miracle of the loaves and the fishes is most unlikely to be repeated, and with the precious few loaves and fishes we now have available it is going to be practically impossible for us to tackle all of the European Union' s external obligations."
"We have to give more effective and more coordinated aid, gathering together all the scattered bits and pieces."
"I conclude by repeating the Commission' s own words - that these two proposals are the cornerstone of a process that should lead these countries, which have had and still have so many problems, to become fully integrated into the structures of Europe."
"I am firmly convinced that the Balkans do have a solution and that the Balkan curse can be lifted, but for this they need all our support and these two programmes aim to provide it."
"Mr President, I feel that the content of this important measure has been clearly and very well explained by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza."
"The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which I have the honour of chairing, has endeavoured, through its opinion, to emphasise the importance of this reconstruction work in the Balkans as a possible way of integrating these areas into Europe as a whole."
"At the same time, in order to include a specifically cultural angle, not in abstract or generic terms but in terms of solidarity, we have proposed amendments which have found favour in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and which, I feel, contribute to providing, on the one hand, economic, civil, supportive assistance while restoring the civil society of these very unfortunate areas and, on the other, the possibility for cultural and institutional - and I stress the word institutional - support, to give these areas a sense of association with Europe, association in terms of civilisation, in terms of cultural initiatives, as well."
"The fact that the amendments expressed as an opinion by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport have been accepted and that unanimity has been achieved is, in my opinion, an important factor which this House should note and take into consideration."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, what you see before you is one happy man, one happy rapporteur, because the Commission has adopted the lion' s share of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Budgetary Control, on their merits."
"Of course this is only to be welcomed."
"Our work has borne fruit."
"But I am also happy because I feel that Parliament has succeeded, by keeping the pressure on, in turning round a situation that originally left a great deal to be desired."
"Rapporteur Lagendijk rightly pointed out that, if truth be known, the Commission' s original proposal drew no lessons from the past, from the comments already made by the Court of Auditors, or from the experiences of the European Agency for Reconstruction. Nor did it take on board the comments in Mrs Pack' s report, which was available to us back in 1999, or the feedback from the ad hoc delegation that we sent to Kosovo, and which submitted some very important recommendations under the leadership of Doris Pack and Terry Wynn."
"When I drafted my report in July, I saw at once that that this original proposal was lacking."
"I then asked the Commission to withdraw the proposal."
"I am delighted that they did so and went on to submit a new proposal."
"There has been a new proposal on the table since 4 October, and we are working on it now."
"I feel this is to be welcomed, thanks to the pressure exerted by Parliament."
"What is it about?"
"We must ensure that the regulations now on the table make provision for EU aid to the Western Balkans to be delivered quickly, flexibly and unbureaucratically, in cooperation with the local population and local bodies."
"There has been all too little of this in previous years."
"We need a flexible system to this end, a lightweight structure free of red tape."
"It is a pity that the President-in-Office of the Council is absent today."
"It is mainly the Council and the Member States who have, as it were, put a spoke in this large wheel in recent years."
"They have put paid to things that might have been possible."
"Therefore I welcome the proposal now on the table."
"On behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am able to tell you that we support all the amendments."
"Naturally we are also delighted that the amendment regarding OLAF has been adopted."
"It is indeed the case that the anti-fraud unit must also be free to carry out its full range of tasks in the Western Balkans."
"Finally, I would like to say a brief word, speaking in a personal capacity rather than on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I am currently working on a report on how funds are being spent in Bosnia Herzegovina."
"It is a follow-up report to a special report by the Court of Auditors."
"We will need to ensure that sufficient funds are earmarked for Bosnia Herzegovina in the CARDs regulation."
"Our task will not end there, as we will still have quite some way to go."
"It is a fragile and unstable state."
"That, more than anything is what we must keep in mind in the years to come."
"I am sorry to have to start the group debate without the President of the Council being here with us."
"I am promised he will be here soon."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Lagendijkand Westendorp reports on the Agency and the CARDS programme - it is difficult to distinguish one from the other - base their proposed amendments on the experience gained from their forerunners, the OBNOVA programme and the Kosovo agency."
"I think we all realise that a slimmer, more efficient structure is needed if the good work which the Kosovo Agency has carried out in recent months is to be consolidated for future purposes."
"In future, responsibility must be vested in a few people, including a director, if you like, so that really one person is responsible vis-à-vis the committee which selects the individual programmes."
"I think responsibility must be vested in very few people if we are to raise the profile of European work on the ground."
"As we have seen in Bosnia time and again, the Americans manage to show themselves to good advantage with very limited funds."
"In numerous areas, we have spent and continue to spend more money than anyone else but still we are not visible because it sort of runs through our fingers rather than being vested in any one institution."
"I also feel that duplicate work by the governing board and management board and unnecessary ritual meetings of their members, where it is the director responsible who needs to take the necessary decisions on time, should be avoided."
"I hope that Parliament's proposals will be accepted by the Commission and the Council."
"I repeat: unnecessary expenditure on unnecessary meetings really should be cut back."
"The money is desperately needed on the ground, where it can be put to better use."
"If, although this was not the case with my report on the Kosovo Agency, the Council could perhaps at last learn from its mistakes, that would help the taxpayer no end."
"The objectives of the CARDS programme were in fact all right."
"But something important, one important objective is missing from this CARDS and that is support for education and training in these countries."
"Without education and training there is nothing, which is why I am delighted that the members of all the committees have helped me to table this proposed amendment."
"As I understand it, the Commissioner also takes the view that this should be an important objective in the CARDS programme."
"It should also be an objective which is close the Council's heart."
"I really do hope that the French Minister for Education, Jacques Lang, will be able to persuade his cabinet to ensure that the French government does not oppose the inclusion of the objective of education in the CARDS programme in the next Coreper."
"I think it would be counterproductive and I am certain that Mr Lang will do his utmost and if Mr Moscovici were here, he would perhaps do so too."
"So my thanks to all my fellow members who see this as an important objective and I am delighted that we shall be able to bring these countries more in the way of content in the future."
"Mr President, I wanted to make a number of general comments today about what I would like to call 'the political reconstruction of the Balkans region' ."
"Mr Swoboda will say a little more, on behalf of my group, about what I would like to call 'efforts to reconstruct the EU' , which is also the subject of the reports under discussion today, courtesy of Mr Lagendijk and Mr Westendorp, to whom I offer my compliments."
"In theory, we should be encouraged by the developments that have taken place in the Balkans over the past year."
"A great deal of headway has been made in the space of a year and the internal dynamics in a number of countries are at long last enhancing the role of the international community, even though the Kosovo crisis is still fresh in the memory."
"Kosovo is, and remains, a problem child."
"The local elections had a positive outcome."
"Of course it is ever thus when moderates win, but the internal situation remains tense, as borne out by the recent murder of four Roma who had returned to Kosovo after seeking asylum in Belgium."
"Naturally the all-important question is: what future does Kosovo have within Yugoslavia?"
"We PSE members reject any fanciful notions of an independent Kosovo."
"We are therefore looking forward with bated breath to the first meeting between President Kostunica and Mr Rugova."
"Perhaps the European Union could act as a mediator in this."
"However, we ought not to focus on Kosovo alone."
"By and large, things are moving in the right direction."
"I would call it a return to normality, all be it a gradual one."
"Last year belonged to true democracy, which was on the up and up, and to those politicians who eschew nationalism as the sole vehicle for politics."
"They have replaced three politicians who personified the worst aspects of former Yugoslavia in the nineties."
"I am referring to Tudjman, Milosevic and Izetbegovic."
"The government in Zagreb is helping us to think about the future of the region, and making real investments in democracy and stability."
"Tomorrow we are due to receive the new President of Yugoslavia in this House."
"As I see it, they are the new heroes of the Balkans and of course they are more than welcome."
"Croatia must soon be given the opportunity to strengthen its ties with the European Union."
"As far as I am concerned, apart from Slovenia it will be the first country from former Yugoslavia to qualify for EU membership in the future."
"What Serbia deserves most of all at this point in time is material aid, and the sooner the better."
"Europe must clearly demonstrate that its aid is making a difference, even before the parliamentary elections in Serbia."
"However, as far as I am concerned, this week' s star price goes to the leader of the Social Democrats in Bosnia, and, incidentally, to the people of Slovakia, for not falling into the referendum trap that the opposition set for the government, but that is another story."
"I read in some reports about the elections in Bosnia that the extreme nationalists have won at the parliamentary elections held in Bosnia Herzegovina."
"On the face of it, that appears to be true, particularly in the Republika Srpska and in the Croatian part."
"In the Bosnian part, the position of the nationalists has come under attack for the first time ever."
"In any event, the changes taking place in Croatia and Serbia are starting to have an effect on the situation there."
"The Social Democrats have done remarkably well there."
"There is nothing untoward about that in Europe, or even in the Balkans, but what is striking is that this party is multi-ethnic and openly defends this."
"At recent gatherings in Sarajevo, the leader of this party, Zlatko Lagumdzija, in the company of Serbs, Croats, Montenegrins, Albanians and other representatives from the region, introduced the concept of reconstruction of the spirit, thereby getting right to the heart of the matter."
"We must concentrate our energies in the physical reconstruction of former Yugoslavia, but this will only work if we manage to alter the people' s frame of mind too."
"Those politicians who openly work for such a cause deserve not only our admiration, but above all, our support."
"They alone can bring down the bastion of nationalism."
"The stability of the region will depend on the extent to which the new leaders are able to keep the lid on the national spirit and develop a different kind of mentality."
"Their political fate will also depend on how successfully the EU is able to deliver aid."
"The reports by Mr Westendorp and Mr Lagendijk provide the foundation we need for an efficient approach to the matter."
"Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of the reports we have for discussion, and we support the Commission' s attempt to make the very difficult work the European Union is doing for the Balkans more effective."
"The aid has been too bureaucratic and too slow in coming, because the Commission has been too centralised and management-driven in its work."
"There has been too much management in detail, and Parliament has been complicit in this on a number of points."
"It is very unfortunate that the agency has been split up into a headquarters in Thessaloniki and an operations centre in Pristina."
"We have been opposed to this throughout."
"Moreover, the arrangement has now also been criticised by the Court of Auditors."
"It is good that, in this year' s Budget, EUR 175 million is being set aside for Kosovo and EUR 200 million for emergency aid for Serbia."
"It is very unfortunate, however, that the appropriations to the UN' s administration in Kosovo, to the Baltic region and to the rapid reaction facility have been put in the reserves."
"It is very unfortunate that there is no certainty regarding what we have by way of money for Serbia next year."
"It is particularly unfortunate in view of the fact that the elected Serbian President is coming here tomorrow."
"It is also unfortunate that a large number of programmes have been put in the so-called performance reserve."
"I am well aware that Parliament wants in this way to force the Commission to behave better, but one ought not to take one' s own children hostage. We should do much better to give the Commission a free hand in making the work effective, and we must reserve the right to criticise the Commission if the work is not a success."
"We must not make ourselves partly liable for possible damage to programmes of which we are in favour."
"Let us give the Commission larger appropriations and permission to delegate responsibility so that it becomes easier to make rapid decisions and to implement initiatives."
"Let us celebrate the visit by the elected Serbian president tomorrow by now seriously giving the Commission a chance to put the aid we offer onto a new and better footing."
"Mr President, the aid which we are discussing is yet another instrument of foreign intervention in this highly sensitive region of Europe."
"International imperialism is well versed in the art of using the stick and the carrot, of alternating bombing incursions with humanitarian aid, destruction with reconstruction."
"Its final objective is to subjugate people to the new world order."
"What I want to know is how can those who sowed disaster talk of reconstruction? How do murderers of children and civilians have the gall to give their victims lessons in democracy, the rule of law and human rights?"
"The imperialist forces owe Yugoslavia war reparation, not humanitarian aid."
"The events which unfolded in Yugoslavia a few weeks ago, the so-called popular uprising, was backed by at least USD 100 million in foreign aid to the so-called ""democratic opposition""."
"These events may well have created a climate of euphoria in leading imperialist circles; but they know full well that they have not subdued the spirit of resistance in the Yugoslavian or any other people."
"That is why they are preparing military and police strike forces."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that the Western Balkans present a significant challenge for the European Union and the credibility of its foreign policy, due to the scale of our human, political and financial commitment in the region, and also our desire to facilitate stabilisation through the construction, development and finally reintegration of the Balkan region into the European family."
"This year began on a positive note with democratic change in Croatia, as a result of the parliamentary and presidential elections it held."
"It continued with another major event in the form of the victory of democratic forces in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the fall of Milosevic."
"We indeed hope that the year will end with the consolidation of democracy on 23 December during the parliamentary elections in Serbia."
"As you will be aware, the European Union, has contributed significantly to these historic developments."
"It reacted immediately to the new order in Croatia, by undertaking the process that will lead, at the Zagreb summit on 24 November, in other words in ten days' time, to the opening of negotiations aimed at concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with this country."
"As it had made a similar commitment to the people of Serbia, it took the necessary steps on the election of President Kostunica, whom you are to meet tomorrow."
"These steps included the lifting of sanctions that had been imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, emergency assistance to the value of EUR 200 million granted by the European Council meeting in Biarritz, and the integration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the international community, all with a view to supporting the process of the consolidation of democracy."
"I should like to speak in more detail about the priorities set by the Presidency-in-Office for the Western Balkans."
"Thinking ahead to the summit in Zagreb, we wanted to focus the Union' s action on consolidating democracy and evaluating the Stabilisation and Association Process."
"To this end we have set two aims; the first is to develop regional cooperation, and the second is to implement a genuine policy to encourage a rapprochement between these countries and the European Union."
"At Cologne, the European Council offered countries the opportunity to join the European Union."
"At Feira, the Council considered those countries participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process as potential applicants for membership of the European Union."
"We intend to confirm the offer at the Zagreb summit, but also go one step further and define the measures each country needs to take and the reforms they need to put in place to this end."
"Lastly, we intend to confirm that the process will receive Community support of the highest order."
"On the initiative of France, for the first time the Zagreb Summit will gather together Heads of State and Government of the European Union and the countries of the Western Balkans that are participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process: Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"This summit will provide an opportunity to draw conclusions at the highest level, with regard to the decisive democratic changes that have taken place in this region. As a result of this, we will be able to reaffirm the fact that the way is open for a rapprochement between all of the countries in the region and the European Union, within the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process."
"We should like to highlight the value of the process, for example by marking the conclusion of negotiations of the first Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia during the Zagreb Summit, or confirming an individual approach that is adapted to each country' s particular characteristics and, as I have already said, by outlining the prospects the process holds for each of us."
"The summit will also aim to consolidate democracy in the FRY, support the process of reconciliation between these countries and neighbouring countries, and encourage the development of reliable cooperation between the countries in the region."
"Therefore, the Union, without waiting for the Stabilisation and Association Agreements to be implemented, will remind the five countries concerned that it expects them, as of now, to conclude regional cooperation agreements between themselves."
"Such agreements, that were provided for within the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Agreements, should, in our view, include the initiation of political dialogue, a regional free trade area, as well as close collaboration in the field of justice and home affairs, in particular with a view to strengthening the judiciary and its independence in the fight against organised crime, corruption, money laundering and all other forms of criminal trafficking."
"Any rapprochement with the European Union is, in fact, closely linked, in the eyes of the Council, to the development of regional cooperation."
"Examination of the reports by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza and Mr Lagendijk on proposals for a Regulation concerning a framework programme on the one hand, and the European Agency for Reconstruction on the other, provide us with an opportunity to assess the scale of the support that the Union intends to give the Western Balkans in relation to the Stabilisation and Association Process."
"Both reports are along the right lines."
"The Presidency-in-Office, like you, would like this framework programme to implement the principles of the reform of the management of external aid: fewer procedures, greater coordination out in the field, fewer outstanding commitments."
"Similarly, we support the extension to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of the activity of the European Agency for Reconstruction, which proved its effectiveness in Kosovo."
"We would like to see the programmes assigned to it by the Commission implemented more efficiently and speedily."
"The Council Presidency aims to reach an agreement on the proposals for a Regulation regarding the CARDS programme and the European Agency for Reconstruction during the General Affairs Council at the end of November, in other words next week, so as to be able to make an announcement at Zagreb on 24 November."
"I should like to remind you that the main priorities of the CARDS programme are the strengthening of institutions with regard to democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction, and regional cooperation."
"The CARDS programme should therefore improve the cohesiveness, effectiveness and visibility of the assistance provided by the European Union to the region."
"At the Budget Council on 20 July, the Member States unanimously decided to refocus the debate on the total amount of the financial envelope set aside for CARDS for the period 2000-2006 within the context of respect for the ceiling of heading 4 of the Financial Perspective, as determined by the European Council in Berlin."
"This amount, which will include assistance for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, will result from a unanimous decision regarding the way in which the EUR 10 billion available under the ceiling of heading 4 will be distributed between the two aid programmes, MEDA II and CARDS, the adoption of which will feature among our priorities."
"Lastly, during the General Affairs Council on 18 September, the Presidency-in-Office adopted asymmetric commercial preferences for the benefit of those countries that are participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process."
"These measures accord preferential access to the Community market for agricultural and industrial products produced by these countries."
"By adopting these measures, the European Union has performed an exceptional gesture, as this process of liberalisation, in particular as regards agricultural products, has been offered practically without conditions or rights."
"Such measures entered into force on 1 November and the Council is currently working to extend them to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"The French Presidency set itself ambitious targets as regards the Western Balkans which are close to being achieved: the development of the Stabilisation and Association Process, the adoption of the CARDS programme, the adoption of asymmetric commercial preferences, to mention but the more noteworthy Community measures."
"The long-awaited victory of democracy in Croatia, and then in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, forces the European Union, as we are well aware, to take things much further."
"This is why we must deliver a very strong political message at the Zagreb summit, one that is in line with the high hopes for peace and reconciliation that the peoples of the countries in the region have placed in this democratic change."
"The European Union must not be afraid to say to these countries: yes, your place, your future is within the European family."
"Mr President, my initial impression of President Kostunica is that he has been very pragmatic in his political dealings since he assumed power in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"He has consolidated his victory but has equally been tactful in his relations with other leaders in the region."
"He has already visited Sarajevo, he has attended an informal regional meeting in Skopje and he has also been to Moscow."
"The European Union was right to react positively to President Kostunica's accession to power."
"Visa restrictions have been loosened and the oil and flight embargo has now been lifted."
"The fact that the Commission has allocated EUR 200 million in emergency and assistance support from the NGOs is to be commended."
"I hope that President Kostunica and his supporters will steadily consolidate their position as the new democratic leadership in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at all political levels."
"Elections for the Serbian Parliament are scheduled to take place on 23 December."
"I welcome the fact that President Kostunica has acknowledged the importance of cooperating with the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague."
"An invitation has been extended to President Kostunica to participate, as the new President of Yugoslavia, at the forthcoming Zagreb summit."
"This summit, instead of being a showcase award for Croatia's efforts towards democratisation, will now inevitably shift towards celebrating President Kostunica's achievements."
"It is very important to assure the other Balkan participants that the return of Yugoslavia to the international community will in no way lessen their support from the European Union."
"Due attention must be paid to the sensitivities of all countries in the Balkan region and to assure them that they will not be neglected in the general euphoria over President Kostunica's accession to power."
"Other objectives of the Zagreb summit must include an announcement of the Community assistance and reconstruction, democratisation and stabilisation programmes for the Western Balkans, a confirmation of the progressive establishment of a free trading zone between the European Union and the Western Balkans and a commitment by the countries in the region for regional cooperation and to putting in place a free trading regime between them."
"This debate is now suspended and will be resumed at 9.00 p.m."
"Ms Pack wishes to make a point of order."
"Please make sure it is a point of order and not a continuation of the debate with Mr Moscovici."
"Unfortunately, Mr Moscovici was not here when I spoke."
"I should like him to tell me if he supports the addition of another objective to the objectives listed in the CARDS programme, namely support for education and training in south-east Europe."
"This is an important new objective in the CARDS programme."
"The Commission is in favour and I should like very much to know if the Council is too."
"This is an interesting question in my view, and one which I believe has the Commission' s support."
"We shall therefore study it within the Council."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0553/2000). We shall examine questions to the Council."
"Question No 1 by (H-0818/00):"
"Subject: Rapid Reaction Facility Why has this proposal not been discussed formally under the French Council Presidency, although work had certainly begun on this issue under its predecessors?"
"On 10 May, the Commission presented a proposal to Coreper aimed at setting up a rapid reaction facility with a view to meeting the expectations expressed by Heads of State and Government at Helsinki."
"During the European Council, within the framework of the report on the development of European facilities for military and civilian crisis management, it was suggested that rapid financing mechanisms, such as the creation by the Commission of a rapid reaction fund, should be set up to speed up the provision of finance to support European Union activities, to contribute to operations run by other international organisations and to fund NGO activities, where appropriate."
"In line with the mandate given by Coreper, studies of this project are being carried out by the group of Foreign Affairs Ministers."
"It was first examined on 6 November."
"The aim is to adopt a regulation as soon as possible but, in order to achieve this, the Council must have Parliament' s opinion in due form."
"Thank you for that reply."
"When I tabled this question there was in fact a log-jam in the Council and there was no discussion, which was the purpose for tabling the question."
"But I welcome the fact that now there is movement within the Council and that we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs actually have a copy of your latest document saying what the compromise looks to be."
"Mr President-in-Office, you want Parliament's opinion and we understand you propose taking a decision next month in December."
"If I tell you that Parliament will be debating this in January, I should like to know if you will wait for our opinion before you take your decision?"
"I can only repeat what I said in the conclusion of my reply, namely that we aim to adopt a regulation as soon as possible, but, in order to do so, the Council has to have the European Parliament' s opinion in due form."
"This is essential."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 2 and 3 will be taken together."
"Question No 2 by (H-0819/00):"
"Subject: Western Sahara On 13-15 September a delegation from the European Parliament' s Intergroup on Peace for the Sahrawi People, in which I participated, visited the Sahrawi refugee camps in South-Eastern Algeria."
"There we met the highest authorities of the RASD (Sahrawi Democratic Republic), including its president, and representatives of Minurso."
"Minurso has done remarkable work in identifying people with a view to drawing up electoral lists prior to the holding of the referendum on self-determination referred to in the UN Secretary-General' s settlement plan signed by the Moroccan Government and the Polisario Front."
"However, the very large number of objections raised - particularly from Morocco - is clearly an obstacle to holding this referendum in practice."
"The delegation noted the terrible living conditions of the refugees."
"The constant postponement of the referendum, and the failure of negotiations in Berlin on 28 September 2000, are raising serious concerns and engendering deep disappointment among the people."
"We also noted that there were high expectations of a clearer commitment by European Union to settling this conflict which, which is an obstacle to any prospect of stability in the region."
"Reiterating the calls made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000, what initiatives does the Presidency of the European Council propose to take with a view to playing a more active role so as to guarantee the full and complete application of the UN peace plan?"
"Question No 3 by (H-0846/00):"
"Subject: Referendum on self-determination for Western Sahara The talks under way between the international mediator, UN Secretary­General special envoy James Baker, and the parties in dispute over the holding of a referendum on self­determination for Western Sahara, are in a state of deadlock."
"At the meeting held on 28 September in Berlin, the Moroccan authorities suggested that they might end their support for the peace plan for organisation of the referendum."
"The President of the Commission is scheduled to visit Morocco and Algeria in November."
"What action is the Council taking or does it intend to take in support of the peace plan, in order that the referendum may be held as soon as possible and the dangers for the region of renewed conflict thus avoided?"
"What is the Council's political assessment of the current impasse and how does it intend to contribute to a fair solution to the conflict?"
"The Council of the European Union supports the process set in motion by the United Nations."
"It also supports the current endeavours of the UN Secretary-General' s Special Envoy, Mr James Baker - who seems somewhat concerned with other matters at present but this will soon change - to find a fair and mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara question."
"The Council seeks to help foster a climate of confidence between the parties involved and ensure that this is achieved."
"Resolving the conflict in the Western Sahara will help bring stability to the Maghreb and aid its economic and social development."
"However, the fact remains that this issue falls within the remit of the United Nations Organisation and the Special Envoy of its Secretary-General, whose perseverance in this complex matter must be supported."
"For several months, Mr Baker' s mission has been twofold; he has sought both to resolve the difficulties inherent in implementing the Settlement Plan, which should lead to a referendum on self-determination for the Sahrawi people, and to reach a political agreement."
"Both parties have just been granted a new deadline of four months - by Resolution 1324 - to try and make some progress on both counts."
"The Council, nonetheless, remains concerned by the conditions endured by the people in the camps at Tindouf from a humanitarian point of view and in terms of food supplies."
"The active commitment of the European Union in this regard is worth highlighting, as it is the largest provider of humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi refugees through its ECHO programme, through which EUR 10.58 million have been allocated for the period 1999-2000."
"In addition to this, EUR 9 million if aid is being provided as of November 2000 for a period of eight months."
"Thank you for your reply."
"You referred to a mutually acceptable solution."
"I myself have visited the camps at Tindouf where this extremely difficult situation has been going on for 25 years."
"It must be noted, however, that one of the parties involved, Morocco in this instance, that has diplomatic weight and the wheels of state at its disposal, is making less of an effort to ensure that the peace plan, in other words the Houston agreements that it did, in fact, sign, is implemented."
"It continues to talk about the problem of territorial integrity, a term used by the King, particularly during his last official speech."
"Now, the issue relates to the self-determination of a nation and the implementation of United Nations resolutions."
"Whatever the result of the referendum - independence or annexation to Morocco - it seems to me that democracy is what will finally resolve this conflict most effectively."
"Otherwise, the exacerbation of current tensions and the possible return to arms would be dangerous for the region as a whole at a time when we are discussing - and we were even doing so earlier in this Chamber - the resumption of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"How can we even consider reviving this partnership without first resolving the conflict?"
"We are well aware of the close links between the European Union and Morocco and, in particular, between France and Morocco, which is why I wanted to ask Mr Moscovici if he could inform us as to the content and nature of negotiations that he is currently holding with the Moroccan Government on the Western Sahara question."
"At the end of the meeting held in Berlin on 28 September 2000, as you will be aware, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Morocco made a speech in which he reasserted his willingness to do everything possible in order to find a sustainable and definitive solution."
"Mr Rabat now seems to have realised that this proposal did not meet either the UN Secretary-General or his Special Envoy' s expectations, and that it should have formed the basis for seeking a just and definitive solution to the problem."
"As a result, Morocco dispatched its Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation to New York on 26 October to attend a private meeting with the Security Council after a similar meeting was held with the Secretary-General of the Polisario Front on 19 October."
"During his speech, Mr Ben Aïssa stated that a complete file on the scope and content of Morocco' s proposal would be presented the next time the parties met under the auspices of Mr Baker."
"According to Mr Ben Aïssa, all Morocco had done at the meeting in Berlin was to put forward a proposal for dialogue and sketched an outline of what its content should be."
"France is of the opinion that the willingness Morocco demonstrated in Berlin constitutes an initial step towards finding a way out of the current deadlock the settlement process has reached, and it must be considered as the basis for finding a solution."
"However, more details need to be provided and the substance of its content improved if it is to constitute a genuine political offer that can be considered by all of the parties involved."
"This is the message we have given our counterparts in Morocco."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I think the EU would have far more influence in the Maghreb if there were stronger links with the reform process in Morocco."
"I should like to ask about progress with the association agreement with Morocco."
"As you know, we have already debated the fisheries agreement."
"That is another problem which needs to be resolved."
"But the question of the association agreement is, I think, extremely urgent."
"Question No 4 by (H-0820/00):"
"Subject: The safe transport of radioactive materials in the EU What consultations took place between the Council (Transport, Environment and Energy Ministers), and the French Presidency and the Standing Working group (of experts) on the safe Transport of Radioactive Materials in the EU, prior to - or subsequent to - the announcement by the German Government in September 2000 that it intended to resume the cross-border transport of radioactive materials, which was suspended in May 1998 because of safety concerns?"
"The transport of radioactive materials in France is carried out in accordance with the legislation in force and, in particular, Council Directive 94/55/EC of 21 November 1994 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, and Council Directive 96/49/EC of 23 July 1996 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail, which apply to the transport of radioactive materials and set out various technical requirements in relation to vehicles, brands and packing."
"The organisation of the transport of radioactive materials between France and Germany has been the subject of bilateral negotiations between the two countries, in which neither the Council of Ministers, nor the French Presidency-in-Office as such, were involved."
"I can simply point out the fact that France and Germany - and here I am no longer speaking as President-in-Office of the Council - raised these questions during a bilateral summit in Vittel last week, where it was decided to form a working group in order to find a solution to the problem."
"I regret to inform the Minister that he really has not answered my question."
"I asked what consultations took place between the Council, the French Presidency and the standing working group of experts."
"I asked that question because just three weeks after the Council's expert group, the standing working group on the safe transport of radioactive materials, published a report in April 1998 giving a clean bill of health to the way nuclear wastes were transported, the transports were found to be contaminated, as the Minister very well knows."
"As they are about to be resumed, so we hear - and I am glad to hear all these consultations are taking place - can we place any credibility in the working group on waste?"
"It said everything was hunky-dory but then the transports were found to be contaminated."
"In the light of that, why are there only representatives from the nuclear industry and government on this working group of experts?"
"Why cannot we have independent experts who have detailed information which could be relevant?"
"Could I ask the Minister to answer to the point?"
"We have decided, I repeat, to set up a working group."
"Generally speaking, this is a bilateral issue, but, rest assured, it is one we indeed intend to resolve."
"I am not saying this to rule out certain considerations but in order to put an end to the problem."
"Question No 5 by (H-0826/00):"
"Subject: EU initiatives in dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan Recently, following many years of conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan - which have resulted in devastating economic stagnation and severe damage to the social fabric of the two countries - there have been signs of reciprocal attempts at rapprochement to break the current deadlock between the two countries and embark on reconstruction."
"According to the International Herald Tribune of 7 September 2000, the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan, Robert Kocharian and Heydar Aliyev respectively, have had at least 11 meetings with each other in recent times."
"The EU has so far remained a passive onlooker in the face of the two countries' endeavours and has taken no initiative, leaving the field open for other strategic players to make moves in their own interests."
"What diplomatic initiatives will the Council take to further the rapprochement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, settle their bilateral differences, and promote cooperation between the two countries?"
"The stability and development of the Caucasus are one of the European Union' s strategic priorities."
"As you will be aware, the European Union supports the mediation efforts currently in progress with a view to finding a political solution to all of the conflicts in the region, on the basis of respect for the territorial integrity of the states concerned and an appropriate degree of autonomy."
"The Union is therefore closely monitoring contacts between Armenia and Azerbaijan with a view to finding a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which is why it welcomes the meetings that have regularly taken place between the two Presidents and hopes that they will lead to a political solution."
"The European Union remains convinced that the Minsk Group of the OSCE has a central role to play in finding a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, in spite of the fact that the solutions put forward by this group in 1997 and 1998 were both rejected by Erevan and Baku."
"The European Union is also using all of the instruments at its disposal within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement to help improve relations between the two countries."
"Thanks to the various opportunities for cooperation, it has been possible to establish regular political dialogue with the aim of facilitating exchanges between Armenia and Azerbaijan."
"At the same time, the Union continues to provide substantial material aid to both countries through its various programmes, in particular its TACIS programme."
"It has offered to finance cross-border projects of common interest in an attempt to re-establish good neighbourly relations between the two countries."
"The commitment of the European Union has been publicly acknowledged by Armenia and Azerbaijan, who have both asserted their willingness to work towards a rapprochement between their countries and the European Union."
"The President-in-Office's reply, I am sorry to say, is far from satisfactory."
"It smacks of formal, departmental despatches rather than political initiative."
"The Caucasus needs a more extensive plan and more extensive initiatives if it is to be stabilised."
"And a European Union which - from what I have read in the newspapers - recently changed its strategy on its energy problems and is now looking more towards the former Soviet Union - with all the implications which that has for the region in general - obviously cannot remain passive and fail to react to developments."
"So from this point of view, and because, of course, the question was not asked in order to elicit an expression of satisfaction that everything is just fine but in order to express a concern, I think that it could be used as the starting point for an integrated policy, such as that which we have been debating recently for the Balkans; in other words, a new stability agreement for the Caucasus, at the political initiative of the European Union and with political objectives and priorities concerning development, autonomy and democracy in this region."
"Mr President, I shall start by reiterating the question put by Mr Souladakis, i.e. what sort of initiatives has the European Union taken on this major problem, which has reduced a rich region to this sorry state?"
"More specifically, because one of the main issues which is causing problems in the region is the embargo which Turkey has imposed on Armenia, I should like to ask the President-in-Office if, during the negotiations and discussions being held with Turkey at the moment, the question has been raised, albeit academically, of Turkey's lifting its embargo on Armenia, which is reducing the country to poverty and misery."
"I understand the concerns expressed by Mr Souladakis and Mr Alavanos, but I do not have anything to add regarding the action taken by the European Union as it has been carried out."
"As regards discussions with Turkey, we have just held an important debate on this issue and you are well aware of the European Union' s position with regard to this matter."
"As the author is not present, Question No 6 lapses."
"Question No 7 by (H-0832/00):"
"Subject: Legislative proposals to prevent concealment of refugees The French Presidency has put forward several proposals to tighten up legislation applying to persons who transport or hide refugees who do not have the right to be in the EU."
"The proposals cover anyone who hides refugees, including anyone who does so without financial gain."
"The proposals also enable the Member States to impose various penalties on or even disband organisations which hide refugees."
"Does the Presidency consider that this option to disband organisations should also extend to non-profit organisations such as churches, monasteries and parties?"
"The tragic events in Dover last June were a cruel reminder of the need to fight more effectively against illegal immigration rings."
"The European Council in Feira last June called upon the Council to speed up the implementation of measures combating illegal rings, provided for in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999."
"The measures to which the author of the question refers comprise a draft Council Directive aimed at defining the concept of the facilitation of unauthorised entry, movement and residence and a draft framework decision designed specifically to strengthen the penal framework combating the facilitation of unauthorised entry and illegal residence as defined therein."
"These texts, which have been submitted to the European Parliament for consultation, are currently being examined by the relevant groups within the Council."
"They are essentially aimed at combating the trafficking of human beings, which occurs through the facilitation of illegal immigration by organised rings."
"The aim is to disband and punish those criminal organisations that are involved in this type of traffic."
"The question raised therefore provides the Presidency-in-Office with an opportunity to clarify several points."
"The texts concerned are not aimed at preventing potential refugees from exercising their right to seek asylum on Union territory."
"Mr Sjöstedt will agree, in fact, that a potential refugee is not ipso facto an illegal immigrant."
"What is more, these texts are not designed to prevent non-profit making organisations from carrying out their work, provided, of course, that they comply with the laws in force."
"It is therefore a matter of fighting against criminal organisations that are involved in the trafficking of human beings, not disbanding non-governmental, charitable, political and denominational organisations, except of course - though I cannot imagine this ever happening - in the event of their activities serving as a cover for illegal acts."
"We agree that the situation in Dover calls for a reaction on our part, but I also think it shows something else."
"In the Danish media, we have heard a 14 year-old Afghan boy say that, if you have to become a refugee, you need an agent."
"The word 'agent' was his own, but to some extent it shows how difficult it is for refugees in fact to make their way to a place in which they can request asylum, and that is of course where the whole problem lies."
"I should like to ask how the Council views the fact that this further contributes to criminalising humanitarian actions."
"It is as if we stand midstream at a place where two currents, formed of immigrants and refugees, often combine."
"What is the Council thinking of?"
"If this area is further criminalised, the result will be to have contributed to a situation in which only unscrupulous and cynical people and those out to make money from the situation will stay behind."
"Is it really the Council' s policy to help bring about a situation in which the money of poor and persecuted people ends up in the clutches of the mafia and similar organisations?"
"I think that the European texts are intended to encourage each Member State to take the necessary measures to ensure that the act of facilitating, directly or indirectly, the unauthorised entry, movement or residence in its territory of an alien who is not a national of a Member State of the European Union is regarded as an offence."
"This is the general philosophy behind them."
"Mr President, I welcome the Council's response to the original question."
"I just want the Minister to re-emphasise that this proposed legislation is aimed at those who exploit and make profit out of people in a desperate situation and is not aimed at further criminalising the immigrant or potential immigrant."
"It is about stopping gangs making money out of immigrants."
"That is what happened in Dover."
"It was organised business that ended up with people dying in the back of a truck because people were making money out of them."
"That is what we must end."
"Would the Council also - and this is where I agree with Mrs Frahm - encourage the Member States to differentiate more clearly between asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants?"
"At the moment it seems that Member States are beginning to forget their international obligations."
"We have an international obligation to treat asylum-seekers properly and to deal with them through specified procedures."
"Some Member States now seem to be confusing asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants."
"Mr Martin is right, as we are indeed concerned with fighting criminal organisations involved in the trafficking of human beings and not reviewing previous texts that enable potential refugees to exercise their right to seek asylum on Union territory."
"This is our purpose and this alone."
"I should also like to add that these two texts focus, in particular, on strengthening the framework of criminal law in order to fight organised rings of facilitators."
"It is precisely this type of act and this type of organisation that we resolutely wish to combat."
"Mr President, Minister, even if I have now been given explanations, I do not properly understand why this imprecise and to some extent inhumane proposal has been tabled at all."
"Would it not be more sensible and more appropriate for the EU' s governments and the Council of Ministers to reflect upon why people are forced to find their way illegally to Europe?"
"I should like to ask the minister how many countries there are whose citizens are at present required by the EU' s Member States to have entry visas. Is it 10, 50 or perhaps 100 countries?"
"According to the latest information I have, it is 127 countries."
"Is this figure correct?"
"If so, do you think this is reasonable, and do you believe it is in keeping with a humane asylum policy?"
"I have nothing further to add."
"Question No 8 by (H-0836/00):"
"Subject: 'Crimes of honour' in Turkey Every year, dozens of women fall victim to 'crimes of honour' in Turkey."
"Although Turkish law confers the same rights on women as men, in practice many men continue to condemn women to death for being raped, committing adultery or simply for meeting other men."
"The men who commit the murders rarely receive long prison sentences, some get off with as little as two years."
"The new legislation being drafted in Turkey, which prohibits reduced sentences, is necessary but it is even more important that Muslim leaders officially condemn 'crimes of honour', which are a direct violation of Islam."
"There is a need both for legislation and measures to stimulate debate and increase awareness."
"What will the Council do to encourage Turkey to take effective measures to combat 'crimes of honour'?"
". (FR) Mrs Theorin has drawn the Council' s attention to the issue of crimes of honour in Turkey."
"Such practices appear to be in sharp decline and, we are told, only occur sporadically in rural areas."
"However, these crimes continue to be a source of concern for the Council as they are often committed in the most appalling circumstances."
"The Turkish Government has undertaken significant reforms aimed at fighting such acts more effectively, acts which are, of course, not permitted by national law."
"The report that was adopted by the Turkish cabinet on 21 September as a reform programme contains several planned amendments to the law, such as the inclusion of measures in the Civil Code that are designed to enhance effective equality between men and women in social and educational fields, ways to better combat domestic violence by training judges that specialise in family matters and, lastly, measures to prevent people that have committed crimes of honour from serving reduced sentences."
"Rest assured that the Council will remain particularly vigilant as to the implementation of these measures that are in line with the Copenhagen criteria, as discussed at length earlier on."
"In any case, the issue of crimes of honour is not a problem that is specific to Turkey, as these crimes occur in many other places around the world."
"The Council has therefore supported the Dutch initiative aimed at the introduction this year, within the framework of the third committee of the United Nations General Assembly, of a draft resolution against these crimes, which is still in the process of being examined."
"The Council notes that Turkey has also given its support to this initiative."
"Without pretending to understand how so barbaric a phenomenon as crimes of honour can be explained, it can be seen how, every year, dozens of Turkish women are murdered in cold blood by their brothers, fathers, cousins or husbands, with the express motive of maintaining the family' s honour."
"For the family - and especially for the men of the family - status, credit and honour reside in having a large number of possessions, including female family members."
"According to this view, male family members have a right and a duty to take the life of a female family member who, for some reason, reduces her value as an unviolated woman."
"It makes no great difference whether she has transgressed voluntarily or against her will, that is to say been raped."
"It is good that the Council should point out the initiatives taken."
"It is important to prohibit reduced sentences, but it is still more important to counter the general acceptance of crimes of honour."
"My question to the Council is this: Are you prepared to make efforts to put a stop to the spiral of violence by, for example, demanding that Muslim leaders officially distance themselves from crimes of honour?"
"In my view, we must indeed do everything within our power, absolutely everything, to combat such crimes, and I note that the Council, the United Nations General Assembly and the Turkish Government, as far as I know, are prepared to do this."
"Such retrograde practices which have no place in a modern world cannot continue."
"Question No 9 by (H-0839/00):"
"Subject: Attitude of French European Affairs Minister, Pierre Moscovici, to Austria In an interview with the French TV channel France 3, the French European Affairs Minister, Pierre Moscovici, affirmed yet again his rejection of the Austrian Federal Government."
"He continued moreover to assert that the government coalition between the ÖVP (Austrian People's Party) and the FPÖ (Freedom Party of Austria) was 'abnormal' and that the FPÖ was a 'racist and xenophobic party'."
"How can the Council justify the situation where an official representative of the French Presidency of the Council can, notwithstanding the favourable verdict handed down in the experts' report on Austria and the consequent lifting of the unjustified 'sanctions' against Austria, continue unopposed publicly to assert such a rejectionist, aggressive and offensive attitude to another European Union country that is a full member on an equal footing?"
"Can the Council clarify whether those statements by the French European Affairs Minister also represent the attitude of the French EU Council Presidency, or if this was the expression of a private opinion by Mr Moscovici?"
"Can the Council confirm that Austria and its Federal Government will suffer no disadvantages or unequal treatment in the pursuit of major, large-scale European projects as a consequence of Mr Moscovici's statements and attitude?"
"When will the Council publicly distance itself from Mr Moscovici's statements and clarify its reactions to them?"
"It is true that when I first saw this question I did wonder what the French European Affairs Minister had said as he - and I quote the question - 'affirmed once again his rejection of the Austrian Federal Government."
"He continued moreover to assert that the government coalition between the ÖVP (Austrian People' s Party) and the FPÖ (Freedom Party of Austria) was abnormal and that the FPÖ was a racist and xenophobic party.'"
"The author of the question continued: 'How can the Council justify the situation where an official representative of the French Presidency of the Council continues, unopposed, to assert such a rejectionist, aggressive and offensive attitude towards another EU country which is a full member on an equal footing?"
"Can the Council clarify whether those statements made by the French European Affairs Minister also represent the attitude of the French EU Council Presidency, or whether this was the expression of Mr Moscovici's private opinion?"
"Lastly, can the Council confirm that Austria and its Federal Government will suffer no disadvantage and no unequal treatment in the pursuit of major, large-scale European projects as a consequence of Mr Moscovici' s statements and attitude?"
"When will the Council publicly distance itself from Moscovici' s statements and clarify its reactions to them?'"
"Not this evening, and here I come to my answer, as I know the Minister and I can give you the Council' s response."
"In response to the question posed by Mr Karas, the Presidency-in-Office should like to highlight the fact that the political situation in Austria and the sanctions imposed bilaterally by the other Member States and then lifted were not carried out at the Council' s instigation, precisely because they were bilateral measures."
"The Presidency-in-Office therefore has no answer to give with regard to this point."
"However, it goes without saying that, as the sanctions have been lifted, it is no longer an issue of making Austria suffer any disadvantage or unequal treatment because the sanctions are no longer in place."
"On the other hand, and speaking on a more personal level, I can confirm that the statements this Minister made on France 3 clearly reflect his personal opinion on the matter."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, it is clear from your reply that you personally are holding the Council to ransom."
"It is also clear that your personal prejudices, which bear no relation to the situation in Austria and contradict the experts' report, also have a great deal of influence on your function as President-in-Office, as can be seen from your itinerary in preparation for the French President's and the President-in-Office's tour des capitales."
"My question, therefore, is when do you intend to start performing all your duties in a way which reflects the spirit of Robert Schuman, the content of the experts' report and the situation in Austria, and leaving your personal prejudices to one side?"
"I have no personal views on this particular matter, though I, like everybody else, both here and elsewhere, am at liberty to make a political analysis on the nature of government."
"What is more, I note that the wise men have spoken and that, for example, the adjectives 'racist' and 'xenophobic' were used in their report, albeit as part of a question."
"With regard to the other points, I can assure you that as President-in-Office, these personal view points have no bearing whatsoever on matters. I repeat: none whatsoever."
"The Austrian Government is the legitimate government of a country in the European Union and it is up to us whether we approve or disapprove of the way it is made up."
"It is precisely because the other 14 Member States disapproved that they imposed sanctions against it."
"These sanctions are no longer in place today and, as a result, we shall treat this government as we do any other."
"This, moreover, has always been the case within the European Union, as the sanctions taken against Austria were done so on a bilateral basis, which is something I should like to stress."
"You therefore have my full assurance that, within the framework of the European Union, the Austrian Government is considered to be on a completely equal footing with all of the other countries and it participates in all of the Council meetings that are held under the auspices of this Presidency."
"The term of the Head of State and President of the Republic, Jacques Chirac, will, of course, come to an end at Vienna, this is clear."
"I should like to mention that the President of the Republic will be accompanied, as is usually the case, by one of his government ministers, either the Minister for Foreign Affairs or myself."
"Next week, a meeting of the European Conference will take place on my invitation in France, in other words a meeting with the candidate countries."
"I have been informed that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner intends to come and I will be only too pleased to see her."
"All of this shows therefore that we need to clarify several facts."
"On one hand there is the French Presidency of the European Union, which has to fulfil its duties and do so in a wholly objective manner, and on the other hand there is the political opinion that any politician may impart with regard to a political situation, which is something I am not to change."
"Mr President, I share the President-in-Office's view that extreme right-wing parties in governments have lost nothing; nor could they in Austria because extreme right-wing parties are banned in Austria."
"My question to the President-in-Office is this: how is it that extreme right-wing parties are not banned in France and what is the President-in-Office's opinion of extreme left-wing parties in government?"
"Allow me a brief comment, Mr President: I love France, I love the French and the charm of French men is, as a rule - I repeat, as a rule - unsurpassed."
"The digressions on France and the charm of French men are all very interesting in this Parliament, but the President-in-Office of the Council must answer in his capacity as such."
"Not as a French male nor in terms of domestic politics."
"I simply wondered why you used 'for example' with regard to your reference about the charming nature of the French, as I thought charm was a general characteristic; at least I hoped it was."
"As regards the issue in question, I simply wanted to say that there was no discrimination being made against any particular country."
"If, for example, and here I am talking as a Minister, France was to elect an extreme right-wing party to office tomorrow, I would hope that the other countries would take measures against it similar to those taken against Austria."
"This demonstrates therefore that one country is not being singled out for discrimination over another."
"The European Union has certain values, which make it difficult for it to accept some countries taking on particular responsibilities."
"That is the political position."
"Having said that, I should like to make it clear, Mrs Flemming, that, in general, I like Austria and Austrian people."
"Mr President, institutional reform is on the agenda for Nice."
"Do you think that the Austrian model, i.e. bilateral majority resolutions, will be used in future as a way of passing resolutions which bypass the European institutions and of forming a new institution or a new group in order to circumvent unanimity in the Council?"
"I have a supplementary question: how do you behave towards extreme left-wing parties and what is your opinion of them?"
"I shall answer your first point very clearly."
"These bilateral sanctions have demonstrated their scope and limitations."
"They were imposed and then lifted and, in my view, show that we need to submit proposals for the creation of legal mechanism to be provided for in the treaties."
"In this regard, several countries, including Austria, have put forward proposals to amend Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, in order to set up a prevention and warning mechanism which would mean that a country considered to be out of step with the values of the European Union can receive recommendations while at the same time having its point of view heard."
"This was the proposal put forward by the Austrian Government, for example."
"I can assure you that this proposal has been fully considered and, in my view, we should seek to amend the Treaty along such lines, within the framework of the IGC."
"As regards the other points, I have not used the words 'extreme left' and 'extreme right' here because this would run the risk of a debate on the definition of both notions."
"When you say that extreme right-wing parties are banned in Austria, that is all well and good, but one might also question what does or does not constitute the notion of the extreme right."
"I personally wanted to talk about values: I have spoken about values as they appear in our texts and I have spoken about the values that appear in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I have spoken, in particular, it is true, about the fight against all forms of discrimination, as appears on the title page of all European texts and which is something we should ensure is respected."
"Question No 10 by (H-0842/00):"
"Subject: Council reply to letter from the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr Cem In a supplementary question (Question Time of 5 September 2000 - Question H-610/00) I had the opportunity to ask the President-in-Office of the Council about the Council's response to the letter sent by the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr Cem, to the 15 Foreign Ministers of the European Union in which he sought to promote his own interpretation of the Helsinki Summit conclusions."
"The President-in-Office's reply that he did not have the specific answer to this question and his general statement that the Helsinki conclusions were the common point of reference of both parties certainly did not constitute an answer to the very specific observations made by Mr Cem in his letter."
"Will the Council give its response to the assertion in Mr Cem's letter that in the partnership agreement there can be no link-up between the Cyprus problem and EU-Turkey relations and that such a link-up would constitute a violation of the terms of the Helsinki conclusions?"
"The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Cem, did in fact send a letter to his counterparts in the Member States of the European Union."
"The Council did not receive a copy of this letter but the Presidency has, of course, replied to Mr Cem and all of the Member States were informed about the content of the reply given."
"As regards the Accession Partnership with Turkey to which you referred, the Commission put forward its proposals on 8 November at the same time as it submitted its report on the progress made by each of the 13 applicant States regarding their application for membership."
"The Council must now examine these proposals."
"The Presidency still aims to adopt the partnership during the General Affairs Council on 20 November, which is why perhaps the issue was not dealt with in detail in the answer Mr Vedrine gave to Mr Cem."
"The Presidency has, however, stressed in this instance how important it is for this partnership to become a useful mechanism in defining Turkey' s future national programme for adopting the Community acquis and for implementing its pre-accession strategy, in accordance with the terms and spirit of the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council."
"I also think that the debate we had earlier on Turkey shows the spirit in which the Council and the Commission wish to work."
"I thank the President-in-Office, who rightly referred to the proposal for a Council decision on the Accession Partnership, which is a new element."
"Hence, my questions are quite specific and are based on the Commission text."
"First, how can the Council possibly accept a text on Turkey in which the word minority and the word Kurd are nowhere to be found?"
"Secondly, how can the Council possibly accept a text in which the long-term objectives scarcely mention the Helsinki position on border disputes between a candidate country and a Member State of the European Union?"
"And thirdly, how can this sort of text simply include the Commission's ridiculous statement on the Cyprus question to the effect that Turkey has to support the efforts of the Secretary-General of the UN rather than accept a solution based on the resolutions of the UN?"
"On the issue of minorities and, in particular, the Kurdish question, I think that anyone listening to the debate which took place earlier will be well aware that both the Commission and the Council are aware of these issues and have duly taken them into consideration."
"With regard to the political solution of the Cyprus question to which you referred, Mr Alavanos, it will of course continue to be an issue of debate with Turkey as we confirmed at Helsinki."
"I should like to remind you that this political dialogue constitutes, along with the future Accession Partnership, one of the elements in Turkey' s pre-accession strategy, which was set out on this occasion."
"Next Monday' s General Affairs Council on 20 November will specifically debate the proposal for an Accession Partnership that the Commission has just put forward, which contains extremely clear, explicit, specific references to the Helsinki conclusions."
"It is in this spirit that we must proceed, and the Presidency-in-Office of the Council will do everything possible to reach the right agreement."
"Mr President, I am surprised."
"The situation, and I should like a response to it from the minister, is this: First, the Helsinki conclusions state that resolving the Cyprus problem is not a precondition to the accession of Cyprus."
"But the Cyprus problem is not just any old problem."
"It is the specific problem of the invasion and occupation of a significant part of the territory of a country which is a member of the UN and a candidate for membership of the European Union by another country which is also a member of the UN and also a candidate for membership of the European Union."
"Are we are saying that the Cyprus question can be resolved without ending the occupation?"
"And what is his opinion of Mr Cem's position - the President-in-Office did not reply here - that there can be no link-up between the Cyprus question and furthering the Accession Partnership between Turkey and the European Union?"
"In other words, is it possible that this partnership will be furthered and that Turkey will join the European Union without ceasing to occupy Cyprus and removing its settlers from Cyprus?"
"If that is the case, you can hardly blame us for seeing the European Union as an imperialist organisation."
"I attended the Helsinki European Council and was present when these issues were debated."
"I know that we accepted - and when I say we I mean the 15 Member States, including Greece therefore - Turkey' s application."
"We based our acceptance on some very precise conclusions that committed us and continue to commit us to the process."
"This is what this is about, and nothing else."
"There was a translation error."
"I did not say that it is true that there is an imperialist regime in Turkey, but I did say that if the European Union accepted this rationale, in other words, the possibility of Turkey joining the European Union while it still occupied a large part of Cyprus, you cannot blame us for considering the European Union' s actions as imperialist."
"There was no translation error in my reply."
"As the author is not present, Question No 11 lapses."
"Question No 12 by (H-0850/00):"
"Subject: Repercussions and features of Fisheries Agreement with Morocco Do the most recent negotiations between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco on securing a Fisheries Agreement suggest that such an agreement could be reached before the end of November 2000?"
"What would be the features of this new Fisheries Agreement?"
"Does it cover the sector' s basic needs? Does it give priority to meeting the needs of the Objective 1 regions concerned?"
"The Community aims to complete negotiations as soon as possible with a view to concluding a new Fisheries Agreement with Morocco."
"In this regard, the calendar for negotiations that was recently set included one meeting per week, so we can be fairly optimistic that negotiations will be swiftly concluded."
"Even though it is difficult at present to envisage the final details of such an agreement, it seems clear that we need to establish a framework for cooperation and partnership in the area of fisheries that is broader than the previous agreement, and extend it to encompass all of the fisheries sector."
"The agreement will also take into consideration the need to ensure the sustainable use of resources and aid the development of the Moroccan fisheries sector."
"Although it is still too early to assess the features of the future agreement in relation to the expectations of the sector, the Council can, however, assure Mrs Izquierdo Rojo that the Community' s priority is to safeguard the interests of the Community sector as regards the practice of sustainable fishing in Moroccan waters."
"The Council, I can assure you, is well aware of the needs of all of the regions concerned, particularly those whose economies are main contributors to this agreement."
"The Community will ensure that these needs are taken into consideration in the agreement."
"Mr President, I am very grateful to the President of the Council for such a positive and to some extent optimistic and encouraging answer."
"It must be remembered that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more than a simple fisheries agreement; as he knows, if this agreement were not reached, bearing in mind its significance, this fact might conceal a deterioration in the relations between the European Union and Morocco."
"I should like to ask him if in the coming weeks the French Presidency is going to push for this agreement to be concluded at last."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is essential that the French Presidency should push hard along this home straight because Commissioner Fischler lacks the Mediterranean imagination needed to be able to secure an agreement."
"He is less likely to succeed in something which is purely Mediterranean, than Pitres, a village up in the Alpujarra mountains in Granada, is in getting its own port, or even the expansion of its port."
"In view of this situation, my question is whether the French Presidency, which does have the will and the imagination, will make it possible for us to achieve a fisheries agreement, which is now vital after eleven months of having our fleet tied up."
"Andalusia and Galicia, Objective 1 regions, need it and there are many other Europeans working at sea and on land who need this to succeed."
"I do not know, especially as it is not exactly a Mediterranean who is negotiating this Fisheries Agreement but the Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries, Mr Franz Fischler."
"However, I doubt very much that this will hinder his imagination in this case."
"My reply was not really meant to be a show of optimism or hope, rather the expression of a desire, the desire of the French Presidency of the European Union, to reach an agreement, a sound agreement."
"What is a sound agreement?"
"It is one that respects Community ideals and shows concern for the interests of all of the European Union' s regions. I have, of course, listened to your concerns, which will indeed help us secure good terms of agreement with Morocco."
"This is what we shall endeavour to do and it is along these lines that we intend to proceed and no other."
"Mr President, I am going to ask a question, do not worry."
"Anyway, allow me to say that Mr Fischler is neither Mediterranean nor is he from the Atlantic, and what is more we are unfortunate enough to have a Director-General for Fisheries who is from the north Atlantic and only learnt about fisheries problems when he was recently appointed to that post."
"Thus the question I ask the Minister is as follows: the proposal we know about from Morocco would in principle seem to entail cutting the fleet from Galicia, Andalusia, the Canaries, and also Portugal, that fishes in Moroccan waters, down to 25% at least."
"The agreement they propose is for two years instead of five, and in addition they want the European Union to pay them the ESP 21 billion that it is currently paying."
"Allow me to say that the political will shown in practice - not in theory - by the Community negotiators has been absolutely nil, or in any case inadequate."
"I must therefore express my scepticism about the result."
"I ask the Minister: do you believe it is acceptable to negotiate the cuts I have mentioned and the continuing cost to the European Union of the agreement with Morocco?"
". (FR) My comments as to this person' s Nordic or Mediterranean origins were made in response to a quip made by the President - it was a quip in itself."
"The Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries acts on behalf of all of the European Union, irrespective of whether he comes from the north, south, east or west."
"I can simply remind you how negotiations developed on the subject of fisheries."
"Commissioner Fischler held several meetings with the highest authorities in Morocco."
"Two technical meetings took place in Rabat on 25 July 2000 and in Brussels on 27 and 28 September 1999."
"During these technical meetings, the Community delegation, headed by Director General Smith, put forward several initiatives that it envisaged as part of a new Fisheries Agreement with Morocco to aid the development of the Moroccan fisheries sector."
"It also tried to set out a calendar for negotiations."
"On this occasion, it must be said that Morocco did not respond to the offer made by the Community."
"The impression that the negotiations had collapsed, which affected all of us, led Commissioner Fischler to call for another meeting with Prime Minister Youssoufi, to take place on 16 October 2000, where he met King Mohammed VI, Prime Minister Youssoufi and the new Minister for Fisheries, Mr Chbaatores."
"These meetings seem to have revived the negotiation process and led to another meeting with a Moroccan delegation on 30 October 2000, therefore very recently."
"This is why I think we must set a limit and not be overly optimistic, but neither do we have any reason to be unreasonably pessimistic."
"Question No 13 by (H-0854/00):"
"Subject: Fundamental rights and criminal justice Is the Council aware that conditions of pre-trial detention of foreign truck-drivers arrested at ports on the English Channel commonly fail to comply with all the conditions laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights concerning arrest and concerning the right to a fair trial?"
"Is the Council aware of similar grave concern in relation to the Portuguese criminal justice system?"
"Will the Council therefore defer any proposals for mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters until minimum human rights requirements are fully observed in all Member States?"
"Mr President, it is not the place of the Council to comment on behaviour observed on the territory of any Member State which contravenes the principles enunciated in the European Convention on Human Rights which each Member State has duly signed and ratified."
"It is worth pointing out that the principle of the mutual recognition of criminal decisions, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, must make it possible to reinforce cooperation between Member States while at the same time reinforcing the protection of human rights."
"The principle of the mutual recognition of criminal decisions presupposes the reciprocal confidence of Member States in their own criminal justice systems."
"This confidence will depend specifically on setting minimum standards, especially in terms of procedure, which will have to be adopted as a precondition for the implementation of mutual recognition."
"The European Union Member States have a shared commitment to the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the rule of law."
"It is by remaining attentive to these values enshrined in the Treaty on European Union that the Council will continue its work in the area of the mutual recognition of criminal decisions."
"Mr President, I have on my desk a document which was presented to one of my constituents in Longuenesse jail in the north of France three months after his first detention there on suspicion of a drugs offence."
"It is in French - no translation or interpretation was provided to the person in question."
"He has now been in detention five months."
"I have a letter from the sister of another constituent of mine who draws to my attention that he has been in prison since 28 March 2000 on similar suspicion."
"No opportunity is given to such prisoners to choose their own lawyer."
"They are given a defence lawyer. The defence lawyer takes few opportunities to visit the persons or to explain the charges."
"These are citizens from Scotland where after 110 days of detention any person charged with an offence must either be brought to trial or released and never again charged with that offence."
"We do not have common standards of justice in the European Union and while we have such divergent standards and such total failure to meet the standards of Article 6 of the Convention on Human Rights, it is unacceptable to press ahead with the proposals of the Council."
". (FR) Yes, I simply wanted to say that it is precisely because we are sensitive to this issue that a programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of criminal decisions is possible."
"That is what is at issue here."
"Mr President, my point of order is that there remain twenty minutes of Question Time, there are very few Members in the House and there is no risk of exceeding time."
"I ask you to give a ruling that two supplementaries may be allowed."
"Supplementary questions must come from other Members."
"According to the Rules of Procedure, you have reformulated your question."
"Question No 14 by (H-0855/00):"
"Subject: EU's energy policy The Commissioner for Energy said recently that the energy issue in Europe was a national responsibility, not a Community one."
"At the outset of discussions for the Intergovernmental Conference (1996/1997) there was a suggestion that special provisions should be incorporated into the Treaty of Amsterdam which would pave the way for the drafting of a common energy policy."
"The suggestion was rejected by the 15 Member States, as was also the case for the Treaty of Maastricht."
"There are, naturally, measures concerning energy (the White Paper, the SAVE programme, EUR 1 billion from the Fifth Research Programme, alternative energy etc.). Despite all this, however, all the forecasts predict that the EU' s overall energy dependence (gas, oil, coal and uranium) will increase in the future."
"Given that developments in the oil markets make it necessary for the EU to adopt a more dynamic policy in the energy sector, how does the Council think it might achieve a reduction in the European economy' s dependence on oil?"
"Have specific measures been taken (such as security of supplies and energy efficiency) to make the economies of the Member States less sensitive to external crises, and what are the Council' s methods and short-term and medium-term priorities for energy efficiency and energy saving?"
"The Council is aware of the growing importance of the European Union' s overall energy dependence and would remind the honourable Member of the Council conclusions of May 2000."
"In this context, the Council attaches the greatest priority to pushing this work forward in the following areas: the promotion of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, the security of energy supplies and the diversification of energy sources."
"The competent bodies of the Council are currently working on a proposal to promote electricity from this renewable energy sources with a view to an agreement being reached at the next Council meeting in December, provided the European Parliament has given its opinion in due time."
"As to energy efficiency, the Commission presented an action plan during last May' s Council meeting."
"Based on this plan, next December the Council should be adopting conclusions containing a list of priority actions making it possible for the Commission to assess the areas where Member States would like to see Community measures or, alternatively, would prefer to confine themselves to coordinated action."
"Furthermore, in the communication adopted on 4 October 2000 on the European Union' s oil supply, the Commission indicated that, at the European Council of Göteborg, it was planning to present a plan to save energy and to promote the diversification of energy sources, which should help to boost energy efficiency, especially in buildings and transport."
"As regards the security of energy supplies, the Commission is planning to present a Green Paper, in November 2000, on the future and place of the different energy sources in the context of improving the security of the energy supply of the European Union."
"This communication will tackle both nuclear energy and renewable energies."
"Once it has been presented, the Council will certainly accord it the greatest priority."
"What is more, the Presidency has convened a conference on the security of supplies for 24 November 2000 in Paris."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I will not conceal from you that my question was designed first and foremost to elicit a list of projects and a calendar from you."
"You have presented these, and I thank you for that, but I also wanted to see if you could give us any information on, or your assessment of, whether the Council could perhaps progress towards closer cooperation, towards a sort of communitisation of energy policy given that, as we saw during the recent crisis, Member States are moving forward in a disorganised array and are competing amongst themselves in terms of both supplies and prices, and that the result for Europe as a whole is rather pathetic."
"Nor will I conceal that I was looking for, perhaps, some ideas."
"Some of my fellow Members have suggested an idea, which I too endorse, of investigating or drawing up plans towards, for example, a policy imposing the euro as the sole means of paying for oil in certain countries."
"It is these questions above all which interest me and which, I think, are of special interest to all the citizens of Europe, because this dependence is not just quantitative but also economic and financial."
"These are indeed very interesting suggestions which merit a debate, but I cannot give you an answer on behalf of the Council right now."
"Regarding energy issues in general, I do believe that we must look into presenting more of a united front, since we should at least have a coordinated approach to these problems within the European Union."
"Question No 15 by (H-0858/00):"
"Subject: New US bill enforcing embargo on Cuba A new bill being voted on in the USA has given rise to a storm of protest both in Cuba and in European."
"On the pretext of lifting the ban on sales from the USA to Cuba of primary necessities, medicines and medical equipment , the embargo is being considerably intensified and obstacles to trade are multiplying in the form of tighter restrictions on Americans travelling to Cuba, provisions - which are contrary to international trade rules - preventing US organisations and banks from financing sales, requiring guarantees by third countries or payment in cash."
"What steps will the Council take to stop the adoption of this US bill, which is in breach of international trade rules, and what action will it take to secure the total lifting of the embargo on Cuba and the restoration of normal trade relations between Cuba and all other countries, in particular the Member States of the European Union?"
"The measures to which the honourable Member is referring appear in the draft budget signed by President Clinton on 28 October 2000."
"The position of the European Union on the extra-territorial measures decreed by the United States has not changed."
"I believe it is well known to the Members of the European Parliament, and the European Union seizes every opportunity to remind the United States of it."
"However, it must be regretfully pointed out that the US Government has not yet taken any action regarding its own commitments under the agreement concluded at the London Summit in May 1998."
"We call on the US Government to do so, as we believe this is essential in resolving this dispute."
"The objective of the European Union regarding Cuba, as established in the common position on Cuba adopted by the Council on 2 December 1996, is to encourage a process of peaceful ""transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people."""
"Encouraging the Cuban regime to bring Cuban legislation and its application into line with international standards also falls within this objective."
"In the same vein, at the time of the vote on the resolution on the embargo as part of the Third Commission of the General Assembly of the United Nations which met on 9 November 2000, we launched an appeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with international organisations defending human rights."
"The European Union notes with satisfaction that Cuba has continued to be very active in various international and regional forums."
"It also recognises that measures have been taken by the Cuban Government to better integrate the country into the region economically."
"The European Union notes the need for a progressive and irreversible opening of the Cuban economy towards the outside world and reaffirms its wish to be Cuba' s partner in this process."
"Finally, it is with concern that the European Union takes note of the findings of the United Nations' agencies and programmes on the ground."
"It deplores the negative, and often tragic, repercussions of the US economic embargo as they affect the Cuban population, especially women and children."
"Mr President-in-Office, thank you for your reply."
"I note that your reply contained certain comments on the lack of respect in Cuba for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"You, of course, suspect that I do not agree with that view; be that as it may, I consider that this sort of judgment constitutes interference in the internal affairs of a country."
"And, the way in which you phrased your position gives me cause to wonder if, in the final analysis, there is any difference between the ultimate aim of the policy of the European Union on Cuba and the ultimate aim of American policy on Cuba."
"It seems to me that both seek to overturn the Socialist regime in Cuba."
"It is curious what interpreting problems there can be, as I do not feel that is what I said at all."
"I recalled the very clear differences between the United States and Europe regarding the extra-territorial measures decreed by the United States."
"I noted with satisfaction, on behalf of the Council, that Cuba had continued to be very active in various international and regional forums."
"I recognised that measures had been taken by the Cuban Government to better integrate their country economically into the region and reaffirmed Europe' s willingness to be Cuba' s partner in this process."
"Finally, I recalled that it was with concern that the European Union took note of the observations made by the United Nations' agencies and programmes on the ground and deplored the negative, and often tragic, repercussions of the US economic embargo as they affected the Cuban population."
"So I, in fact, said practically the opposite of what you have just said."
"At the same time, I must remind you of the European Union' s position towards Cuba as established by the Council on 2 December 1996, which is to encourage a process of peaceful transition towards pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people."
"No position has been taken in relation to the nature of the regime, but the regime has perhaps been given a certain amount of encouragement or incentive to move its practices forward."
"If you do not see the difference between that and any other position, then perhaps there is a degree of misunderstanding, possibly intentional."
"Question No 16 by (H-0859/00):"
"Subject: Violation by Turkey of sovereign rights within NATO Turkey has, de facto, challenged the sovereign rights of Greece by intercepting Greek aircraft taking part in NATO's exercise, Destined Glory, its failure to respect the Greek ten-mile FIR and the air corridors over the islands of Limnos and Ikaria, ignoring the opinions of NATO's legal service, and departing from the plans for the exercise drawn up by NATO's administration, which prompted the Greek Government to withdraw its troops."
"Does it intend to make representations to the Turkish authorities to put an end to such acts of provocation, and what form will those representations take? What consequences will these acts have for relations between the EU and Turkey, particularly in the context of the common foreign and security policy, given Turkey's status as an applicant for accession?"
"Regarding the incident involving the Greek and Turkish aircraft taking part in the Destined Glory exercise, it must be pointed out that this incident took place during a NATO exercise between two members of the North Atlantic Alliance."
"It is therefore up to NATO to take the steps it deems necessary to prevent further accidents of this kind."
"This case has not, in any case, been brought up in the Council of the European Union."
"On the substance of the disputes between Turkey and Greece in the Aegean Sea, the Council recalls the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council which stress the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the United Nations Charter and which insistently call on applicant countries to make every effort to settle any border disputes and any other disputes of a similar nature."
"Failing that, they should take their disputes to the Court of Justice within a reasonable period."
"By the end of 2004 at the latest, the European Council will take stock of the situation regarding any outstanding disputes, especially with regard to their implications for the accession process and so as to promote their settlement through the International Court of Justice."
"More generally, issues relating to the settlement of the disputes between Greece and Turkey are included in the reinforced policy dialogue in the context of Turkey' s pre-accession strategy and the accession partnership the Commission has just proposed and which the French Presidency - as I can confirm - hopes will be adopted quickly."
"Moreover, the Council is gratified that, at their meeting in Budapest on 31 October, the Turkish and Greek Foreign Ministers agreed to adopt confidence building measures in the context of NATO, and to do so bilaterally."
"Mr President, first we find it unacceptable, as the President-in-Office said, that the Greek Government has not raised the matter in the Council, despite the justified outcry in Greece."
"Secondly, the Council refers in its reply to NATO as Pontius Pilate, without taking a position on Turkey's provocation in contesting Greek sovereign rights, on this occasion during NATO exercises."
"Does the Council not understand that this is a supremely political problem and that it is unacceptable for it to maintain a position which is equidistant from both the offender and the victim?"
"Similarly, it is a fact that Turkey contests the Greek ten-mile FIR and the air corridors over the islands of Limnos and Ikaria, both of which are regulated by the Lausanne and Montreux conventions and in intergovernmental agreements between Turkey and Italy and Italy and Greece."
"Thirdly, it does not take account of the fact that NATO's legal service issued an opinion upholding Greece's aforementioned rights in accordance with international conventions, even though, under pressure from Turkey, NATO changed its exercise at the last minute."
"NATO's legal service, no less!"
"Fourthly and finally, does he not think that his reply is an encouragement to Turkey, a candidate country for membership of the European Union, to continue its present policy of contesting the sovereign rights of Greece, a member of the European Union and that he has therefore indirectly admitted that there are border disputes which must be resolved, as we have said, on the basis of international conventions?"
"I outlined what action Council had or had not taken, and what it had to do or believed it had to do."
"As for the rest, I believe that we now have a framework for dealing with these particular problems, to wit, the Helsinki Council conclusions. I would point out that these conclusions are our common rule as, obviously, they were adopted unanimously by all the Member States."
"That is the mandate the Council has given itself for the next phase in the examination of this candidacy, which has already been discussed at length and in detail today."
"I must inform you, ladies and gentlemen - even though there are very few of you I am going to make this solemn statement - that for the first time in the legislature we have had time to get through all the questions."
"I do not know if it was to everyone' s satisfaction, but it is an almost historic event of which we take good note."
"That concludes Questions to the Council."
"(The sitting was suspended at 6.55 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Aid for reconstruction (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on aid for reconstruction."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission should start by applying the Feira conclusions to its proposals."
"All of us in the European Union who supposedly have a position of responsibility face a huge challenge."
"I think we have an historic chance today to prove that our acts are tantamount to a declaration of good intentions towards the western Balkans."
"The sums budgeted for the Balkans should put us in mind, in terms of quality and quantity, of a new Marshall plan and should act as a springboard to a new beginning in the countries of the western Balkans."
"Nor should we forget that the countries of the western Balkans are not third countries, they are candidate countries for membership of the European Union and we must treat them as such."
"It is true that the European Union is often accused of promising aid to countries struck by disaster or catastrophe and then taking so long to pay it, so long to keep its financial promises that either it creates the impression that it regrets having promised it in the first place or, when it finally does pay, it is already too late."
"Luckily, there is a shining exception to this rule, and it really is a rule."
"The exception is the Reconstruction Agency which has its headquarters in Thessaloniki and an operational centre in Kosovo."
"This agency complies with the Commission's decision on decentralisation and is exceptionally efficient in managing the project for which it is responsible."
"It has already signed contracts for 90% of the budget for 2000, which is truly amazing."
"It has already disbursed approximately 30% of the appropriations for 2000."
"Plus, and this is unprecedented, it has requested a reduction in wage costs."
"I therefore propose, that not only should we leave these people in peace to get on with their job with the gusto and enthusiasm which they have shown so far, not only should we refrain from upsetting the modus operandi of the agency, although we should, of course, make it responsible for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and anywhere else it is needed, but we should also ask them to pass their know-how on to other committees whose work, as we all know, is so abysmal, so inefficient and brings in such poor results."
"I trust that we can use these opinions to do more for this region in which hardship and suffering abound."
"Commissioner and the few honourable Members who have found their way here, I must, of course, start by congratulating the rapporteurs on their work and excellent cooperation, especially the rapporteur who is here in the House."
"The previous speaker spoke of a sort of Marshall plan for this region and rightly so, I think."
"It is the prerogative of those handing out money to stipulate the political objectives and the Commissioner has done so on several occasions."
"Nonetheless, I should like briefly to outline them once again today on behalf of my group."
"First, we still have a situation in this region, more's the pity, in which human rights and minority rights are not properly respected."
"That is now a fact."
"Our first objective, therefore, must be to help where we can and where we see that there is the will to take better account of minority and human rights in the future."
"Secondly, international agreements are being challenged in this region over and over again, including recently the Dayton agreement."
"If I think back to the election campaign in Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the saddest side-effects of the election process was that leading politicians distanced themselves from Dayton, not in the sense of saying they wanted to go further and wanted more stability, but in the sense of destabilisation."
"Here we must say an unequivocal 'no' ."
"Respect for international agreements - including in connection with Dayton - obviously includes cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague."
"We must act decisively - albeit with a certain degree of tolerance - both towards Kostunica, whom we shall be receiving here tomorrow, and the new Yugoslav authorities."
"There are a few positive signs, but certainly not enough."
"Thirdly, there must be no unilateral changes to borders."
"That applies to both Montenegro and Kosovo."
"Here too, we must be clear and unequivocal."
"We must give the new Yugoslavia a chance."
"I hope it will grab that chance."
"I am not excluding border changes, but I am quite definitely excluding unilateral border changes, whichever side makes them."
"Any such changes must be set out in an agreement."
"Fourthly, and most importantly for us, new borders are being erected but they are no obstacle to the activities of criminal organisations, which know no borders."
"We must combat illegal cross-border activities, be they in connection with the drug trade, cross-border cooperation or trafficking in human beings."
"Borders are there to be dismantled, but not by criminals and, unfortunately, they are more active here than in other regions."
"These are the objectives we need to achieve with the funds and instruments which we are now creating."
"I think that the Commission and Council are also keen for us to work consistently with the means at our disposal over coming years to achieve these objectives."
"But where there is no will, nor should there be money from us."
"Mr President, Mr Kostunica, the new President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, will be addressing the House tomorrow."
"His symbolic presence here could open up prospects for the overall policy which we are pursuing."
"My second comment is that the previous speakers complained that the European Union pays, but the US is listened to."
"That is only logical because the US has engaged in political acts in Bosnia with the Dayton agreement and the US has again engaged in political acts in Kosovo with the initiative which it took on the bombings and much else besides."
"What does that mean for us?"
"That policy must come first or must at least move in parallel if it is to have political objectives."
"What should these political objectives be?"
"Obviously, institutional aspects and the proper working of democracy take priority in the region as a whole."
"If democracy is working properly it will create the preconditions to respect for minorities in the various regions."
"If democracy is working properly, it will help the region to run smoothly."
"However, it must also be based on individuals."
"We must admit that, on numerous occasions, the individuals serving a number of purposes during the transitional phase were not a healthy expression of political life in the region."
"In this sense, we need to review our perception of individuals, facts and situations."
"The second issue which I would like to touch on concerns the strategy in the region."
"Quite clearly, uniting political prospects with economic and institutional prospects is a positive development."
"However, if positive developments are to have good results, they need a strategic framework and a strategic aspect."
"From this point of view, I think that resurrecting an issue which was resolved about a year ago with the Pack report as far as the headquarters of the Reconstruction Agency is concerned is a disservice."
"It would be a good idea for Commissioner Patten, who has a great deal of experience - not to say wisdom - in managing international crises, to add to the visits which he has made to various regions of the Balkans by going to the headquarters of the Reconstruction Agency in Thessaloniki in order to see how this department works."
"In this sense, I endorse and repeat everything which Mr Folias just said."
"Anyway, enough of the bad news, now to the good news."
"The Lagendijk report, apart from the criticism which I may have levied at one point, is an excellent text, as is the Commission proposal."
"They create a framework for political initiatives which must be built up into new perceptions."
"We must look on this region as a region of Europe and not as a region of antagonism between the countries and the national policies of Europe or America."
"If we treat the area as a region of political antagonism we shall be making a big mistake."
"In all events, I think that we are on the right track."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for the excellent reports which they have tabled today."
"The message sent by Parliament through these documents comes across loud and clear."
"It is my hope that the Commission and the Council will accept it with due interest and amend the two regulations accordingly."
"We are all aware of the importance of European Union aid for the Balkan region."
"The re-establishment of a democratic political system in Serbia is the start of a new chapter in history, but the Union must be the protagonist of this new phase rather than the passive, slothful observer which it has been thus far."
"Our technical and economic intervention must be large-scale and effective, for this is the very least the Union can do to give the region and the continent as a whole a stable future."
"We must bear in mind that there is still a long way to go along the road to peace in the Balkans and that potential friction points still exist which could well set the whole process back again."
"But this region, the most troubled region of Europe, has never held such hope as it does now."
"The virtually despotic Croatian system has been replaced with a pro-West democratic system."
"The vulnerable countries surrounding the remains of Yugoslavia have weathered the crisis, and, what is more, Bulgaria, Albania and Macedonia have even made economic progress."
"In the fine changes of balance currently governing the Balkan region, the responsibility of the European Union is great, enormous, and when we say the Union we mean the Member States but also the European and Parliament."
"The Member States make grandiose declarations of their intentions but these must be followed by a concrete financial undertaking."
"The European Commission must assume responsibility for the smooth running of these programmes, and this is the primary objective of the two reports which are to be put to the vote tomorrow."
"Parliament must be regularly consulted and updated on progress, and it is this, the second of the rapporteurs' requests, which we must all support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the texts before us, the Commission and Parliament have put a figure of EUR 4 billion on the war damage caused by the NATO bombings in Serbia alone, excluding Kosovo, thereby indirectly admitting that they were to blame for some of the material war crimes."
"NATO professes to have intervened in order to prevent further suffering, and yet there were far more exiles, dead and wounded as a result of this war than there had been in the 12 allegedly decisive months before NATO intervened militarily."
"Surely the region was not effectively destabilised until NATO waged war on it?"
"In the end, the intervention by NATO in the Balkans served to legitimise the NATO strategy and its so-called self-imposed mandate."
"In recognition of the war damage caused and the fact that the situation was escalated by NATO, payments should be equal to not half but all the quantified war damage."
"More importantly, instead of lending money, the EU - and in particular the Member States which belong to NATO - should pay reparation for the damage which they caused."
"This has been an excellent debate even though, by this time in the evening, the attendance is restricted to the cognoscenti."
"However, it is good to see some familiar faces in the Chamber."
"I do not intend to traverse the ground that was covered by the Minister earlier in his remarks about the Zagreb Summit."
"I totally endorse all the objectives which he set out."
"That summit is taking place in rather happier conditions than we perhaps imagined when the presidency first conceived of it."
"I want to focus on the regulations."
"I should like, first of all, to thank the House for its excellent and speedy work during its examination of these two draft regulations."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs of the relevant committees: firstly, Mr Westendorp y Cabeza, who has considerable on-the-ground experience of these matters in Bosnia, and also Mr Lagendijk, with whom we have a regular dialogue on southeast Europe."
"He is at least one other human being with whom I can share the distinction of having read Misha Glenny on the Balkans. I should also like to thank the following Members: Mr Staes, Mr Färm and Mr Gargani for the quality of their reports and opinions."
"These two proposals respond to two key Union priorities: providing assistance to southeastern Europe and providing it as rapidly and as efficiently as possible."
"The European Councils of Lisbon and Feira underlined the importance that the Union gives to the integration of this region into the economic and political mainstream of Europe."
"Our policy for achieving that is the stabilisation and association process."
"Of course the European Union is making a leading contribution through that process to the work of the Stability Pact."
"The heads of government have also confirmed the Union's determination to back this process with technical and economic assistance."
"The return of democracy to Serbia, thanks to the determination and courage of the Serb people and the democratic forces there, offers the chance now of building prosperity across the whole region."
"More than ever the European Union has to live up to the commitments it has made."
"To do that we must have the right legal instruments, flexible procedures and efficient management."
"The reform of external assistance which the Commission adopted on 16 May demonstrates our determination to improve radically the speed, quality and visibility of external assistance."
"In southeast Europe this determination has already brought concrete results."
"In Kosovo the taskforce which we deployed within days of the end of the conflict and, in the last six months, the European Agency for Reconstruction have achieved a track record of delivering help on time and efficiently."
"The figures bear this out: 84% of the funds allocated for reconstruction under Obnova - in 1998 to 2000 EUR 444.5 million - had been committed by the end of October 2000."
"Seventy percent of the funds committed had been contracted and 43% of the contracted funds had been paid."
"We have achieved rapid results in Serbia too, where the Commission, in the space of just over four weeks, has drawn up an emergency assistance programme worth in total EUR 200 million."
"It was agreed by the Commission last week and the first trucks of heating fuel started rolling into Serbia at the weekend, ahead of schedule and ahead of most other donors."
"This programme is going to ratchet up every day from now on: a contract for imports of EUR 30 million in electricity was signed today with the Serbian Electricity Company and should come on-stream within days."
"Every day counts in this situation."
"Our reforms have started to bring results too in Bosnia, where the implementation of assistance, in terms of amounts contracted and disbursed has improved dramatically since our delegation in Sarajevo was reinforced last year and authority was delegated to it."
"The results that have been achieved are extremely encouraging."
"These are the results of which the European Parliament too can be proud."
"It was the European Parliament that sounded the alarm about weak management in Bosnia."
"It was Parliament which supported the Commission's proposal to create the European Agency for Reconstruction."
"It was Parliament which insisted on a single regulatory framework for assistance to the region and it was Parliament, in its role as budgetary authority, which made sure that funds were made available for emergency assistance for Serbia, without delay."
"This is good progress but we need to build on it."
"There is still plenty of room for improvement."
"That is the purpose of these two proposals."
"Members of Parliament have tabled a significant number of amendments."
"I want to comment on them as they relate to our twin proposals on the agency and the regulation."
"The Commission has proposed an assistance regulation which is deliberately simple and clear."
"It sets out the over-arching objectives for assistance for the main principles governing programming, comitology for programmes, but not for individual projects."
"And it also proposes simple decision arrangements for programmes run by the European Reconstruction Agency."
"Let me take up a number of the broad points that have been raised by Parliament, first the role of the Commission and its financial responsibilities in relation to the running of the agency."
"The Commission takes very seriously its responsibilities for the implementation of the Community budget."
"A number of new amendments underline this responsibility by referring to Article 274 of the Treaty."
"But in order to exercise this responsibility we need legal instruments which allow us to act quickly and flexibly."
"Second, Parliament wants us to refer more specifically to sectoral priorities."
"We want, in the light of experience, to retain as much flexibility as possible."
"But we can accept several of Parliament's amendments which urge us to include mention of key sectoral priorities such as assistance for education, vocational training, environment, civil society and NGOs, ethnic reconciliation and the return of displaced persons."
"In the same spirit we can accept the proposal to include a reference to the Feira European Council conclusions in the preamble to the regulation."
"Parliament's resolution on the Commission's communication on the stabilisation and association process also deserves to be mentioned in the preamble."
"We think it makes more sense to do it there than to build it into the article on conditionality."
"Naturally we can also accept the proposal that the guidelines which the Commission will adopt should reflect the search for greater efficiency that underlines our reforms."
"I just want to add the point that it is important, having put forward a regulation which attempts to simplify things, not to allow the regulations now to be hung about with caveats and qualifications and spectacular quantities of red tape."
"As Mr Staes said: We do not want people throwing spanners in the works."
"If we cannot have a clear and simple regulation then, frankly, we would be better off with no regulation at all."
"To be clear: we can accept the spirit, provided changes can be made in certain cases to the wording, of Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, the first part of 11, the first part of 13, 16 partially, 17, 18, 19 partially and 20, 21, 24, 28 in the first part, 31 and partially 37."
"The Commission's position on the overall sum we estimated was necessary for the region, the so-called financial reference amount and its compatibility with the financial perspectives, is well-known."
"We do not think, as the House knows, that it is necessary to make an explicit reference to this in the regulation."
"Despite Mr Lagendijk's eloquence, I do not think it is necessary, but he made one point which is fundamentally true and it was made, in another sense, by Mr Westendorp when both of them argued that these regulations are all very well but if there is not an adequate budget to cover the political priorities of the European Union then we are wasting our time."
"Mr Westendorp, said that the Council could not - I think this was the implication of his remarks - replicate the New Testament and perform miracles with loaves and fishes."
"That may be regarded by some Members of some Councils as being a touch brutal in its assessment of the powers of the Council but it is entirely true."
"We have to deal with finite budgets but I very much hope that the budget which is available for the external actions of the European Union reflects the political priorities of the European Union."
"That is the discussion which we have been having with the Council in recent weeks and months and the Commission or Parliament do not come badly out of that discussion."
"I should have thought, in particular, that the experience of the last two months has shown that the Commission's proposal on financing was not as eccentric as some people suggested at the time."
"Let me now turn to the second proposal on the table, the European Agency for Reconstruction and, in doing so, I want to pay warm tribute, as Mr Lagendijk did during his own remarks, to the excellent job that the board, the director and the staff have done on the ground in Kosovo."
"They are a terrific team and I am not surprised that the results they have achieved are extremely impressive."
"They have earned their good reputation for delivering results and I know that Parliament's own delegation to Kosovo in May was as impressed by them as I have been."
"It clearly makes sense to learn lessons from the past six months of the Agency's operations and to see how we can help it to work more effectively."
"This is essential now that the Agency will be responsible for the whole of the FRY."
"Our main aim is to clarify the role of the governing board."
"It has to take on responsibility for the examination and the approval of reconstruction programmes which will be submitted to the Commission for decision."
"We also want to simplify decision-making."
"According to the new regulation the Commission will be permitted to adopt programmes proposed by the Agency without having to consult the management committee."
"Let me make it clear that responsibility for the formal adoption of the programmes remains with the Commission."
"It is the Commission that decides on the desirability of these programmes; it is the Commission which is responsible for the implementation of the budget; it is the Commission which adopts the programmes."
"A number of amendments seek to ensure that the Agency acts under the direct and sole responsibility of the Commission and thereby to ensure that the Commission is solely responsible for the Agency's management before the European Parliament, the Court of Auditors and OLAF."
"I want to clarify this."
"The Agency has a certain degree of autonomy, like all European agencies."
"This is the position under the current institutional set-up and the autonomy, which the Agency now has, must be respected unless the institutional structure of the Agency is modified."
"That does not detract from the full responsibility that the Commission assumes, as the Treaty requires, for the execution of the Community budget."
"I would like to thank Parliament for the sensible and pragmatic way it has accepted the current structure of the Agency."
"I know Parliament's views on this issue and the Commission will take these into account in the design of any future executive agencies."
"The language regime is a further sensitive issue."
"I hope that Parliament will understand the sense of the proposals that I put forward in May and will continue to work constructively with others on this very difficult issue but I cannot offer to support Parliament's amendment to remove the unanimity requirement which would contradict the view of the College."
"We can accept those amendments which are designed to remove the requirement for a further Council decision to extend the mandate of the Agency to the whole of the FRY."
"I can accept, too, those amendments which refer to the General Affairs decision of 9 October, to cooperation with NGOs, to the restoration of civil society and the rule of law, to the payment for services provided by the Agency, to third parties, to the possibility of creating further operational centres, to the responsibility of the director for the implementation of the work programme and the structure of the Agency's budget."
"This means that we can accept the spirit, provided changes can be made in certain cases to the wording, of Amendment Nos 1, 2, 6, 8, 10 in part, 11, 37, 16, 27 and 33."
"We will look carefully at the desirability of producing an explicit list of issues which the governing board should examine."
"We will do this in the interest of clarifying its role; that concerns Amendments Nos 21 and 22."
"We will also examine the timetable which you propose for the adoption of the Agency's budget while respecting the principle of good budgetary programming and compatibility with the Community's budgetary procedures."
"This concerns Amendments Nos 29 and 30."
"Let me reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its hard work on these issues."
"We have made real headway in south east Europe."
"This proposal should allow us to take advantage of the new opportunity we have, to make a decisive contribution as the European Union to lasting peace and prosperity across the whole region."
"I have to say that the European Union did not come frightfully well out of the history of south east Europe during the 1990s."
"I hope we make a better fist of things during the next decade and this regulation will provide us with some of the prosaic means of doing so."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m."
"ASEM III"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the third Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM III, Seoul, 20-21 October 2000)."
"Mr President, let me engage in a bit of continent hopping."
"Before reporting on the third ASEM summit and evaluating its results, let me briefly say a word about the ASEM process."
"The first summit in 1996 was at a time of huge optimism about Asia when people were talking about the Asian economic miracle."
"The second summit, in 1998, came at a time of economic crisis when many people were saying that Asia had had it and all had been much exaggerated."
"We saw some reality at the third summit."
"There was not an Asian economic miracle but a great deal that is very exciting has happened in Asia and it has recovered very rapidly in most parts from the crisis of 1997/98."
"Where it has done so most successfully, it has managed it by combining economic and political reform."
"That has been the background to these summits."
"The challenge for the third summit in Seoul was to deepen the ASEM process both for governmental participants and for the broader public."
"It had to demonstrate that there need not be dramatic events occurring to justify meetings of European and Asian Heads of State or Government."
"We outlined our goals for ASEM III in our working party, we discussed it with the European Parliament before the summit on two occasions in the ASEAN working party and in the plenary which resulted, I believe, in your resolution of 5 October, the aims of which we not only took into account, but also managed to achieve in most cases."
"In addition to adopting three important documents, the leaders of the summit actively engaged in discussion of sensitive issues like human rights, the South China Sea, East Timor and Burma."
"They pledged to promote and protect fundamental human rights and uphold respect for democracy, the rule of law, equality, justice and concern for the environment."
"It was agreed to intensify ASEM's high level political dialogue by drawing strength from the diversity of Members while not excluding any issue."
"Leaders agreed to an expanded and updated Asia-Europe cooperation framework 2000 which forms the work programme for the coming decade."
"The need for common efforts to implement the Kyoto Protocol was confirmed, a consumer-producer dialogue to stabilise world prices for oil was advocated as well as closer cooperation to develop energy saving technologies."
"Trans-national crime was discussed, the exploitation of migrants, people trafficking, the fight against illegal drugs, all those issues which, alas, form the darkest side of globalisation."
"The summit adopted the separate Seoul declaration for peace on the Korean peninsula, welcoming the inter-Korean summit in June, urging both sides to continue building on its success and underlining the importance of engaging the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in multilateral dialogue."
"On enlargement, the two-key approach was adopted whereby a candidate country first needs the support of its regional partners before seeking endorsement from the other region."
"The final decision is made by consensus, by Heads of State or Government."
"No specific candidates were discussed at ASEM III."
"In the field of economic and financial cooperation, leaders agreed to work together to address the challenges posed by globalisation, information technology, e-commerce and the digital divide by expanding research and information networks between the two regions."
"Leaders also confirmed the preparation of voluntary annual reports on the status of efforts to overcome barriers to trade as identified under the trade facilitation action plan."
"There was an acceptance by all ASEM partners to work towards a new comprehensive WTO round as soon as possible, taking into account the special needs of developing countries."
"In the social and cultural field, leaders recognised the vital importance of better educational links with specific initiatives for promoting mutual awareness, including an enhancement of inter-university cooperation and electronic networking between schools."
"In the related people-to-people field, the principle of opening the ASEM process to a larger segment of civil society was maintained, although the NGO initiative to establish a social forum could not be realised because of the resistance of certain Asian partners."
"I am sure Parliament can see these results are in line with the resolution of 5 October which I mentioned earlier."
"Human rights and the rule of law are embedded in the process; there was a clear understanding of the need for the early start of a broad-based WTO round but I am not sure that has been entirely reflected so far at the discussions at the APEC meetings in Brunei."
"While the proposal to establish a social forum was not accepted, we actively engaged with civil society and the NGOs and I very much hope that this area will see further progress in the run-up to ASEM IV in Copenhagen."
"Finally, leaders agreed to encourage an intensification of contacts among parliamentarians as set out in the cooperation framework."
"Inevitably, ASEM III was dominated by the momentous developments on the Korean peninsula which have resulted in the very worthy nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize of the President of South Korea, a man whose career has been distinguished, both by his commitment to democracy and human rights and the rule of law and, most recently, to his commitment to reconciliation between the south and north of the peninsula."
"I think that reminded us in Europe of the important role that we have in Asia, not just in economic and trade terms, though it has to be said that one of the reasons for Asia's recovery has been that we have kept our word to keep our markets open to Asian exports over the last two years."
"This year it seems very likely that China will have a surplus of EUR 40 billion with the European Union."
"We have kept our word in economic and commercial matters which, among other things, encourages Asia to take us rather more seriously."
"It is important to remember that we also have a political role in Asia, not just in our advocacy of democracy and good governance, but also in the contribution we can make in the Korean peninsula and elsewhere to stability and security for the future."
"The ASEM process is an important one."
"This was a very valuable meeting."
"The process is developing and strengthening with time and I look forward to the next ASEM meeting in Denmark in a couple of years' time when I am sure we will be able to build on the progress already achieved."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think the House is so empty because we have proceeded apace this evening and some members who wished to speak have not yet arrived and are still dining."
"I would ask you, therefore, not to interpret the low turnout as an indication that the issue is not important."
"Commissioner, first I agree with your reading that the ASEM process is hugely important."
"It is of huge political and economic significance."
"I only wish that both this House and many of your colleagues in the Commission would see the importance of Asia's relations with Europe from the right perspective, and that includes the Union's fisheries policy - may my Spanish colleagues forgive me and with my excuses to Mr Fischler."
"If you take a long-term view of political and economic developments in our multi-polar world, then you will see that Asia's relations with Europe, and vice versa, are of paramount importance."
"In this respect we are extremely lucky that the summit in Seoul took place at all and that, with one or two exceptions, all the heads of government attended."
"That was highly significant."
"You are quite right that the Asian Summit was somewhat dominated, in the positive sense, by developments in both North and South Korea, with the result that more time was spent evaluating and qualifying the rapprochement on the Korean peninsular than on a real in-depth discussion of the Asia process."
"But we should be pleased that positive developments are taking place there."
"Allow me, however, to comment on the poor Council representative who will have to write up his protocol at some point: obviously the situation was awkward in Seoul due to the fact that some EU Member States have stopped exchanging ambassadors with North Korea and others have not."
"It would have been smarter - if we are to have a common foreign and security policy - if all 15 Member States had taken a joint decision to resume relations with North Korea at the same time and on the same terms, as opposed to this display of showmanship by some Heads of State and Government."
"It is good - I freely admit - that some agreement was reached on a framework programme for cooperation between Asia and Europe."
"But, Commissioner, have you in all honesty understood the substance of the framework agreement?"
"I still have a great deal of difficulty really understanding the substance of what has been agreed for the next decade."
"And here I think that, what is important to Parliament - even if only a few of us are here, someone should read the protocol and we specialists will take it from there - is for it to be involved in the process of putting flesh on the bones of the framework for cooperation between Asia and Europe."
"I think, in any case, that Parliament conducts itself far too reactively."
"As we have such a good negotiating partner in you, Commissioner, we should try to agree on the content before Copenhagen and before the conferences and Parliament should start us thinking about how we can flesh out the framework which you have decided on."
"I am delighted that the European side took a clear stance on human rights."
"But we need to discuss the consequences of what that means at our leisure."
"I think it was an excellent political declaration but we still have a few problems here."
"I think that it is our job here in Parliament to follow up on what the European side generously included in the conclusions, namely cooperation between the European Parliament and the parliaments of the countries in Asia, following the first ASEM conference held in Strasbourg a few years ago."
"It is an important task and I can only hope that Parliament will initiate the second meeting next year before Copenhagen."
"We should arrange to hold it in Asia, given that the last meeting was held in Strasbourg."
"It is when you look at cooperation between Asia and Europe from the point of view of democracy or human rights that you see how important it is for us to cooperate more closely with parliaments in the Asian countries and bring about positive developments."
"Mr Jarzembowski, with regard to your remark about the extremely low attendance, if we count the Commissioner, we can say that 75 percent of the speakers are present."
"That is really not bad!"
"Mr President, we talked about this issue a month ago and had an excellent discussion with the Commissioner."
"We were all agog."
"Naturally we welcome the fact that the process has been opened up to North Korea."
"It is just a shame that we have not seen fit to make the necessary funds available to go with it."
"Apart from that, we feel the outcome left a lot to be desired, and that is putting it mildly."
"What we dislike about ASEM II is not so much what we have managed to achieve, because projects to do with money-laundering, HIV and AIDS, food safety and suchlike, are of course to be welcomed."
"In fact two concrete proposals have been adopted, notably the round table on globalisation and the duo fellowship programme, 4300 fellowships amounting to a total cost of USD 25 million."
"That is not to be sniffed at of course, but there are still a few questions we would like answered."
"I will return to them in due course."
"What is more important is what was not adopted."
"We could have done so much more in terms of financial stability, trade and investments, and infrastructure."
"An ASEM environmental centre was proposed."
"Now that would have been something."
"What concerns us is what we failed to do on the human rights front."
"Things were said but they have not found their way into the projects that were agreed, not even in terms of the considerable reserve, for example, although this could easily have been done."
"In any case, this considerable reserve also has something to do with globalisation."
"We agreed to concentrate on globalisation, in particular the adverse effects thereof, when in fact we believe that globalisation is a positive force."
"There is a down side but surely we should also consider the bonuses."
"We find it incomprehensible that the secretariat for the fellowship programme is to be located in Seoul."
"ASEF is working extremely well in Singapore, so why not establish it there?"
"We know that the Commission values ASEM extremely highly and it has our wholehearted support on that score."
"What we want to know is whether our Ministers have given ASEM due consideration."
"We feel they have been sadly lacking in ambition and are therefore unworthy of praise."
"Some headway has been made in terms of Asia-Europe parliamentary dialogue."
"Perhaps we parliamentarians can succeed where Ministers have failed in this respect."
"The European Commission deserves our support because we are convinced it is going about things the right way."
"That said, we feel the Ministers ought to have been able to achieve a much better result."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Regional Fisheries Organisations (RFOs)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0275/2000) tabled by Mr Jové Peres, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission Communication to the Council and the European Parliament: Community participation in Regional Fisheries Organisations (RFOs) [COM(1999) 613 - C5-0108/2000 - 2000/2068(COS)]."
"Commissioner, the regional fisheries organisations are becoming increasingly important, particularly in fishing grounds with shared sovereignty or in the management of migratory or straddling stocks."
"As they are adapted to the specific characteristics of their areas, they are a particularly appropriate instrument for the rational management of resources."
"It is therefore a matter of priority that the European Union should equip itself with the machinery needed to ensure the full participation it deserves."
"The Commission' s communication confines itself to dealing with those aspects relating to the powers of the Community and Member States in tasks arising from their participation in those organisations."
"This approach is necessary but inadequate, since the European Union needs to adopt clear, uniform and homogeneous guidelines for its participation in the regional fisheries organisations."
"In view of the diverse nature of the existing regional organisations, the Community's participation in each of them must be suited to their individual characteristics."
"It must, however, obey the same basic principles from a legal and institutional point of view."
"Therefore the report by the parliamentary Committee on Fisheries advocates sharing tasks evenly between the Community and the Member States with regard to the regional fisheries organisations as a whole."
"The leading role in the Community' s action should be played by the Commission, the guardian of Community interests, but it should not only deal with the representative role to which it seems hitherto to have confined itself through lack of resources."
"In future the Commission must not confine itself to being a mere figurehead: it must unequivocally and specifically take up all aspects of the Community's participation in these regional organisations, representing it, monitoring the transmission and verification of data, participating in scientific fora, and in general guiding Community action, including monitoring the fishing carried out in the context of these organisations."
"The monitoring of fisheries affects the jurisdiction of the Member States and hence to a certain extent the core of their sovereignty."
"This monitoring should be transferred to an unequivocally Community body, so that the common fisheries policy can apply to all Member States and to all vessels and crews regardless of their nationality, thus avoiding any possible breach of the principle of equal treatment."
"The administration of monitoring and, progressively, its actual execution must therefore be assigned to the Commission, and hence the cost of this must be borne by the Community budget."
"The existing machinery for transposing rules into Community law needs to be improved in order to increase legal certainty and to overcome its current sluggishness."
"But faster transposition into Community law of the rules adopted within the regional organisations does not exempt the Council and Parliament from doing their job of steering the Community fisheries policy."
"In view of the growing importance of the regional fisheries organisations (RFO), the European Union must fully exercise its powers in fisheries matters, but this raises a problem above all of human and material resources."
"Perhaps to side-step the problem of resources, the Commission has decided to propose a reformulation of the duties to be performed by the Community and the Member States, without modifying their respective competences."
"Although this approach might be acceptable as a temporary measure, it could cause serious regulatory and, above all, institutional problems if it were made permanent."
"The distribution of tasks proposed by the Commission would assign 'high-level' representation to the Community and delegate representation on scientific and technical committees to the Member States."
"Contributing to the work of the RFOs would also be entrusted to the Member States, as would inspection and monitoring tasks."
"This means that the Community's role as a contracting party would be reduced to a mere façade."
"European integration cannot be confined to declarations without any tangible content."
"While there is a common fisheries policy and the Community has powers in the sphere of fisheries it must equip itself with the human and material resources needed to tackle its obligations, as required by the principle of adequacy of resources inherent in the common fisheries policy."
"Similarly, if the Community is a contracting party in the RFOs, it must behave accordingly and perform the role required of it."
"The implementation of this principle has financial implications and requires legal changes and, possibly, sacrificing a certain amount of sovereignty; but if a particular model of political integration is chosen the means must be provided for that model to be put into practice."
"Mr President, the regional fisheries organisations are today without doubt the best, if not the only, guarantee for the management of world fish stocks, and they are likely be even more significant in the future."
"The rapporteur has understood their importance perfectly and has drawn up an excellent report, which highlights the real weakness of the communication."
"Very good intentions which can only become reality if there is a genuine political desire."
"When we think that, of all the coastal countries in the world, very few have the economic, judicial, legislative and political potential that the European Union has, that should tell us how much we should be asking ourselves what our responsibility is."
"Yet the Community neither gets involved nor takes a lead; the very most it does is react."
"But it reacts with such paltry means and so little foresight that in the end it is like sending David out against Goliath."
"Except that in the Bible David won, which is not the case here."
"I have been an observer in some regional organisations and I can assure you that it is pathetic to see two or three mid-ranking officials, exhausted and hardly getting any sleep, trying to react to problems that could be seen coming months earlier and facing high-powered delegations, which are high-powered either because they are from great powers like the United States or Japan or because they have followed an intelligent policy of forming alliances in advance."
"As the Directorate-General for Fisheries is currently being restructured and may gain more staff and better resources, I believe we should demand that priority be given to strengthening this area."
"It would mean, first of all, not having to confine itself to reacting to actions like that of the Galapagos Agreement and its manifest intention of unilaterally extending the jurisdictional waters of four countries in defiance of the basic norms of international maritime law, or against attempts to arbitrarily expel Community fleets, which are among the few that are governed by strict standards and regulations."
"Similarly, the Commission has the obligation not only to properly represent us in the international maritime sphere but also to take the initiative."
"It should thus promote the setting-up of new regional organisations, beginning where the Community already has a presence, such as in the western Pacific and south Pacific."
"In view of the expected restructuring, I should like to ask specifically for a unit to be set up for large migratory species, the need for which has already been noted by the Commission insofar as it has drawn up a number of regulations just for these species, which are the main target for flags of convenience, a pirate scourge that inexplicably is spreading ever more widely."
"In conclusion, I reiterate my support for the rapporteur' s magnificent report."
"Mr President, I thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner."
"The regional fisheries organisations and the Community's participation in them is an important issue."
"Covering nearly all the high seas these organisations provide an instrument to ensure active conservation and management of the fisheries resource."
"It is this precious resource that I should like to turn to."
"We face a depletion of stocks already which puts fishing into a crisis situation."
"There is over-fishing, pollution of our seas, the climate is changing - we see that at the conference at the Hague at the moment - and the physical alteration of the environment puts increasing pressure on these finite resources."
"Reform of the CFP will be critical but getting the right reforms will be even more important."
"In Scotland the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and the World Wildlife Fund have got together to propose the concept of zonal regional management."
"The fisheries management scheme would involve all interest groups in a particular region."
"Although initially merely advisory in its recommendations, it is hoped that by illustrating efficiency and effectiveness over time it would earn a management role."
"The development of a regionalisation of the CFP will be critical in ensuring local action."
"Regional fisheries organisations provided a role on an international scale and regional or zonal management can make the global become local."
"It will truly make for sustainable fisheries."
"Mr President, I have only one minute in which to express my support for Mr Jové' s excellent report, which deals very accurately with an aspect of the common fisheries policy that has not been recognised within the Union as a fundamental part of the policy."
"Because Europe' s Member States are obsessed with disputes in Community waters, they forget, in practical terms, that fishing has a worldwide dimension, in terms of both the conservation of marine stocks and production and also the markets and the nature of the fleets. As a result, some countries in the Union, such as Galicia, which I represent, are affected particularly badly by this situation and by the consequent lack of human and material resources afflicting the European Commission in its implementation of the common policy for regional fishing organisations."
"The rapporteur rightly criticises these shortcomings and has proposed highly appropriate solutions, with which we agree."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as we now all know, the state of fish stocks is a cause for concern throughout the world."
"As we have just heard, part of the problem is extensive environmental pollution, such as the recent tanker accidents and, let us face it, there is no shortage of tanker accidents nowadays."
"However, the main reason is overexploitation of fish stocks due to the huge catching capacity of the fishing fleets."
"For the sake of the environment, and fishermen, we must aim to achieve sustainable management of fish resources."
"However, if we are to achieve this objective, the Community still has a few important steps to take."
"And time is running out."
"In its communication to the Council and Parliament, the Commission criticises the lack of uniform regulations governing fisheries within and beyond exclusive economic zones."
"The law of the survival of the fittest still applies on the high seas."
"This law is based on the overriding principle of the freedom of the high seas."
"The sea knows no borders."
"There is hardly a fish in it which is permanently domiciled."
"I am referring here to all migratory fish stocks."
"Any over-fishing has a domino effect, and careful handling of fish resources is a pointless exercise if everyone else is ruthlessly pursuing their own economic interests and paying no heed whatsoever to the need to protect stocks."
"The EU has the fourth largest fishing capacity in the world."
"However, its importance does not give it the right to take measures at its own convenience and any measures taken must be in keeping with its international obligations."
"It is because of this global perspective that international collaboration is needed and, to be sure, the most important committees - and this brings us back to the basis for collaboration - are made up mainly of regional fisheries organisations."
"It is not just since the 1995 New York Agreement that their importance has been recognised; basically they are the best way of fostering responsible fishing."
"They alone are able to implement supra-regional regulations in keeping with local conditions."
"They carry out statistical programmes and are responsible for inspections and the monitoring system."
"They are the most efficient way of ensuring that rules are not ignored."
"Given the importance of regional fisheries organisations to sustainable fishing, it is imperative that the EU be granted a seat in every regional fisheries organisation. That way we can be sure that we will all end up pulling in the same direction."
"chairman of the Committee on Fisheries."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I am about to leave for one of these regional fisheries organisations in Marrakech, where I am due to arrive the day after tomorrow to take part as an observer for this Parliament, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I should like to take part in this debate on our colleague Salvador Jové' s magnificent report, in which the position of our committee is made quite clear."
"We are backing the regional fisheries organisations; we are asking for more regional fisheries organisations and for the Commission to have more weight in them."
"When we say more organisations, we mean those that can and should be set up in the South Atlantic or South Pacific - as has already been said here - and for the Commission to take a leading role in them."
"I believe the future of fishing in international waters depends on these organisations, and the Commission must make every possible effort, Commissioner, to this end."
"To support the United Nations position in both the 1982 Convention and the New York one, which has been mentioned here, we must maintain a very active presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing."
"You can count on the support of this Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries, including our support for acquiring more material and human resources, which, as has been shown, are much needed."
"We are a budgetary authority and I believe we should fund this line, because in these organisations and in these waters we are staking a lot on the future of fisheries in the coming years."
"I want, therefore, to stress that the opinion of Parliament is practically unanimous, and so the Commission should realise that we are allies in this constructive endeavour to give the Commission greater weight - more staff, as we have said."
"In comparison with other nations the European Union representation is clearly small, so we have to have more and better representation, Mr Fischler."
"Let me say that we are going to continue this strategy of calling you before our committee in advance to inform us of the positions that you intend to advocate."
"We shall do so together with the fishing sector so that we can form a common, joint opinion Then you will have to return to the parliamentary committee for the Commission to report back to us."
"I should like to close, Mr President, by once again congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Jové, for the magnificent report he has drawn up."
"Could I first of all take the opportunity to welcome the report and say that the whole issue of the management, control and the conservation of fisheries stocks is a major problem no matter where you look."
"Throughout the European Union and far beyond we are all well aware of that."
"It has also been the source of tremendous disagreement between the fishermen, on one hand, and the scientists, on the other."
"To some extent, those of us who are politicians find ourselves in the middle."
"We are neither fishermen nor scientists and we try to find the way and the truth between what both are saying to us."
"This is an extremely difficult position to have to try to find a way through."
"What I would say to this House and to the Commissioner is that we need information of the highest quality and the highest standard that we can all, scientists, fishermen or politicians, take on board."
"That is why I believe there is a tremendous role for the Commission to play in going out there and encouraging the fishermen to come forward and cooperate with it and come forward with a solution that we can all agree to."
"The Commission should take account of the views of the national regional authorities and the industry."
"The Commissioner, when he replied to my report last month, seemed to get his geographical situations slightly mixed up - he did not know whether he was going to Scotland, Ireland or Northern Ireland."
"I suddenly discovered that he went to Scotland and the Republic of Ireland but he did not come to Northern Ireland."
"Hopefully, geographically, he will be much better placed in the future."
"I know he knows where Northern Ireland is and I certainly hope he will come in the future to visit the fishermen there."
"I want to say, before we come to a decision that will end the chaos - because I think we are all aware of the situation we are facing coming into December on TACs and quotas - that it is going to be extremely difficult not only for the regional and national areas and the fishermen but also for the Commission."
"We need a better way of addressing this at a better time of the year with a greater lead in and greater cooperation than we have had in the past."
"I ask the Commission to take that on board."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to start by thanking you for your support for our efforts to promote and strengthen the Community's participation in regional fisheries organisations."
"I agree with all of you who have said that we need more regional fisheries organisations and I agree with Mr Varela and other speakers that the Commission has a role to play in these regional fisheries organisations."
"We also agree with the House that the question of controls must be a cornerstone in the area of regional fisheries policy."
"However, I must again stress the Commission's position that it cannot accept sole responsibility for controls in regional fisheries organisations."
"It is in fact the Member States - in keeping with the basic structure of the European Union - which are primarily responsible for controls."
"In exercising their sovereign rights as flag states, they must provide the necessary human, financial and material resources needed in order for the Community to meet its international obligations."
"The Commission therefore stands by its conclusion in the communication that, as far as controls are concerned, NAFO is an exceptional case and should not become the rule."
"The Commission should concentrate on its own job, which is to monitor and coordinate the implementation of controls in the regional fisheries organisations by the Member States."
"The Commission is also required to carry out a huge amount of work in connection with negotiations held within the framework of regional fisheries organisations."
"It would quite simply be inappropriate to disregard current institutional practice in the Community in relation to responsibility for controlling ships operating on the high seas."
"I should like to reiterate two fundamental points here."
"First, the Community must be consistent in its actions, irrespective of whether we are talking about controls in Community waters or controls on the high seas."
"Secondly, the stand which we take on this subject must be in keeping with the stand taken during the current debate on the Commission's so-called core activities, which is why the discussion of control measures goes beyond regional fisheries organisations."
"We need to select a comprehensive modus operandi which takes account of all fisheries activities in the Community, both in EU waters and on the high seas."
"If we want to consider a completely new take on the Commission's remit in relation to controls inside and outside Community waters, then I think that it we should do so in connection with preparations to reform the common fisheries policy."
"That means that we shall have plenty of opportunity here next year to discuss these issues in depth."
"So much for the central tenet of the report."
"I should like to make a few brief comments now on a number of other points."
"As far as the time taken to implement the decisions of the regional fisheries organisations is concerned, I agree that the Commission's record can and must be improved."
"Some progress has already been made but our efforts must focus on better planning."
"On the question of infringements and sanctions: the Commission has always been in favour of including sanctions in the control regulations."
"Without sanctions, we have no teeth."
"Unfortunately, we have not succeeded so far in getting our ideas across because the Council has always resisted them."
"But we shall try, as part of the ongoing work to create an area of freedom, security and justice, as formulated and decided at the Tampere Summit, to make progress on this question also."
"Now to the reproach under point 16, where it says that the Commission wants to exclude Parliament from the process of Community participation in the various regional fisheries organisations."
"That is quite untrue; in fact the opposite is true."
"The Commission has always spoken out here in favour of the rules for cooperation between Parliament and the Commission and has always adhered to the rules of the interinstitutional agreement."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"COM in pigmeat"
"The next item is the report (A5-0305/2000) tabled by Mr Garot, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat [COM(2000) 193 - C5-0225/2000 - 2000/0076(CNS)]."
"Mr President, I have Mr Nicholson's problem in an even more acute form."
"I turned up for my debate on ASEM III at the time indicated to find that the whole debate had taken place."
"I do not know what the problem is."
"I think it is that one or two Members are absent which then brings the debate forward which means that more and more people arrive after the debate."
"I do not know how we can solve this problem but my apologies to the House for not being present when I should have been."
"I do not know how we can tackle this problem in the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening we are going to be debating the situation of the pig industry and its COM, which has proved to be totally unsuitable in the face of the latest crisis which has just arisen."
"Between 1998 and 2000, production surged disproportionately, with an increase of 20 million head of pigs, reaching an annual total of 205 million pigs slaughtered in the European Union."
"This was accompanied by a 30% collapse in prices with its trail of consequences, which some producers, especially the young and those heavily in debt, often could not withstand."
"Having been made bankrupt, some breeders had no option but to change social status by becoming mere employees of cooperative or private farms, whilst continuing to work on their former holdings."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that is not the interpretation of the European agricultural model that the European Union wishes to project internationally."
"Quite clearly, in the light of the objectives contained in Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75, as amended, one conclusion has emerged, and that is that the tools of the pigmeat sector COM, including private storage aid and export refunds, are unsuitable and inadequate."
"We have private storage aid, which is of less interest to operators now that it is being implemented in the context of a structural crisis, and export refunds, which are always useful, but which are dependent on international agreements which impose increasingly stringent restrictions."
"It is necessary, therefore, to come up with new instruments to guard against a serious crisis re-emerging despite a high level of internal consumption and good use of export opportunities."
"The ongoing improvement of the productivity of pig producers is already generating a growth in supply and if this were to be accompanied by the unlimited extension of the apparatus of production, it would inevitably result, once again, in a serious imbalance in the market."
"The last crisis has taught us that the markets are now much slower to recover as, for the most part, specialised breeders maintain their overall production while waiting for better days to come."
"Ladies and gentlemen, under these conditions, the problem concerns less the future of production than the future of producers."
"That is why it is imperative that the European Union is equipped with flexible instruments to prevent and manage crises in the pig industry."
"Accordingly, the Commission has proposed incorporating a new tool into the COM: regulatory funds."
"The idea is a good one, certainly, but, as its application is optional for Member States and producers and it does not provide any suitable solutions for breeders in a period of crisis in return for the freeze on output it demands, it is of little interest."
"In its present form, it would most probably be ineffectual."
"That is why, fully aware of the extent of the problem, on the basis of my report the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development introduced amendments to make this proposal more attractive and more effective."
"These amendments introduce measures intended to make it possible to draw up reliable forecasts for the market based on thorough assessment of the means of production; to establish regulatory funds in all Member States, supported by Communityaid, so that any pig producer in the European Union, whether breeder or fattener, who wants to join can do so in return for a commitment to stabilise output for five years; to establish conditions for the cofinancing of these funds by producers or their producer associations and by the European Union in order to encourage producers to join; to adjust the aid payments from these funds during periods of crisis and finally, to commit Member States to adopting, together with the Commission, the measures which appear to them to be best suited to restoring the balance of the markets in the event of a crisis."
"This effort to firm up the market must take into account developments in production in each Member State and must have a bearing on producers who do not join the regulatory funds."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these are the solutions advocated by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"We are convinced that these measures are such as to prevent crises in the pig industry, or indeed to manage them if by any chance they were to recur."
"By using instruments which are flexible, complementary and hence indissociable, and at a reasonable cost for the European Union, we should accept the fact that we can make the future less problematic for our producers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Garot report on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat, I should like once again here to make clear reference to the shadow side of the report."
"The report, which basically makes provision for a compensation fund for pigfarmers, and hence goes beyond the Commission proposal, was adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I moved on behalf of our group for a split vote, as I personally reject the idea of a compensation fund for pigfarmers."
"I am quite happy to say yes to a piggy bank for pigfarmers, but I say 'no' to a compensation fund for pigfarmers, especially to a compensation fund co-financed from European money."
"I take the view that we do not need any more regulations or state intervention."
"The whole point of the free market is that supply and demand even out at a specific price."
"It is true that pigfarmers have been hit by an historic slump in prices."
"But it was preceded by a period of economic stability."
"A relatively limited supply, as the result of swine fever and the BSE debate and high exports to third countries have benefited prices and our farmers are again demanding that politics should keep out of it as far as possible."
"This is again a good starting point for proving it."
"To my mind, this is no time for hysteria."
"Every self-respecting agricultural textbook talks of two classical pig cycles."
"What we have seen over the last three years, albeit more drastically, is part of the classical pig cycle."
"The pigmeat market is now one of the few agricultural markets which is still basically free from state intervention."
"And the pigfarmers in my country are delighted at the fact."
"Setting up a compensation fund will quicken the concentration of European slaughter pig production considerably because the risk of bigger capital investments will shift to the common fund."
"I am aware of the fact that totally disparate agricultural philosophies apply in Europe; the philosophy of the federal system in Germany is quite different from that of the centralistic system in France."
"I am quite against the idea of co-financing by the EU."
"I am against any increase in state intervention."
"As for European regulations - as many as are needed, but as few as possible."
"What will we think up if there are any more agricultural risks, for example in the poultry sector?"
"We cannot stuff money into a new EU piggy bank every time."
"That would indeed be the thin end of the wedge."
"Instead, it makes more sense if every pigfarmer sets up his own reserve, i.e. if every pigfarmer has his own piggy bank."
"That is what I should like to see."
"Mr President, the Commission proposal recognises that the pigmeat market in the European Union is subject to cyclical movements, with periods of balanced supply and satisfactory prices followed by periods of plentiful supply when prices plummet."
"The periods of crisis are becoming worse and worse."
"The last one caused prices to fall by over 30% from mid-1998 to early 2000."
"The result is the disappearance of family holdings, whose only solution is to close down or to move into what is known as integrated production, in other words production in which the producers lose their independence as farmers and join a business structure - such as distribution chains or supermarkets - which dictates production plans to them in exchange for a certain economic stability."
"We have sometimes even wondered to what extent the cyclical market crisis itself may not be caused by the speculative action of these business structures, which thus gradually take control of the sector for their own interests."
"The Commission accepts that the only two ways to support the market - private storage and refunds - are insufficient to stave off the crisis, and yet it makes this timid and ineffectual proposal."
"Its lack of imagination and lack of ambition are amazing."
"Rather than a measure to guarantee producers' incomes when prices collapse, it is more like a paternalistic piece of advice: save up in times of plenty so you can get by in times of shortage."
"What the proposal calls a regulatory mechanism consists of authorising a Member State that so wishes to establish a fund financed by those producers who join it on a voluntary basis for a minimum of five years, on the undertaking that they do not increase their stock."
"The contribution from the Community budget is nil, and the Commission confines itself to authorising the levy thresholds and the fund payments from within the management committee."
"The voluntary nature of the system means that the task of controlling production will be borne by only a few while the rest nullify this effect by producing without limit until the next crisis arrives."
"For all these reasons the Commission' s proposal is disappointing and we believe it is unacceptable."
"It does not solve the cyclical instability of the sector, it breaches the principle that the CAP will provide financial support and it is clearly an example of renationalisation and distortion of competences."
"Hence we back the report by our Socialist coordinator, Mr Georges Garot, and the amendments approved in the Committee on Agriculture."
"These turn the proposal into something very different by introducing, first, the compulsory nature of this measure for the Member States; secondly, Community cofinancing of the fund and the contribution of degressive launching aid; thirdly, Commission participation in crisis management measures; and fourthly, a broadening of the scope of this measure to cover piglet producers and closed-cycle holdings."
"Reference is also made to the need to encourage producer organisations, the prevalence of which varies greatly from one Member State to another."
"For the Socialists the amendments approved by the Committee on Agriculture provide an acceptable framework for the establishment of the proposed funds, and therefore if the Commission is not willing to accept these amendments, we ask it to withdraw its proposal, which in its present form has been rejected both by ourselves and by the sector."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Garot for his report, even if I do not agree with its content."
"I agree that there has been a crisis in the pigfarming sector but I do not agree with Mr Garot' s proposal as to how future crises might be solved."
"The fact is that the pigfarming sector has been the only sector which has until now been able to compete on market conditions with just a relatively few forms of intervention such as export subsidies and private storage, and it must continue to do so. If subsidised by the EU, the regulatory fund proposed in Mr Garot' s report may well be of short-term benefit to small producers and help keep them artificially alive at the expense of larger and more productive producers who are, of course, the future for pigmeat production here in Europe."
"The extra EU subsidy proposed in Mr Garot' s report would, in my view, be quite unreasonable in a year such as this when, with Agenda 2000 and the forthcoming enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe, we are to reform agricultural policy."
"We are not going to do this by inventing new aid schemes. Nor, moreover, is there any money in the Budget for this."
"I should like to have a statement from the Commission on the extent to which this proposal is in keeping with the trade agreements with the WTO and with Agenda 2000."
"In my view, it is in direct contravention of the common agricultural policy to establish national funds which will lead to unequal competition for European pigmeat producers."
"What is perhaps worse, however, is that it may contribute to a renationalisation of agricultural policy."
"I would therefore urge you to vote against both Mr Garot' s report and the Commission' s proposal so that the liberal policy which has so far prevailed in the pigmeat sector can continue."
"Mr President, Commissioner, yet again we see just what can be done with a common organisation of the market."
"My congratulations to the rapporteur."
"If every common organisation of the market were as anti-cyclical as what Mr Garot has proposed, or if all organisations of the market were to work in favour of smaller holdings, as Mr Busk has just said, then holdings in Europe would be structured very differently."
"The way in which the organisations of the market have worked in the past has served rather than impeded the concentration process."
"It is interesting to see how the tables have turned."
"Those who, like me, tend to oppose the organisation of the market in the usual sense, support this proposed amendment."
"Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, who has fought tooth and nail to prevent other organisations of the market from being withdrawn or to get co-financing for them, now says there should be no co-financing here."
"If we were to apply the co-financing estimated here, i.e. 50%, to the other organisations of the market, for example in sugar, where the PPE is vehemently opposed to any change, that would instantly free up huge resources."
"Mr Busk is worried that the WTO would be unable to accept this, but he takes a quite different view when it comes to the organisation of the market in sugar which, if you please, we must defend against the WTO."
"This is a model just like the American model."
"We are introducing an insurance system and can easily demonstrate that social aspects play a part."
"I really do think that what the rapporteur has done here is a brilliant achievement; it shows just what you can do with administration when you set your sights on a specific objective and the objective is clearly specified here."
"Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, this objective does not suit you."
"Then you should say so and we can argue it out."
"This objective suits me fine and, as I say, if we had applied it in other organisations of the market, we would have a very different structure today."
"As for co-financing and European contributions: the Commission has suggested adding an insurance system to the current organisation of the market, but only using money from the holdings themselves."
"I mean, what sort of a proposal is that?"
"It is certainly no good to us. That leaves the other system and that is no good either because it fostered concentration."
"If we are going to do anything, then it must be as Mr Garot has proposed."
"He has turned the Commission's pathetic proposal into a reasonable, anti-cyclical, structure-securing proposal, which is why our group will vote in favour of this proposal and I trust that it will secure a majority tomorrow."
"I am just curious, Mr Garot, to see what the decision-makers in the Council will make of it."
"I personally do not think that it stands a chance."
"It is because its objective is designed as I have just described that it will most probably be swept straight off the table, unless the French presidency has something up its sleeve which it can use as a sweetener."
"And after that, it will probably be a first class funeral, but at least it will have been interesting!"
"Mr President, changing a market organisation is always a difficult decision and the objective, when weighing the alternatives, is to achieve as accurate a market-regulating intervention in supply and demand as possible, so as to ensure that production, in this case the production of pigmeat, secures farmers' incomes."
"For a long time this has not been the case."
"The report has been resisted and rejected."
"Some of the demands go beyond the report because there is much which is out of kilter in the beef and pigmeat sectors."
"The latest cases of BSE will result in reduced production and will eclipse everything put in place hitherto."
"The globalisation of the economy is a red herring here and cyclical crises have absolutely nothing to do with it."
"Slaughter cattle are being driven right across Europe, animal stocks are being cut back in return for state subsidies and huge ecological installations are being built."
"Nor does this report offer any ready solutions; too much else needs to be done for that."
"But the report does try to bundle production by applying the principle of voluntary action and by forming producer groups."
"This is an honest and credible endeavour and I shall recommend that my group vote in favour."
"Mr President, at a time when food safety is more than ever on the agenda and, above all, at a time when the entire meat industry in Europe is affected by mad cow disease, it is especially important that the reform of the COM in pigmeat is adopted without delay."
"The market in pigmeat is subject to cyclical fluctuations with which economists are familiar, but the duration and the extent of the 1998/1999 crisis was unprecedented and highlighted the way this phenomenon is being amplified. Each crisis that occurs bankrupts countless family farms and pushes the industry more and more in the direction of concentration and integration."
"This crisis clearly demonstrated the inadequacy of the current, extremely flimsy mechanisms of the COM in pigmeat and the need for a regulatory mechanism that will enable producers' incomes to be stabilised by a system of levies to be collected during periods when the economic situation is good and a system of payments to be made in times of recession, as the European Commission finally proposed along the lines of the French stabi-porc system."
"But this proposal would be totally inadequate if it was possible for Member States to reject these regulatory systems and if the reserves used to maintain revenues in a period of crisis were drawn solely from producer contributions, as this would lead to a two-speed production in pigmeat."
"On the one hand, the largest producers, or those integrated with processing industries downstream, would distance themselves from this measure, preferring the systems they already have: individual savings; bank loans and redistribution funds."
"They would not have to commit themselves to limiting output and would retain their right to expand."
"They would hence be the very source of the next overproduction crisis which would inevitable lead to the bankruptcy of the regulatory funds."
"On the other hand, the more modest producers, family farms, would play the game of solidarity, accept to limit their output and contribute to a national regulatory fund which would drive them into bankruptcy when the next overproduction crisis occurred."
"The current COM in pigmeat is extremely flimsy and much too hesitant."
"This planned reform is the first remotely significant reform that the Commission has proposed since 1975."
"The amendments introduced by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development at the instigation of Georges Garot, whom I must congratulate on his work, transforms this limited text into a wide-ranging one."
"The changes made by the committee are major indeed."
"The participation of all Member States in this new system will be compulsory."
"Producers from all over the European Union will be able to subscribe to this measure."
"The participation of the Community budget is also essential since, without it, those joining one of these regulatory funds would simply be faced with constraints and the system would not be attractive at all."
"Efforts cannot be made by producers alone."
"That is why our rapporteur proposes that the European Union should make a greater commitment by co-financing the regulatory funds."
"In this way, far from creating an exceptional system from the standpoint of international practice, with this flexible system of preventing and managing crises we would be moving, at reasonable cost, towards what is practised in certain third countries, such as the insurance-cum-income systems in force in the United States and Canada."
"We therefore support the proposal by the Commission, as profoundly amended by the work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and will be voting in favour of the Garot report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin straight away by saying that, in principle, I welcome the Commission's proposal to set up a compensation fund, even from the point of view of Austrian agriculture."
"This fund may be just the instrument to reduce pigfarmers' losses in times of crisis."
"The pig crises in 1998 and 1999 demonstrate the inadequacy of instruments such as private stocking and the export refunds of the common organisation of the market in pigmeat at the time."
"I think that, if we are to avoid and manage such crises in the future, this proposal is the first way forward."
"A fundamental point which the Commission has overlooked in its proposal is joint financing."
"In my view, the basic principle of EU financing should apply to common organisations of the market, including the common organisation of the market in pigmeat."
"It guarantees intensive participation on the part of farmers, thereby indirectly restricting production."
"The proposal makes provision for the fund to be set up by the Member States."
"We must, I think, ensure that all Member States set up the fund, so that farmers throughout Europe have an equal chance to participate in it."
"As far as the management of the fund is concerned, state administration should be kept to a minimum; in other words, the Member States should approve and monitor the fund but should not administer it; that should be left to the producer groups."
"Every farmer should be free to participate in the compensation fund., but if they decide to participate, they must sign up for five years."
"I am positive that this instrument will improve the stability of the market and allow farmers in Europe to manage cyclical crises more efficiently."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur, Mr Garot, has dealt with the Commission' s proposal for pig industry funding realistically and in precise terms."
"The aim to balance production and marketing beforehand will be of benefit to the production chain and to everyone else as well."
"I would like to point out, however, that at this stage we should not be embarking on a regulated economy in the pig industry."
"I agree very strongly with my colleague, Mr Busk, when he says that eastward enlargement lies ahead of us and, in a situation such as this, where we will have to take a serious look at the whole agricultural policy a few years from now, it is not, in my opinion, worth embarking on a regulatory mechanism for just one sector. That would not be the wise thing to do at present."
"In this the south and the north are quite clearly opposed."
"In the south people are more in favour of co-financing. On the other hand, the pig industry in the north works on the principle that it should be very firmly undertaken on a voluntary basis, on which schemes may be created, schemes which - as Mrs Schierhuber said here just now - pig farmers could join in different parts of Europe."
"The Community could be providing funds in a mainly technical sense, financing technical matters in connection with start-up, and thus supporting actual start-up."
"The way I understand it is that voluntary funds in the future will help to ensure there is also balanced marketing in the pig industry."
"Mr President, first of all, it would be totally wrong of us to have come here tonight to either criticise the report or the Commission for coming forward with the proposal."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report."
"It is the first time we have had a constructive debate on the problems that face the pig industry throughout the European Union - certainly in the eleven years I have been in this Parliament."
"I am not saying it is right, I am not saying I agree with it, but at least it is the first time we have had a constructive debate on the subject."
"There is no doubt that pig farmers, regardless of where you come from, have faced the most difficult period possible."
"I have seen family farms go out of business; I have listened to farmers' wives wondering how they would survive because of the problems the industry was facing."
"The question I have to ask myself is very straightforward and simple: will this proposal help to alleviate their difficulty either in the short- or long-term?"
"I have extremely serious reservations as to whether it can help the pig farmer in either the short term or long term."
"Co-financing is one aspect, but I have a horrible suspicion that would perhaps create an uneven playing field in many countries throughout the European Union."
"I have to ask the Commissioner - because this is the one thing that might be useful for some of us - whether this proposal will be mandatory on the Member States?"
"If it is implemented in every Member State then there is a degree of fairness."
"If it is not implemented throughout every Member State, then there will be unfairness."
"There will be the suspicion that producers in another Member State have an unfair advantage."
"Can the Commissioner answer that?"
"Whether I will vote for or against depends on how he answers that."
"Unfair competition must be avoided at all costs."
"Pigs have always had - as has been said by Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert - tremendous highs and lows in price."
"When the price has been high the producer has been doing well."
"When the price has been low then the family is not doing well."
"It is a question of balance."
"This is the problem in the pig industry at the moment."
"Is the Commissioner going to address the same problem in the poultry industry, in mushrooms, in tomatoes, in other industries that will have some particular difficulty at some stage in the future?"
"That is what we have to ask ourselves: can the common agricultural policy really cope with the challenges it faces at the present time?"
"While the policy is good, and while I pay tribute to it, we have to go back to the drawing board."
"We have to look at it again."
"We have to have further consultation and greater cooperation to find a way in which we can come forward with a proposal rather than asking the hard-pressed producers at the moment to pay for something that they cannot afford."
"Let us look at how we can best support the industry in the longer-term."
"Mr President, the really positive thing about this debate is that we are getting a very clear idea of what can be regulated within the common agricultural policy and what cannot."
"So this will prove to be a memorable evening, particularly where the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is concerned."
"I fully understand why people want market organisation for intensive livestock farming, and why they should want to scrap agricultural policy for land-based production."
"This is precisely the form of agriculture we have recognised as being the most sustainable and environmentally friendly form of agriculture for the future."
"This is noteworthy in itself."
"We will certainly revisit this theme in future discussions with the Green Group."
"First and foremost, I would like to compliment the rapporteur, Mr Garot, on the fact that he has done his utmost to see if he can do something to help at a time when pig farming is lapsing into crisis."
"That alone is worth a compliment."
"Secondly, is the medicine he prescribes the right medicine?"
"I have grave doubts about that."
"To be perfectly honest, I do not believe in his particular brand of medicine, and I will tell you for why."
"I believe that market organisation only works if you talk in terms of co-financing, and European financing, and if agreements are reached regarding the volumes produced."
"Otherwise, there is every risk that whilst the market or revenue will indeed level off, this will mainly occur in a downward spiral, which cannot be the object of the exercise."
"That being the case, my preference is to have a free market for pig farming, where the market ultimately determines price trends."
"If, however, we opt for market organisation, and reinforcement of the associated policy, then we would do well, in my view, to see that the producer groupings are better equipped, so that they occupy a stronger position in the market; a market which is becoming increasingly close-knit on the demand side, and which is gaining in influence."
"You may ask yourself to what extent agriculture and horticulture in Europe can find an effective solution to this."
"I would sooner strengthen groupings, specifically with a view to gaining a better market position and making better agreements."
"I am therefore bound to say that I have reached a different conclusion to that of Mr Garot, and whilst I am almost inclined to say that I could almost go along with the Commission proposal in its present form, since we also have a duty to be honest, I feel that, basically, it does not actually do anything to address the issues."
"Mr President, that is the approach I would go for; once again, although I reject the medicine prescribed by Mr Garot, I have the greatest admiration for all the trouble he has taken to explore the possibility of introducing more social support into the pig farming sector."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I should like to thank you, Mr Garot, as rapporteur, for your excellent report on the introduction of a compensation fund in the common organisation or the market in pigmeat."
"The crises in the pig sector which, thank God, we have since overcome, were in fact what prompted the Commission proposal in the first place."
"Luckily we are currently in the buoyant phase of the pig cycle, meaning that supply has fallen and farmers are commanding much better prices."
"Farmgate prices have been hovering around EUR 140-150 per 100 kilos for several months and experts continue to see a positive outlook."
"It is clear from market developments that, as ever, the pig cycle is exerting its influence and still applies and that good times will again follow bad."
"We must not overlook this fact during our debate of today's proposal."
"What we are discussing is an instrument to support farmers' incomes in times of crisis."
"We are not discussing a new common organisation of the market in pigmeat."
"We have a common organisation of the market in pigmeat and we should not make the mistake of questioning the present common organisation of the market in pigmeat which, basically, works."
"I should like, in examining the amendments proposed in the report, to concentrate on the points which clearly differ from the Commission proposal."
"The first is co-financing."
"Without doubt, this is, to an extent, the key question in the debate on this proposal and it is addressed in proposed Amendments Nos 11 and 12."
"I should stress here that the main responsibility for a balanced market and for the resultant price levels lies in the hands of the pigfarmers themselves."
"It is they, the pigfarmers, who decide on production volumes and, hence, indirectly and automatically on future price developments."
"I think it would therefore be wrong to deny farmers their responsibility."
"Apart from that, co-financing carries the risk of distorting the market's signals to the farmers."
"I cannot therefore support the idea of putting all the market's eggs in an anti-cyclical price policy basket."
"If we start an anti-cyclical price policy, then all we are doing is jacking up the pig cycle."
"One thing I have learned today is that there appear to be members who support the idea of introducing co-financing in all common organisations of the market."
"In other words, if we do it everywhere else, we will probably include the pigmeat market."
"But that is not the subject of the debate, at least not as far as I am aware."
"The second important question is the voluntary basis for the system."
"The Commission proposal gives Member States the choice of whether or not they wish to set up a fund, whereas the proposed amendment makes it compulsory for all Member States."
"But we must not forget that European pigfarming varies and is organised differently from one country to another and that cooperation between the individual stages of the production chain is organised very differently."
"As a result, there is a whole series of Member States, and of pigfarmers in those Member States, who will brook no discussion of a compensation fund because they say that they do not need it because they have other arrangements for coping with recessions in their income cycle."
"Other countries are determined to have a compensation fund and I will tell you quite frankly that, if we were to propose a mandatory compensation fund, we might as well forget the whole idea, because it would never obtain a majority in the Council."
"Then there is the question of including specialist breeders in the proposed system, as stated in proposed Amendments Nos 7 and 13."
"I think this is asking for trouble because a) breeding is a very varied operation and b) support for breeders will not necessarily automatically fall in the same phase of the cycle as support for fatteners."
"Plus, the weight of piglets various enormously, from 8 to 30 kg, and there is, as it were, no uniform price quotation system for standard piglets, meaning that there is no basis on which to support them."
"I think it is far better here to establish an economic balance between the price of piglets and the price of slaughter pigs through the market rather than through artificial measures."
"More importantly, we must not forget that in numerous countries farmers fatten their piglets themselves and hence have direct access to the compensation fund via the fattened pigs which they sell."
"The Commission cannot accept proposed Amendment No 16 because this amendment would interfere drastically with the freedom of decision of farmers who decide not to participate in the fund, in order to retain their freedom."
"Plus, the measures have not been defined, meaning that the decision on the measures to be applied basically stays in the hands of the Member States."
"That would be genuine renationalisation and I cannot agree to it."
"The planned reduction in production for each Member State depending on previous production sounds suspiciously like a quota regulation."
"Plus, it would generate huge bureaucratic costs, including for the purpose of controls."
"The Commission feels that it is only fair to subject farmers who participate in the fund to some sort of discipline, because they receive a certain income guarantee in return, whereas others, who do not participate, have no such guarantee."
"In addition to these four core questions which the debate on the report has thrown up, there is a series of other, less fundamental proposed amendments, most of which deal with the details of the regulation - details which, in my view, should be included not in the Council regulation but in the implementing measures."
"As far as adjusting aid on the basis of the number of animals is concerned, may I point out that the Commission proposal already makes provision for a legal basis for just such a procedure."
"Before I finish, I should like to touch on a question addressed mainly in proposed Amendment No 6, namely improving statistics on herd trends and the possibility of forecasting production trends."
"I really do not think that a new law or new provisions are needed here."
"What is needed is proper, comprehensive application of current provisions by the Member States and their statistics offices."
"My services have drawn the outstanding problems to the attention of their Eurostat colleagues responsible for inventories and have pushed for results to be improved here."
"We have discussed this on several occasions over recent months and it is clear from our discussions that we have no shortage of provisions; what we are short of is people who take the provisions seriously, carry out the inventories of pig herds correctly and answer the questions put to the Member States truthfully."
"You will have understood from what I have said that I am unable to accept your proposed amendments."
"However, I thank you for the serious debate which we have had here and I hope that we shall be able to reach a result on the basis of the Commission proposal, because the problem here - and I make no bones about it - is that the Member States still have very differing views on this matter."
"Mr President, allow me to put a question to the Commissioner, because I am rather annoyed."
"He said that the Commission had no intention of changing the common organisation of the market in pigmeat."
"But the title reads ""on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat""."
"Then what, pray, has the Commission presented to us?"
"If you want fewer radical changes than we do, then we can come to an agreement, but if you do not want any changes, then the text is a farce."
"Perhaps you could explain."
"If you present Parliament with a proposal, Parliament takes the liberty of introducing its proposals."
"As is our right."
"Mr President, allow me to explain."
"I did not say that there would be no changes to the common organisation of the market in pigmeat as the result of the Commission's proposal."
"Of course it represents a change to the common organisation of the market in pigmeat, of that there can be no question. But from the opinions expressed during the debate, it appeared that what we were doing now was introducing a common organisation of the market in pigmeat and I took the liberty of pointing out that we already had one."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)"
"Court of Auditors' annual report for 1999"
"The next item is the presentation of the Court of Auditor' s annual report for 1999."
"I welcome the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Karlsson, and I immediately give him the floor."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Members of the Court of Auditors I would like to thank you all for inviting me to present the 23rd Annual Report of the Court."
"As in previous years, this presentation marks the start of the discharge procedure for the 1999 financial year."
"The report follows the format used for the past two years with chapters covering revenue in each of the expenditure areas under the headings of the Financial Perspective."
"You will also find a chapter dedicated to the Statement of Assurance, and attached to the report you will find the Court's observations on implementation of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds."
"The different chapters of the annual report address four main concerns."
"Firstly, there is an analysis of the budgetary implementation of the budgetary management practices within the specific financial headings."
"You will find that the Court has paid more attention to the follow-up to previous observations, in response to the demands expressed by this Parliament."
"In each of the chapters the Court reports on the progress made in a number of areas on which it had reported in the past and I will return to some of these issues in my presentation."
"Thirdly, in response to the request of the European Parliament, the Court has expanded its audit work on the Statement of Assurance and now provides additional information per area of expenditure in each chapter."
"Finally, in each of the chapters the Court presents a number of other key audit findings."
"Many of these findings are also reported upon in more detail in the Court's special reports."
"Since the last discharge procedure the Court has adopted 24 special reports containing the results of audits which focus on a wide range of specific areas in which the Community's financial management can be improved."
"Although these reports are not part of today's presentation, they are to be taken into account in the discharge procedure."
"The total income for the 1999 financial year amounted to EUR 86.9 billion."
"The gross national product-based resources represent 43% of this total."
"The value added tax-based resources represent 36% and the traditional own resources are 15% of the total."
"The remaining 5% is composed of the surplus resources of the previous year and other income."
"This means that four fifths of the Community resources, the gross national product plus the value added tax-based resources, are calculated and fixed by using statistical data."
"I would like to point out two major observations of the Court in this context."
"First, for several years now, the Court has commented on the use of a statistical aggregated system (SEC79), which for all other purposes has already been replaced by a newer system (SEC95)."
"The difference is 16 years."
"Further, in the context of the fight against VAT fraud, the Court has identified a method based on a comparison between fiscal and statistical intermediate consumption data that can be particularly useful in pointing to areas where the risk of fiscal fraud is high."
"It therefore invites the Member States to consider the use of this method."
"In the customs area the Court reports on the complexity and variable application of the outward processing procedure."
"However, it also supports the Commission's proposal to modernise customs arrangements with an economic impact."
"With regard to the 1999 expenditure, a total amount of EUR 93.6 billion was entered into the account as new commitments, and payments amounting to EUR 80.3 billion were recorded."
"This is 96% and 92% respectively of the available appropriations for the year."
"The utilisation rates of the Financial Perspective estimates are 91% and 83% respectively."
"Expenditure from the Community budget is spread over many different areas."
"It is, therefore, difficult to draw general conclusions on this budgetary implementation."
"However, the Court makes the following major points."
"Half of the 1999 expenses are recorded under the common agricultural policy."
"As reported in chapter 2 of this annual report, the high rate of expenditure, which is almost 99% of final appropriations, is explained in part by numerous transfers that reflect in fact the poor quality of the initial estimates, of both revenue and expenditure."
"The Court invites both the Commission and the Member States to improve the quality of these estimates."
"There were also numerous transfers of appropriations for the Structural Funds that significantly altered the structure of the 1999 budget."
"Further, there were major differences between programme amounts and the amounts allocated by the Financial Perspective and the majority of Structural Fund interventions had to be rescheduled."
"In this area there was also an under-utilisation of commitment and payment appropriations and a concentration of transactions at the end of the year."
"In areas where the Community programmes are implemented directly by the Commission, such as internal policy and external actions, implementation rates are somewhat lower."
"There is also a heavy concentration of commitments and payments at the end of the year."
"This is something that we have come back to over the years."
"The Court repeats, consequently, its comments of previous years on the negative effects of this, for instance poor and hasty decisions, heavy workload creating a risk of errors and so on."
"Finally, in both the chapters on internal policies and external actions, the Court finds that the Commission's own comments on budgetary implementation are inadequate."
"The Court welcomes, therefore, the clear commitment of the Commission's answer to improve fundamentally its budgetary and accounting report."
"The Court has produced an annual Statement of Assurance since the 1994 budgetary year."
"Each year the Court has expressed serious criticism of the legality and regularity of the payments and the transactions underlying them."
"This is the case once again."
"Indeed, the audit of the 1999 payments revealed once again an unacceptable incidence of error which affected their amount or the reality or the eligibility of the transactions underlying them."
"The majority of these errors occurred in areas of the Community budget that are managed by the authorities in the Member States."
"They mainly comprise non-compliance with eligibility rules, overclaims, insufficient justification and calculation errors."
"There are also other failures to comply with regulations and systems weaknesses for which the effects on payments cannot be directly evaluated but which increase the risks of errors occurring."
"The most frequent examples here are problems in implementing regulatory control checks insufficiently, detailed supporting documentation and failure to comply with tender procedures."
"Thus, for 1999, the Court did not obtain the necessary evidence from its audit activities to ensure that the underlying transactions were legal and regular, except for own resources, commitments and administrative expenditure."
"On the other hand, for the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Fund, the Court gives a positive statement of assurance."
"Not only is it the duty of the Court to report on the errors found in its audits but we should also ensure that our audit findings are interpreted and used correctly."
"Therefore, let me remind Members of Parliament that the high incidence of errors found by the Court cannot, and must not, be seen as an indication of the level of fraud affecting the Community budget."
"Most of the payment errors found by the Court are due to problems of inadequate financial management and control and it is only in the case of a small proportion of the errors found that further reinvestigation by OLAF or the Member States' authorities is justified."
"Another risk of misrepresentation is that the objectives for corrective actions are set in terms of diminishing error rates and obtaining a positive statement of assurance."
"As the Court already pointed out in its previous report, a medium-term improvement requires a combination of general and specific measures, including the clarification and improvement of control procedures, particularly at the level of Member States."
"In this context, the Court welcomes the Commission's plan for improving financial management presented to the discharge authority in the context of the discharge for 1998."
"This reflection leads me to some comments on the reform of the Commission."
"The Court welcomes the efforts of the Prodi Commission to build a modern and robust structure of management and control and, at the same time, to focus on the way political priorities are set and resources allocated."
"Many of the weaknesses that the Commission now seeks to overcome have been emphasised by the Court on many occasions."
"For instance, the proposals of the Commission to increase the responsibility of authorising officers for the execution of commitments and payments while bringing to an end the centralised system of prior approval of transactions by the financial controller, together with the creation of an independent internal audit service, is in line with the key requirement for improved financial management that we lay down in our Opinion No 4/97."
"Another element of the reform that corresponds closely to a key priority identified by the Court is the increased focus to be placed on results and performance measurement within a framework of resource allocation that is consistent with predetermined priorities and objectives that are clearly defined and measurable."
"At sector level, the Commission has now announced reform programmes which can be seen as a response to concerns expressed by the Court over a number of years, for example, the proposals for improving the management of external aid programmes."
"This initiative is clearly based on an analysis very similar to that of the Court - most comprehensively set out in its Annual Report for 1997."
"Whereas the Court encourages the Commission to proceed from principles to practice as quickly as is feasible, it needs to be recalled that, as yet, much of the reform is still on paper only."
"The implementation of this new reform will need a genuine change of the management culture of the Commission, a process that will certainly take time."
"The Annual Report 1999, when reporting upon the follow-up of previous observations, shows how difficult it is for the Commission to implement the needed changes which have been agreed upon."
"In some cases, such as the reforms of the measures for the subsidised use of skimmed milk and skimmed milk powder or the programme of assistance to South Africa, as well as in certain areas of traditional own resources, the Commission has taken actions to remedy specific weaknesses reported upon by the Court."
"In other areas corrective action has been slow."
"For instance, for the milk quota system, the Court found that the overall situation had not significantly changed and that, contrary to the Court's view, increased quotas have been established, thereby giving rise to greater surpluses in the milk market and a heavy financial burden for public storage and disposal measures."
"In the case of the import of dairy products at preferential rates, the Court considers that nothing has been done so far to avoid breaches of regulations similar to those reported in the Court's Special Report No 4/98."
"In the area of the European Regional Development Fund, the Court followed up about 48 observations for which it believed a financial correction should be made."
"There are only 16 cases where the Court is satisfied with the corrective measures taken by the Commission."
"In the area of the social dialogue, the Commission has not undertaken all the measures it had agreed to carry out in its replies to the Court's observations."
"In the internal policies area, the Court re-audited nine contracts at the Transport and Energy Directorates-General and eight contracts at the Research Directorate-General."
"The Commission had only followed up three of the 17 contracts, with actions continuing on six others."
"In its 1996 annual report, the Court identified a number of weaknesses in the management of an export promotion fund for Nicaragua and Honduras."
"In its discharge recommendation published in 1998 the Council called on the Commission to review its relations with the regional bank and recover amounts unduly credited by this bank."
"At the end of 1999, the Commission was still in the process of setting up a new organisation."
"From these and other examples, it is clear that the Commission has hitherto not only been slow in implementing corrective measures but that it particularly faces problems when it comes to recovering unduly paid amounts."
"In its 2001 programme, the Court has therefore planned an overall audit covering all budgetary areas of the Commission's recovery procedures."
"As I indicated before, the Commission's financial management is only part of the overall management of Community funds."
"Member States are responsible for the day-to-day management of the bulk of Community funds in the areas of the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds."
"This annual report and the special reports published since the last discharge continue to draw attention to serious and persistent weaknesses in Member States' management and control systems."
"For instance, an important category of errors reported in the Statement of Assurance are irregular deductions by the central or local administrations on agricultural subsidies."
"Also in the area of the common agricultural policy, the Court calls upon Member States and the Commission to make checks more effectively by comprehensively applying to all Common Market Organisations inspection procedures comparable to those of the Integrated Administrative and Control System."
"The dramatic events of the recent past have clearly demonstrated the increasing importance of management and control issues on the European agenda."
"It should be clear to each and every one of us, whether as representatives of European institutions or of Member States, that this reflects a permanent change in the values and opinions of European taxpayers."
"They require, in exchange for their confidence and contribution, that the European funds are being spent in a meaningful and honest way."
"The commitment undertaken by the Commission should be seen as a constructive reply to this challenge: a reply that deserves our support."
"On the other hand, the Commission will be aware that it has now raised high expectations and that it is obliged to put into practice its good intentions and to produce results."
"It rests with the budgetary authorities, which have successfully triggered the reform that addresses public financial management concerns, to continue and reinforce their efforts to ensure that this reform succeeds."
"In practice, they will thus have to devote sufficient attention and resources to the follow-up to, and the feedback from, the reform process."
"Members of the European Parliament will be at the forefront of this."
"The new President of the Italian Court of Auditors, the Corte dei Conti, who was officially installed in office a few weeks ago, said in his instalment address: ""I am convinced that the relations between the Court of Auditors and Parliament would be significantly improved if Parliament strengthened the instruments that are designed to ensure that Parliament systematically takes results of audits carried out by the Court of Auditors into consideration""."
"I make his words mine."
"They imply that we wish to see a development of the working organisation and methods of this Parliament to reflect this need for structural change."
"Yesterday I had the opportunity - for which I thank the President - to discuss with the President of Parliament involving all the committees of this Parliament in the business of financial and management control."
"Last, but not least, we will also need the cooperation of the Member States."
"Being responsible for the day-to-day management of the bulk of Community funds, the Member States need to strengthen their financial controls and to take up fully their responsibilities in the fight against fraud against the Community budget."
"Only when all actors - the Commission, Parliament, the Council, the European Court of Auditors and the Member States - commit themselves to the reform and cooperate in this achievement will the confidence of the European taxpayer in Community financing be able to be restored."
"Thank you, Mr President. I now give the floor to Mrs Schreyer, who will speak on behalf of the Commission."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Karlsson very sincerely for his presentation on the annual report."
"Mrs Schreyer's report was just as interesting."
"But I would particularly like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, as President of the Court of Auditors, for the way you have kept the Members of the Committee on Budgetary Control informed this time round."
"This has enabled us to prepare for today's debate without having to obtain details from the press."
"As you said, Mr Karlsson, 1999 was a dramatic year, with the resignation of the previous Commission and the appointment of the new one."
"We do not expect that the new Commission will immediately be able to rectify all the mistakes and irregularities that Parliament uncovered and because of which it called, in vain, for reforms at that time."
"Like the Court of Auditors, we welcome President Prodi's efforts to reform the Commission and we are following the implementation of these efforts in a constructive but not uncritical way."
"Are things finally changing for the better as regards the Community budget?"
"We would have liked to have been able to say ""yes"" to that question, now that the new Commission has been in office for over a year and has, since September 1999, already been directly responsible for part of the process of implementing the 1999 budget."
"Unfortunately, we cannot yet answer with a clear conscience, even armed with the Court of Auditors' new annual report."
"The Court of Auditors has quite rightly noted the many steps that the new Commission has taken - or at least announced - in order to improve matters. Mrs Schreyer also mentioned this."
"I have in mind new procedures for setting priorities and allocating resources, changes in human resources policy, fundamental improvements in budget implementation and financial control, reform of programmes and the creation of an efficient audit service. But all these are still hopes for the future."
"The reality as described in the annual report is, however, more sobering."
"What is particularly regrettable and almost incomprehensible is that there are still problems about the reliability of accounting procedures."
"In other words, the Commission has not put its books in order, and the closures only reflect the true financial position subject to serious limitations."
"Information is missing on the payment of advances and the payment of instalments at the year end, and existing commitments are, believe it or not, undervalued by EUR 2.6 million."
"At the same time, the Court of Auditors says that potential claims have been significantly overvalued."
"Parliament expressly drew attention to these serious accounting errors during the discharge procedures for 1996, 1997 and 1998."
"Even if it is difficult and time consuming to fundamentally change budget management, we might have hoped, Commissioner, that the new Commission would at least manage to get the books straight without delay."
"But it is apparent that they have not even succeeded in doing that, which is a matter of great regret as far as I am concerned."
"When you assumed office, Mrs Schreyer, you assured us that you would strive to achieve this."
"The European Parliament now finds itself in an extremely difficult situation because earlier this year, in January, it declared that it could no longer accept a situation in which the 1999 closure was still marred by serious errors."
"You are familiar with the wording of that decision."
"But if there is no closure, that means that no discharge can be given for budgetary management, just as we said back in January."
"Closure is a condition for such a discharge."
"A solution needs to be found here, and I would like to ask you, Mrs Schreyer, if a correction of the 1999 accounts could be envisaged."
"Once again, and for the sixth successive time now, the Court is unable to give a positive statement of assurance, that is to say, it cannot give a guarantee of the legality and regularity of the procedures on which the financial statement is based."
"The number of errors occurring is too great for a guarantee of this kind to be given."
"The error rate is still well over 5%."
"Expressed in euros, that means that a sum of approximately EUR 5 billion was spent incorrectly."
"I most certainly recognise that fraud is not always involved, Mr Karlsson."
"It is often a case of carelessness or misunderstandings in the face of complicated rules and procedures, but there is no getting round it: an error rate this high is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated in the long run."
"I must refute your comments about poor implementation in the Member States, Mrs Schreyer, given that the Court of Auditors was quite clear about where the error rate lay within the Commission and, ultimately, it is still the Commission that bears responsibility for budget implementation."
"I would like to see more rigour here, so that we can really tell the European public that their money is being properly administered."
"We are now getting down to work in committee and will cooperate closely with you."
"Madam President, I should first of all like to thank the Court of Auditors for its annual report."
"I should like to draw attention to a number of problems, and I hope that Mr Karlsson will be able to answer my questions today."
"In connection with the 1997 discharge, we in Parliament agreed that, as Mrs Theato has just said, no discharge for 1999 could be given if the Court of Auditors was not in a position to issue a positive statement for 1999."
"However, I should like to know how serious the situation is regarding the 1999 accounts."
"Yesterday, I asked you a question - I appreciate there was not much time - but I should like to have a completely clear answer from you to the question of how great a percentage of error there is."
"We are told that this cannot be properly calculated."
"Yesterday, a member of the Court of Auditors gave a press conference and, at this press conference, a figure was given, and so I think we should be given one here, too."
"Is the percentage of error 5.5?"
"I hope I can obtain an answer."
"The Commission employed more than EUR 80 billion in 1999."
"However, the Commission has not been especially good at administering the Budget."
"The amount of fixed assets has been set EUR 240 million too low."
"Liabilities have been set EUR 2.6 billion too low, and unredeemed liabilities have been set EUR 1.2 billion too high."
"If the management of a private firm had committed such major blunders, then I am almost certain that the owners would have given them the sack."
"But let us pour a little oil on the waters now, so that we do not get ourselves worked up at this early stage."
"The former Commission, which was primarily responsible for the 1999 Budget, was indeed given the sack."
"The new Commission is to be judged this year on how good it has been at cleaning up and implementing reform."
"I am therefore pleased that the Court is attaching more importance to following up the earlier annual reports."
"This emerges clearly, of course, wherever there are still problems, but also where some sound improvements have been made."
"I could have done with seeing a much more practical annual report from the Court of Auditors."
"We must have more figures, and we must have more facts."
"Mr Karlsson said yesterday that it is not easy to come up with figures."
"I appreciate this, but I asked one of my employees to look at the agricultural section, and in an hour he had prepared a complete report on which countries were concerned, on what problems there were and also on how much money had gone missing."
"If this can be done in an hour by an able employee here in Parliament, then we can probably also demand that the Court of Auditors issue a report of this kind on all sections."
"Some unpalatable facts will emerge of course but, at the same time, we are demonstrating that transparency exists."
"In that way, we can shut the press up, which is merciless and scents blood every year when the Court of Auditors produces its report."
"Once and for all, we can say: 'Here are the problem areas, and we want to find solutions' ."
"I believe this is a good way of doing that, and I also think that the report should be much more practical."
"I should also have liked the Court of Auditors' report to have been a little more user-friendly and to have provided a number of clear recommendations, for example one or two per chapter."
"I could also do with seeing the Court of Auditors produce its report earlier in the year."
"It would give us more time for the discharge procedure in Parliament, and we should not need to defer the discharge every single year."
"As rapporteur, I now have only 14 days in which to ask the Commission questions, and in 14 days it has to supply me with the answers."
"It is almost unreasonable to make such demands, so if we could obtain the report much earlier, we could also produce a piece of work of even higher quality."
"I am also pleased that the Court emphasises that the 7% margin of error does not only relate to fraud, and I hope that the press is listening hard in the press room so that it is not only the scandals that are reported."
"There may be irregularities or ambiguities."
"What is really a relief is that it looks as though the right way to combat fraud has been embarked upon."
"Only very few cases have been referred to OLAF and for criminal investigation in the Member States, but it is important to remember that, as Mrs Theato also mentioned, 7% of the Budget corresponds to DKK 5 to 6 billion. If it comes down to figures, that amount is larger than the whole of the EU' s development aid."
"Reform of the Commission is largely about making the individual Directorates-General responsible, and I should like to ask the Court whether it has plans in future to restructure the annual report so that chapters for the individual Directorates-General are prepared."
"I shall try as early as this year to see whether this can be done so that we can make a start on assessing the Directorates-General."
"We can also make a start on assessing the Commissioners and giving them marks according to how good they are."
"They could perhaps be given a push in the right direction, if need be."
"The Court of Auditors emphasises once again that daily administration of most EU resources, for example within agriculture and the structural sphere, takes place in the Member States, and I completely agree with what has been said to the effect that the Member States now need to make sure they get their act together."
"The Member States avoid responsibility, misappropriate funds and do nothing whatsoever to exercise control and, every time criticisms are made, a storm of criticism rains down upon those in Brussels, that is to say the Commission and others."
"I think the Member States should be ashamed of themselves."
"In 1995, a convention to protect the EU' s economic interests was adopted."
"There is only one Member State which has implemented this in its legislation."
"It is simply not good enough, so make sure you in the Member States get your act together."
"Finally, I want to say that I am delighted with the cooperation in connection with the discharge."
"I am certain that we shall achieve a result, but it requires openness and honesty from all parties. We in Parliament are in no doubt that we want to be involved in doing something sensible, and we shall give discharge in April if we get what we are asking for."
"Madam President, I too would like to thank the chairman of the Court of Auditors for their report, and the Commissioner for their response to it."
"Yet again, public opinion will be the first casualty when the news hits the streets that there is to be no positive statement of assurance for European expenditure this time round either."
"Everyone knows - and this will crop up time and again - that the Member States spend the most money."
"So they must be the first port of call when it comes to raising revenue as I see it."
"It is also no secret that the lion' s share of expenditure goes on agriculture."
"A number of years ago, the Commission established, at Parliament' s insistence, that if there are irregularities, this could mean an additional financial correction of 25% for the Member States."
"I understand that the Court of Auditors is studying this, and would it not have been interesting if the Court of Auditors had studied what effects this had?"
"Could the same principle be applied to other sectors?"
"I would be very interested to know."
"I completely share Mr Blak' s dissatisfaction with the fact that the Court of Auditor' s report does not contain exact figures."
"Is the reliability of the expenditure 5% or 7%, and is it true that reliability is less than 3% in the case of agricultural expenditure?"
"The Court of Auditor' s constant refrain is that they do not have sufficient staff to analyse this."
"That may well be true, but when the Court of Auditors reaches a verdict, I take it as read that it will be based on exact figures."
"What I would like to know is why these figures cannot be published?"
"I also think we should set up a mediation committee for agriculture. Then, any disputes between the Commission and the financial corrections could be brought before it."
"Would the Commission and the Court of Auditors be prepared to endorse this proposal?"
"On a final note, Madam President, this financial report covers 1999."
"The Commission is bound to point out that it did not take office until September 1999, and will therefore deny all responsibility."
"I think it is high time we heard the last of that."
"I feel the Commission must give us a clear indication of when it expects to be able to deliver a positive statement of assurance, for we cannot keep postponing it year after year, as we have done since 1995."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, for this excellent report."
"I would also like to thank you for the procedure you followed."
"We were able to read things through more than a week in advance, and come well prepared."
"I believe that in principle it is a sound procedure."
"Only, to be perfectly honest with you, I was rather disenchanted with yesterday' s meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"It was too short."
"And you actually failed to answer a number of precise and really rather crucial questions put to you by the delegates, which I think is a shame."
"Some of these questions have already cropped up again in today' s debate, and I read in today' s Süddeutsche Zeitung that some of your colleagues do make detailed statements."
"Their themes are fraud, irregularities, and mistakes running to DM 8 billion."
"I also read that the erroneous percentage is certainly in excess of 5%."
"Why do we keep harping on about this figure?"
"Both Mr Mulder and the rapporteur did the same."
"We want to know why because it is important in our estimation."
"We have made political statements about this in the past."
"I would therefore be grateful if you could respond to this question again."
"We are aware that things are in very bad shape in the Commission, and that it still lacks a culture whereby the European taxpayer' s money is administered effectively."
"That is a pity."
"Of course, we all know that the Commission is working on its programme of reform."
"The President of the Court of Auditors also made reference to this, and in this sense, next year' s report will, of course, be the moment of truth."
"There is also indeed a need for action in the regional and national parliaments, because it is the Member States themselves that are responsible for a great many errors."
"I would therefore urge my counterparts in the national parliaments to ratify the two conventions that have yet to be ratified by all the Member States."
"I also call upon the Ministers, Heads of State and Government to endorse the proposal for a European Public Ministry at the Nice Summit."
"Lastly, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, a final request."
"Could you please make your report a little more user-friendly?"
"Tell the whole story."
"Name those Member States that are performing well, and those that are doing badly in some areas."
"It will make it more readable."
"It will raise interest in your report and give people the incentive to do better next time."
"Madam President, I, along with all my colleagues, wish to welcome this annual report which is presented to us in a spirit of constructiveness."
"The Commission and the Member States should see it in this light and use the findings of this report as a tool for improving their performance in managing the EU's finances."
"It is regrettable that it is not possible for the Court of Auditors to give a clean bill of health to the Commission with a positive Statement of Assurance."
"This situation has not changed since the first Statement of Assurance was published in respect of the 1994 budgetary year."
"Member States are responsible for managing 80% of the expenditure and a range of errors has been found by the Court at Member State level."
"This is somewhat disquieting."
"We should remind ourselves that the EU resources come directly or indirectly from European citizens."
"There is, therefore, a clear duty to account for every last euro of expenditure."
"We must ensure that the European citizens receive value for money."
"I am pleased that the Commission has taken steps to improve its management control over Community finances, and systems are being put in place in the Member States."
"This will diminish the level of errors."
"The Commission must be vigilant in its pursuit of proper management procedures at Member State level."
"We in Parliament must also be vigilant in seeing that the Commission carries out this task."
"The Commission has responsibility for implementing the budget."
"Proper management and control procedures, lack of planning, inadequate evaluations, loose or non-existent eligibility criteria frequently feature in this report."
"This, combined with the negative Statement of Assurance, makes some worrying reading for the taxpayer."
"I know that this report and the work that Parliament is about to embark on in the context of the discharge procedure will contribute to greater vigilance when it comes to Community spending."
"In conclusion, let us approach our task in a positive and constructive spirit in the best interests of the citizens of the EU."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, in 1999, the Netherlands made the highest per capita contribution to EU coffers."
"As a representative of these net payers, however, I am really rather disappointed in the Commission' s performance."
"We could give this Commission the benefit of the doubt over the discharge for 1998 because it was saddled with the legacy of the ousted Commission."
"However, the present Commission has to answer for the 1999 annual report and, unfortunately, it lists a whole series of shortcomings in the Commission' s accounts."
"What concerns me is that the Commission evidently does not consider itself bound by the budget approved by Parliament."
"Firstly, the Commission has committed EUR 400 million more than we budgeted for, and secondly, it has modified the original budget and implemented a revised version without Parliament' s approval."
"In 1999, the Netherlands only received 3% of total agricultural subsidies, when proportionally, it should work out at around 5%."
"I do not begrudge the poorer EU countries a comparatively larger share of agricultural aid, but to me, this makes it all the more unpalatable that the majority of irregularities should have arisen in the payment of agricultural subsidies."
"I would be very interested to know which Member States have benefited the most from these irregularities."
"The number of irregularities in the structural funds payments warrants a thorough investigation into the way these funds operate and their effectiveness."
"Reforming the Commission is no guarantee that previously recorded irregularities will not arise in the future."
"Therefore, now and in the future, the Commission will be held to account for non-compliance with the rules."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Karlsson for the important work the Court of Auditors is doing, and I also thank him that this year the publication of the report has not been pre-empted by newspaper headlines based on biased leaks, which sow so much mistrust of the work of this serious and impartial Court and of the tasks this Parliament and the other institutions have to perform."
"I especially appreciate the impartiality of his report, in which he points out the faults and praises the progress; for instance, he praises the fact that the Commission is getting moving."
"I belong to a group of MEPs working on the reform; we have just been with President Prodi and have seen that he has personally taken on the development of the White Paper in accordance with many of the recommendations that have been received year after year from the Court over which Mr Karlsson so ably presides."
"It must be said that this is actually a process on paper which takes time to turn into action, but it is going along the right road."
"It is going along the road that you, this Parliament and the independent experts are indicating."
"Problems still lie ahead on this road, however, such as the overly-long transitional period laid down for the reform of the Financial Regulation."
"We are in a period that is bad for everyone, including those responsible for payments, in which we have an old system, a new system and an intermediate period in which there is a certain feeling of confusion."
"I should be grateful if the Court would issue its opinion on the reform of the Financial Regulation soon."
"Madam President, I must ask: where is the Council in all this?"
"I think the Council is responsible for five sixths of Mr Karlsson' s report and for the spending it approves."
"Where is the Council?"
"Right now, Madam President, I should like to stop talking and wait for someone from the Council to come here."
"Therefore, may I suggest that in the next debate on the presentation of the accounts, the Council should be present and intervene."
"I repeat that the part of the report I most value is the recognition that the Commission is getting moving; but the same cannot be said about the Council, whose importance lies not only in the spending figures."
"You say that you keep on drawing attention to serious and persistent weaknesses in Member States' control and management systems, and you say that most of the errors occur in the main spending programmes managed by the Member States' administrations."
"I believe that we, the members of this Parliament, will be able to point to and lay the blame on our own administrations if they do not meet their commitments, but you have to do us the favour of clearly indicating the States and the programmes."
"I am convinced that in order for the Community' s financial interests to be properly defended any management failures must have consequences in the budget and Parliament must be able to deny funds to a Member State for repeated breaches of spending control regulations."
"Mr Pomés Ruiz, it is totally unacceptable that the Council' s seat is empty."
"You were quite right to bring it to my attention."
"Madam President, I am grateful too that the Council have come back because I have got something to say to them as well."
"Can I first of all thank Mr Karlsson because cooperation with the Committee on Budgetary Control this year has been much better than in previous years."
"Your work is crucial to our job because you are the experts and we then sort out the political problems."
"We must not forget that this report refers to the 1999 budget, the year when there was the forced resignation of the Commission, so it is clearly too early to judge yet."
"Next year will be the beginning of the real test as to whether the Commission's reform has started to bite at all."
"It is interesting to note that a key part of the Commission's reform is the whole question of who takes responsibility."
"Where does the buck stop?"
"Who is responsible?"
"We should today be assessing how the Commission and the Member States spend the money rather than assessing the work of the Court of Auditors."
"But I find that the work of the Court of Auditors has not been done sufficiently well to help us to do our job."
"Let us not forget, and I hope the Council once again is listening, that 80% of the money is spent in the Member States."
"The Court, as in other years, has failed to point out exactly where those failures occurred."
"We have asked time and time again for a 'sinners list'."
"We want to know where the problems lie, in which Member States, in which areas."
"We even want to know about good practice."
"You will note from one part of the report that two Member States have been exemplary in terms of VAT collection but how are other Member States supposed to copy these Member States if they do not know who they are."
"We need names."
"If you the Court will not do your job of naming and shaming, then we will have to do it for you."
"But your legitimacy as an auditing body will be questioned, and some might even suggest that some members of the Court are keen to protect the interests of Member States that nominated them."
"Will you make a commitment to do this in future, Mr Karlsson, because a lack of clear information in the report makes it very difficult for us to put pressure in the right areas on the worst offenders."
"I call on you also to publish a league table of those countries which have the worst record of maladministration in the EU and in what areas."
"Europe's taxpayers deserve to know where the money is going."
"Without the facts we are fighting fraud with one hand tied behind our back."
"Of course, there are no magic solutions to improving financial control in the Commission."
"The whole process will take time."
"We have a lot of vested interests to challenge but we will be watching next year's report for concrete evidence that the measures the Commission has put in place since its investiture have had a real impact in stamping out financial mismanagement."
"Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union is looming, and the report by the Court of Auditors leaves us in no doubt that there is still a great deal of work to be done in the candidate countries too."
"If we are to do all this on the already modest budgets we have at present, how are we to manage when these countries actually become members and start participating in the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds?"
"My group therefore feels it is imperative to start implementing our rules on financial control in the candidate countries without delay."
"We cannot start treating them as fully-fledged members soon enough in this respect."
"I would therefore ask the Court of Auditors to give us more information about this in future reports, so that we do not have to face any nasty surprises come accession day."
"Madam President, it is all very well having one representative from the Council here, but that is not enough, because - as has already been pointed out on several occasions - the majority of serious errors have been committed in the Member States."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control can no longer tolerate the impression being created, year in year out, that 'it is a real shambles in Brussels' , when the main culprits are sitting in the capital cities."
"That is why, Mr Karlsson, we are asking you to give us a better idea of who is doing well and who is making a mess of it."
"Only then, i.e. if those responsible are named, will we be able to tackle them and really get down to putting Europe' s house in order, so as to win back our citizens' trust."
"Finally, winning back that trust is also an important aspect, and I hope that by the end of this year, Parliament will have a clear statute, so that never again will these delegates be shown in a poor light in a Court of Auditors report."
"In order to achieve this, I also wish you, Madam President, a great deal of staying power, and would like to thank you for the commitment you have already shown to date."
"Madam President, I too would like to very sincerely thank the Court of Auditors for its report and also for the assessment that the Court gave the Committee on Budgetary Control yesterday, in which it stressed once again the much-needed efforts being made at reform."
"However, I would also like to support what Mr Staes said earlier."
"I think that if the Court leaves this much room for interpretation in its report, the result will always be critical headlines."
"For example, the Süddeutsche Zeitung today has ""Over DM 8 billion misspent - Court of Auditors refuses to give Commission discharge - Accusations of sloppy budget management""."
"This headline relates to a press conference by Mr Friedmann, and I must ask, Mr Karlsson, why Members of the Court of Auditors are making different statements, first in our Committee on Budgetary Control and then apparently to the press."
"I believe that we urgently need clearer criteria for next year's report by the Court of Auditors."
"The Commission and the Court really have a duty here."
"We need objectives in the various sectors, so that the public can genuinely judge where improvements have been made, otherwise the same thing will happen again every year, despite Parliament's endeavours in the direction of reform, based on the Court of Auditors' reports. We give our blessing to these reforms and then headlines like this more or less wipe out the benefit of all these efforts at reform in the public's eyes, because the public then just focuses on the mistakes and does not see the efforts that have been made to really achieve reforms."
"I therefore implore all of you to consider once again how we can set objectives so that we will be better prepared in terms of media relations next year."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we recently reached an agreement with the Court of Auditors under which we would be able to obtain advance information from the Court's annual report on a totally confidential basis, and we also agreed that we would be discreet about this."
"I am saddened to see that the Members of the Court of Auditors do not apparently respect this kind of agreement."
"So my question is whether we should repeat an arrangement of this kind in the coming years."
"I really think that you should have some concerns about the culture on your side, if the Court of Auditors is not capable of keeping its side of the bargain on such issues."
"Secondly, various honourable Members have already mentioned the lack of clarity here."
"You know, Mr Karlsson, that if you do not include the figures in the report, then others will work them out for you."
"Mrs Rühle and other previous speakers have mentioned percentages."
"Bearing in mind that there are error rates of up to 7%, Mrs Schreyer can no longer come along and tell us that the Court has endorsed the Commission's actions and has said that the Commission is on the right track, because that, of course, would be the track over the edge of the cliff!"
"But you have not included that in your report, and I am sick and tired of hearing, year after year, that the Member States are responsible for 80% and the Commission for only 20%, while the report itself does not point the finger of blame!"
"The points Mrs van der Laan made earlier should be included, and I am pleased to say that we agree about that."
"Let me be quite clear about this, you should name the Member States who are to blame even if you are nominated as Members of the Court of Auditors by those same Member States."
"After all, we have to judge what the new Commission achieved in 1999."
"What disturbs me, Mrs Schreyer, is that in many cases you have not honoured the commitments you gave to act on the Court's comments."
"I urge you, there really is some scope for improvement in the future - otherwise, your protestations that you want to adopt the right approach in tackling irregularities will merely be empty words."
"Mr President, although the Court cannot provide a positive Statement of Assurance for 1999, the tone of the report on the whole is more positive than it has been in previous years."
"I would like to congratulate the Commission, and Commissioner Schreyer in particular, on the Court's observation that many of the changes it has requested are being implemented or are on the way to being implemented."
"There is particular praise for the reform programme set in motion last year."
"I would also like to pick on the Council by asking why it is not moving forward on Article 24 of the Financial Regulation."
"Parliament moved very quickly to give its opinion and I hope that Council will be able to do the same and adopt its position well before Christmas."
"Having said that, I was disappointed in the report as the first step in the discharge procedure."
"It is too political in the negative sense of the word."
"It avoids strong criticisms and it does not point any fingers."
"Other Members have already pointed this out."
"Member States should be put on the spot when they misuse Community funds, and political groups in this Parliament should be named when they misuse taxpayers' money, as my colleague, Mr Kuhne, pointed out earlier this year."
"The error rate should be made explicit so that targets can be set for getting the error rate down."
"We need to look at the way the Court works and how its independence from the institutions and the programmes it is meant to audit can be strengthened."
"That may require giving the President of the Court more power to take decisions on the Court's working methods and on the way it communicates."
"I should like to say a few words about Parliament's place in this report."
"The report is positive about steps that have been taken by Parliament to remedy problems that have been identified by the Court, too positive in my view."
"Many of these changes have either not yet been implemented or have been implemented partially."
"Parliament can solve most problems by swiftly moving on two fronts."
"Firstly, by instituting its own internal audit service and secondly, by adopting three urgently needed statutes: a statute for Members, a statute for assistants and a statute for political groups."
"Finally, Mr Karlsson, while we, as a Parliament, make all these changes, perhaps you could go and help America count its votes!"
"The error rate in the Florida count is clearly still too high."
"Perhaps some European Union common sense will help sort out the problem and give George Bush his rightful place in history - its dustbin!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, this new report from the Court of Auditors which we have just received is of interest to the Committee on Budgetary Control because it makes a number of points concerning the problems of managing the Community budget, while at the same time warning us against the narrow interpretations that could be extracted from the crude exploitation of certain figures."
"But in addition to these, Mr President, we need more detailed explanations and analyses in order to progress."
"Let me quickly expand upon three points."
"First of all, there is a question of terminology: even though all too often no clear distinction is made between the notions of fraud and irregularity, the Court of Auditors warns us against the temptation to consider irregularities or errors as tantamount to cases of fraud."
"But it must be pointed out that the Court of Auditors itself says that cases of fraud are few in number."
"This report raises another point: the problems linked to VAT."
"VAT is an important component of the Community budget revenues."
"But it has to be recognised that we are faced with a complex system."
"Rates differ from one Member State to the next; their make-up also differs from one Member State to the next."
"For example, there is regional VAT in some Member States."
"We also still need to continue to question the implementing of fiscal harmonisation."
"The third point I would like to make concerns the debate which took place yesterday evening when the Court of Auditors' presented its annual report to the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The Court of Auditors was asked - and a number of speakers have reminded us of this morning - to explicitly name the Member States in which fraud and irregularities have been uncovered."
"I would warn us against the temptation to indulge in such practices."
"We are not looking for scapegoats, either in our institutions or in our Member States."
"What is more, as the working method applied by the Court of Auditors is based on sampling, we only have a partial view of the situation."
"The report from the Court of Auditors highlights, somewhat more so than in the past, the situation regarding the management and control of Community funds by the Member States."
"This analysis should lead us, as MEPs, and the Commission to put forward proposals to improve the management and financial control systems which the Member States must implement in order to protect the financial interests of the European Union."
"In conclusion, I would call for improved cooperation with the Council."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Commissioner, over the last two years the Court of Auditors has published six special reports on the subject of the common agricultural policy."
"In its special report on subsidies for the disposal of skimmed milk, it highlights a lack of supervisory measures, a level of falsification of milk data and fraudulent use of this data that is unparalleled in any other agricultural sector."
"In its report on the disposal of butter, the Court of Auditors noted that 89% of the budget is spent on subsidies to the food industry through procedures of dubious transparency and of even more dubious efficiency in terms of their impact on farmers' incomes."
"In both cases, this involves a limited number of countries and a limited number of economic agents, who are the direct beneficiaries of these policies."
"In what has been its most important work on the common agricultural policy, the special report on arable crops, the Court concluded that, from 1993 to 1997, the Community budget paid out a sum of more than EUR 13 billion more than could reasonably have been expected."
"Arable crops represent 43% of the CAP budget, but only 10.7% of the end product."
"In 1995, almost 40% of payments went to the top 3% of beneficiaries, whilst 57%, the smaller beneficiaries, received only 4.5% of payments."
"The Court, therefore, quite rightly concluded that support for farmers should not be provided on the basis of price, production or area, but of support for the net income of farmers or of agricultural work units."
"These are excellent, high-quality documents, which are a ""drop in the ocean"" in a common agricultural policy that still gives special treatment to larger farmers at the expense of the smaller ones and to countries and regions at the heart of Europe at the expense of peripheral countries and regions."
"It is a shame that the Court of Auditors' annual report, which is supposedly drawn up to reflect the most relevant aspects of the work undertaken in the course of the year through the special reports, did not include these studies and decided to concentrate on other issues on which it had not undertaken specific studies."
"First of all, on the procedure for presenting the annual report to Parliament and the Budgetary Control Committee, I am happy to listen to the assurances from Members of Parliament that the situation this year is more satisfactory than before."
"I hope that we can jointly conclude that we have found the right approach to the discharge procedure."
"I say to Mr Staes that I am sorry I did not have the chance to answer all the questions that were asked in yesterday's meeting."
"I may also have that problem today."
"However, I pointed out that we are only at the beginning of this discharge procedure."
"I sincerely hope that we will be able to give a reasonable answer to any question that Parliament or the Budgetary Control Committee wishes to ask and that all questions that were asked yesterday and in this debate will be properly answered."
"I now turn to the construction of the Statement of Assurance and the question of figures."
"First of all I point out - not only to Mr Blak, rapporteur for this year's discharge, but to Mr Mulder - that we have gradually changed and developed the procedure for drawing up the Statement of Assurance in close collaboration with this Parliament and the Budgetary Control Committee, to meet with the wishes of the Committee by including in the Statement of Assurance the specific observations in the different budget areas."
"This is a result of the discussion that we have had hitherto."
"I emphasise - to Mr Mulder, Mr Blak, Mrs van der Laan, Mrs Morgan and to all the other speakers who have expressed themselves on this issue - that the Court will continue to develop that."
"But I should like to make it abundantly clear that a procedure of this kind has to develop very gradually so that we do not have a complete change in the method of data collation because then the value of this exercise would not meet the requirements we are set under the Treaty."
"Concerning the accuracy of the figure that Mr Blak queried: 5.5% or 3%?"
"Do not ask me questions that are impossible to answer."
"We did not produce a figure last year and we have not produced a figure this year."
"So the question of whether last year's figure corresponds to this year's figure is unreasonable."
"A Statement of Assurance is a very detailed exercise, including not only specific observations on the different budget areas but also a global appraisal."
"We will study that in detail, with your excellent secretaries."
"I am very happy to hear that you have staff at your disposal able to summarise the Court's report in one hour."
"I am extremely happy."
"Perhaps we will steal that person from you."
"But we will have a chance to go through all that."
"I will see to it that the rapporteur for the discharge is fully informed of all the details."
"Members of the Budgetary Control Committee point out the need for more precision."
"You are right that we have to be more precise in our observations."
"When you study this annual report you will find that what the Court is trying to do is to see to it that the clearance of accounts becomes a real instrument for analysing shortcomings in implementing the agricultural policy."
"But a delay of more than two years makes the value of this exercise very limited."
"What we also point out is that, in the other area of the big bulk of spending in the Member States, we do not have a procedure corresponding to the clearance of accounts."
"That is in the Structural Funds."
"It is very difficult to be more precise when we do not have a clearance system that would give the answers that we ask for, for instance in respect of the Social Fund."
"I pledge that we will continue, together with the Committee on Budgetary Control and Parliament, to see that we develop more precise information so as to tackle the real problem."
"The Court entirely agrees with Parliament that it is not only a question of reform of the Commission or of Parliament reforming its way of working with financial control."
"The Court of Auditors also has to change its working methods."
"Now, to the question of naming: I cannot accept Mr van Hulten's view that this report is too political in the sense that we avoid naming the names that should be named."
"You are listening to a Member who, as rapporteur for the Committee on Development, was once responsible for naming not only two countries but two companies and where the Court of Auditors was taken to the Court of Justice because of that."
"He implies that for political reasons we are scared to mention the names necessary for the audit that we independently find important, but I have evidence to prove the opposite."
"It was quite clear, in this particular case, that the Court of First Instance supported us by saying we not only have the right to mention these names but also a duty to do so."
"If you look at the report of the Court of Auditors on the anti-pollution measures of the Commission, you will find not only countries named but also regions and the French Member of the Court of Auditors from Brittany, Mr Jean-François Bernicot, did not protest at the fact that we dealt with his Brittany page after page."
"When it is relevant, from the audit point of view, we mention everything that has to be mentioned."
"This is the policy and principle of the Court."
"The intention of the Court of Auditors is not to become a political instrument but to be an objective instrument for your political control here in Parliament and we will continue to work towards this end."
"Having said that, I pledge that we will listen carefully to Parliament's requests for more precise instruments of analysis and we will ensure that we can use all these instruments to satisfy the needs of political control."
"I will come back to that next time when I report and give you the plan for the programme of work for next year when we see each other again."
"I stress, Mr Mulder, what I said yesterday."
"From a technical, statistical point of view, specific DAS figures on each country and major political field would require an enormous amount of personnel because when you diminish the population you increase the need for the sample so the amount of sampling will require an enormous amount of work that I do not think anyone would find feasible."
"That is why we should use other methods and adopt the approach that we have agreed on the specific observations field and bring the DAS exercise more in line with the other audits, not only of the Court, but also of the Commission and of the Member States, in the clearance of accounts."
"I was also thinking about Florida this morning, Mr van Hulten, and I am thankful that I was not responsible for auditing the election procedure in that specific state."
"There is always something to be happy about."
"I hope that the debate is over so that I can answer any question that I may have forgotten."
"I must comment, Mr Blak, on what you said."
"You want us to restructure the report and we have done that."
"I would just like to remind you that after the dialogue that we had between the Committee on Budgetary Control, we have restructured the report."
"You suggested that the report should reflect the portfolios of commissioners or directors-general."
"I would warn against that."
"Commissioners, like Mr Fischler who is responsible for executing half of the budget, must have a bigger chapter than those commissioners who have no dealings with the budget."
"Let us be open and discuss how we will structure the reporting so that it will be as satisfactory as possible."
"Thank you very much, Mr Karlsson."
"The debate is closed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as I am sure you will have noticed, the last part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors was marred by an unfortunate bug that intruded between his speech and this Chamber."
"For that reason and in order to sort out this bug, we shall have to suspend the sitting for two or three minutes to find a way of solving this technical problem."
"(The sitting was suspended for three minutes in order to solve a technical problem)"
"General product safety"
"The next item is the report (A5­0309/2000) by Mrs González Álvarez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on general product safety (COM(2000)139 - C5­0224/2000 - 2000/0073(COD))."
"Mr President, today we are debating a proposal on general product safety."
"The Parliamentary Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy considers it to be a generally good proposal."
"Therefore, there are few amendments."
"Perhaps the quality of the proposal is due in part to the fact that the Commission consulted over 14 consumer organisations and these pointed out the difficulties there had been in implementing the 1992 directive."
"I think some of the observations made by the consumer organisations are included in the Commission' s proposal."
"I shall give one example, one that I know the Council has some difficulties with, but which for Parliament is highly important and we wholly support it: the ban on exporting products deemed unsafe to third countries."
"And the same has happened with other proposals in the document, which to us seem acceptable."
"Therefore we have not made too many changes, but there are some which we believe will better safeguard consumer rights."
"This report was approved by a large majority in the Parliamentary Committee on the Environment, and I shall therefore stand by the result of the Committee' s vote."
"The proposals approved in the Committee on the Environment deal with enhancing transparency and consumer information; ensuring the recall of products even when they are already in the hands of consumers; limiting professional confidentiality to the bare essentials; clarifying the definition of a safe product and a dangerous product; including the monitoring of the safety of product installation and maintenance (because sometimes this installation and maintenance may present a risk to consumer safety); including the precautionary principle, a useful principle little used in the European Union (if it were, we would not have problems such as mad cow disease, to be examined this afternoon, the dioxin issue, or other matters relating to genetically modified products); ensuring a certain harmonisation of surveillance and follow-up programmes (it is important that Member States should maintain some equality in these surveillance and follow-up programmes); and in general arranging for consumers to be given information in the language of the country in which they buy the products."
"Mr President, unfortunately we cannot accept some amendments first tabled in the Committee on the Environment and now tabled here, which go against these principles."
"I shall mention two examples."
"The first concerns Amendment No 4."
"It proposes removing a paragraph which simply asks producers and distributors to inform the authorities in the Member States immediately if they learn of a dangerous product."
"We must not allow this paragraph to be removed."
"Another paragraph that some wish to remove concerns professional secrecy and says that professional secrecy must be subordinated to the efficiency of dangerous product surveillance and follow-up services."
"We must not allow this paragraph to be removed either."
"Some amendments, such as Nos 1 and 18, deal with questions that basically concern the United Kingdom, and it must be said that all the groups from the United Kingdom, whether socialist, popular or green, have supported them vehemently and they have been approved in the Committee on the Environment."
"They relate to a matter that is very specific to the United Kingdom, that is, charity shops and sales more or less between private individuals."
"Some of us from other countries do not understand so well this concern of our United Kingdom colleagues, but the amendments were approved in the Committee on the Environment and so I have to explain the fact."
"Mr President, I thank the Commission and the Council for their collaboration in the preparation of this report."
"I believe the Committee on the Environment has drawn up a report that tries to go more deeply into consumer rights and safety."
"In view of what has happened in recent years, especially in the food sector, I believe this to be a very important directive and I hope it will be approved by a large proportion of this Parliament, even though, as I said before, certain amendments presented go against the spirit adopted in the Committee on the Environment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the attitude of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market towards this matter is quite different from that of the responsible committee, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"We believe that a whole raft of amendments to this proposal for a directive are necessary, and regret that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has not adopted these."
"I am therefore deeply grateful to the PPE Group for having adopted these amendments here today and tabling them for further debate here in this Chamber."
"I would like to comment on just two aspects."
"First, we believe it is wrong that the possible liability of suppliers of services is addressed under this directive on general product safety, because we quite simply consider that issues relating to potential liability of suppliers of services have no place in this directive on general product safety, but should, if necessary, be dealt with in parallel elsewhere."
"My second point is about export bans, which have previously been so highly praised."
"A majority of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is of the view that there is no legal basis for these."
"In light of recent experience, notably the European Court of Justice ruling on tobacco advertising, I can really only urge this House to heed the recommendations to plenary of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as the committee responsible for such matters."
"Otherwise, I regard it as quite possible that the European Court of Justice will make another embarrassing ruling on this issue."
"For this simple reason we have expressed a different viewpoint, and we can only advise this Chamber, on behalf of a majority of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to accept Amendments Nos 38 or 41 in particular, as these relate to a weakening of export bans."
"On behalf of my group, I would like to say that if neither of these amendments is adopted, the PPE Group believes that the entire report should be rejected, because we really have had enough of adopting illegal proposals in this place!"
"Mr President, in March this year we adopted the directive on cableway installations designed to carry persons."
"If the directive had already been implemented, the accident in Austria might not have happened."
"This demonstrates just how important legislation is here, and directives in areas as sensitive as product safety need to be implemented as soon as possible."
"I hope that will happen before 3 May 2002."
"The proposal on product safety before us today is a general directive relating in particular to those areas not covered by existing directives."
"I would like to thank the Commission for adding a very important new point here. I have in mind the presumption of conformity, that is to say that if products comply with European standards they are considered to be safe."
"I believe that this principle is enormously important for consumer protection because it makes it possible to check at any point whether a product complies with standards or not."
"In view of this, Amendment No 37, which provides for external certification and for CE declarations to be issued not just by companies, but also by external and impartial agencies, is particularly important for consumer protection, because it would, of course, considerably increase consumers' confidence in such declarations."
"In the case of Amendment No 14 on the publication of standards in the Official Journal, I naturally have some difficulty with this because the present copyright is with the national standards agencies, who are therefore entitled to royalty payments from the European Union."
"In addition, there is the question of what the scope of current standards in Europe is and what the scope of European standards would be."
"I therefore have some very considerable reservations and wish to reject this particular provision."
"With regard to export bans, it cannot automatically be assumed that our standards are appropriate throughout the world."
"There are many countries that have their own regulations and safety standards which meet those countries' needs far better than standards currently in force in Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs González Álvarez has produced a very convincing report, but my group does not agree with the idea of product liability applying to services as envisaged by the Commission."
"For example, in many sectors, products are no longer assembled by the manufacturer, with the component parts instead being delivered to dealers."
"This means that everyone involved in the sales chain who can affect the safety characteristics of a product now bears liability as a manufacturer, so that all dealers who carry out assembly work are classified as manufacturers."
"We believe that in such cases the trade should not be burdened with manufacturer's duties under product safety legislation."
"There are certainly other ways of guaranteeing adequate protection for consumers under civil law, for example, compensation for damages as a consequence of contractual liability."
"I must say that I was amazed that the Commission's experts have not solved this problem themselves and I trust that the new Commissioner will give this problem some more thought."
"And I hope that there will not be any problems with the Commission as regards exempting charitable organisations and non-profit making bodies from the provisions of this product safety directive."
"When it comes to exports, I quite agree that exports should be banned in cases where the Commission has stopped a product from being placed on the market or has ordered a product recall."
"But a Commission requirement for safety checks cannot be sufficient grounds for bringing whole branches of the export business to a halt."
"As various honourable Members have already said, at the very least proof that different safety rules apply in the importing country should be accepted."
"I can only urge the Commission to think again about this problem area, please."
"We are at first reading."
"At second or third reading it is necessary to secure the famous 314 votes, and if the report is still in the same form as now that will certainly not happen."
"Mr President, I join the general congratulations to Mrs González Álvarez who has been a sympathetic and inclusive rapporteur."
"She may occasionally have found the eccentricities of British car boot sales hard to follow but that, too, came within the remit of her personal charity."
"This directive should be welcomed by the whole House and the issue of general product safety and its extension is something which must be commended."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, under the wise guidance of our rapporteur, we passed a series of amendments which, again, my group would commend en bloc to the House today."
"We are less happy with some of the later ones."
"We have heard the justifications for them and for the reprise of the industrial arguments which we heard in committee."
"We remain unpersuaded and we will vote against most of them."
"Perhaps before the vote, Mrs Lulling or one of her colleagues, will tell us what the exact wording, particularly in the English version, of Amendment No 42, is."
"We could support it if the wording was 'installation and maintenance' and not 'installation as maintenance'."
"I am sure this is an error and if this can be confirmed, we will support it."
"This proposal includes some extremely valuable general principles including the one which the other side of the Chamber appears to find offensive."
"That is the principle that we do not export products that we believe are unsafe for our own people in the European Union."
"Increasingly, as world trade develops, we are faced with this problem and we have to tackle it and not back away on the grounds that somehow the rest of the world does not matter, whether it is the safety of its health, its foodstuffs or the product which we export to it."
"We have to look now at the links between products and services."
"The Commission have begun to take a tentative but welcome step in that direction and perhaps the Commissioner will say more about that when he replies."
"Finally, I would like to say a word about charity shops and car boot sales and all those other exchanges of donated and individual second-hand goods."
"The charity shops welcome the general protection of this directive."
"But they need an exemption from the obligation under Article 2 to provide information that they simply do not have."
"Our Amendments Nos 1, 8 and 18 bear on that point."
"I hope it will be possible for the House to support these because it cannot be anybody's intention to see these valuable and usually non-profitable charitable activities effectively driven out by an information provision which should relate to mainline manufacturers and to new or well attested products."
"Provided the vendor can always inform the buyer of the nature of the goods and the limitations on the information that should be sufficient."
"Mr President, it is a fact of life that directives must be evaluated and modified from time to time, and in fact this occurs all too seldom."
"As far as we are concerned, the Commission deserves to be complimented on the way it has handled matters on this occasion."
"The procedure it followed was first-rate and also very inclusive."
"This directive gives rise to a certain tension between what can reasonably be expected of producers, on the one hand, and consumer protection on the other."
"In that respect, I would, in a sense, concur with Mr Lehne when he said that recent statements by the Court indicated that this is a rather nebulous area, when it comes to what the Union can, and cannot, do."
"In particular, the aspect concerning the definition of exports is something we must look into very closely."
"As matters stand, my group is inclined to support the proposals now on the table, but I would appreciate it if the Commissioner could go into this aspect again in a little more depth."
"Incidentally, we support the Commission' s proposals concerning the extension of the directive's scope of application to include services, and also the incorporation of migrated products, even though there is certainly still a lot more that could be done in these areas, which will no doubt fall to us in the future."
"We concur with the rapporteur where he has highlighted the importance of providing consumers with information about the risks, and the need for transparency, especially in the sphere of health and safety."
"That must indeed be the general principle."
"Two final remarks, the first of which relates specifically to a particular amendment concerning the Commission' s proposal that producers should inform the competent authorities immediately when they discover that a product is dangerous."
"We believe this to be a very important element."
"There is a proposal to scrap this idea, one of the considerations being that producers should not have to incriminate themselves, and also in the light of professional secrecy."
"We feel that the emphasis really must be on consumer protection here, and that a producer who discovers that his product is actually dangerous should not be allowed to sit on his hands."
"Finally, a brief question for the Commission about Article 4, which concerns European standards and the question as to whether they must be disclosed."
"I would be grateful if the Commission could go into this in a little more depth."
"Mr President, the proposal under consideration was certainly long-awaited."
"However, what we have to decide is whether it responds fully to the aims which, eight years ago, it was hoped to achieve through its promulgation or whether it may create further confusion."
"And this is certainly not the fault of the work carried out by Mrs González Álvarez, who has endeavoured very successfully to improve the legislation under consideration, but is inherent in both the guidelines and parts of the proposal itself."
"Firstly, in the case in point, the Commission, as the principal author of the legislative process, appears to have appointed itself an administrative authority, although there is no adequate legal and transparent legislative structure to define this new role, even from the point of view of defining its field of operation and monitoring its rapid action decisions."
"Furthermore, in view of its potential power to act autonomously as regards the introduction of emergency measures, not to mention the presumably lengthy period which will pass before it is possible to ascertain whether these measures are well-founded, even purely in terms of employment, it should be noted that there is no mention of the damage which would be caused to a company - to its employees in particular - by an erroneous decision."
"On the other hand, it does provide for a ban on exporting products classed as dangerous, which is certainly evidence of the Union's high level of civilisation, but there is no clear indication of whether this ban is consistent with the procedure known as Prior Informative Concert, laid down, in fact, by international conventions."
"The concept of liability, in terms of the definition of the word product, product traceability and the inclusion of products used to provide services in this definition, also appears to be open to interpretation and therefore to subjective action."
"At the same time, we should consider the possible interpretations as a product of the raw materials in the manufacturing processes and the positive implications of this in terms of guaranteeing health and safety at the workplace, although this endeavour is limited by the lack of an appropriate European statistics recording system and by the inconsistencies between legal systems for recognising an occupational illness."
"In conclusion, I call upon the Commission to set in motion a coordination project within the framework of existing Community legislation and to make our legislation both more transparent and also genuinely beneficial owing to its certainty."
"Mr President, it goes without saying that we need a certain basic level of consumer protection in the European Union."
"But do we really need a completely harmonised and uniform standard of protection?"
"It does not seem to me to be a particularly good idea, quite apart from the high cost, stringent regulation and associated red tape."
"I would have thought it would be better to take more account of subsidiarity."
"A Danish or German consumer has different safety requirements to a Dutch or Italian consumer."
"We must give more consideration to this diversity in the directive on general product safety."
"Furthermore, I feel there is insufficient reason for the Commission to produce proposals on the safety of services."
"By its very nature, the service industry is less suited to this approach."
"A producer can take a product back, but it would, of course, be rather difficult for a service provider to do so with a service."
"I welcome the fact that exceptions have been made for shops associated with charitable institutions and non-profit organisations, as well as for articles sold as second-hand goods at markets or car boot sales."
"Finally, I was wondering whether, on closer inspection, Amendment No 14, tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has been formulated correctly."
"It does not seem to me to be a problem if an agreement is reached between a standardisation body and the government, which makes European standards freely accessible to the public. After all, that is not the same as the Commission publishing the European standards."
"I would be interested to hear what the Commissioner has to say about this."
"Well done Mother Europe!"
"Thank you Mother Europe for taking care of your children!"
"Or should I say, rather, thank you Father Byrne!"
"Thank you because all the safety directives aim to preserve the well-being of our European citizens, from minors, from children right up to the elderly."
"This is certainly positive."
"However, I do recall a substantial discussion which I had with my daughter, Elisabetta, when she was nine years old and wanted to be allowed to go out on her own."
"I told her that she could not go out unaccompanied because it was dangerous."
"Then, some years later, when I allowed my second daughter, who is six or seven years younger, to go out on her own, Elisabetta protested: ""But Daddy, you never let me go out on my own and here you are, letting my sister out alone, and she is younger than I was!"""
"In effect, a good father must indeed take into account the safety of his children, but he must also realise that they cannot be wrapped in cotton wool. They have to learn to be independent."
"What is the point of all this?"
"The point is that all the safety directives must be balanced. A balance must be achieved."
"We must indeed be safe but we must not stifle production, in this case, which has to be free."
"Most importantly - and here I am addressing the Council representative - how can any safety directives be effectively implemented if the Council refuses to endorse the directive on safety inspections and controls?"
"The outcome will be the same as in the mad cow affair: thousands of safety measures leading, regrettably, to the slaughter of millions of animals."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her work, which addresses the fundamental concerns of consumers' associations, which must be accepted as equal partners in a constructive dialogue."
"We Socialists in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy support the Commission' s initiative to clarify procedures for informing the public and for recalling products that are deemed to be dangerous, and for extending this responsibility to distributors and producers of services to the extent they are involved."
"These producers and distributors must unequivocally accept the consequences of the foreseeable risks inherent in their products, from the installation of equipment to its maintenance. They are also responsible for informing the authorities and consumers and for fair compensation for damages."
"Recalling products in a situation of risk should not be done as a last resort but must begin as soon as there are reasonable grounds for taking this course of action in the light of recent scientific advances."
"Community standardisation must be based on appropriate scientific knowledge and we must therefore foster cooperation between Member States in researching the safety of products in general and of high-risk groups in particular, such as children, the elderly, new youth cultures, new lifestyles and people with a history of illness."
"The reliability of product safety and after-sale care represent added value for a ""made in Europe"" label at a particularly difficult and crucial time."
"Any measures that increase confidence and mean that European products are manufactured and distributed with respect for workers' health, for social rights, for the environment, for fair competition and with rigorous safety requirements are to be welcomed."
"Any product that does not match up to this standard must be withdrawn and appropriately disposed of, because products that we would not wish for ourselves should not be exported to more disadvantaged countries either."
"I hope that this directive will help to respond, in part, to the European public's increasing concerns about consumer safety."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there has been a directive on general product safety since 1992."
"The purpose of the present debate is to review the experience we have gained with the existing directive, to incorporate that experience and to eliminate any shortcomings."
"I rather doubt whether we have adequately achieved that."
"There are certainly complex legal issues here."
"The scope of the directive in relation to the wide variety of national and Community product legislation needs to be defined, as that legislation, too, covers the same safety ground."
"We need to ensure seamless consumer protection but without regulating the same things more than once or even in contradictory ways."
"The possibility of having a product's compliance with regulations certified by an external agency would certainly be very helpful in this case and would ensure a clearer and more logical approach."
"However, it would have been better to have an EU regulation providing for a general European system and eliminating the simultaneous existence of national regulations in Europe."
"In the food sector, for example, there are also numerous rules and regulations which are currently being amended and revised as a result of proposed EU regulations and I think this will help us to reach a high standard of safety."
"In other sectors, this directive has been extended to other fields of application."
"The inclusion of service-related products will lead to dealers and the craft sector increasingly being burdened with obligations which are actually the responsibility of the manufacturer."
"Elsewhere, we are calling on the Commission to present a proposal on the safety of services, so it is not evident why we should or would want to regulate service aspects here and now, instead of waiting for the Commission's proposal, since it is becoming increasingly clear that problems with demarcation between different provisions will arise and that legal uncertainty will grow as time goes on."
"Just a few more words about export issues."
"On the one hand we are demanding widely varying safety standards and like Mr Blokland are calling for national and regional needs to be taken into account, and on the other we want to impose our national provisions on countries we export to."
"I feel that this means there is a fundamental contradiction in the directive's approach, which we cannot support as it is proposed here."
"Mr President, at this time it is certainly nothing new to state that there is a great divide between the citizens and the European Union."
"Lack of confidence in the possibility of ensuring food safety, for example, is spreading like wildfire and, when all is said and done, obscures the Union's positive work in this sector."
"But we are going to discuss this today."
"In this context, it is therefore important to emphasise the political value of the directive upon which we are about to vote."
"Thanks to the Commission's sound proposal, further improved by Mrs González Álvarez's work, the text that we are examining today at last brings good news for consumers, to which, moreover, the non-governmental organisations which represent them bear witness."
"The laws on product safety, in particular the safety of those products which have hitherto escaped regulation by the vertical legislation already governing the matter, is being improved, consolidated and made more transparent."
"A great deal of effort has been made to better define the interaction between vertical laws on certain categories of products and this new horizontal directive, so as to definitely achieve a satisfactory result."
"Then I would like to stress the importance of the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which increase transparency towards the end consumer and apportion responsibility to distributors as well as producers in the event of products deemed dangerous being withdrawn from the market."
"In the hope of seeing the final line taken by the rapporteur endorsed and declaring my support for her regarding the amendments which are to be put to the vote in plenary, I trust that this directive will rapidly continue through the procedures so that the European citizens can be provided with confirmation of the Union's undertaking to preserve their safety as soon as possible."
"First of all I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, the draftsmen, Mr Rübig and Mr Lehne, and the respective committees for their very comprehensive report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on general product safety."
"The current Commission proposal is in response to the numerous problems related to the health and safety of consumers which have occurred recently."
"Although the review and revision of the directive are formally required by the directive itself, this coincides with the reinforced commitment by the Commission to safeguard the health and safety of consumers."
"The revised directive will be of relevance for food safety for only a limited period of time but it will, in the long term, improve the possibilities for dealing with non-food product safety problems."
"I would only say a few words to present the main aspects of this proposal."
"The idea behind the directive is simple: that only safe products are placed on the market."
"This means European products as well as imported products."
"The two key objectives of the general products safety directive are: ensuring a high and consistent level of protection for consumer health and safety throughout Europe and ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market."
"We had extensive consultations with stakeholders - as the rapporteur has acknowledged - on implementation of the present directive, which brought to light certain weaknesses which we are now trying to correct."
"We first clarify the scope of the directive."
"This directive is meant to provide good and consistent assurances of the safety of products for consumers."
"It is also meant to fill possible gaps in sectoral legislation, for instance, market surveillance or emergency procedures that are rarely provided for in specific legislation."
"However, it does not apply when specific sectoral legislation covering the same aspect applies."
"This also means that when new sectoral legislation is devised it supersedes the corresponding provisions of this directive."
"For example, in the foodstuffs area - as you well know - when we have a food authority, the authority itself should provide a notification system which will take over from the general product safety provisions."
"We wanted to make sure that the directive gave the best coverage possible to products used by consumers."
"This also means products which have migrated from the professional field to personal use: for instance, laser pointers; and, secondly, products which are used to provide a service."
"We wanted to have a more efficient system."
"This implies additional obligations for producers and distributors to provide information."
"The present situation is less than ideal."
"It is incredible, for example, that authorities in our Member States are sometimes informed by the US authorities that a certain European product is dangerous."
"The notification is compulsory in the United States but not, so far, in the European Union."
"As you know, law is no good if it is not applied properly."
"Member States will now be required to strengthen the tasks of competent surveillance authorities."
"They will be required to establish sanctions."
"They will have to develop links with other Member States as well; in particular, through a network of enforcement authorities of Member States."
"This is also extremely important from an industry point of view in order to make sure that a level playing field is maintained between competitors and especially with imported products."
"Improvement of Rapex (the rapid alert system operated by the Commission) is also necessary."
"The scope of Rapex is extended to include voluntary measures taken by industry to withdraw a product."
"The practical operation of the system will be improved."
"We now also provide for the possibility of opening the system to third countries, in particular to the candidate countries: simplification of procedures for emergency measures at Community level so that we can take rapid action following the advice of a regulatory committee."
"We have now introduced an export ban for products withdrawn at Community level."
"Another point to which I wish to draw your attention is the question of improved transparency."
"Consumers often lack confidence because they do not know what is happening."
"Nothing undermines consumer confidence more than a belief that something is going on that they do not know about."
"We believe that, in line with the general policy of the Commission, citizens have the right to know which real dangers they are exposed to and the measures taken to prevent that."
"The limitation to this is professional secrecy as defined in Article 287 of the Treaty, except when there are overriding public health reasons."
"I expect that exception will be drawn and interpreted narrowly."
"I am very pleased that the report of Mrs González Álvarez endorses the main principles of the Commission proposal."
"Many of the proposed amendments of the report are an improvement on the text and can therefore be accepted by the Commission."
"Allow me to address first the amendments with which the Commission cannot agree."
"Firstly, Amendments Nos 1, 8 and 18 propose to exempt second-hand goods sold by charity shops and non-profit organisations, private persons, flea markets and car boot sales, as Mr Whitehead has said, from the obligation to provide information and documentation on product risk and product origin."
"The obligations of distributors, which have been a part of the directive since 1992, are formulated in a very generic and flexible way."
"The only new requirement is that distributors, within the limits of their respective activities, are to safeguard and provide to the authorities on request the available documentation necessary for tracing the origin of products."
"This does not imply that distributors should actively inquire about the origin of a product, but just that they should not destroy identification of the product and/or manufacturer and keep trace of any useful information available on the product origin."
"This new requirement does not imply any substantial additional responsibility in the case of these kinds of shops."
"Charity shops normally receive, as a gift, single used products which they in turn sell to consumers."
"The nature of their trade is such that they could not be required to play a proactive part in product tracing."
"In addition, the interest in terms of market surveillance of tracing the origin of single second-hand defective products is simply non-existent."
"In conclusion, there is already a lot of flexibility in the requirements of the directive on distributors."
"These requirements can be applied to these kinds of shops in a way compatible with the nature of their activities."
"However, to meet the concerns raised and in order to further clarify the situation we could consider including in the recital dealing with this article a statement that it may prove impossible to provide the competent authorities with information and documentation on the possible risks and origin of the product in the case of isolated used objects donated by private individuals."
"Secondly, Amendment No 3 proposes a deletion of part of the motivation for having clear conditions in the annex of the directive for the duty of business to inform the authorities about dangers."
"This motivation is needed in order to prevent excessive bureaucracy."
"Thirdly, Amendment No 4 proposes adding, in a preamble, a requirement that Member States draw up factual reports with the cooperation of competent and independent public or private institutions."
"To require Member States to engage external institutions for this runs counter to subsidiarity."
"Amendments Nos 6 and 29 require the Commission to consider approaches or submit a proposal relating to the safety of services in Amendment No 29 before a specified date."
"The Commission is in fact already analysing and considering this issue, but it would go too far against the Commission's right of initiative to introduce this in the directive in such a prescriptive way."
"Amendment No 7 proposes certain changes in the references to paragraphs."
"The first part is acceptable to the Commission, but it is not common practice in Community legal texts to explain the content of articles referred to, as proposed."
"To replace the word ""producer"" with ""supplier"", as proposed in Amendment No 11, would create more confusion than clarity, as there is no definition of supplier in the directive."
"The definition of producer already covers suppliers whose activities may affect the safety properties of the product."
"Amendment No 13 proposes adding a reference to the precautionary principle in the general obligation for producers to place only safe products on the market."
"The precautionary principle is a general principle of risk management by the competent authorities and cannot be enforced as such as a direct obligation on producers."
"The Commission does, however, share the view that the principle is important as a background for the revision of the directive, and a reference to this principle could therefore be made in the first recital of the directive."
"Although the idea of publishing a full text of the European standards in the Official Journal, as proposed in Amendments Nos 14 and 16, is understandable, it would require fundamental changes in the relationship between the Community and the European standardisation organisations, probably implying higher levels of subsidies from the Community budget."
"The reason for this is that the standardisation organisations own the standards and that most of them finance part of their activities through the sale of the standards."
"This issue, with implications for most product-related Community legislation, cannot, therefore, be dealt with in the context of the current revision of this directive."
"Amendment No 19 proposes harmonisation of Member States' monitoring approaches on the basis of guidelines prepared by the Commission and the consultative committee."
"Although the Commission is in favour of cooperation and common principles, the proposed wording runs counter to subsidiarity."
"To require Member States to take measures also in cases when business has already taken satisfactory measures to prevent a risk, which would be the consequence of the second part of Amendment No 21, is not acceptable."
"This would also run counter to the objective of encouraging business to take proactive measures on its own initiative."
"Amendment No 23 proposes the introduction in the directive of provisions on compensation in respect of damage."
"These are civil law aspects, regulated by the directive on product liability, and should not, therefore, be dealt with here."
"A requirement that the product safety network should be established within a specified time-frame is proposed in Amendment No 24."
"Although the Commission is in favour of quickly establishing a network, this has to be agreed between the Member States."
"It is therefore not realistic to set a time-frame."
"The first part of Amendment No 27 proposes that only information related to the risks that have been established should be made available to the public."
"This is not acceptable, as consumers should also have a right to obtain information on on-going investigations - provided that this information is not covered by professional secrecy in the manner that I described earlier and drawn narrowly."
"Finally, Amendment No 28 proposes that the Commission should submit a report on the implementation of the directive every second year instead of every three years."
"Although the Commission has sympathy for this idea, this cannot be done within the current limitations of the resources of the Commission."
"The Commission cannot agree with most of the additional amendments proposed for the plenary session."
"Allow me to explain first the Commission's position on the amendments to which we cannot agree."
"Amendments Nos 30, 32, 42 and the main part of Amendment No 33 propose rewordings of the existing text of the directive which is not subject to revision."
"No problems have been reported to the Commission with the existing wordings and the changes would weaken the provisions."
"Amendment No 36 proposes that services directly associated with the product should be excluded except when provided by the original producer."
"The discussions in Council go in the direction of dealing with the services within the definition of product which is, in fact, acceptable to us."
"Amendment No 43 would totally exclude the application of this directive to products regulated by specific legislation."
"This is not acceptable, as these directives often lack provisions on market surveillance, notification systems and so on."
"A possibility of proving that a product conforms to the requirements through external certification is proposed in Amendment No 37."
"Such certification can always be used for providing evidence but cannot, in itself, be regarded as foolproof."
"Amendment No 38 proposes limiting the time period for emergency decisions to six months which is, in most cases, not sufficient for adopting permanent measures."
"It also proposes an exemption from the export ban when the producer can show that the safety requirements of the receiving State are complied with."
"This is not acceptable as products judged at Community level as posing serious risks and requiring rapid intervention should not be exported."
"The amendment also proposes that the possibilities for parties to submit their views on a Community measure taken should be without prejudice to domestic remedies."
"As this is not any type of appeal procedure, this seems unnecessary."
"In addition, Amendment No 41 proposes that the export ban should not apply when a product has been banned while carrying out further checks."
"This is a period during which there are real dangers of exports taking place."
"If the checks confirm that the product is safe, the ban will automatically be lifted."
"Amendments Nos 39 and 44 propose that information on dangerous products should only be available to the public once a banning or withdrawal decision has been issued and that exchange of information protected by professional secrecy should not be possible between market surveillance authorities."
"As the consumer should also have the right to information about risks not yet firmly established, including in cases when the measure taken is not a ban or withdrawal, this is not acceptable either."
"In addition, effective market surveillance cannot be carried out under the proposed limitations regarding confidential information."
"Amendment No 40 proposes a deletion of the duty for business to notify the authorities about dangerous products they place on the market."
"That is not acceptable as this is a key improvement in comparison to the existing directive."
"Still on the notification obligation, we believe that to use the term ""ascertain"" instead of ""conclude"" for triggering the moment when information is to be notified, as proposed in the first part of Amendment No 34, will create more uncertainty than clarity."
"Having extensively explained why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 to 30, 32, 33, 36 to 43 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, I can inform you that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31 and 35 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21 and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, as these amendments constitute an improvement and clarification of the Commission's proposal."
"In the case of some of these amendments, however, in particular Amendments Nos 2, 15, 22, 25, 31 and the second part of Amendment No 27, further editorial changes might improve the text."
"To conclude, I wish to thank again Mrs González Álvarez for the excellent report which can be supported by the Commission to a large extent."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"Membership of political groups"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a lot of votes to take, so can I please ask for a little discipline and cooperation?"
"Before we proceed to the vote, I wish to inform you that Mr Claudio Martelli of the Technical Group of Independent Members has now joined the Mixed Group, that is he has switched from the Technical Group to the Mixed Group."
"Mr Martelli, normally you can only speak at the end of voting time, but I shall, exceptionally, give you the floor for a few moments."
"There will not, however, be any discussion of this, but you can make a short personal statement."
"Mr President, I have been a socialist in Italy and in international organisations for 30 years."
"When I was re-elected to this Parliament in June 1999, I naturally joined the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"On 30 June 2000, at the end of a meeting of the Bureau, of which I was a member but where a few close colleagues discussed my case, in my absence and without my knowledge, Mr Barón Crespo informed me that I had excluded myself from his group."
"I did not even receive a courtesy reply to my protest."
"Clearly, Mr Barón Crespo feels that Italian Socialists may not be part of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"One must either be a former Communist, such as Veltroni, or the satellite of a former Communist, such as Boselli."
"This is the story of the Italian left, the story of the cuckoo: the ex-Communist cuckoo which, when its world crumbles, lays its eggs in the nests of other birds and, thanks to the mother's failure to care for her eggs, is able to eat the eggs which were originally in the nest."
"Mr Martelli, you have had your minute."
"Only one minute is allowed for a personal statement."
"You can submit the rest in writing, to Mr Barón Crespo as well."
"Mr President, I wish to categorically reject Mr Martelli's remarks."
"Mr Barón Crespo spoke on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists in accordance with our statutes, and it is a matter for regret that Mr Martelli has now joined the European Right."
"VOTE"
"Mr President, I would like to have an explanation of what you meant when you said ""wir checken"", as that word is not part of my German vocabulary."
"Yesterday, Mrs Roth-Behrendt spoke about people who were ""eingesqueezed"" in a lift, that is ""squeezed in""."
"As we are talking about our citizens' rights, I would like to know if we have ever adopted any amendments on the German language."
"(Laughter, applause)"
"A typical example of English humour."
"(Laughter, applause) Incidentally, you used the word ""eingesqueezed"" in German, and that is not correct German either!"
"But nearly everyone understood what you meant, Mr Watson."

"After the vote on Amendment No 32:"
"Mr President, a misunderstanding seems to have arisen in connection with Amendments Nos 12 and 37, which we are about to vote on."
"I do not think they are incompatible."
"I would therefore urge you to vote in favour of Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 37 because taken together, they provide a sensible solution."
"So it is not a case of either/or, but both."
"Mr Lagendijk, we have every confidence in you as rapporteur."
"Contrary to the suggestion that these amendments are, so to speak, mutually exclusive, you believe that we can vote on both of them, and that is what we shall do."

"Ladies and gentlemen, in connection with the vote on the Garot report, while looking through the documents I have discovered a mistake in the voting list for one group - I do not think the other groups are affected - namely the PPE."
"Please have another look through the voting list, because I think that Part I and Part II have been mixed up."
"So please have another very close look at this."
"I think that the PPE list should be exactly the opposite way around, so that were it says ""shall establish"" it should read ""second"" and where it says ""second"" it should read ""first""."
"Please have a close look at that when we get to that point."
"(Heckling)If the mistake had affected the Group of the Party of European Socialists I would have pointed it out just the same, and the same even applies to other groups!"

"Mr President, before we start, may I point out that there is a mistake in the Greek translation. It says, at the end of point 16, that negotiations are to take place under the aegis of ÍÁÔÏ."
"It should say that negotiations are to take place under the aegis of the United Nations. I should like to ask the services to correct this."
"We can put a very quick question to the rapporteur about that."
"But first we have another objection, from Mr Wurtz."
"Mr President, my question relates to the order of the votes on the amendments concerning Paragraph 10, in other words, the genocide in Armenia."
"As the vote was to have taken place yesterday, the voting sheet you prepared listed the votes in a different order, which was logical."
"Today' s order is not logical."
"So I suggest we draw up yesterday' s voting list again, in other words, to vote on Amendment No 13 first."
"We have highly qualified people assisting us with our work."
"There was a mistake in the original analysis, and that has been corrected now, but I would be grateful if the rapporteur, Mr Morillon, could briefly comment on these two points."
"The first one was from Mr Katiforis about the word NATO, and the second question was about whether the present order is correct as shown."
"Mr President, regarding the first question, it is quite clearly an error not of translation but of transcription."
"As far as the order is concerned, I leave it to the discretion of the President to decide, and I repeat that I am against all three amendments."
"That gives us an answer to both questions."
"When we get to Amendment No 16 we should make sure that it is changed."
"After the vote on Amendment No 7:"
"Mr President, in agreement with Mr Katiforis I would like to present the following text - I only have it here in English - which differs slightly from the actual text."
"If I may just read it out:"
"""Welcomes the start of negotiations on confidence-building measures agreed on 31 October 2000, by the Foreign Ministers of both Turkey and Greece""."
"It is the start of the negotiations that we are welcoming here, not the outcome."
"Unfortunately we are not in a position to welcome that yet."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0275/2000) by Mr Jové Peres, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on Community participation in Regional Fisheries Organisations (RFOs) COM(1999) 613 - C5-0108/2000 - 2000/2068(COS))"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)Explanations of vote"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0845/2000)"
"Mr President, I gave my explanation of vote in writing but, in addition, I would like to say that I find it truly hard to believe that, precisely in the context of this report, Parliament voted against a series of amendments this morning which called, for example, for respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"I find it hard to believe because we voted on the Charter of Fundamental Rights only yesterday."
"I therefore feel that the prejudice shown by Parliament against amendments tabled by certain political parties is evidence of an alarming lack of democracy in this House."
"- (EL) The Mediterranean has always been, and still is, a particularly sensitive region with serious political, economic and social problems."
"Peaceful coexistence, mutually beneficial and balanced cooperation between countries and peoples, with no interference in their internal affairs, and smooth transnational relations have always been the mainstay of any cooperation between its countries."
"The Mediterranean countries which do not belong to the ÅU have to cope with particularly acute problems of economic development and regional inequalities are becoming more and more marked."
"The ÅU and its Member States bear a great deal of the responsibility for this state of affairs."
"What we are witnessing is over-exploitation of natural and human resources by the developed countries, mainly the EU, and the companies established in them, in order to maintain and increase their foreign debt."
"The attempt to export the EU economic and social model to the countries of the Mediterranean which do not belong to the EU and to integrate them into the new world order and so-called globalisation is the expression of colonial mentality."
"It cannot provide a stable basis for cooperation because it seeks to impose the ways of the strong on the weak and to serve the interests of huge monopolies rather than the interests of the people and workers of the countries in the region."
"The attitude of the Member States of the EU towards immigrants from these and other countries, making many of them feel insecure and at risk of deportation, failing to grant them equal rights with other workers, and maintaining ghettos of second-class citizens and victims of a modern slave trade is a typical example of this conduct."
"The various embargos against, and even military intervention in, countries which refuse to toe the EU line and bow to the new world order are another typical example of Community policy. As is the fact that some countries are excluded from Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, others receive privileged treatment and money is distributed not on the basis of real need but of the interests of multinational capitalists."
"Finally, we should not forget that we are talking about a region in which the EU and ÍÁÔÏ bombarded Yugoslavia and in which the ÅU, with ÍÁÔÏ's blessing, has conferred candidate status on Turkey, which is currently occupying 40% of Cyprus and contesting Greece's sovereign rights."
"Nor should we forget our responsibilities towards the Palestinian people living in wretched conditions under a regime of Israeli state terrorism who continue to fight heroically for a homeland."
"Unfortunately, the proposal for a resolution has failed to address these issues and has abided by the philosophy applied by the EU hitherto."
"Its aim is to help European monopolies penetrate the area, obviously so that they can continue to plunder the wealth of the Mediterranean countries outside the ÅU."
"That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have voted against it."
"The conditions for reinvigorating the Barcelona Process have not been fully achieved."
"The delays in implementing the agreements can only be partly justified."
"The responsibility is dual, lying with both the governments of the countries of the Union and the governments of the Mediterranean partners as well."
"The Process is suffering from a lack of political will, which raises occasional doubts as to whether this major Mediterranean undertaking will be successful."
"It is in consideration of this dual responsibility that I tabled amendments referring to the governments of the Euromed States."
"If they do not assume their responsibility and make good their undertaking, there can be no project creating a multilateral sub-regional free trade area in the Mediterranean countries, as proposed at the Malta Conference in the context of south-south relations."
"The question of financing also requires a will to succeed which has thus far not been displayed."
"The proportion of the funds dedicated to all the different geographical areas, in respect for democracy, transparency and efficiency, needs to be re-established, and there needs to be lasting revitalisation of decentralised cooperation once a critical, in-depth analysis of the weaknesses and shortcomings noted in the implementation of the old programmes has been carried out."
"With regard to respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, in the spirit of a harmonised European migration policy, in addition to legal instruments guaranteeing the fair treatment of immigrants, financial aid instruments need to be established for all those young people who wish to return to their native countries to start work when they have finished secondary education or a university course in a European country."
"Coordination of Member States' initiatives in this matter is becoming essential and could be carried out by the European Commission."
"Moreover, the Commission needs to present similar proposals regarding financial aid for young immigrants within the framework of the policy for cooperation with the ACP countries."
"Another type of coordination concerns potential contributors - States and financial institutions - of international and regional aid, particularly in the Gulf countries."
"A concerted programme of investment in the Mediterranean is becoming necessary."
"Without joint action there can be no dynamism, and without dynamism there will not be sufficient drive for development."
"I would like to end by stressing that by far the most effective means of achieving coordination would be a global Union strategy for the Mediterranean region."
"Such a strategy will be able to establish the goals of an excellent partnership; such a strategy will provide the necessary justification for every initiative and each and every intervention; such a strategy will allow the partnership to become a vital means not only of ensuring the economic and social development of the Mediterranean region but also of enabling Europe to assume a stabilising role throughout the area."
"This is why we will vote for the motion for a resolution."
"Averoff Report (A5-0322/2000)"
"- I welcome this report by Mr Averoff on a proposal to grant funds to Greece in order to relieve the interest burden on EIB loans for the reconstruction of the Attica region which was devastated by the earthquake of September 1999."
"This aid is more than justified in the light of that tragedy."
"Eriksson Report (A5-0294/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for this report, which lays down the action to be taken by the European Community in order to bring about genuine gender equality."
"Before leaving to come to Strasbourg last Sunday, I met Mrs Rossi."
"Mrs Rossi - who is a pensioner, a widow - asked me: ""Why is it that, as a widow, the pension I receive is only half the amount that it used to be when my dear husband was alive?""."
"Now then, I would like to make it clear that, when we discuss gender equality, we should also concern ourselves with the pension laws which are discriminatory towards women."
"The Member States must also respect women in their laws on widows' and married women's pensions."
"Mr President, despite the progress made in recent years within the European Union, within this Europe that champions human rights, structural discrimination on the grounds of sex still exists."
"Women do not enjoy the same rights as men, there are still fewer women representatives in public institutions and also at decision-making levels in private enterprise, and they are still the main victims of domestic cruelty and sexual violence."
"I should like to highlight one point which frankly I see as a determining factor in this question: the lack of equality in the employment sphere."
"There will never be equality if women do not have personal financial autonomy, if they have to depend on men for their support and to ensure their future."
"What can most make women truly free and equal is to have the same opportunities of finding a job as men and not at a lower rate of pay."
"I am convinced that the day when women achieve real financial independence through their work, then they will be truly free and all other inequalities will have disappeared."
"- (EL) The proposed new five-year programme on gender equality is the most reactionary programme which has been dreamed up in recent years. Its objective is to integrate women into the anti-labour policies of the ÅU."
"The so-called equal opportunities policy has not reversed women's disproportionate share of unemployment, part-time employment and poverty, nor has it broken the glass ceilings of the centres of power."
"Equal opportunities in the workplace, in society and elsewhere cannot be understood within the context of a set of reactionary policies which offend human dignity, a society in which there is unemployment, underemployment and no state welfare or a society which puts a price on and commercialises human values."
"We are radically opposed to the way in which the terms ""equal opportunities"" and ""equality"" are used, because these two terms can only mean one thing in the context of capitalism: equal social misery for the majority of workers, which gets worse day by day, an equal share of poverty, the general rise in unemployment and part-time employment, cutbacks in public and free social services provided by the state and a heavier overall burden on the family."
"Given the anti-labour policies of the ÅU, the specific objective and any positive measures promoted to achieve it will have just one purpose: to integrate women fully into EU policies, which have become even more reactionary to grass-roots interests."
"The purpose of the text is to implement the more general policies of the ÅU and it clearly states that the policy of equality must promote the full integration of women into the ""new economy""."
"In other words, their full integration on equal terms into part-time employment, into the reversal of full, stable employment and into the reduction of the non-wage costs of labour."
"A genuine equal opportunities policy presupposes a different economic and social policy focusing on equal opportunities for men and women to share in prosperity, not an impoverished life, such as a reduction in the retirement age for both sexes to 60 for men and 55 for women, strengthening and upgrading the public and welfare sectors, abolishing the private health sector and abolishing part-time employment."
"- (FR) We voted for this report because it recognises a certain number of principles on gender equality with which, I am sure, we all agree."
"But all the declarations concerning 'equal opportunities for men and women' are cast in a rather garish light by the European directive authorising night work for women."
"The ban on night work for women was one of those rare areas in which, by protecting women, the social legislation of certain countries was further advanced for female than for male workers."
"On account of the fact that European institutions are incapable of combating the social segregation suffered by women in the areas of employment, salary and professional promotion and are therefore incapable of 'equalising opportunities' upwards, they 'equalise' downwards."
"We are against the social regression represented by the authorisation of night work for women."
"Night work in industry and, more generally, in the retail sector, which is just as detrimental to women' s as it is to men' s health, has no social or human justification."
"The only reason why it is becoming widespread is the desire of companies to make ever greater profits."
"In order to abolish social segregation, night work should be banned for men and women alike, with the sole exception of public services, notably hospitals and transport, where such work is socially useful. In this case, the inconveniences of working at night should be compensated for by a massive reduction in working hours, with protection for pregnant women."
". (PT) Although somewhat belatedly, the Commission has presented its programme for the Community framework strategy on gender equality (2001­2005), which differs strikingly from previous programmes and, specifically, from the fourth action programme, which finishes at the end of this year."
"In line with the proposal that has been presented, the aim of the change in methodology is to increase access and opportunities for non-governmental organisations to actively participate and contribute to the project."
"If this is going to be possible, we must encourage this effective participation not just at Community level, but also in the Member States."
"As the rapporteur states, it is important that the Commission considers the fact that a prerequisite of any genuine democracy is that all its citizens - men and women alike - should participate and be represented in equal measure in economic life, in decision-making forums, in social and cultural life and in civil society."
"The Commission must nevertheless bear in mind that no work on gender equality will have a lasting effect unless women' s rights are improved, specifically in everyday practices in all spheres of activity."
". (DE) In order to ensure equality of opportunities between women and men in cultural, social and economic life, and to minimise and prevent discrimination on grounds of gender, the Commission has adopted a twin-track approach of which the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities approves."
"Special measures to help women should not be secondary; they should be integrated into policy."
"In practice, initiatives are to be taken in five areas, including equality in economic life, equal participation and representation, and equal access to social rights."
"EUR 53.5 million is provided for under budget item B3-4012. This is a considerable but also necessary sum, which the Committee on Budgets has agreed to as a matter of political priority."
"We would have liked to have scrutinised the fourth action programme just as we are now considering the fifth programme."
"I very much hope that in future, by producing an annual review in good time, the Commission will enable this House to carry out a more in-depth analysis and hold a more thorough debate."
"One more point about timing: this report contains many examples of ambiguous and infelicitous wording, because we have had to hold our debates and votes under extreme time pressure and the amendments were not available in all languages."
"I have some reservations as far as the content is concerned."
"For example, as so often happens in this House, studies are called for on the significance of a general reduction in working hours.We have adopted opinions by clear majorities recognising that the Member States can cope far better with flexible working hours than with unrealistic collectively bargained solutions."
"Furthermore, I think that a ""media code of conduct"" is impractical."
"Whenever woman are presented in a discriminatory way, the only thing that helps is forceful protests against each specific incident - protests by active readers of both sexes and by alert national and European Members of Parliament."
"Nevertheless, I voted for the report because, on the one hand, various proposed improvements submitted by my group were taken on board, and also because the report calls for studies into the position of women in national labour markets and the inadequate access they have to social security systems, an area in which we need statistically relevant gender-specific data."
"And it is quite right to call for consistency of the fifth framework programme with the Structural Funds, which are probably the most sustainable instruments the Community has, with the Community's EQUAL initiative and with the DAPHNE, STOP, PHARE and MEDA programmes."
"I have voted in favour of compromise Amendments Nos 61-74, which were adopted together."
"At the same time, I want to express my very great surprise at the view of children and elderly people, parents, family life and family unity, as well as of simple, decent love of thy neighbour, which comes to light in the following words to be found in the justification of compromise Amendment 72 on the subject of finding necessary resources for making it easier to reconcile working and family life, mainly by setting benchmarks for improved childcare and care of the elderly (which I interpret as also applying to care of children by their own parents in their own homes): 'The need for childcare and care of elderly family members form obstacles to women' s activity in professional, political or social spheres at various periods in their lives' ."
"It is mainly the words 'form obstacles to' and 'the need for childcare and care of elderly family members' which cause me deep concern."
"Moreover, is 'activity in professional, political or social spheres' , to quote the justification, the highest good and only thing of value for individual human beings?"
"Is it this to which the political authorities attach the highest importance, while family life - the basic unit of society - and the intimate and human values associated with it are now also to be disregarded and devalued in this way?"
"- Regarding the Eriksson report (A5-0294/2000) on the proposal for a Council Decision on the Programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality (2001-2005), I totally support gender equality but on examination of the related commission document, COM(2000) 335, it would appear that the financial statement includes ""core funding of running costs of the European Women's Lobby (EWL) currently financed under budget line A-3037""."
"As you are aware, the Committee on Budgets has identified this NGO as a monopoly."
"It would appear, according to correspondence from various European women's groups, that this monopoly does not ideologically represent a very substantial number of European women's organisations."
"As this NGO plays an integral role in the formation and implementation of this programme, I believe the integrity of this Community framework strategy on gender equality is in question, and therefore unsupportable."
"Furthermore, is it appropriate to fund a monopoly from a budget line intended to promote equality?"
"Indeed, are we justified in funding a monopoly from any EU budget line?"
"Regretfully therefore, I have voted against."
"González Álvarez Report (A5-0309/2000)"
"Mr President, there are several reasons why I voted against the González Álvarez report but, in order to keep within the minute allowed for this explanation of vote, I will mention only one."
"A lot of people came to the airport to see me off when I left to come to Strasbourg this time, including an elderly pensioner who, sadly, was suffering from a serious physical injury caused by a highly unsafe product on sale in the European Union."
"As I left, I said to her, ""Don't worry: we are going to debate the González Álvarez report which deals precisely with product safety""."
"However, I have realised that there is absolutely no provision in this report for a clear obligation for the rapid compensation of victims of dangerous products for their injuries."
"- My party has serious reservations about Community law applying to the sale of consumer products, as against applying the concept of mutual recognition of standards."
"Thus, we are opposed in principle to the original directive and must therefore oppose any extension of it."
"Even if this was not so, we would still have serious reservations."
"While this Commission proposal on general product safety is styled as a revision of the 92/59/EEC Directive, with claims that the approach followed in the original directive has not been altered, this does not seem to be entirely the case."
"What particularly disturbs us are the plans revealed by Commissioner Byrne to develop a network of enforcement authorities to help implement this law."
"Having seen proposals for ""networks"" elsewhere in Community initiatives, we see in this the beginnings of something which is altogether unhealthy - a unified enforcement system amounting to a European Union consumer law enforcement service."
"This to us seems of a general trend where the Commission, having saturated Member States with its laws, is now taking altogether too keen an interest in enforcement systems, with an eye to direct control of them."
"On this basis alone, my party opposes this measure."
"- Whilst I support this report on general product safety, it is important that we do not go too far."
"It is important that our products are safe, but we should not go over the top with extreme actions."
"People across Europe are extremely concerned about the safety of consumer products, and rightly so."
"This report welcomes an improvement in current European law on product safety, but in my view the directive should not be applied to charity shops, a key feature in the British high street."
"It is absurd to think that the average charity shop can provide the authorities with information about product risks and product origin for second-hand goods acquired from the general public."
"Let us not forget that it was my Labour colleague, Mr Whitehead, who introduced the amendments exempting charity shops, and we should congratulate him on his achievements."
"The threat to charity shops occurred because it simply was not understood on mainland Europe."
"It is now, and the Labour amendments offer a guarantee that charity shops will be left untouched and will be exempt from the directive."
"The overall aim of the directive is extremely important in ensuring that there is a consistent and high level of consumer protection, as well as the efficient functioning of the single market."
"I wholeheartedly support the drive for clearly-worded, understandable warnings about possible risks to be put on products where they are on sale."
"Clear labelling is the best way of reassuring worried consumers that the goods they buy are safe."
"Public confidence in the safety of products we all buy has taken a real knock in recent years following a number of scares, especially in children's toys."
"Only by taking a safety first attitude - and being seen to take a safety first attitude - can public confidence and the safety of our children be restored."
"Lagendijk Report (A5-0324/2000)"
"Mr President, the Council quite rightly hoped to rationalise EU aid to the Balkan states and to reform the European Agency for the Reconstruction of Kosovo, whose competence could gradually be extended to cover the entire region."
"We fully support this approach and the two proposals for Council regulations which would implement it. But we cannot support the amendments tabled by the European Parliament which aim to profoundly upset the balance of the system in favour of the Commission."
"Today, the European Agency for Reconstruction is administered by a Governing Board on which the representatives of the Member States and the Commission each have one vote and on which decisions are adopted by a two-thirds majority."
"The Commission is not at all happy about a situation in which it is under constant supervision and complains that the weight of the Member States hinders its freedom of action and therefore, in its view, impedes the effectiveness of its assistance."
"The European Parliament has rallied to the call of its old friend and has just voted for amendments in its favour."
"Amendment No 5 proposes returning the running of the Agency to the Commission, which would be responsible to the European Parliament."
"Amendment No 14 weakens the Governing Board vis-à-vis the Commission, by stipulating that its decisions are adopted by simple majority."
"Amendment No 10 extends the tasks of the Agency, which is now effectively controlled by the Commission."
"Finally, Amendment No 15 gives the Commission free rein in determining the rules governing the languages used by the Agency, about which we are very concerned."
"We are witnessing the repetition of a classic scenario in which the Commission believes it will manage external aid better if it has more powers and more autonomy, and if it is less supervised by the Member States."
"That is a mistake which, as we well know, could unfortunately take us down a very dangerous path."
"We are therefore asking that the Member States retain the upper hand regarding the management of aid and the Agency."
"In this way, they will exercise better control and they will maintain a vital link between European aid and national policies in this sensitive region."
"Mr President, both as a member of the European People's Party and as a member of the Pensioners' Party in Italy, I was very happy to vote for this major report on European Union aid - and the management thereof - to Albania, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo."
"This aid will serve, above all, to help these countries feel that Europe exists and is particularly close to peoples who are the victims of war, war which has brought inconvenience and poverty, especially to the elderly and the infirm, who should be among the first to receive assistance."
"I naturally support this report wholeheartedly."
"Mr President, I voted for the report although it does not distinguish clearly enough between Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro."
"President Kostunica was happy to have himself compared with General de Gaulle in a recent interview."
"But General de Gaulle was only able to play a major role once he had settled the Algerian problem."
"I believe that Serbia's ""Algerian problem"" is Kosovo."
"Kosovo has the right to decide about its future independently and in partnership with its neighbours."
"So we must give President Rugova and President Kostunica a chance to negotiate democratically with each other."
"That is why we need early elections in Kosovo, cooperation in a spirit of partnership and an agreed solution for this region achieved in the same spirit."
"- (EL) The remit of the European Agency for Reconstruction should have been extended to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia a long time ago and should not be linked to the internal changes in Yugoslavia."
"It was not Milosevic and his cohorts who paid the price of exclusion, the lack of international aid and the harsh post-war conditions; it was the civilians - or rather the most disadvantaged civilians."
"Simplifying the decision-making process, creating decentralised operational centres (and not just in Pristina, which has gained in importance now that it has broken away from Yugoslavia) and dealing with the twin structure between the Governing Board and the Commission may prove to be the right moves in a bid to deal with the huge bureaucratic shortcomings at the European Agency for Reconstruction."
"At the same time, we should:"
"1."
"Increase funding to this region, given that the European Union perpetrated and aided and abetted its destruction."
"2."
"Ensure that local agents, seconded by bureaucracy and various European consultancy firms, have a say at central level."
"3."
"Strengthen cooperation programmes between the former parties to the conflict and the countries in the region."
"- I welcome this report which seeks to improve the delivery of EU assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by simplifying the decision-making procedures and making them more transparent."
"Garot Report (A5-0305/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Garot report, although there are many gaps and inaccuracies which the Pensioners' Party does not support."
"In particular, I would call upon the Commission to decide to put forward new, different types of proposals in order to resolve the problems suffered by agriculture and livestock farmers."
"In fact, we cannot continue to assist those farmers who are in need of European Union subsidies - and long may they receive them - in the way we have done thus far, for it has achieved nothing but damage."
"The quota system must be entirely abolished; we must find a different way of assisting agriculture, fisheries and livestock farmers in the European Union."
"- (SV) We are not in favour of new subsidies for pig feed and are therefore voting against the report."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have voted against a report designed to introduce aid for pigmeat producers in the EU."
"The Commission has proposed introducing an aid scheme for pigmeat producers by establishing equalisation funds in the Member States."
"The proposal is unnecessary and harmful because it introduces a new form of aid for a sector which has so far acquitted itself well without aid."
"The crisis in the pig sector has resolved itself through the market economy, and precisely because unnecessary and expensive aid schemes have not been introduced."
"Parliament' s report will introduce still more aid schemes."
"Producers are to receive 100% aid from the fund to reduce their production, and the EU is to co-finance the scheme."
"We are therefore voting against both the Commission' s proposal and Parliament' s report."
"Once the vote has been taken, this report on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat will simply add to the tonnes of paper of common agricultural market legislation."
"It is curious to observe how the rapporteur, albeit a supporter of the market economy, by talking of 'cyclical movements' in the market in pigmeat, attacks its 'harmful effects' in order to be moved by the 'havoc' it wreaks."
"We are opposed to the market economy, which is just as stupid and disastrous in regulating the economy as a whole as it is in regulating the production of pigmeat."
"However, we will not share the rapporteur' s cynicism, as he mourns the passing of the good old times when 'the cessation of activity by small production units was enough to restore prices' ."
"Even less do we share his view when he talks of the elimination of small producers which he, above all, uses to ask the European institutions for supplementary financing for large livestock producers."
"We need to prevent producers falling victim to the cyclical variation of the market."
"But the only true producers are those who work and run the pig farms, small farmers and agricultural workers, which definitely does not include those who are the primary focus of this report and who confine themselves to investing in this industry in order to make a profit with the aid of European Union grants."
". (PT) A genuine reform of the COM for pigmeat is urgently needed in order to address the extended crisis that has hit producers in the European Union."
"However, the Commission's proposal to create a voluntary regulatory fund financed solely by producers not only runs counter to the CAP principle of financial solidarity, it will also not solve any of the industry' s fundamental problems."
"The Garot report is an attempt to improve on some aspects of the Commission' s proposal, by seeking to reach a compromise with the Council, specifically with regard to a financial contribution to the fund."
"The problem is that, even if the French Presidency has shown a degree of openness, we know that the Commission has rejected these proposals and there does not appear to be a majority within the Council in favour of approving them."
"It is therefore still crucial that we continue to fight for the mandatory establishment of the fund, financed completely by the CAP, and that payments from the fund should be adjusted to cover more producers, paying particular attention to small- and medium-sized farmers."
"With regard to the overriding issue of the Community' s contribution to the fund, I also wish to point out that the proposals in the Garot report are an improvement as compared with the Commission' s position, but we still disagree with the idea of linking this contribution to the principle of CAP cofinancing which was, in fact, rejected in Agenda 2000."
". (DE) I doubt if anyone here will deny that pigmeat producers throughout the EU Member States have, over the last two years, been faced with a crisis which has had devastating consequences for many of them."
"We do not have a market organisation for pigmeat comparable with those for other agricultural products."
"And we do not fundamentally want to change that situation."
"However, when there have been such major structural changes in a sector as there have been in the pigmeat sector, and when there has been a more sustained fall in prices, of up to 30%, than has been the case up to now, in that case some action is needed."
"It cannot be in anyone's interest for smaller pig farming units in particular to have to give up because they cannot cope with this kind of on-going disaster scenario."
"I therefore believe that there is a justification for modifying the present Community schemes in this area."
"If it has already been accepted that regulatory funds should be created, then Community cofinancing should also be a possibility, as this would not stretch the Community budget as much as some people make out."
"I therefore voted for the report."
", in writing. (FR) The Commission proposal, in itself, is a recognition of the inadequacy of the current tools used to regulate the markets."
"The last crisis was exceptionally long and severe."
"It caused the disappearance of smaller holdings and difficulties for a large number of young farmers."
"The lack of a regulatory system accentuated this movement in favour of large, often integrated, production units."
"It is not possible to ask producers alone to make an extra effort: many already belong to equalisation funds."
"We believe we should support them by creating efficient tools not only to resolve the crises but also to better control the markets, improve quality and promote their products."
"Pig farming is still essentially a family activity, based on responsibility."
"It supports the economic activity of the rural community, often in regions where there are few alternatives."
"We have chosen to fight in defence of a living and diverse rural world: maintaining small- and medium-sized enterprises, be they agricultural, industrial, or small-scale cottage industries, is the cornerstone of this."
"The creation of a regulatory fund for pigmeat production, as amended, does not place the free market in the balance but will protect small family holdings."
"- (NL) The pigmeat market is cyclical."
"A slight variation in the supply is enough to spark a crisis situation."
"However, the crises have been more drawn out in recent years and have had a terrible impact on young and small-scale pig farmers in particular."
"The Commission is right to try and find ways in which to secure the income of pig farmers."
"Unfortunately, the Commission' s present proposal will not yield structural solutions, and rapporteur Garot feels that the time has now come to dig out the old socialist instrument of robust state intervention again."
"There is no point in setting up funds to ameliorate the effects of recurring crises."
"There is a risk that these funds, by virtue of the cushioning effect they have, only make the crises more protracted."
"In addition, such funds give Member States the opportunity, in the form of co-financing, to grant capped state aid to a greater or lesser extent."
"Member States who have always been generous on the aid front can take advantage of this to distort competition."
"This leads to situations worthy of a quote from George Orwell in the eleven official languages of the Union: ""All pigs are equal but some pigs are more equal than others""."
"But even if the co-financing aspect was to be dropped from the proposal, the proposed fund would still not be in a position to address the frequency and depth of the crises in the sector."
"When prices fall, production must be curtailed."
"That is a natural reaction in the pig farming sector."
"Therefore, a fund does not solve anything unless it is binding, and unless all participants endeavour to limit production."
"These are the reasons we voted against the proposal."
"Reducing production is the key to dealing with crises in the pig farming sector."
"I therefore hope that the Council will study this report with a critical eye and take the view of Dutch pig farmers on board."
"These farmers, who oppose an income fund in the first instance, feel that if the Council endorses a fund of this kind, it should do so with the proviso that each Member State limits its production."
"Morillon Report (A5-0297/2000)"
"Mr President, I am very critical at this time when we have to decide upon relations between the European Union and Turkey."
"Even though I voted for the motion, I would like to emphasise certain points which I feel that we should always bear in mind in this situation."
"Firstly, it is not Europe which has asked to become part of Turkey but Turkey which has asked to join Europe, and Turkey must therefore adapt to and accept the rules which the European Union asks it to respect."
"Secondly, Turkey is no longer alone against Greece but alone against the European Union."
"Greece, which is no longer able to defend its rights and interests within our institutions, must be defended by the entire European Union."
"Mr President, I voted for the motion and I was pleased to see that an amendment was adopted recognising the genocide of the Armenian people."
"However, I regret that the amendments I tabled, which stressed the obligation of respect for the principle of the self-determination of peoples, were rejected."
"This House is always talking about rights - the Charter was adopted yesterday - but when it comes to the application of these rights, not so much in practical terms but at least in terms of upholding them, Parliament takes alarming steps backwards which are certainly no credit to it."
"Mr President, the Armenians' genocide was the first of many genocides in the twentieth century, which might indeed be called the century of genocide."
"Franz Werfel created a literary monument to this genocide in his work ""The Forty Days of Musa Dagh""."
"Franz Werfel had Jewish and German-Bohemian relatives."
"The Jewish relatives were victims of the Holocaust, and the German-Bohemian relatives, some of whom were Jewish themselves, were driven out of Bohemia after the Second World War."
"This goes to show that one disaster can trigger off the next."
"When Hitler was preparing the Holocaust, he asked ""who talks about the Armenians now?"""
"That is why we must tell our Turkish friends that wrongdoing cannot be hushed up today either."
"We do not want to rub salt into historical wounds, we want to work together to right wrongs, no matter whose name they were committed in."
"- (EL) Despite its serious shortcomings, the Morillon report is clearly an improvement on the Commission proposal as far as the partnership between the European Union and Turkey is concerned."
"There is a positive reference to the Loïzidou case and the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."
"Similarly, there is a positive, albeit inadequate reference to the Armenian question, in that Turkey should have been clearly called on to acknowledge the genocide - the amendments have, of course, done much to correct this."
"Similarly, there is a positive reference to the Kurdish question and minorities - which the Commission draft accession partnership passes over in silence."
"However, the main drawback and shortcoming of the Morillon report is on the issue of Greek-Turkish relations."
"The European Parliament should make it clear to the Turkish Government that, if it wants to join the European Union, it must stop contesting the borders of Member States of the European Union and must refer any disputes to the International Court to be resolved."
"This is also in the interests of the Turkish people who would like to live in peace with their neighbours."
"Our vote in favour of the resolution should be interpreted as support for the fact that it represents an improvement on the Commission proposal and not as full agreement with it."
"It is extraordinary that the European Parliament should be expressing an opinion on Turkey' s progress on the road to accession, especially when it comes to respect for human rights."
"Because Sweden is not prepared to participate in a common military defence but only in civil crisis management, we cannot support Paragraph 15 which ""welcomes Turkey' s determination to contribute to improving European capabilities within the framework of the common European security and defence policy"" ."
"- (FR) The Morillon report on Turkey' s accession to the European Union serves, above all, to remind the Turkish Government that it must open up the Turkish market to European capital by carrying out 'structural reforms' ranging from 'dismantling state subsidies to reorganising pensions and accelerating privatisation' : in other words, by reducing social budgets and by making the living conditions of the most destitute sections of the population even worse."
"As far as human rights are concerned, however, the report confines itself to 'encouraging the Turkish Government' , 'calling' on it to do better, without European countries ever threatening it, even if only to stop delivering arms."
"The truth is that neither the rapporteur nor European governments want to offend the military who, in reality, govern Turkey and reduce a section of the country to a state of emergency."
"European governments do not want to offend Turkish reactionaries who refuse to abolish the death penalty and trample women' s rights underfoot. Nor do they want to offend the Turkish authorities who now oppress the Kurdish people after having already massacred the Armenian population."
"Let those who are interested only in the movement of capital and goods and not life and human rights vote for this report."
"We voted against it."
"- (FR) Ladies and gentlemen, today' s debate is not about reopening old, historical wounds, which have not completely healed."
"It is not about rekindling ancestral hatreds or blowing on the embers of intolerance, as I have heard talk of in this Chamber."
"What is at stake is not even the acknowledgement of the reality of Armenian genocide, since this House has already had occasion to express its views on this, most notably in its resolution of June 1987."
"What the Members of the European Parliament asked of Turkey in 1987 was to have the courage to open its eyes to the past so as to be able to look to the future."
"Historical truth is the guarantor of democracy. It must not and cannot suffer specific financial or economic interests, be they of individuals, governments or states."
"Truth and remembrance are not negotiable."
"It is enough to remember what happened in Germany, which recognised the Shoah and which, after the Second World War, became a major democratic country."
"This is what we are hoping for once again today when we call upon the Morillon report to make reference to genocide."
"Acknowledging genocide must be a call for dialogue to be established between the new Armenian and Turkish generations."
"The whole of the Armenian community and the Armenian children who fled into exile at the beginning of the century to the countries of Europe are today waiting for justice to be done."
"They want to offer a memorial to their ancestors, the victims of genocide."
"At a time when the last witnesses of exile, the last survivors of the carnage, are quietly passing away, the work and the duty of remembrance are even more necessary."
"But beyond the duty of remembrance which we must demand from all democracies, and the people of Europe know just how difficult and painful a task this is, so difficult in fact that some European countries have not yet completed it, it is incumbent on us to ensure that such acts of barbarism, which destroyed lives for ethnic, religious and cultural reasons and which offend the conscience of the world, never recur."
"Europe must spread this message."
"- (FR) It was at the European Council meeting in Helsinki in December 1999 that the European Union decided to grant Turkey the status of candidate country for accession to the European Union and to establish an accession partnership and a single financial framework with a view to helping Turkey's application to progress in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria."
"It is a sine qua non that these criteria are met before the accession negotiations can start, and we must never forget this."
"The progress reports established by the European Commission are therefore extremely important."
"Today we are discussing the 1999 progress report."
"Following the example of the rapporteur, we are bound to admit that Turkey has progressed on certain levels and that there are positive signs."
"I am primarily thinking of the resumption of the political dialogue in the Association Council, which met on 11 April 2000 after being suspended for three years, and the establishment of eight subcommittees entrusted with the task of setting priorities for incorporation of the acquis communautaire, the signature by Turkey on 15 August and 8 September 2000 of four important UN conventions, on political, civil, social and cultural rights respectively, which must be ratified as soon as possible so that human rights and democratic pluralism may be guaranteed in that country, the Turkish Council of Ministers' adoption of the report presented by the Turkish Supreme Coordination Council for Human Rights, as a 'reference working document' , even if practical measures to protect the rights of minorities need to be added, and the adoption of the law on adjourning trials and deferring sentences for press and radio broadcasting offences."
"But there are still many areas where progress is unsatisfactory, or indeed non-existent."
"I am thinking in this case of the absence of a law abolishing the death penalty, the Cyprus question and the occupation by the Turkish army of one third of the island of Cyprus, and the problem of the rights of minorities, such as the Kurdish and Armenian minorities."
"In this connection, I supported an amendment aimed at inserting into the body of the report a reference to the genocide in Armenia, because it is important to acknowledge this historical reality."
"I invite the Turkish authorities to do the same: this would mark a great step forward in the country' s progress towards democracy."
"If Turkey wants to enter into accession negotiations, it still needs to make a great deal of effort."
"If it wants to accede to the European Union, it will have to integrate all the values which make Europe what it is."
"This once again raises the question of whether Turkey really wants to be a Member of the European Union, or whether it would prefer to organise an integrated 'whole' with other Middle East countries, which would have very close links with the European Union at the commercial and economic level, at the security and stability level and also at the human rights and democratic rules level."
"This is, of course, a different debate to the one we are having today. But, given the importance I attach to Turkey, I wanted to restate my case today."
"- I and my colleagues have opposed this amendment because Leyla Zhana is insisting that she is not herself asking for special treatment or immediate release from gaol."
"She wants the penal law changed, as do we."
"Moreover, we believe that not only Kurdish, but all political prisoners should be freed."
"I voted for this motion for a resolution."
"I am delighted that the European Parliament has openly committed itself to encouraging the Turkish Government and the Turkish Grand National Assembly to publicly acknowledge the genocide that the Armenian minority was subjected to before the establishment of the modern state in Turkey."
"Parliament had already undertaken the road to recognition as early as 1987, and the adoption of this amendment demonstrates Parliament' s consistency in this area."
"However, this resolution does not answer what is a real question: what borders do we really want for the European Union?"
"- (NL) Perhaps there will come a time when EU enlargement will head further eastwards, through the accession of the Ukraine and Russia."
"Obviously Turkey will then have to be given the same opportunity."
"But that day is in the distant future."
"Present-day Turkey is an authoritarian state with superior military power, political prisoners, censorship, party bans, border conflicts and an electoral system that excludes minorities."
"Lessons still have not been learnt from the mass murder, eighty years ago, of the insurgent Armenians."
"That partly explains why people do not think it untoward that a different national minority is still being deprived of its rights to this day."
"The Kurds are displaced, bombarded and suppressed. Their language is banned from use in administration, education and the media."
"Turkey must first learn from the histories of Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, Albania, Syria, Iraq and Yemen."
"These countries came under Turkey' s dominion in the past, and uprisings that took place there were repeatedly suppressed using violent means."
"Since the people are no longer prevented from exercising their right to self-determination, this has enabled peace to take hold."
"I do not believe that Turkey' s style of government will change by us presenting this country with the prospect of EU membership, subject to flexible conditions."
"The necessary changes cannot be bought outside by the governing powers; they must come from within."
". (IT) Turkey must become an integral part of the European Union as soon as possible, for this will both contribute to the fight against fundamentalism and the peace process and improve development and stability between the countries of northern and southern Europe."
"Sadly, many issues are still unresolved such as those related to the Kurdish and Armenian situations and to full respect for civil rights, although a great deal of progress has been made in these fields."
"The dignity of peoples and respect for traditions are foundation stones of the Union, which cannot be content with mere declarations of principle regarding the Kurdish and Armenian situation."
"The Union must be more proactive and treat enlargement to include Turkey as a vital geopolitical strategy."
"We therefore also renew our invitation to the Turkish Government to make a formal admission of Turkey's responsibility in the extermination of the Armenian people."
"This declaration, which is necessary from the moral and historical perspective, is an obligatory condition for Turkey's accession to the Union."
"For these reasons, Alleanza Nazionale, which has already, in the past, declared itself to be in favour of enlarging the Union to include Turkey, will abstain from today's vote, as a further invitation to the Turkish Government and the Turkish people to take steps to resolve these issues with all haste."
"-(FR) We are facing a terrifying danger, and that is forgetting."
"We need to remember the horrors of history if we do not want to relive them."
"The genocide in Armenia is one such horror and such suffering can only be alleviated if it is recognised."
"Recognition of the genocide in Armenia is a recognition of the dignity of the individual."
"We cannot forget the deportation of the entire Armenian population to the deserts of Mesopotamia, the deportation of the Armenians of eastern Anatolia in 24 hours, the shooting of able-bodied men, the persecution of women, children and old people, who covered hundreds of kilometres on foot, without medical care and without food, divested of their belongings, raped, their throats slit on the open road, the deportation in 1915 of the Armenians of Cilicia and eastern Anatolia, the assassination of 600 Armenian prominent citizens in Constantinople, the extermination of more than a million Armenians in just over a year - in other words, almost half the Ottoman Armenians."
"All the accounts bear witness to the same ordeal of the civil populations of Armenia."
"I remember the 1987 resolution which called on Turkey to acknowledge the Armenian genocide as a precondition to its accession to the European Union."
"I voted today for the amendments calling for this acknowledgement in order to keep this testimony alive and to acknowledge a people' s suffering."
"Turkey will gain in stature among nations when it agrees to face up to its past."
"- (FR) What the Morillon report shows us is quite simply the fact that we are still paying for the absurdity of the decision adopted at the European Summit meeting in Helsinki which regarded Turkey, on an equal footing with Poland, as a fully European country destined to join the European Union with all the practical implications this entails (pre-accession strategy and so on)."
"I remember the exact text of the conclusions of the Presidency in Paragraph 12: ""Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the Union on the basis of the same criteria as applied to candidate countries"" ."
"We all know that, in reality, this decision was tainted with hypocrisy."
"Nonetheless, the system that has been put in place will do its work and will impose its logic on us until the time comes when this awkward position will become so untenable that our relations with Turkey will be in serious and deep crisis."
"But, some might say, we can make the pleasure last, we can multiply the conditions and infinitely draw out the Copenhagen criteria in order to delay the moment when we have to take up the subject of the free movement of workers with Turkey."
"Such ulterior motives are unworthy of Europe and unworthy of Turkey."
"In our relations with the Turkish nation and the great Turkish people, we must use the language of frankness and respect, not a double talk which opens the door to the worst kind of disappointment and unacceptable humiliation."
"It is absolutely not a question of pushing Turkey away from Europe, as Cohn-Bendit claims."
"It is simply a question of recognising that geography and history have made present-day Turkey a country that is not European."
"In the face of stark realities, it is about fully respecting the dignity of the Turkish people by not seeking to impose on it a behaviour which it must adopt of its own accord, and by seeking to jointly develop close cooperation."
"The ambiguity of the pre-accession procedure prevents real cooperation between Turkey and Europe from developing along healthy and clear lines, even if there is a powerful common interest for Turkey - with its influence and weight and the privileged relations it now has with the Turkish-speaking countries of central Asia - to be a powerful stabilising factor in a region which is in great need of stability."
"- On behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party, I welcome Mr Morillon's report."
"We believe that Turkey should be treated the same way as any other applicant country."
"While it is clear that Turkey does not yet meet the Copenhagen criteria, we should be working closely with them to achieve that objective - just as we have done with all the other applicants."
"We cannot consistently seek new obstacles to put in their path."
"We opposed the amendments on the Armenian massacre for exactly this reason."
"That event took place during the time of the Ottoman Empire."
"I do not recall events which took place during the British Empire being used to obstruct the United Kingdom's accession."
"Consistency and honesty should be the hallmarks of our dealings with any applicant country."
"Jové Peres Report (A5-0275/2000)"
"Mr President, as you are aware, the news is spreading throughout the world of fish that I am promoting their cause."
"In fact, the fish are extremely concerned about the mad cow disease crisis and, having heard about Mr Jové Peres' report - which is rightly concerned with the fact that we are not able to monitor how many fishing boats go to fish in one area and how many in another - they have proposed that I put it to the Commission that it would be appropriate to fit these fishing boats with remote tracking devices - which are present on many cars - so that the European Union will be able to discover how many fishing boats fish in one area of the sea and how many in another."
"This would avoid there being too many fishermen in one place, for the fish would also like to be left to live their lives in peace and become pensioners as well."
"in writing.- (FR) We voted against the Jové Peres report on Community participation in the Regional Fisheries Organisations because it calls for the transfer of national sovereignties, which would be completely counterproductive."
"For a number of years, as a member of the delegation for relations with Canada, I have been able to observe the operation of one of the regional organisations, NAFO (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation), whose members are the countries of that region, including Canada, as well as all the countries that use traditional fishing zones in the region, including France, Spain and some other European countries."
"Every member country has a vote in the decision procedure."
"Now, from the moment the European nations concerned decided to communitise this issue and to be represented solely by the Commission they have just had a single vote."
"So the first effect of the uniting of our forces was to reduce the number of our votes from six to one."
"The countries of Europe, as a whole, have the same number of votes as Cuba, for example."
"This situation does not worry the federalists for whom, when the Commission speaks with a single voice, we gain in strength."
"Unfortunately, it is 'with a single voice' in all senses of the phrase."
"What is more, our position is often weakened by our internal mechanisms, notably prior alignment to the lowest common denominator."
"On the whole, our interests are undermined, they are not defended with the necessary force, and the role of the Commission is primarily that of a police officer vis-à-vis Member States to get them to apply the binding decisions that have been adopted, sometimes in spite of themselves, in the regional organisation in question."
"The Jové Peres report would not only like to regularise this situation for existing regional organisations and those that are in the process of being established, it would also like to reinforce it by putting paid to the Commission' s habit of calling on the support of technical experts from different Member States."
"According to the report, the Commission would need to recruit staff as a result and would be given the corresponding funds."
"We cannot accept any of these approaches."
"We believe that the current system of representation by the Commission weakens instead of strengthens us, and we want every European nation to be fully represented within the regional fisheries organisations, even though it is clearly desirable that the Member States coordinate their positions."
"- Although the Jové Peres report is ostensibly about fisheries, I see in it a much more sinister agenda."
"For instance, one sees such statements as: ""... the development of a genuine fisheries policy requires that the powers of monitoring fishing activity must be assigned to the Commission""; ""...the establishment of a proper Community system of monitoring fisheries is bound to entail a degree of sovereignty being transferred to the Union institutions""; and ""... the European Union is not a confederation of states but a 'sui generis' entity in international law, in which ... there is a desire for economic, social and political integration...""."
"Then there is the observation that: ""the lack of adequate human and material resources means that the Community's powers are delegated to Member States..."", with the view that this situation cannot be extended indefinitely."
"The rapporteur's answer is for the Community to be given the resources, effectively, to take direct control over fisheries monitoring."
"This reveals the European Union's true ambition - the continued acquisition of powers until it becomes an all-powerful superstate."
"It will only be content when its own gunboat fleet, flying ""ring of stars"" flags, is enforcing its fisheries policies."
"My party cannot support this report."
". (IT) The European fishing sector is currently suffering a series of challenges due to an increase in competition caused by the globalisation of the fish products market."
"There is also a clear need for greater protection of the marine environment and rational management of exploitable fisheries resources."
"In this context, it appears necessary to increase international cooperation and ensure that the Community consolidates its undertaking to define a law on fish stocks."
"The principle tool for achieving closer cooperation is the Regional Fisheries Organisations (RFOs), which play a key role on the international scene but which lack the human resources for the Community to be adequately represented."
"The RFOs are particularly suitable for achieving the objectives established because of their regional nature, but, above all, they contribute to the rational management of resources by reflecting the specific characteristics of the fishing areas."
"In this context, considering the importance of RFOs for the future of the common fisheries policy and the different levels of organisation, competences and development of each organisation, the Community needs to adapt its participation according to their respective characteristics and to harmonise its role within the 30 existing RFOs, in order to speed up transposal of the recommendations adopted by the RFOs into Community law."
"- (FR) Without going back to the excellent argument put forward by Mr Gallagher regarding the text that has been submitted to the vote, I would like to extend the debate to cover all cases where our countries are represented by the executive Commission in international negotiations."
"My comments naturally apply to the issue before us today, the representation of the European Community within regional fisheries organisations, but they apply equally to talks conducted for example within the World Trade Organisation."
"If the Commission has the power to represent the Community and to negotiate in an international context, it is because it has received a mandate from the Council."
"It is therefore important that this mandate is defined clearly in terms of time and content and that it is strictly monitored by the Council."
"In a good many cases, such as fishing in certain regions of the world, the interests of Member States are not uniform."
"Some Member States are not at all involved in certain fishing regions."
"It is therefore vital that the Member States that are directly involved can defend their own interests by sitting at the negotiating table with the Commission at their side playing a useful technical support role."
"Otherwise, the influence and the weight of Europe in such negotiations would be weakened if the interests of Europe were represented in a manner intended exclusively to benefit the Commission."
"Europe would, in fact, have just one seat and the position that would be defended would be nothing more than the lowest common denominator established on the basis of the positions of a group of Member States who are involved to varying degrees."
"What is important therefore is not to satisfy the Commission' s desire for domination by weakening the position of Europe, which would be in direct conflict with the correct application of the principle of subsidiarity."
"On the contrary, in all international negotiations in which the European Union is involved, it is important to begin by strictly defining the Commission' s role, which should by no means be to replace Member States, but to support and coordinate alongside the Member States concerned."
"I am not a hundred percent certain that this is the path the Nice Summit is preparing to take ... but there is still time for Member States to regroup."
"That brings us to the end of voting time."
"I would like to thank those who have stayed to the end!"
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.27 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Waste incineration"
"The next item is the report (A5-321/2000) tabled by Mr Blokland, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the incineration of waste [C5-0371/2000 - 1998/0089 (COD)]."
"Mr President, when I was appointed rapporteur for the amendment of a directive concerning the incineration of hazardous waste, three years ago, I could not have suspected what it would lead to."
"A small subject grew into an extensive piece of work owing to the fact that proposals on hazardous and non-hazardous waste were combined in a single directive."
"My suggestion that we should include them in one directive was supported by the then President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Trittin, and by the Commission, which meant that Parliament' s motion to amalgamate three directives did not meet with a great deal of opposition."
"The amalgamation had the effect of streamlining Community legislation."
"Things did not go as swimmingly for Parliament' s amendments from first reading, as the Council rejected most of them."
"A chastened Parliament confined itself to adopting sixteen amendments at second reading."
"The need for conciliation soon became apparent because, as it turned out, the Council was not minded to adopt these amendments."
"In order to avoid a costly and exacting official conciliation procedure, informal negotiations were opened in order to see if a compromise could be reached."
"However, Parliament' s willingness to expedite the procedure demanded flexibility on the part of the Council."
"That proved to be a sticking point on account of the divergent positions."
"Ultimately, after some tough negotiating, an outcome was achieved that is worth defending."
"As rapporteur, I do so with utter conviction."
"Throughout the entire period, I was able to work well together with the representatives of the Council and the Commission, and was secure in the knowledge that I had the support of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and its secretariat."
"I would like to sincerely thank all concerned."
"I would like, just one more time, to give three reasons as to why the directive on waste incineration is so important."
"Firstly, the emission of dioxins, as well as the emission of other harmful substances will be drastically reduced."
"Secondly, the public will have far better access to information about incineration plants."
"Thirdly, it will substantially reduce the disparity between the requirements governing incineration plants and those governing plants for the co-incineration of waste, such as cement kilns."
"But although I am upbeat about the outcome of this directive, it cannot conceal the fact that waste incineration is an emergency solution."
"After all, we have not managed to avoid the production of waste, nor have we succeeded in introducing recycling."
"Fortunately, there is talk of progress on the technological front, where the emphasis must be on sustainability."
"I will give you an example: PVC comprises 0.7% of the total amount of incinerated waste."
"According to the Commission' s Green Paper, incinerating PVC waste gives rise to a number of problems."
"We must get straight down to tackling these problems, leaving no stone unturned."
"Sustainable technology could prove helpful to us in the process."
"Finally, I anticipate our being able to tighten up the waste incineration directive in a few years' time, in close consultation with industry."
"The people who live in the vicinity of these plants will thank us for it."
"Mr President, I share at least one certainty with the rapporteur, Mr Blokland: incineration may be a significant source of pollution but it is in fact necessary today, given the very low levels of waste recycling."
"The urgency of this subject is made more acutely felt by the problem of animal meal in feedingstuffs, which we are going to be debating later this afternoon, which are going to have to be destroyed."
"The objective of this proposal, which aims to replace three directives relating to waste incineration, is to improve air, water and soil quality and human health by reducing emissions of pollutants linked to incineration and co-incineration, notably dioxins, furans and heavy metals."
"This proposal also allows for the integration of the technical progress that has been achieved since the 1990s."
"Overall, the result of the conciliation process is very pleasing."
"The emission limit values for incineration and co-incineration plants have been brought into line, while taking account of the technical differences between these two activities."
"I have always been in agreement with the joint draft which regards these two systems as complementary and not competing."
"Today, we cannot do without either of these incineration methods."
"Yet one can only regret the fusion of these incineration processes in terms of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, which has considerably complicated the debate, and which I have always condemned."
"In my view, the working method is not good, and I believe it is undesirable that we behave in this manner on such issues."
"Nonetheless, we are satisfied with this third reading, because it reinforces the operation authorisation conditions."
"Our group, which wanted to avoid the confusion between hazardous and non-hazardous waste, recognises that the current text clearly provides for different recovery and treatment processes, which are adapted to the types of waste involved. Supplementary precautions will have to be taken as far as hazardous waste is concerned."
"Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that the Group of the Europe People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is satisfied by the work that has been carried out during the course of the third reading."
"Mr President, first of all, I think we have cause to thank Mr Blokland, the Commission and the Council for the cooperation there has been in connection with the directive."
"We all know that it has been a long and very difficult process putting together the requirements for the incineration of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste."
"I want to draw attention to just three important objectives we can achieve by means of the directive."
"First and foremost, a significant contribution has now been made to reducing discharges of hazardous and polluting substances produced by incineration - substances which are very harmful to people' s health and which damage the environment."
"This is to happen by means of the operational requirements made in connection with incineration plant and also by means of the emission limit values we have now established for heavy metals, dioxins and other substances."
"I also think, however, that it is very important to emphasise that it is now no longer merely a question of discharges into the atmosphere but also of discharges into the water and the earth."
"The second thing I want to point out is that, as Mr Blokland too mentioned, people are now to be given more information about emissions from incineration plant in the form of the annual reports that are to be prepared."
"I think this is a very important result."
"People are entitled to be told about these things."
"Finally, I want to emphasise that, by establishing the common requirements which everyone must now fulfil, we can presumably get rid of a significant proportion of so-called waste tourism."
"It will no longer be so financially attractive to export waste to other places in the Community where waste handling requirements are less strict."
"As Mr Blokland mentioned, incineration is, of course, far from being the ideal way of disposing of waste."
"It is important for us to continually invest in better production methods, recycling and re-use."
"This ought clearly to be given priority ahead of incineration."
"It is nonetheless good that we have now obtained tighter rules covering waste incineration."
"I believe this will prove to be a significant contribution to improving the environment."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank Mr Blokland for preparing this subject."
"It has been a difficult process drafting the directive, as circumstances and practices in the Member States vary, and this affects many different interest groups."
"The end result is that we now have a reasonably balanced proposal for imposing strict limits regarding the incineration of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, improving the environment and enabling waste to also be used in the production of electricity and heat."
"One of the hardest problems was to define what co-incineration meant."
"In some countries the best alternative, environmentally speaking, is that carefully sorted combustible waste can be burned in small municipal plants that produce electricity and heating."
"In the first draft sketches for these plants there was a call for unnecessary, technically costly and, in some respects, impossible tests."
"The proposal has improved during the debate."
"It is also important that industry can still use non-hazardous waste in its own production of energy."
"In my opinion, the problem was also that the directive went into precise technical detail which it was hard to get unambiguous opinions on from the experts."
"I think we in Parliament should keep to the definition of the main arguments, allowing Member States to take account of differing circumstances and continue with best practice with regard to the environment."
"A directive on the incineration of waste will increase the costs of burning waste, but will cut hazardous emissions and improve the state of the environment."
"Our parliamentary debate achieved a reasonably balanced proposal that can serve as a basis for action throughout the Union."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Blokland for his excellent work on this report and give my group's support for the compromise text."
"With the toughening of legislation on landfill there has been significant increase in waste incineration, and I know from my own experience in my constituency in Wales that incineration of hazardous and non-hazardous waste is as much a concern, in terms of its effects on health and the environment, as is landfill."
"It is essential that we do not replace one unhealthy and unsustainable form of waste disposal with another."
"Incineration is not recycling."
"It is not a clean and safe method of waste disposal."
"Genuinely sustainable alternatives must be funded and promoted and far more must be invested in research and in developing waste prevention, re-use and recycling."
"That is why I welcome these standards for co-incineration of municipal waste and the transportation of waste, which should help bring an end to the present trade in waste where areas with the cheapest operators and the lowest standards become the co-incineration capitals of Europe."
"In particular, I welcome the commitment to improving public access to information on incineration plants and the obligation on plant operators to publish an annual report on emissions."
"Greater openness is obviously of major concern to people who live near these incinerators, but it will also help to ensure that the plant operators themselves keep below the emission ceilings that have been set."
"The introduction of much stricter nitrogen oxide limits for new co-incineration plants such as cement kilns is also a step forward which will be an incentive for reducing emissions even though the standards proposed do not reflect the best available techniques."
"Overall, this much needed legislation will put in place safeguards to limit the worst effects of incineration on health and the environment and, I hope, discourage incineration-for-profit, which depends on the creation of more and more waste."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Blokland in particular for his cooperation during this process."
"Agreement on the derogations in the scope of the directive was one of the hardest questions in the debate and conciliation process."
"The aim was for strictly limited derogations and the clearest possible definitions."
"In my opinion this has been successful, meaning that ecological targets and compatibility with other Community policies can come about in what is actually an easily realisable way."
"Parliament was also pushing for greater transparency and better opportunities for the public to have access to information."
"Thus, in the conciliation process we were able to agree that plants that incinerate more than two tons per hour should publish a report on their emissions each year and smaller incineration plants should be included in the lists that would come under public scrutiny."
"The limit values for emissions in the annex to the directive were definitely the most difficult point."
"In this respect the conciliation process achieved a good result, as Parliament' s proposal for stricter nitrogen oxide emissions in all new cement kilns co-incinerating waste was approved."
"I myself succeeded in having some amendments made to the report, vital for the continuation of co-incineration practices that have been in place in Finland for years and which are more ecological than those contained in the directive that is now about to be approved."
"I am very happy about that, as the job I had as a new member having come directly to the second reading was not easy."
"The report by Mr Blokland, now at its third reading, was for many members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, elected to Parliament for the first time, the first real test of learning with regard to parliamentary practice."
"The procedures chosen by the institutions work surprisingly well, however."
"The end result can be considered good, and with good reason."
"The important element in all this, though, was the genuine desire for cooperation on the part of the three institutions."
"The work of the countries to hold the presidency, Portugal and France, was constructive, and we have to mention in particular the role of the Commission, which played a decisive part in bringing about a satisfactory end result."
"In my opinion, there is something to be learnt from this for the future and we must see to it that cooperation to achieve a more ecological European Union works."
"Mr President, honourable Members, forgive me - especially Mr Blokland - for being a few minutes late."
"I could not hear your introduction, but I can guess what was in it."
"First of all, I want to thank you for your excellent work as rapporteur on this report."
"The fact that this directive has passed through the legislative procedure so smoothly serves to show how important it is for all concerned."
"This directive will lead to significant reductions in emissions in several key pollutants across the European Union, despite the fact that the volume of waste incineration will increase over the coming years."
"Not only does it contribute to the fight against air pollution but it also covers the release of waste water, as Mr Lund has said, from exhaust gas cleaning and the quality of waste from the incineration process itself."
"The conciliation process was demanding, but a well-balanced compromise has been found and the amendments of Parliament and the Council have produced a better directive."
"The scope of the directive is much clearer."
"Public access to information has improved."
"Stricter emission-limit values have been introduced for new cement kilns that co-incinerate waste, as Mrs Evans pointed out."
"This has been largely due to the excellent work of the European Parliament and its rapporteur, Mr Blokland."
"I am convinced that the joint text strikes the right balance - a view reflected in your speeches yesterday - incorporating a high level of environmental protection along with the legitimate interests of all stake holders."
"Let me remind you that the directive is only one instrument in the whole waste-management concept of the Commission."
"Burning waste is the final stage in the treatment of waste, due to the waste hierarchy, and the Commission will make strong efforts to reduce and recycle waste and in its approach to an integrated product policy."
"Of course, the overall objective is to prevent waste in the first place."
"In conclusion, this directive is a major contribution to the reduction of negative effects on the environment and the risks they pose to human health."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Supplementary health insurance"
"The next item is the report (A5-0266/2000) by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on supplementary health insurance [2000/2009 (INI)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for almost ten years now the Community institutions have been working on the issue of social protection, a major element of which is, quite clearly, health cover."
"Today, Member States, while retaining their own responsibilities through the direct application of the subsidiarity principle, nevertheless have problems in common which justify a debate at European level."
"The operation of social systems is directly affected by certain general trends including the unemployment and social exclusion generated by 25 years of low economic growth, which has restricted the overall potential tax yield, the ageing of the population, the consequence of the emergence of new diseases and, finally, increased health care costs due to advances in medical research and treatment."
"However diverse national situations may be, one can recognise in all Member States a more or less general reduction in statutory cover, an enhanced role for supplementary health insurance schemes and a marked increase in discriminating factors."
"Against this backdrop, a more global approach to health protection seemed to me to be necessary, taking account, of course, of the institutional context: responsibility for the organisation and financing of social insurance systems by the Member States; national social models shaped by history, and free competition governing the rules applicable to the insurance industry."
"Providing guaranteed access for all European citizens to high-quality necessary medical treatment within reasonable time limits is a primary objective towards which the efforts and financing of obligatory and supplementary systems must converge."
"Starting from the principle that every individual has a right to medical care and that healthcare is a social good to which all Member States must provide access, it is unacceptable that some are forced to simply abandon healthcare, allowing unwholesome systems to take their place which are disastrous for our societies."
"The Employment and Social Policy Council adopted a European strategy for the fight against social exclusion in Luxembourg on 17 October."
"The European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which will be officially announced at the Nice Summit, recognises the right to social security and to health protection as a common reference value."
"In its fight to combat discrimination and social exclusion, and in terms of the responsibilities of each individual, the European Parliament will take pride in giving a strong impetus to the establishment of a system which will allow the essential principle of solidarity to be practically implemented."
"To this end, I sought the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee, which greatly clarified a number of points in a communication which was adopted with a very large majority."
"The opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the proposals of the draftsman, Ioannis Marinos, gave rise to a large number of debates and favoured the adoption of compromise texts."
"A broad consensus was finally reached within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which I have the honour of chairing."
"The proposed system contains a number of approaches, the first of which is the development of a common vision of universal services which allow access to essential healthcare within a reasonable timeframe."
"The second is the establishment of a Community system to monitor health systems and their capacity to respond to specific needs: the collection of statistics and comparable data; the development of effective cooperation between the Member States and the pooling of good practice."
"It should be possible for this monitoring system to be organised by extending the tasks of a Community agency that has already been formed."
"The third approach is the presentation by the European Commission within a period of six months of a Green Paper examining a framework for supplementary health insurance schemes and proposing appropriate legislative initiatives. We have already called on the Commission to do this and, Commissioner, we are aware that it will involve a considerable amount of work."
"This will preferably be in the form of proposals for recommendations to include the following points: recognition by Member States of a common concept of a universal service to govern the basic service which will enable every European citizen to have access to the necessary care; establishing, in agreement with the private insuring bodies, guaranteed respect for the principle of non-discrimination; organising a system of pooling costs in order to cover the costs of persons and groups with serious existing diseases, and encouraging private insurers to develop preventative measures."
"There should also be a proposal for a directive to include the following points: a prohibition on the use of personal medical data, such as genetic typing, a key point; ensuring that persons joining a scheme are not in principle required to undergo a medical examination; the introduction of an obligation to provide lifelong insurance by the insurer; undertaking to reimburse persons working and moving within the European Union in a more coordinated way and, finally, introducing a mediation procedure."
"It would be necessary to consider encouraging and supporting the codes of conduct for insurers concluded on a national or transnational basis, and an annual forum to study these issues."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Committee Chairman, Mr Rocard, for his words of praise in connection with my opinion."
"Supplementary health schemes have also developed, over and above the reasons quoted by Mr Rocard, because there is a need for improved care as the result of advances in medical treatments, which are too expensive for national health services to pay for."
"However, they are also needed in order to compensate for the increasing shortcomings of national health services as the result of public-sector management, high costs and cutbacks in expenditure by governments, expenditure which has steadily decreased in all the Member States during the 1980s and at the beginning of the 1990s."
"As in the past, these gaps are being filled and the increase in the demand for better health services is being increasingly covered by subsidiary and voluntary supplementary health schemes set up by public- or private-sector agencies on a profit-making or non-profit-making basis."
"However, there are huge differences between one country and another and we have no detailed or comparable statistics to help us ascertain reliably what applies where, what works best, where the weaknesses lie etc., which is precisely why my opinion, which was drafted on the instructions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, stresses the need, before any generally-applicable rules are introduced for supplementary health insurance, for the Commission to submit a Green Paper containing an analysis of all these separate issues, together with the relevant information."
"We could then use the conclusions drawn from the paper to introduce some general rules for all the Member States, in order to improve the quality of supplementary health insurance and ensure that it adequately meets the needs of the weaker sections of the population."
"However, these rules would need to take account of the subsidiarity principle, facilitate competition in the favourable sense of the word and not hamper the efficiency or speed of the private sector or its economic viability."
"I should like to end by stressing that the distinguished rapporteur, Mr Rocard, took extensive account of the scientific observations and many of the suggestions in my opinion."
"I should also like to thank my fellow members, Mr Pronk and Mr Karas, for their valuable contribution to the final report."
"Mr President, I would like to offer warm thanks to Mr Rocard, and also to Mr Marinos, for their trail-blazing report, which is on the table today."
"The issue of health insurance has occupied European minds for quite some time now, but the Kohll and Decker decrees, in which the European Court of Justice determined that healthcare received overseas must be remunerated by insurers, has in fact added an extra dimension to this discussion."
"Mr Rocard' s report, which we have here before us, will help to stimulate debate about the further development of social security in Europe, within the context of growing competition and the rise of the single market in healthcare."
"One of the main objectives of the current modernisation of social protection is guaranteed access to affordable health protection."
"It is particularly important for the affordability of health care to be taken into consideration, because the discussion about social security is determined not so much by the quality as by the cost of health care."
"With its Kohll and Decker decrees, the Court of Justice has sent a clear message to the EU Member States."
"We are really coming round to the idea of cross-border care and so market forces are becoming increasingly applicable to health care."
"Whether this will happen, to what extent and when, is still unclear."
"Research and experiments have shown that it will not open the floodgates to medical tourism."
"However, there can be no two ways about it; more and more people are going to seek health care overseas."
"It is therefore imperative that the citizens are our main concern in this process."
"This issue has one or two implications for us, but it will also have an impact on the national systems."
"We are talking subsidiarity."
"National systems of health care, and even the supervision of health insurance, are regulated at national level, but that does not mean that we are not all dealing with the same problems."
"That is precisely why it is so important - and in fact this is far and away the most significant achievement of this report - for the Commission to produce a Green Paper on supplementary health insurance in the short term."
"In point of fact, we must ask the Commission whether it is in a position to do this, and if so, how long will it take?"
"Because it is very important."
"The statistics available to us in this sphere are not comparable, despite our best efforts to this end, and so it is crucial that we have this Green Paper."
"Apart from that, there is a great deal people want done in the health care sector."
"A significant number of these aspirations are at national level, but that does not mean that we should not compare notes."
"Hitherto, this has been somewhat taboo up to a certain point."
"The Kohll and Decker decree has made a breakthrough."
"I also think the Rocard report has made a breakthrough on that score, but it is very important for the Commission to take up the initiative now, and come to the table with an actual Green Paper."
"Once that is in place we will look at how we should take it forward."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to hear Members from all groups who accept their responsibility regarding social policy and who are prepared to work towards a consensus."
"I would like to thank you Michel, as rapporteur, for your initiative in bringing the issue of supplementary health insurance to attention now, at the appropriate time."
"I have some general comments on this subject."
"We had never had it as good as now."
"This is reflected in the fact that our life expectancy is increasing by three years every ten years, and that is not because we are leading a healthier lifestyle."
"We are living to an older age because the body of medical knowledge is doubling every five years."
"However, medical treatment is costing more and more money!"
"However, equal access to health care must be available to everyone, without exception."
"This is important if we want a social Europe that sets us apart from others."
"For example, although we often take the United States as a model for the free market economy, it would be a fatal mistake to follow their lead in health policy."
"For instance, we see that in the US system, health costs as measured against gross domestic product are nearly twice as high as the EU average, and that in the United States there are still some 40 million people who have inadequate health insurance."
"That is scarcely what you would call a responsible social policy."
"So, as far as the European Union is concerned, it is more a question of seeking to develop a combination of health insurance and supplementary health insurance that does not sacrifice quality and is not socially exclusive."
"The debate on health insurance in the EU must not end up going down a blind alley."
"Unless there are pan-European requirements for supplementary insurance, we will have to be extremely cautious about the existing systems."
"The risk that the less healthy and the elderly may not necessarily be able to secure full private insurance cover because they represent too high a risk is quite unacceptable in terms of social development."
"Flawed thinking of this kind has no place in the European Union."
"Therefore, during the first phase, we need to prepare a Green Paper on the situation of supplementary health insurance in the EU as soon as possible."
"Following on from that, we will have to define minimum standards for supplementary insurance in Europe if we wish to achieve and further develop a reasonably equitable and socially balanced health-care system in the EU worthy of the name of a social Union."
"After all, that is what we want, is it not?"
"Mr President, I too should like to thank Mr Rocard for his own-initiative report, even if I did not agree with his original view which was, of course, to establish supplementary health insurance schemes in all EU countries, founded on the principle of solidarity and governed by a common set of regulations."
"I can, however, support the Commission' s publishing a Green Paper explaining the ins and outs of such sickness insurance, focusing in particular upon sickness insurance in relation to cross-border activities and, in the process, looking into whether there is a need for further initiatives."
"Sickness insurance is, of course, a national responsibility and systems differ from one another. It is true, however, that the growing number of elderly people and the growing demands upon the health sector mean that the systems are coming under financial pressure."
"It is a problem calling for many different solutions, including better organised and more efficient health care, so that a better quality of service can be obtained for the same money. Moreover, new medical methods can also, in fact, lead to both better and cheaper forms of treatment."
"I am generally in favour of a system in which the money follows the patient as far as possible, so that it is the patient and not the system that is central. In this perspective, there is certainly justification for insurance-style sickness schemes and supplementary insurance schemes."
"However, the individual country must decide for itself what arrangements it prefers."
"It would be wrong if the EU were to devise rules concerning, for example, data relating to health, or requiring everyone to be insured and, in that way, destroy the multiplicity of supplementary health insurance schemes which exist today in many countries and operate on actuarial principles."
"It is right that, in connection with serious illnesses such as cancer and aids, there must be a compulsory system, founded on the principle of solidarity, which ensures good treatment for everybody."
"Supplementary health insurance must be just that: supplementary, for example, for those who are willing to pay for an extra service, or designed to cover the costs of more ordinary and frequently occurring illnesses for which actuarial calculations can reasonably be made."
"Mr President, the debate which followed the presentation of this own-initiative report at last highlighted two concepts, one of which, unfortunately only too prevalent, involves favouring the commercialisation of all aspects of life and aiming to reduce supplementary health insurance to a mere project by placing it in the hands of economic operators and subjecting it to the rules of the internal market."
"According to this concept, the purpose of the market in profit-making supplementary health insurance schemes is to increasingly and crucially take on the role of supplementing the basic state systems."
"This view turns up its nose at the non-profit-making mutual insurance companies, which are vital players in supplementary health insurance in several Member States."
"The other viewpoint illustrated by the rapporteur' s initial statement and shared by a number of members is to promote regulations and codes of conduct which are needed in order to establish among insurers ways of organising costs on a mutual basis providing everybody with guaranteed access to high-quality care and to counter the risk of discriminatory practices developing together with risk and client selection."
"The report by Michel Rocard, which is being presented today as amended in committee, demonstrates the difficulty of overcoming these contradictions."
"The amendments we are proposing on behalf of the Group of the Greens recommend that consideration should be given to the following points."
"Firstly, we have not, unlike some, resigned ourselves to the reduction in the relative share of public expenditure on health."
"Demographic trends, the effects of an ageing population and increased demand for medical treatment necessitate a public debate."
"It should be the citizens of the European Union who decide the outcome of this social debate and the volume of funds that must be allocated in order to guarantee the fundamental right to social protection."
"The increasing transfer of responsibilities from the basic systems to the supplementary health insurance systems is doubly disadvantageous in that it reduces the obligations of these systems, while at the same time weakening non-profit-making mutual insurance companies which reject risk selection."
"We propose that the report should include recognition of a right to health care for all, rather than simply the recognition of a basic service which is accessible to all. We also propose removing all risk of discrimination or risk selection which would, we believe, result from the legislation calling for medical examinations to be carried out before a supplementary health insurance contract is concluded as provided for in Paragraph 11b."
"Mr President, a while ago, I received a serious meniscus injury."
"I turned to the health service and was told that I had to wait three weeks for an examination and then at least a further month for a crucial operation."
"I said, 'I can hardly walk!"
"I need help straight away."
"Can I not be admitted as an emergency patient?'"
"I received the answer, 'Everyone in the queue is an emergency case'."
"It then appeared that there was in fact a way of getting in."
"I was suddenly informed that, if I had private health insurance or if I could pay the whole cost myself, then I could be examined immediately and be treated by the same doctor I should otherwise be forced to wait two months to be treated by."
"I am rather ashamed to admit it, but I chose that solution."
"I was operated on immediately, and that is why I am able to be here today."
"Otherwise, I should have been at home with my leg in plaster."
"It nonetheless leaves a bad taste in the mouth, because each time a private patient jumps the queue, as I did, other people have to wait longer with their problems."
"It is, of course, the same doctor, the same nurses, the same hospitals and the same resources in the health care sector which are to be used, irrespective of whether it is ordinary or private patients who are being treated."
"This means that the bigger the health insurance sector becomes, the fewer resources there are left for general health care."
"I think it is completely wrong that it should be money which decides who goes to the front of the queue."
"If we acquire an extended system of supplementary insurance for those who can pay, or who have employers who can pay, then we get what the report talks about, namely a distinction between basic care for 'ordinary people' and high-quality care for those who can pay."
"My group believes that this class-determined type of organisation must be objected to."
"We want to see common arrangements which are based on the principle of solidarity and are the same for everyone."
"It is, of course, good that, as Mr Rocard proposes, the attempt should be made to supervise existing schemes, but what is most important of all is that private systems should not be allowed to expand at the expense of public systems."
"Mr President, the observations made by Michel Rocard on the right to health and social protection are alarming but, unfortunately, pertinent."
"During the 1990s, a sharp fall in contributions has penalised health funds."
"Almost everywhere in Europe this has resulted in a ticket system which penalises patients by making them contribute to the cost of medical treatment and in the marked decline of preventative medicine."
"We must therefore ensure better reimbursement of costs."
"I wish to highlight the uniqueness of the French insurance environment, in which the mutualist sector ensures good unified management of care."
"If more and more Europeans turn to supplementary health insurance in order to reimburse health care costs, the mutualist sector will remain the best guarantee for equal access to care."
"In particular I have in mind the areas in which costs are reimbursed at the lowest levels: dental and eye treatment and so on."
"I also think it crucial that the Commission should not attack this sector on the grounds of distortion of competition."
"Who will be able to guarantee that discrimination on the grounds of health, handicap or impediment is prohibited and not practised, if supplementary health insurance is regulated simply by the logic of competition?"
"With human genetic mapping, it is necessary to prohibit genetic tests and the use of their results before the conclusion or during the term of a supplementary health protection contract."
"The same applies to the health of all the citizens of our Member States and the cohesion of our territories."
"Regional inequalities in terms of development are glaring enough."
"Let us not add to this a two-speed Europe of health."
"We must of course legislate, but we must do this by respecting the individual characteristics and insurance traditions of each Member State."
"Mr President, Commissioner, greater generosity of cover for individuals and rising costs in the Member States' health sector are creating two requirements. First, the need for individuals to pay more from their own pockets towards statutory schemes or through private supplementary health insurance, and secondly greater coordination of such private health insurance in the European Union."
"My sincere congratulations go to the rapporteur, Michel Rocard."
"His diagnosis is first-rate, but there are a couple of question marks hanging over the treatment he prescribes."
"I need to distinguish here between his practical requests and the key points of the approach he suggests to solve the problems here. These are based on important principles, namely solidarity, subsidiarity and minimum standards, and we fully accept those."
"As Mr Pronk indicated, we oppose the idea of imposing a directive immediately."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs' new proposal is correct, suggesting as it does that there should first be a review of the situation in the form of a Green Paper and that only then should decisions be made about whether a directive or recommendation is needed."
"As regards the heterogeneous nature of the systems already in existence, there are Member States in which individuals have to find a substantial proportion themselves, for example 40% of the cost of outpatient treatment."
"In these cases supplementary schemes are more significant than in Germany, for example, where 90% of the population are covered by statutory health insurance which up to now has been obliged to guarantee necessary medical treatment for all."
"We in Europe should be pointing the way forward without delay, with a socially acceptable level of self-provision combined with the maintenance of existing standards, if necessary by means of permanent supplementary health insurance."
"But people will need time to build up a suitable level of provision."
"That is the alternative to the manipulation and trickery of insurance systems that comes with statutory schemes."
"Mr President, I would like to echo the sentiments of those who have congratulated Michel Rocard on this excellent initiative, which is in the best tradition of Parliament' s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"The report is based on the intention expressed by the Council in 1992 to achieve convergence of objectives and policies in the sphere of social security, and it links these with the existing objectives announced in Lisbon with regard to social cohesion and economic progress."
"I think the connection between these two elements is a very sound one."
"I expressly included a third element in my contribution in the committee, which I believe makes another strong case for European action in the field of health insurance; in particular, the removal of obstacles to freedom of movement, and not just the free movement of services that Bartho Pronk talked about, but also the free movement of persons within the EU."
"In particular, these sentiments are to be found in recital J and Paragraphs 11 e) and f) and 14 of this report."
"Many sometimes distressing problems and examples from real life prompted me to table these amendments."
"I am delighted that the rapporteur and the committee have adopted them."
"It is not by chance that I am particularly used to facing such problems by virtue of my Dutch background."
"We have a special combination of private, public, individual and collective types of health insurance system, which have undergone quite some upheaval in recent times."
"Leaving aside for the moment the question as to whether these changes were for the better, one thing is for sure: far too little attention was given to the effects of these changes on cross-border workers, retired Dutch nationals living abroad, and for example, Germans and Belgians working in the Netherlands."
"In terms of European coordination, the current combination of fiscally financed national insurance for nationals, compulsory insurance for employees up to a certain income level and, in addition, private insurance with collective or individual regimes, is a downright disaster."
"The national insurance system is not subject to the coordination rules because it is not employees' insurance and only applies to nationals."
"The private system has to do with the directives for the insurance sector in the sphere of competition."
"There is at present an on-going discussion in the Netherlands about structural changes to the system."
"An opinion is being prepared on this in the Social and Economic Council."
"It looks as if employers and employees are at last to reach agreement on basic health insurance in which market forces and competition between insurers will be combined with agreements on a compulsory basic package and, in addition, a broad package with optional elements which must, at the very least, be subject to an acceptance obligation and an average premium."
"This is with a view to avoiding risk selection and exclusion, and to secure optimum accessibility for everyone."
"Fortunately, the parties in the SER have realised that creating such a hybrid mixture of private and public elements might run up against conflicting legislation from Brussels."
"People have been doing some fact-finding on this ahead of time, and have reached the sensible conclusion that, whatever happens, the entire system must now fall within the scope of the social insurance system."
"Coordination at European level would certainly make this a whole lot simpler for those who live and work over the border."
"I believe this fits in with the convergence strategy that the rapporteur has in mind."
"I also feel that the increase in labour mobility in Europe is necessary and lends weight to our argument in favour of producing the aforementioned Green Paper and measures on the cost of public health."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Rocard is calling on the Commission to define a framework for basic statutory health insurance systems in a Green Paper."
"The logic of this is that all health care not included in this basic insurance has to be covered by private supplementary health insurance."
"That means that the present statutory health insurance system, which has, up to now, been based on the principle of social solidarity, will be reduced to an ""à la carte"" health system."
"The public would then have to invest additional and ever greater amounts in private supplementary health insurance schemes in order to pay for costly treatment that has, thus far, been covered by statutory health insurance systems."
"For example, someone who is chronically ill but who has only a small income will, in future, accordingly find it very difficult to afford the treatment they need."
"This simply amounts to dismantling public services and it implies turning our backs on the principle of equal health care for all based on need."
"We reject this socially unacceptable reform."
"Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights calls for the establishment of a universal right of access to preventative health care and for a high level of health protection to be defined and put into practice."
"On this basis, the Commission should take the initiative and create solid cornerstones by way of guidelines for the Member States' health systems."
"This would enable the EU to lead the way by creating a social Europe and a high standard of health care for all, regardless of income."
"Rules concerning the coordination of private supplementary health insurance systems in the EU make sense as long as they involve guarantees of freedom of movement for individuals and employees."
"We also support the call for a ban on genetic testing or medical examinations leading to selection on the basis of risk."
"Supplementary health insurance schemes must provide protection against the risk of bankruptcy, insolvency and fraud, but should not serve as an excuse for limiting the range of services provided by statutory health insurance."
"Mr President, I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his own-initiative report, particularly because it is precisely that: an own-initiative report."
"He affirms, especially in Paragraph 17, that publicly funded health care systems should remain within the exclusive competence of the Member States and I very much agree with this."
"He highlights the need to address the issue of health problems of tourists visiting other Member States, and this is certainly a very live issue, as I know from the many letters on this subject I receive from constituents."
"But above all he draws attention, for example in Paragraph 3, to the significant problems regarding the long-term sustainability of public health care systems throughout the EU because of the increasing cost of advances in treatment possibilities, as well as the growing demand from an increasingly elderly population."
"This is a major concern."
"We certainly need fresh thinking on this subject and that has to include new ways of private and public health care working together."
"His report is a useful contribution to that debate, though I hope he agrees in turn that the contributions made in committee, including those made on this side of the House, may perhaps have made it even more useful."
"It is certainly now much less prescriptive, which is good."
"Health care is financed in different ways in different Member States and the roles of private health insurers are correspondingly different."
"Even the definitions of ""supplementary"" and ""complementary"" have slightly different meanings in different languages."
"So an absolute ""one size fits all"" solution for insurance is unlikely to be the answer."
"On the basis that Amendments Nos 2 and 3 are passed, which accept the suggestion of a Green Paper but do not dictate precisely what has to be in it, I shall certainly be calling upon my UK colleagues to vote in favour, though I shall be proposing abstention on Amendment No 16"
"Mr President, I am sure that the rapporteur, Mr Rocard, means well, but to me he resembles a man tiptoeing along a tightrope."
"On the one hand, when he says ""solidarity"", he means it as a Socialist, but he does not want to take responsibility for protecting the social state and the health and welfare systems which are currently being attacked both by objective events and specific policies."
"On the other hand, he does not want to go too far the other way; he wants to apply a Realpolitik, but without quite signing up to the American model."
"I think that we need to be extremely careful."
"We really are on a tightrope and I think that decisions on supplementary insurance which will apply to all the Member States need to be taken cautiously and with a great deal of circumspection."
"If supplementary insurance becomes the general rule, we shall simply end up increasing workers' contributions; but if we have selective supplementary insurance, we shall also have discrimination and that is something we wish to avoid."
"In this sense, I think that, basically, we should await the Commission study on current systems as well as a Commission study on the American system and the schemes in operation in other countries because then we shall have a clearer picture of all this."
"Mr President, those of us who have devoted ourselves all our lives to studying social issues will remember that the old manuals used to include a definition of social protection as a set of state protection measures to cover economically assessable risks affecting individuals or families which individuals - family units - could not cover themselves."
"Health is, of course, one of the assets that we as individuals most value, though very often when we have lost or risk losing it."
"It is, moreover, a fact that social systems - protection systems - have been suffering from the influences and consequences of economic, demographic and public health situations, etc. And it is also a fact that economic recession, unemployment, social exclusion, the appearance of new diseases, the ageing of the population, as well as advances in research, improved therapies, the development of new techniques of diagnosis and treatment have all had a profound effect on the levels of mandatory social and health cover."
"It is a proven and verifiable fact that Europeans are being protected against the risks of illness, maternity or old age (and there are more risks associated with old age these days because of the ageing of the population) not just by the essential and mandatory social and state schemes of social security or social protection."
"Articles 34 and 35 of our fledgling European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights recognise and respect the entitlement to social security benefits and social services and, at the same time, proclaim the entitlement of everyone residing and moving legally within the Union to social security benefits and social advantages in accordance with Community law and national laws and practices."
"Complementary private health insurance, whether voluntary or not, coexists with the mandatory public system and can be a way to achieve quality health care within a given time."
"I therefore believe we should lend our support to what Mr Rocard has put in his report - and we congratulate him on it - asking the Commission to provide a service, a Green Paper which will enable us to see the current insurance situation in the Member States and also to define the future."
"Mr President, the report and the accompanying explanations are based on a damning conclusion."
"For twenty years, statutory health cover for the people of Europe has been in constant decline while the share of health costs they have had to pay has continually increased."
"Increasing numbers of people are witnessing a drastic reduction in their standard of living through badly paid jobs, unemployment, job insecurity and exclusion. They no longer have the means to take care of themselves properly, or indeed to gain access to the most basic forms of healthcare."
"Faced with this intolerable situation, the report envisages nothing but recourse to private or mutualist supplementary health insurance schemes, which it claims to be the solution to the problem."
"But exactly whom does this solution benefit?"
"Certainly not those who will have to pay even more for their care, even though society denies them the means to pay. This is, first and foremost, a solution that benefits the private insurers to whom the Member States have handed the healthcare market on a plate."
"This report and its accompanying amendments would like to impose rules to prevent forms of selection, based on criteria of health or handicap, on sharks such as the insurance company, Axa, which has multiplied the contributions paid by parents of mentally handicapped children by a factor of ten."
"Imposing such rules is the very minimum necessary and we will vote in favour, but we have no intention of accepting the fact that this proposal releases Member States from their duty to carry out a literally crucial task in terms of a public health service."
"Whilst medicine has made tremendous progress, empty phrases about providing access to quality health care for all are nothing but hot air. Lack of investment by Member States and growing health privatisation can only result in selection by money, growing inequality with implications ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"I would like to thank Mr Rocard for his initiative. Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party - which is as good as blamed for the longer life expectancy of citizens and pensioners and therefore for this health service crisis - how could I fail to say a few words on this occasion."
"I have to say, even, that I am rather taken over by the subject for, to my eyes, Mr President, you resemble a chief physician, with a white coat, stethoscope and hammer to test the patient's reflexes."
"We are discussing public and private health care."
"But if public health care is working so well, why is it that in Italy, for example - and ""the voice of the people is the voice of God"" - the people were saying that health insurance schemes take away your health and leave you dissatisfied?"
"Why did the great Italian actor, Alberto Sordi, have such success with a film about the Italian health service, entitled ""The Family Doctor""?"
"Why, in response to a question I put to him, did the great doctor, Christian Barnard, whom I had the good fortune to meet last week at a convention organised by Mr Nisticò, reply that when he performed the first heart transplant in South Africa it was in a private clinic?"
"Why is it, as happened to me when I went to visit my dear mother - who is still alive, thank God - in a major public hospital in Rome, that we see people who are dying accommodated in the same wards as other patients who are happily eating their lunch or supper?"
"Well then, this means that we need to reflect at great length upon the reasons why public health care is in such a state."
"In my opinion, it is because public health care is paid for before the patient is treated whereas private health care is paid for after and if the patient is treated."
"And so I and my pensioner friends call upon Commissioner Diamantopoulou to put on a doctor's white coat, to treat the European Union's poorly medical service and to make us better."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Rocard, first I would like to thank Messrs Marinos, Pronk and Menrad, and last but not least, Mr Ettl, very sincerely for their support in getting my amendments accepted and in changing the objectives of this report."
"Financing statutory health care and pension schemes is at the heart of the social and budgetary debate in Europe."
"Both have similar causes, with demographic change in the one case and specialist and technical progress in medicine in the other."
"Both are based on a three-pillar model with state, company and private provision."
"We all know that these systems have been built up and interlinked in different ways and that they provide different cover from one Member State to another."
"Both sectors also have national requirements that act as an obstacle to mobility and flexibility for employees in Europe and increase employers' costs."
"So I am glad that the rapporteur has been willing to move from his categorical demand for a directive to an in-depth analysis in the form of a Green Paper."
"And I am pleased that we have abandoned the idea of applying the French model to Europe in its entirety, which would not be possible here."
"We need to define what we mean by the concept of supplementary insurance."
"For me, supplementary insurance means a voluntary system which is either a private or company system, supplementing basic state provision ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, first of all, congratulations to Mr Rocard on his report."
"It is every bit as important as the procedure concerning supplementary pension schemes that has got underway."
"In order to avoid any misunderstandings, I would once again like to stress that the present report concerns supplementary health insurance and not health care as such, although obviously the two cannot be separated."
"Supplementary health insurance presupposes a statutory system of entitlements and provisions."
"This system, which is secured by the government, is required to provide sound, adequate, accessible, and hence affordable, health care."
"The better the statutory system, the less need there will be for supplementary health insurance, and the less significant it will be."
"However, technological progress and the demographic situation with regard to dejuvenation and the ageing of the population, mean that supplementary health insurance is not surplus to requirements and is even indispensable in some cases."
"This is an upwards trend owing to the reorganisation of the social security systems in certain Member States."
"At the same time, this presents an outstanding opportunity to make people aware that they must take responsibility for themselves in these matters."
"Because in the same way that we ought not to transfer the whole burden to individual citizens, nor should we expect the state to shoulder the entire load."
"Supplementing collective solidarity mechanisms with private or group insurance is completely in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity."
"The EU has already produced a piece of legislation on supplementary pensions in the form of a Green Paper, which has resulted in a draft directive."
"So information has been gathered, research has been carried out, the systems in the various Member states have been investigated, etc., which is certainly the right way to go about it."
"It stands to reason that the Member States are ultimately the ones responsible for their system of social security."
"But, if insurance, and therefore supplementary health insurance, are offered within a common market, then this presupposes common rules on competition, insolvency, discrimination, transparency and suchlike."
"Mr President, the original draft of Mr Rocard's report contained proposals which could have destroyed the health insurance market in Europe."
"It is fundamental to the insurance business that premiums are related to predictable risks."
"This applies in all kinds of insurance including life, car and home protection insurance."
"If the original proposals had been carried to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of medical history, then premiums would have been attractive to the chronically sick and unattractive to the fit and healthy."
"As a result it would have been predominantly the chronically sick who would buy insurance."
"This in turn would have created a vicious circle of higher and higher premiums and fewer and sicker policyholders."
"It could have destroyed the industry and put new burdens on state systems."
"It is a classic example of socialist interventionism."
"By trying to eliminate discrimination on the grounds of health status, Mr Rocard would have killed the goose that laid the golden egg."
"I am reminded of the story of the representative of the government who went to a businessman and said ""how can the government help you?"" and the answer was ""you can help us best by leaving us alone."""
"When will we learn that lesson?"
"Of course, we should promote a vigorous and vibrant market for health insurance in Europe."
"We must also support state provision, at least for those with difficult health problems who would be uninsurable in the private sector."
"The best way to achieve these objectives is for the state to leave the private sector to get on with its job."
"The new proposal before us is for a Green Paper."
"This is better than the original proposal but even this is a step too far."
"Today's Green Paper becomes tomorrow's intrusive and damaging legislation."
"The best way we can help this industry, and the patients it serves, is to leave it alone."
"Mr President, I would like to thank and congratulate Mr Rocard for his report and to congratulate Mr Marinos for his committee's opinion."
"The Commission welcomes this initiative and it comes at crucial time because we have just launched a political debate at the European level on the reform of social protection."
"It is the first time that we have decided that there is a need for cooperation on reform of social protection systems at the European level."
"This report underlines the economic and social challenges posed by the measures relating to supplementary health insurance and, of course, supplementary health insurance is of vital importance nowadays because the basic insurance system is ripe for reform and because healthcare needs are becoming greater and greater."
"The report says there is a need for the Commission to act and, of course, we agree."
"First, we must take into account the great diversity which exists at the European level."
"There are huge differences from Member State to Member State as far as the definition is concerned, as far as the functioning of the systems are concerned, the combination between the public and the private sector."
"As an example, as far as the differences in the role played by voluntary and supplementary health insurance is concerned, the coverage of the population by voluntary or supplementary health insurance mechanisms ranges from under 0.5% in Sweden to more than 85% in France."
"However, these figures are somewhat misleading since both the concept and the coverage of the system differ significantly from country to country."
"The Commission will act immediately in the framework of its competences and I will try to reply to the conclusions of your report."
"First, on the question of the Green Paper, the complexity of the issues is such that a Green Paper may seem premature."
"However, it is essential to draw up an in-depth report on the situation and we can do this as soon as possible."
"Of course, we will take into account the wide variety of national systems and the complex nature of healthcare systems across Europe."
"The Commission will immediately launch a study of supplementary health insurance."
"Because of the complexity of the issue, we believe we can publicise the results by the end of 2001."
"This study can form the basis for a communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament proposing initiatives or measures."
"In keeping with Parliament's requests, we will try to present a framework, an objective and reasoned analysis, which will take into account all this variety and diversity and we will focus on the different aspects of the issues."
"You have referred to the wide range of aspects."
"We can go from general questions such as access to healthcare for all, to the more specific questions on the rights of individuals who want to settle or work in other Member States."
"As far as the other two proposals are concerned - the directive, the legal action, and this European forum - this is something we can think about."
"It could form the second step after this study in one year's time when we not only have the comparison between Member States but we could also work with comparable indicators which are important for any proposals for European cooperation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Combating social exclusion"
"The next item is the report (A5-0307/2000) by Mrs Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion (COM(2000) 368 - C5-0317/2000 - 2000/0157(COD))."
", rapporteur. (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, inequalities in the European Union have been exacerbated over the last decade and the number of people living on low incomes is now some 65 million, that is, around 18% of the population."
"This is a scandal, especially if we take account of the rate of economic growth in recent years. This represents a real body blow to fundamental human rights, since it denies millions of people access to basic social rights, such as housing, health care, education, training and study, good-quality employment and fair wages."
"Whilst there are considerable differences between the various Member States, the most serious situation is definitely that of Portugal, with around 24% of the population living below the poverty line due primarily to low salaries, insecure and badly paid jobs and pensions and benefits so low that they do not enable workers and their families or the elderly to live with a minimum of dignity."
"This unacceptable situation of poverty and social exclusion, which the Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March acknowledged is in need of urgent measures, requires a profound change in Community and national macroeconomic policies and putting an end to the monetarist policies of the Stability Pact in order not only to combat the current situation of poverty, but also to prevent the situation deteriorating in the future, including in the field of new technologies."
"Particular attention needs to be paid to the situation of women, children and young people, thereby guaranteeing everyone access to incomes and conditions that allow them to live and work in dignity."
"Despite all the commitments that the Council gave recently at the Lisbon Summit, however, and despite the emphasis it placed on the existing correlation between economic and social progress, the proposals that have been presented are little more than face-saving measures with regard to the countless promises to fight for the eradication of poverty. In fact, the proposal for a Community programme presented by the Commission to foster cooperation between the Member States in the field of combating social exclusion is little more than a study programme."
"It is therefore crucial for various aspects of the programme to be improved, specifically with regard to the innovations being proposed for the implementation of an open method of coordination. A European reflection group needs to be created, composed of Community partners, representatives of NGOs with experience in this field and representatives of the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions."
"A network could also be established, linking the various monitoring centres or similar recognised bodies that already exist in the Member States. Another option is to pay special attention to the problems of poverty and social exclusion at local, regional and national level, involving in the programme the social groups that are most badly affected or which are in the most danger of becoming so."
"Equally important are the proposals to increase financing from EUR 70 million to EUR 100 million, proposals which focus on the need for the Commission to guarantee the coherence of its policies, specifically in the economic, monetary and taxation areas, as well as in competition, consumer protection, fisheries and agriculture, with the aim of eliminating the poverty and social exclusion encountered at national level. The Commission will, as a result, be obliged to undertake an assessment of its policies in terms of their potential effects on poverty and social exclusion."
"I also hope that the amendments seeking to ensure that qualifications and integration into professional life are given particular attention will be adopted, which is why it is important to take account of the ever-increasing phenomenon of social exclusion and poverty despite paid employment."
"It is crucial to guarantee good-quality employment with reasonable rights and wages and to establish conditions for access to public services that are also of high quality."
"It is crucial for the Council to keep the promises it has given, not only with regard to the programme, but also with regard to setting appropriate objectives and goals, to be agreed on by the end of this year, so that it meets the expectations it created with the Lisbon Summit conclusions on its commitment to combat poverty, unemployment and social exclusion."
"Lastly, I wish to express my gratitude for the superb cooperation of my fellow members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, of the rapporteurs from other committees, of the Economic and Social Committee, of the Committee of the Regions, of the NGOs involved in social work and of the specialists within the Commission, the French Presidency and Parliament who have worked with me."
"In this work, and bearing in mind that this is a subject for codecision, we have been able to reach a consensus that seeks to simplify the final report and to enable it to be rapidly adopted by the Council."
"This means that the amendments we have tabled to be voted on tomorrow are the result of the consensus achieved in committee, including the new amendments replacing and rejecting various original amendments which were somewhat repetitive."
"I thank you for your understanding during this procedure, which means that we are able to contribute to the European Union once again having a programme in this field, despite its limitations and shortcomings."
"This will be one more instrument enabling us to remain vigilant in defending greater social justice."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Figueiredo for her report."
"Secondly, I would like to say how delighted I am that a compromise has indeed been reached on this important report, which means that the first reading can be brought to a successful conclusion."
"I am very pleased to be able to tell you that all the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets have been adopted."
"In fact there are three points I would like to make."
"Firstly, the Committee on Budgets took the view that, in comparison with other programmes, Parliament did not have enough input to the programme and the Council had too much, in other words, it was slanted too much in the favour of the Council for our liking."
"The second point, and this in fact is the most important point, is that of comitology."
"This is heavily biased towards the Member States on some points."
"Setting up a committee alone will lead to a six month delay in the establishment of the programme."
"It will take six months to set up the committee and then call a meeting, and the Member States will not even need to use their usual blocking tactics, because all that will take at least a year."
"Comitology really is a huge liability, as it is to this programme."
"I would like to ask the Commission, following the example of what Mr Patten did, to reconsider whether it would not be possible to do something similar with regard to the Member States."
"Finally, the question of technical support."
"The Committee on Budgets insists that technical support be included in the programme."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs allocated EUR 100 million in the end."
"A suitable amount of this must be set aside for technical support so as to be sure that the programme is properly supported."
"Any complaints about this from the Commission are therefore unfounded as far as Parliament is concerned, if this technical support is to be included in the programme itself."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report."
"She has already described the scandalous situation in which 18% of Europe's population lives below the relative poverty line."
"This is not just a subject for discussion in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, it is also of concern to us in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because these 65 million people are not only excluded from access to financial and other resources, because they are not only excluded from social and cultural rights, but because they are also prevented from using their talents to help shape our society and because they are prevented from developing their own talents, gaining additional qualifications and skills and working in jobs they are suited for."
"For that reason we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs were almost unanimous in our opinion about adopting a guiding principle according to which everyone should be in a position to make an essential contribution to supporting themselves through their own work."
"They should be enabled to gain and update qualifications and skills."
"We know very well that the problem we are facing here will not be solved by a one-off initiative or by a single catching-up process. No, what we are dealing with here is a permanent situation in which each new technological wave brings with it new winners and losers."
"That is why we need to offer our societies mechanisms that allow those affected to find their places in society."
"We consider that there are three issues here."
"Social integration must be seen as a cross-cutting issue, and the results of our efforts should therefore also be included in the spring report."
"Secondly, the open method of coordination must be suitable for mobilising local and regional stakeholders and enabling them to make a contribution."
"Thirdly, the Member States must, at long last, as requested and initiated in Lisbon, agree on concrete targets and benchmarks, so that Parliament can carry out its role as a guardian and as an animateur in this process."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it was with great satisfaction that my political group received the proposal to establish a Community programme to combat social exclusion."
"We see this proposal as a milestone in the understanding and analysis of, and fight against, this phenomenon, which is spreading and growing, which has struck every society in Europe, which is manifesting itself in new forms in response to economic and technological changes and in the face of which many governments are at a loss and are therefore dragging their feet in coming to terms with and dealing with the social problems resulting from these widespread changes."
"We support the various elements of the programme, such as a multidimensional approach to this phenomenon, measures on health, education, housing, cohesion and complementarity with other related policies and the involvement of both non-governmental organisations and the very people who are subject to social exclusion."
"We support increasing the budget to EUR 100 000 000 and we attach great importance to the need for the programme to be carried out at grass roots level."
"This is a real opportunity for the citizens of Europe to feel that a social Europe is being created and is a reality, rather than just a wish or a slogan."
"We therefore attach huge importance to collaboration with agencies at local, regional and cross-border level, which is why we tabled various amendments which, fortunately, were taken on board by all the groups."
"The Equal Opportunities Committee stressed the need to take account in the programme of the fact that women are particularly vulnerable to social exclusion, particularly special categories of women such as immigrants, women with special needs, unemployed women, women with no modern vocational training and single mothers."
"It is not just that these categories of women are cut off from the social fabric; they also find it difficult to acquire the prerequisites for reintegration."
"We must monitor the application of the programme and its evaluation very closely, Commissioner, because we believe that it will help to achieve the objective we are all striving towards - the objective of a social Europe, a citizens' Europe."
"The debate is now adjourned and will resume at 9 p.m."
"Updating the stability programmes in Germany, Finland and the Netherlands"
"The next item is the Commission recommendations for a Council opinion on updating the stability programmes in Germany, Finland and the Netherlands."
"Mr President, the Commission has today adopted three recommendations regarding three Council opinions on the updated stability programmes in Germany, the Netherlands and Finland; these are the first of the 2000-2001 round that have been updated and submitted."
"As you will remember, the Stability and Growth Pact stipulates close, on-going supervision of the Member States' budgetary position during the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union."
"The central elements in this supervision process are the stability programmes, which the Member States in the euro area have to present every year."
"The countries outside the euro area present their convergence programmes, which to a great extent resemble the stability programmes, although the objectives to be achieved are different."
"The stability programmes include the public finance strategies for the medium term."
"How can they achieve a budgetary position in the medium term that is close to balance or in surplus?"
"The aim of this initiative, as you will remember, is to try to create sufficient margin so that in a crisis situation the government deficit will not exceed the reference budget deficit set at 3% of GDP, which could obviously be reached in a crisis phase."
"This means we have to make the most of the growth phases of the cycle to bring the position back to balance or a surplus."
"In their updating of the programmes each year, the Member States include an extra year in the programme, analyse the budget policy implemented during the past year, explain and describe the budget policy measures they have adopted, and also revise their budget forecasts and objectives."
"This is the second time we have updated these programmes: we did it first in 1999, and now we are doing it again in 2000, thereby including one more year in the programme."
"The document presented by a Member State is assessed by the Commission and, on the basis of this assessment, the Council may adopt the recommendation that the Commission presents."
"In fact, in order to carry out this process, the Economic and Financial Committee first pays special attention to analysing the Commission recommendation and the programmes themselves."
"In this context, to keep Parliament informed, the Commission considers it indispensable to report to it on the current stage of the proceedings."
"Within the regular annual budget assessment procedure, the Commission can also choose to make recommendations of a different kind from those mentioned previously, which may, if appropriate, highlight the non-compliance of certain Member States with the deficit position."
"As yet, it has not been necessary to use this instrument for coordinating economic policies; so far budgetary compliance has been working as laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact."
"More and more Member States are reaching balanced or even clearly positive budgetary positions."
"This has given us a different idea, making us wonder whether this Stability and Growth Pact has run its course, having achieved the quantitative objective of a particular final figure, or whether it is worth introducing other aspects relating to the quality of public finances in future programmes."
"The Commission has opted for this second possibility; hence, in our annual assessment, we shall now also review other aspects previously not considered in the past: first, the orientation of budget policy in each of the Member States according to the point in the cycle at which it finds itself, that is, whether these kinds of budgetary measures are procyclic or anticyclic in nature and to what extent they help the market situation or create tensions within it."
"Secondly, we shall also try to assess to what extent budget cuts and tax cuts are consistent, according to a number of principles which may enable us to adopt a common position on this point."
"Thirdly - and this is a very important issue - we shall assess to what extent there is a restructuring of public expenditure to favour growth, production, and thus avoid inflationary tensions in the future."
"Finally, we shall assess to what extent the national budgets presented each year are compatible with more ambitious medium-term strategies for public finances."
"Thus, for instance, problems such as the ageing of the population are becoming increasingly more important."
"In this respect may I just remind you that the last Ecofin Council asked the Commission to include in the assessment of the stability programmes from next year precisely this long-term aspect of public finances in connection with the ageing of the population."
"Of the three programmes on which I am about to comment, one of them - the Netherlands programme - already includes an annex with a specific analysis of this particular problem."
"I am now going to give a very brief mention of the three programmes that have recently been updated."
"First of all, the three Member States whose stability programmes have been examined by the Commission today have made highly significant progress towards the restructuring of their public exchequers since 1997, the year in which they made their decisions to join the single currency; in fact, Finland already had a budget surplus in 1998 and the Netherlands in 1999."
"In their new programmes, which cover up to 2004, Finland proposes to maintain a budget surplus of more than 4% of GDP."
"The Netherlands will achieve small surpluses, which might be larger depending on economic growth and certain decisions on economic policy that are waiting to be adopted."
"The case of Germany is different: it will gradually approach an overall balance."
"However, in all three cases, there is sufficient margin to absorb the effect of fluctuations in the economic cycle; in other words, all three countries will be able to face a crisis situation, if one comes about, without exceeding the 3% budget deficit limit."
"The three countries plan to introduce major tax cuts in 2001 and in subsequent years, which will relieve the tax pressure on labour and stimulate employment and investment; they are therefore positive and necessary provided that the public finances are kept stable."
"Germany and the Netherlands both foresee a deterioration in their budget positions for the next year as a result of these tax cuts."
"This issue is particularly important in the case of Germany since it means the gradual reduction of the public deficit will be interrupted."
"One of our concerns with the German programme is clearly to insist that this dip in the trend must be a one-year exception arising from these tax cuts and must not affect future years."
"In the case of the Netherlands, the Commission has other concerns, such as the suitability of the policy mix and the risks associated with the fiscal incentive effects of the tax cuts in a situation of strong economic growth, which might lead to the Netherlands economy overheating."
"Our basic message is, therefore, that the margin for making tax cuts must be counterbalanced by strict public spending controls."
"This year, Germany and the Netherlands have gained substantial revenue through the sale of third generation mobile telephony licences."
"In the case of Germany, for instance, this represents 2.5% of GDP, and in the Netherlands 0.7% of GDP."
"Both countries have very consistently made proper use of this revenue by using it to reduce the national debt."
"Because of this factor and, more importantly, better budgetary positions and stronger economic growth, there will be a clear tendency for the proportions of national debt to fall over the coming years."
"This year, for instance, Germany hopes to bring this proportion down to the reference level of 60% of GDP, and the Netherlands hopes to bring it even lower than that this year."
"In the case of Finland, the national debt is already much lower than this target and is falling all the time."
"These trends in the national debt mean lower interest payments, which will, in turn, help provide the necessary framework for tax cuts, and in some cases for specific increases in public spending."
"One of the positive characteristics of the Netherlands programme, as I have said before, is the special attention it gives to the impact of the ageing of the population on the exchequer over the coming years."
"This is a problem which will also have to be faced to a greater or lesser extent in other Member States, as was emphasised at the latest meetings of Eurogroup and the Ecofin Council."
"Bearing in mind that costs will increase in the future, certain decisions will soon have to be made in order to contain them and ensure they can be managed in the long term."
"Based on its own programme, the Netherlands Government is to make important decisions on the use of its budget margins, and it would be appropriate if it used these resources to bring the national debt down more quickly, which would give it greater margins to face these problems in the future."
"The Finnish Government' s ambitious budgetary surplus targets are already motivated to a great extent by this ageing factor that I have mentioned."
"We also hope that the next updating of the German stability programme will pay more attention to this aspect, taking into account the impact of the pension reform that is now under way."
"Lastly, the Commission is delighted by the speed with which Germany, the Netherlands and Finland have presented their updated programmes."
"In the last two countries, the programmes were adopted at the same time as the budget proposals for the coming year, which in the Commission' s opinion is a more suitable practice than used to happen, when we received these updates after each country' s budget had been presented."
"This ensures that the annual budget decisions are made within a multiannual strategic framework and gives the Community institutions an up-to-date, overall view of each country' s economic situation based on the most recent data."
"The Commission therefore recommends that the remaining Member States that are still preparing their updates should follow this example, not this year, when unfortunately it can no longer happen, but in future years."
"These are the basic comments that I wished to make on the three programmes we present today."
"I am at your disposal for any additional comment, to listen to your opinions and to answer any questions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are grateful to you for your report on trends in net government borrowing in the European Union, Mr Solbes Mira."
"I believe that, overall, the message here is a positive one."
"When the Maastricht Treaty was drawn up, it was assumed that maximum permissible net government borrowing would be 3%."
"Today, taking the average for the euro area, it has dropped back to around 1%, and we are moving towards balanced budgets, that is to say very much in the right direction."
"Commissioner, does it not worry you that it appears that in Germany next year, instead of falling, net government borrowing will increase by a further 0.5%, despite the fact that income from UMTS licences this year has been like manna from heaven for Germany's finances?"
"We have noted that this development is taking place in the largest country in the euro area, whereas the Netherlands and Finland have already achieved what we are seeking, that is budget surpluses which enable excessive debt to be repaid."
"So let me ask you once again: does this not worry you?"
"I would like to stress once again that we in the Group of the European People's Party regard the independence of the European Central Bank, combined with consistent application of stability and growth factors, as being a fundamental requirement for price stability in Europe."
"Mr President, it is true, as I said before, that this is one of the points we highlighted in the case of Germany, in which there are two points of interest."
"First of all, the proceeds of the UMTS licences, as I said before, have been allocated to reducing the debt, so that the national debt is now practically down to the 60% level."
"For accounting reasons, the revenue from the third generation mobile licences also has to be included for reducing the deficit."
"For this reason, the budget result for the year 2000 in the case of Germany will give a surplus of one and a half per cent of GDP."
"If we deduct the revenue from mobile licences from this one and a half per cent, we are left with a 1% budget deficit, which is the figure we can use for the stability programme."
"Therefore, to answer your question, we will have a situation of a 1.4% deficit in 1999, a 1% deficit in 2000, and - as you rightly say - in 2001 the deficit will rise again to 1.5% instead of falling."
"Why does the Commission accept this increase in the deficit?"
"Basically, because of the positive impact that the tax measures may have in Germany."
"Germany has a higher than average tax burden."
"The set of tax measures adopted by Germany affects the supply side of the economy more than the demand side but will also have some effect on demand, and we believe it will allow the growth potential of the German economy to increase in the medium term."
"We therefore consider these measures to be positive, even though they mean a step backwards compared with the previous situation."
"Nevertheless - and we left this very explicitly set out in the programme - we are especially concerned about this backward step, and we are aware that such backward steps have to be made up later."
"Hence we must insist on the German Government taking special care when drawing up the working programmes for 2002, on increasing revenue and on cutting costs in order to achieve a reduction in the budget deficit again."
"According to the current programme, the budget deficit should drop to 1% in 2002 and 0.5% in 2003, and Germany should balance its budget in 2004."
"A little late and not quite as we would have liked, but in any case with enough margin not to have difficulties in the event of an economic crisis."
"Mr President, I too am heartened to see that public finances in the countries concerned are sound, but I have noticed that more and more people are becoming nervous about the situation regarding price stability in Europe."
"They state that, in one of the largest countries - which is also one of the most important countries for the European economy, namely Germany - there is a risk of jumping into something resembling overheating."
"I should like to hear your assessment of inflationary development in Germany and ask whether you think that inflation in the EU generally is cause for concern."
"When I mentioned overheating, I was referring more to the economies of the Netherlands and Finland than to the German economy."
"The overheating problem does not arise in Germany in the same way as it does in these other countries."
"There is no doubt at all that inflation is a worry."
"We must not forget that we have had a double setback in the last year, as a result of oil prices trebling in little more than a year."
"If we add to that the fall in the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, we have had an obvious setback in terms of inflation."
"As you know, at the moment we have an inflation figure of 2.8%, clearly higher than our target as defined by the Central Bank."
"Underlying inflation, however, is still only 1.4%, which means we can consider oil to be the basic and fundamental cause of this situation."
"What are our inflation prospects?"
"I shall be able to comment on this in more detail after the 22nd, when we present our economic perspective for the coming year, but according to our initial estimates, in 2000 we shall end up with an average level of inflation a little above the inflation target laid down by the Central Bank, but clearly higher than what we had forecast in our April perspective - we had talked of 1.8% then."
"In 2001 it will be higher than the forecast we had also made in the spring, which was also about 1.8 or 1.7%."
"The average will, however, be much closer to 2%, which, as I have said, is the target of the Central Bank' s monetary policy."
"All this will, of course, happen if we do not have any new surprises with oil prices or the dollar exchange rate."
"Commissioner, you rightly - in my opinion - placed great emphasis in your speech on the problem represented by the ageing population, both for the three countries in question and all the other European countries as well, and you touched upon the need to tackle the issue of the ageing population and therefore the question of the pension deficit, which is an unknown quantity weighing heavily upon the public finances of the European countries, hindering recovery, and it will do so increasingly in the future."
"In last July's publication, the European Central Bank indicated a way, in the social security plans reform - that is, moving from the current ""Pay-as-you-go"" system to a funded system for mandatory contributions as well - of freeing up resources and, in perspective, ensuring the sustainability of European social security plans."
"I would like to know, Commissioner, whether the Commission can tell us anything about this."
"Mr President, thank you, Mr Della Vedova."
"The Commission brought up the issue at the time and the Lisbon European Council accepted the need to analyse in depth the problem of the ageing of the population in Europe."
"In fact, with the Commission' s cooperation, the Economic Policy Committee has been working on this topic for the last few months."
"At the last Ecofin council meeting, a report by the Economic Policy Committee was presented which, in general terms, highlighted the fact that there is a problem of ageing in general in Europe, but not exactly the same in all countries."
"There are very important differences in countries such as Ireland, for instance, which has a very young population and which still has room for an increase in the activity rate compared with countries with higher activity rates and older populations."
"The report emphasises the fact that the reforms carried out so far in the social security systems are helping to improve the situation."
"It also emphasises that national debt reductions, insofar as they can reduce future deficits, may help to resolve the situation."
"In the medium term, I can tell you that the situation over the next twenty years will vary from country to country, but it will mean an extra 2% to 7% increase in government deficit, depending on the characteristics of each country."
"Nonetheless, these two elements will not be enough to deal with the problem."
"As for the solution that can be adopted, it will, of course, be a national decision to be made in each of the Member States; the Commission will not make any proposals in this regard."
"At the moment the impression I have is that the formulas being used in the various Member States are moving in three directions."
"First they are moving towards a search for some system for financing the pay-as-you-go schemes, which may mean some element of pre-funding;"
"I mentioned the Dutch system before, which already has obvious pre-funding elements."
"They are also moving towards making a public pay-as-you-go scheme compatible with private pre-funding schemes, and of course they are also compatible with support for the setting up of specific investment funds, which may obtain long-term tax advantages and may help to deal with the ageing problem."
"But, in the end, it will be each Member State' s own decision that prevails, because, as I have said before, this matter is the responsibility of each one of them."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"BSE and general ban on animal meal in feedingstuffs"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on BSE and the general ban on animal meal in feedingstuffs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you asked to hear, on the occasion of this plenary sitting, from the Presidency about the current situation, in France and in Europe, with regard to the prevention of, and the fight against, mad cow disease."
"As you know, yesterday the French Government adopted national measures to strengthen health safety, including the suspension of the use of animal meal in feed for pigs and poultry."
"I was with the Prime Minister, Mr Jospin, when he announced this action plan."
"The Council of the European Union is also playing an active role, in concert with the European Parliament and the European Commission, in updating and constantly reinforcing Europe' s raft of measures to prevent and combat this disease."
"I understand that you wanted me to address you today regarding these two aspects, in other words, the state of play in the fight against BSE in Europe and related developments in France."
"I will therefore start by confirming the raft of measures adopted by the French Government yesterday, and I will then talk about the initiatives taken by the Presidency, and the Community developments that are underway."
"It is important to take stock of the situation with regard to the fight against BSE in the broader context of food safety developments in Europe."
"Yesterday, then, in Paris, the French Government announced an intensification of national health safety measures."
"This action plan places public health and transparency at the top of the agenda, this being a requirement of the French Government."
"Faced with a situation of uncertainty in the event of a potential major risk to public health, all decisions necessary to protect health must be taken and constantly reassessed in the light of developments in scientific knowledge and opinion."
"This is thus our third guiding principle: the precautionary principle."
"An additional stage in protecting public health seems to be necessary."
"Two facts have increased concerns about meal of animal origin in animal feed."
"Firstly, the emergence of cases of BSE in cattle born after the ban on animal meal was imposed."
"The hypothesis of the accidental or fraudulent cross contamination of these animals by meal of animal origin has been put forward."
"Secondly, a report released earlier this month by the UK Government enabled us to take stock of the difficulties of controlling and using this type of meal."
"It is necessary to add that, over and above the health issues, animal meal is seen by the consumer as a symbol of the abuses of a certain method of agricultural production which has been in operation for 40 years. This method has guaranteed the supply of foodstuffs at low cost but its limitations have since been exposed and it has been called into question over the last few years."
"That is why the French Government decided to suspend the use of meat-and-bone meal in feed for pigs, poultry, fish and domestic animals."
"Only fish meal can continue to be given to fish."
"Meanwhile, the French Food Safety Agency is carrying out new scientific research into the possible health risks linked to meat-and-bone meal in the light of the progress of knowledge and the efficacy of safety measures."
"In parallel, the French Government is taking steps to withdraw specified risk materials from the food chain."
"In accordance with recent scientific recommendations, it has decided to enforce the removal of the spinal cord."
"Following a suggestion from the independent scientific assessment agency, AFSSA (the French Food Safety Agency), a decision was taken to ban beef on the bone."
"The spinal cords of cattle will also be excluded from the production of gelatine and tallow and the entire organisation of animal slaughter will be re-examined in such a way as to make the cutting up of carcasses even safer."
"The methods of control will be strengthened along the entire food chain."
"France has embarked upon an important programme of some 48 000 tests to be carried out on cattle populations deemed to be at high risk, 8 000 of which also come under the Community programme."
"The decision has been taken to extend this programme to cover the whole of the territory of France."
"Tests will also be carried out on a random basis on cattle entering the food chain."
"We propose that the Commission and the European Union should thus undertake to extend these tests at a European level, in the light of scientific recommendations."
"A specific concern is the human form of the disease and the care that is provided."
"A programme to encourage disinfection and sterilisation within hospitals and to reinforce measures for the use of single-use material will be put in place very quickly."
"A reassessment of the precautionary and safety measures regarding the production and use of blood products is underway."
"Special attention will be paid to hygiene and safety conditions for workers in the facilities concerned."
"The progress of research is a crucial factor in improving our knowledge of BSE as well as in its prevention and treatment."
"That is why the efforts that have been made since 1997 in terms of research will be extended and broadened."
"The current unpopularity of beef consumption is reflected in a significant imbalance in the market."
"Tools to support the beef industry in tackling this crisis must be implemented."
"France has asked that the situation of the beef market be included on the agenda of the Agriculture Council, which will take place in Brussels on 20 and 21 November."
"In the interim, it has called for the implementation of the private storage measure provided for by the COM for beef."
"The intervention measure cannot exclude the possibility of going much further and of determining whether the production of oil seeds in Europe can be stepped up."
"This national action plan, which was announced by Prime Minister Jospin yesterday in Paris, resulted from the fact that food safety is a legitimate concern of consumers. It is also a constant inspiration to the government, which will continue to act with determined vigilance to ensure that it is guaranteed."
"We are convinced that this concern is fully shared by all the European institutions, whether it be the European Parliament, Madam President, the Commission or the Council. As a result it must be put squarely at the top of the European agenda."
"This very day in Brussels, the experts on the Standing Veterinary Committee at the European Commission have been meeting with a view to preparing ways of extending the European programme for carrying out screening tests on cattle."
"This meeting of veterinary experts at the Commission is especially useful in the run-up to the next Agriculture Council, which will take place on 20 and 21 November under the chairmanship of my fellow Minister, Jean Glavany."
"This meeting will compare experiences and approaches with regard to the test programme, the ban on animal meal and other measures that might be reinforced at a European level."
"The results of this first debate will be presented to the Council on 20 November."
"The key issue is to restore the confidence of European consumers in beef."
"The Presidency has also planned to hold, during the same meeting, an open debate on food safety on the basis of work in progress, current developments regarding the crisis and recent proposals from the Commission on hygiene and food law, particularly on setting up a European Food Agency."
"It should be recalled that a number of proposed regulations are under discussion, which will reinforce the effectiveness and the relevance of the raft of Community measures and shall thereby, I hope, restore consumer confidence."
"I am reminded that a framework programme on the fight against TSEs is currently being examined by the Council with a view to an agreement being adopted at the Agriculture Council in December."
"The primary objective of this text is to establish the legal base making it possible, by means of a single text, to implement practically all the epidemiological and monitoring measures, health policy and the ban on specified risk materials, as well as measures relating to the introduction on the market, the exchange, importation and exportation of live animals and their products."
"All these measures relate to BSE in both cattle and sheep and to scrapie in small ruminants."
"The scope of these measures covers human and animal feed: the other aspects of the problem of the TSEs will be dealt with under other legal headings (medicines, cosmetics and others)."
"By the same token, the Commission has put forward measures on food hygiene, which are under examination both in the Council and in Parliament."
"The Commission' s very recent proposal on food law and the setting up of a European Food Agency will be debated extensively during the Internal Market, Consumers and Tourism Council to be held on 30 November, which I will be chairing, with a view to devising guidelines for the operation of this agency."
"I believe that the open debate on food safety, which will be held next week during the Agriculture Council, will clearly show, among other things, that scientific research is a cornerstone of the European raft of measures on food safety."
"The European Parliament recently took up a position on the Commission White Paper, which foreshadows the establishment of this agency."
"I am sure that your parliamentary calendar will take full account of the need to move ahead more quickly so that, as suggested by the Commission, we can have a European Food Agency by 2002."
"As soon as this proposal to set up the European Food Agency was presented by the Commission on 8 November, the Presidency enlisted the work of the Council."
"Two meetings of the Council group were held on 9 and 14 November to prepare the general debate, which will take place on 30 November in the Council."
"The role of the European Food Agency will be mainly to express high-quality, independent scientific opinions on all issues having a direct or indirect impact on the health of consumers and arising from the consumption of food to cover all the stages of primary production right up to the final consumer."
"The European Food Agency will also provide clear and accessible information on issues arising out of its mandate."
"As a result, effectiveness, independence and transparency will be the key principles guiding the assessment of food risks in Europe."
"Madam President, I am glad of the opportunity to update you on the latest developments in the on-going crisis in relation to BSE."
"I had already anticipated addressing you on the Phillips report released earlier this month by the UK Government."
"However, events in France over the past week clearly call for an earlier discussion of these events."
"Only the dangerously complacent or naïve could assume that we have safely put the BSE crisis behind us."
"Once more we are reminded that BSE is not an historic event, but a real and present danger."
"There has been a worrying increase in the number of cases of BSE detected in France over the past year, in part due to the introduction of targeted testing."
"Moreover, the marketing of beef from a herd found to be harbouring a clinical case of BSE ignited public fears over the adequacy of controls to protect public health."
"Clearly, we need to look at these developments and draw the appropriate lessons."
"That process must begin with a look at the facts."
"The current incidence in France is of the order of 7 cases per million cattle aged over two years."
"This falls far short of the international criterion of 100 cases per million used to define high incident countries."
"However, this relatively low incidence is no reason for complacency."
"The fact is that the incidence is rising in several Member States."
"In the absence of clear and transparent evidence that the incidence of BSE is falling in all Member States, we must remain extremely vigilant."
"More importantly, we must learn from this latest experience."
"Let me briefly outline my main observations in this respect."
"First, the increased incidence of BSE in France is, in large part, due to the introduction of random testing by the French authorities."
"This follows from a Commission decision requiring all Member States to introduce such testing by 1 January 2001."
"All Member States should follow the French example."
"Second, the absolute necessity for the implementation of rigid controls on BSE cannot be over-emphasised."
"The fact is that there is a battery of controls provided by legislation."
"If these controls are respected and implemented, the risk to the public is reduced to a minimum."
"I will return to this point later."
"Third, we must have total transparency in our approach towards BSE."
"The consumer reaction to BSE has been variously described as a psychosis, irrational or driven by panic."
"A lack of clarity and transparency in addressing the issue has contributed hugely to this unfortunate situation."
"Finally, we must not overlook the huge progress in recent years, in the past year in particular, in putting in place a framework to tackle BSE."
"In the process, we have also begun the task of ensuring that EU systems are in place to avoid similar tragedies in the future."
"I was, frankly, disappointed that there was no acknowledgement in Prime Minister Jospin's statement yesterday of the hugely positive role played by the Community in recent years."
"Inspired by this Parliament, the Commission has been the driving force in pressing for the adoption of measures to eradicate BSE."
"And this was done notwithstanding the frequent lack of support in Member States."
"This work is not complete."
"Important proposals, for example, on animal waste and on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are currently before the Council and Parliament."
"The proposal adopted by the Commission last week on the establishment of a European Food Authority is an even more significant initiative."
"We must not allow recent events to undermine this progress."
"I expect a strong endorsement of the Commission's proposals on the Food Authority from the European Council in Nice - and I note what you, Madam President, said on that issue only very recently."
"Parliament can equally signal its commitment to the proposal by giving it the highest priority with a view to its adoption in the shortest possible time."
"Returning to the issue in hand, the events of the past few weeks already call for a response."
"The Commission view that targeted testing is essential in establishing a true picture of the real incidence of BSE in the Community has been fully vindicated by the test results in France."
"However, it is necessary to put in place such tests on a much larger scale."
"The public needs reassurance that the controls already in place are effective."
"Extensive testing now appears to be the most effective means of providing such reassurance."
"The Commission intends to put proposals to the Agriculture Council on Monday next, which will fully answer public demands in this respect."
"The European Parliament has been a consistent and strong supporter of such testing and I count on your support for the Commission's approach."
"The implications of recent events for the Community measures on meat-and-bone meal are also at issue."
"Clearly, explanations are necessary for the increased incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States."
"Time and again the finger of blame points in the direction of contaminated meat-and-bone meal."
"France decided, yesterday, to ban meat-and-bone meal on a provisional basis."
"I look forward to the forthcoming opinion of AFSSA, the French Food Safety Agency, which will help inform the decision of the French Authorities on whether this provisional measure needs to be continued."
"The evidence still strongly suggests that the increased incidence in some Member States has its origin in the period before the introduction of reinforced controls in 1996 and subsequently."
"And it is certainly the case that the current controls are very strict."
"For instance: there is a ban on the feeding of mammalian meat-and-bone meal to ruminants, notably cattle."
"Meat-and-bone meal must be processed, that is, pressure cooked, to very high standards."
"Specified risk materials must be removed and destroyed."
"Active surveillance measures, including random testing, are in progress to prevent cases of BSE from entering the food and feed chains."
"However, these controls can only be effective if properly implemented."
"Many inspections by the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office point to weaknesses in the implementation of these controls."
"In some cases, the follow-up to these reports in Member States is not taken with the seriousness which it deserves."
"This, frankly, is unacceptable."
"It is unacceptable on public health grounds."
"It is also foolhardy, as the alternative to these controls leads towards an outright ban on meat-and-bone meal with the attendant huge financial and environmental consequences."
"Public health and financial considerations, therefore, both argue for strict implementation."
"The Commission, for its part, will continue to impress on Member States the importance of this issue."
"The Commission's Food and Veterinary Office already affords top priority to Member States' controls in relation to protective measures against BSE."
"I am asking the Food and Veterinary Office to carry out once more a fundamental and thorough inspection in the Member States in this respect."
"For example, the requirement to remove and destroy SRMs only entered into force from 1 October 2000 and I want urgent on-the-ground confirmation that this requirement is being enforced."
"Parliament's assistance in this respect would also be most welcome in alerting the public in the Member States to the importance of these controls."
"Moreover, there is currently a major proposal before Parliament and the Council for a regulation on animal waste."
"This proposal provides the opportunity for putting in place a comprehensive framework to ensure that all the relevant issues relating to animal waste are addressed."
"Again, I hope to work with Parliament in putting this proposal on the statute book as a matter of urgency."
"A number of speakers have raised the issue of a total ban on meat-and-bone meal."
"Let me add a few comments on what I said earlier in this respect."
"In the situation confronting us it is always tempting to look to a magic solution, a solution which can, in one step, both eliminate risk and restore confidence."
"I have gone on record in stating that I will be fully transparent with consumers."
"This includes in my view the responsibility not to mislead them into believing that there are magic solutions to a very difficult problem."
"A total ban on meat-and-bone meal is an example of this."
"My only concern in relation to the use of meat-and-bone meal is whether it is safe or not to use in animal feed."
"I leave it to others to make the economic and environmental case for its continued use."
"In relation to its safety, let me repeat that there is an extensive range of controls already in place to ensure that MBM does not pose a threat of transmission of BSE."
"It may be that MBM cannot be fed to ruminants and I have said this already."
"The scientific advice is that MBM produced under these conditions is not a danger."
"This Parliament also accepts that there is a place for meat-and-bone meal produced under safe conditions."
"Parliament acknowledged that in its report on BSE in 1997 and I quote: ""The recycling of carcasses and slaughter waste by the production of meat-and-bone meal for animal feed offers the best alternative on economic, environmental and health policy grounds""."
"As I stated earlier, however, the safe use of meat-and-bone meal is conditional on the required controls being respected and implemented in full."
"If there is a weakness in the controls, clearly there is a problem."
"I am insisting, once more, that all Member States accept their responsibilities in this respect."
"The Commission's Food and Veterinary Office will redouble its efforts to ensure that Member States respect their obligations."
"I would add that if the French decision to ban meat-and-bone meal is motivated by fears over the adequacy of their controls it is a decision I fully endorse."
"I welcome in this respect that Prime Minister Jospin yesterday also announced a substantial strengthening of controls on the food chain including a big increase in staff."
"I will be asking Member States on Monday if there are concerns that weaknesses in the implementation of controls over the past several years, in contravention of the Community legislation in the matter, are a factor in the current increased incidence of BSE."
"Finally, Madam President, I would add that the Commission has recently presented a proposal to Parliament under codecision for a regulation on animal waste."
"This proposal aims at putting in place a Community framework which will address all relevant issues governing the treatment of animal waste, especially its use in animal feed."
"It is notable that in the discussions that have taken place already on this proposal with the Member States, a ban on the feeding of meat-and-bone meal to animals has not been suggested as a necessary measure."
"By that I mean a total ban."
"Instead, the consensus view is that the Community must ensure that only material from animals fit for human consumption should be used in the production of meat-and-bone meal."
"It remains to be seen if this changes in the light of current events."
"Let me recall, Madam President, in this respect that I succeeded only five months ago in securing the Council's agreement to a ban on the use of specified risk materials in the food and feed chains."
"Yes, difficult as it may be to believe, it took four years to agree a measure which I consider to be fundamental to public health protection."
"The obstacles in securing support for a ban on meat-and-bone meal should be viewed in this light."
"Let me assure you, however, that if and when I consider that a ban on the feeding of meat-and-bone meal to all animals is a necessary measure to protect public health, I will present such a proposal irrespective of the obstacles."
"Parliament itself now has its opportunity to shape decisively the future direction of policy towards waste at Community level."
"All options are open in this proposal on animal waste including a total ban, if thought necessary."
"I await your report and suggested amendments and assure you of my full cooperation for suggested improvements."
"Madam President, the fact is that we would not have needed today's debate at all if all the Member States had immediately and fully implemented the requirements of the BSE Temporary Committee of Inquiry into BSE and the BSE follow-up committee of February and November 1997."
"I am also willing to concede that the Commission, no doubt because of enormous pressure from the European Parliament, has made great progress in recent years in gaining acceptance for the principle of precautionary consumer protection."
"But implementation by the Member States has still been too slow."
"Surely it is possible both to act quickly and to do the job properly."
"The public cannot understand why our legislative process is so slow in times of crisis."
"That is also why I wish to say here that the Commission must have powers at such times of crisis to take more rapid decisions in relation to infringements of Community law or when there is an imminent risk of such infringement, and that it should be in a position to take action in the public interest or if public health is threatened."
"I also wish to say that there must be solid grounds for bans within the single market."
"The measures that have been agreed for animal identification and meat labelling will provide an important basis for consumer safety and confidence."
"It is always better to tackle the root of a problem than to indulge in populism."
"It is time we all finally escaped from this vicious cycle of speculation and mutual recrimination, in which BSE now seems to stand for ""Blame Somebody Else""!"
"That is why I specifically support the joint motion for a resolution calling on us to leave behind this atmosphere of suspicion and universally introduce rapid testing methods for BSE not only for animals affected, not only for animals over 18 months, but for all animals involved in the food chain, if at all possible."
"(Applause)"
"This will give us a basis for more extensive and objective criteria for assessing the risk of BSE or the absence of BSE in Member States and allow us to take new and more far-reaching decisions."
"Mr President-in-Office, I specifically call on the Council to make known its opinion on the TSE regulation."
"(Applause)"
"We completed the first reading in May."
"It is a scandal, if BSE is causally related with scrapie, that there is still no joint preventative legislation."
"Indeed, France has the right to ban animal meal for reasons of domestic policy."
"But what may be right for France in this situation is not necessarily right for all Member States."
"It is good that in this respect we are adhering to the joint decisions adopted in 1997, as Mr Byrne explained."
"A recycling system that functions well in part has been ruined because safety factors have been disregarded."
"I shall be quite open about this: what we will be calling for in the motion for a resolution tomorrow - a temporary general ban on the production and use of animal meal in feedingstuffs until all criteria relating to standards and safe origins have been met, together with the implementation of the Commission proposal to eliminate affected animals for good - is hard for many Member States, but we are going along with it because without society's backing we will have problems in the long run."
"However, it must also be possible to use animal parts approved for human consumption in animal feed as well in the future."
"We also need to think about the budget."
"A BSE test for all animals cofinanced by the Community would cost EUR 130 million."
"Reserves also need to be earmarked in case redevelopment measures should be necessary."
"With that in mind we will also use the trialogue and the budget concertation process with the Commission and the Council to ensure that the Commission's rectifying letter for the 2001 budget is also amended with a view to making the necessary provisions."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I have lost count of how many times we have discussed this over the last four years and of how often I have spoken on this subject."
"I particularly admire your courage, Mr President-in-Office, in coming here today, because I am sure that apart from the rhetorical boxing round the ears you have received from Mr Böge, you will also be on the receiving end of some other harsh words as a stand-in - and I wish to make that point clear - for your fellow Members of the Council of Ministers."
"We have brought in legislation, starting with our exposure of the BSE scandal, which, for years, the Council wanted to sweep under the carpet."
"We have produced excellent legislation."
"Let me mention some examples for you: the ban on feeding animal meal to ruminants, animal meal production methods and the removal of risk materials."
"Where was the Council when this legislation had to be implemented?"
"How long did the Commission have to put up with getting a bloody nose in the Council of Ministers before the removal of risk materials was legislated on?"
"Why did this Council, which attaches so much importance to consumer protection and which now acts as if public health were its top priority, not act earlier and say that this could also be achieved without legislation?"
"You, Mr President-in-Office, and all your colleagues would have been in a position to take appropriate measures in the Member States long before the Commission, unfortunately somewhat belatedly, brought forward its proposal to process only those animal parts suitable for human consumption into animal meal."
"This could have been a Council initiative."
"I really wonder why we had to do battle with the Council about beef labelling in the European Court of Justice."
"Was that necessary?"
"I also wish to ask you, Mr President-in-Office, in relation to your reference to France's policy, why it has taken France so long to transpose the legislation on animal meal manufacturing methods?"
"I fail to understand that."
"Nor can I understand why France could not transpose the provisions on the pressure, temperature and heating time for the production of animal meal more quickly."
"As Mr Böge has already said - he and I were rapporteurs for the TSE regulation - we had our first reading on 17 May."
"Where is the Council common position, if this is so important?"
"Excuse me, Mr President-in-Office, if I make a rather heretical assumption, namely that you personally are certainly very interested in public health and in consumer health, but time and again I cannot help feeling that the Council considers market organisation and economic aspects to be much more compelling."
"And the moment, as you would put it, public hysteria breaks out, there is immediate concern about beef markets collapsing."
"Then you react."
"I would say to you with one small reservation, Mr President-in-Office, that I am very interested to know when those countries which have today agreed a universal ban on animal meal in feedingstuffs will open the door again by saying that animal meal is now being produced safely and we can feed it to animals once more."
"But I shall be very calm and wait for you to tell me something new here."
"I will tell you exactly what we need, ladies and gentlemen - we need two things."
"The first is good legislation."
"We have already put large parts of this in place, and we are trying to take this further, and we need to act quickly."
"It is up to you to deliver this legislation quickly."
"Up to now the Council has acted as a very major brake on this."
"All 15 Members of the Council have dragged their feet."
"And I can tell you that worked very well, it was very effective."
"Once we have good legislation we need controls."
"That is why I am very grateful that our joint motion for a resolution, which I hope will be adopted almost unanimously tomorrow, contains a requirement for the Member States to report on their controls."
"I would like to know when Germany, France, Sweden, Austria and all the other countries have carried out health checks on the production of animal feed, and when veterinary checks have been carried out, and how many poor overworked veterinary officers there are, and whether you are recruiting any new ones at all."
"If you are serious about all this, then you do not need a token Food Authority, which might prepare legislation on food safety, but which is not in a position to deliver what we can: good legislation and controls."
"That is your job, Mr President-in-Office."
"Madam President, I would be delighted if this were to be my last speech on this subject in this House, because we really must get this sorted out sooner or later!"
"Madam President, France' s ban on animal meal in feedingstuffs came far too late."
"In this situation, the only way to break the cycle of BSE infection is to place a complete ban on the use of animal meal as feed."
"As long as it cannot be guaranteed that meal from deceased animals is not being mixed with animal meal that is free from infection, then all animal meal must be banned for use as feed."
"One must not be wise after the event, but I find it extremely difficult in this debate not to think back to the beginning of the Nineties when, as the Swedish person responsible for the agricultural negotiations, I was forced to negotiate an opt-out because we in Sweden had a ban on the use of meal from deceased animals."
"We only just managed to obtain such an opt-out, but we managed it, even if we were laughed at to some extent and told that there was, of course, no danger."
"Now, no one is laughing any more."
"That was, in actual fact, how it was, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"You mentioned, of course, that a faulty production method was to blame and that it is for this reason that animal meal has been banned in France."
"That was why we, back home in Sweden, banned it a long time ago."
"It appeared that faulty is precisely what these production methods are, and they must be opposed from the beginning."
"I want to emphasise a further couple of points."
"In the resolution that I hope will be voted through tomorrow, there are some very important points."
"The first is that it must be possible to trace every raw material in every type of food back through the chain."
"In a situation such as that which has now arisen in France, and also earlier on in many other countries, it is important to be able to tell consumers where the products they buy come from and how their origins can be traced."
"This is an extremely important requirement, especially where the specific issue of BSE is concerned."
"Secondly, it is important to emphasise - and this is not some new idea - that anyone who consciously allows an animal that is sick, or that is suspected of being sick, to enter the food or feed chain is committing a criminal offence."
"Every food producer must be aware of this fact."
"Clearly, many people suffer, of course, in this situation, especially many farmers."
"In certain circumstances, it is necessary to slaughter the entire stock of animals, which must come as a real blow."
"It is also important to remember that the national systems for eradicating this terrible infection must include measures which properly compensate farmers for the financial losses they suffer in this connection."
"On this subject, I want to point out that those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party have tabled an amendment I hope will be voted through."
"In conclusion, I just want to thank Commissioner Byrne, who I think is doing a good job on this issue."
"Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission and the European Parliament have a duty to react in the face of the concern of consumers and European farmers over food safety."
"The BSE crisis is now a public health problem, if not a problem of society."
"The Commission and the Council are unable to respond satisfactorily, with their hands on their hearts and the precautionary principle on their lips, at the same time confining themselves to an acute mania for meetings and to vague decisions."
"Countless measures may have been taken at a Community level, but they are either badly implemented or simply inadequate."
"We must move on to practical proposals and provide the necessary resources to implement them."
"As a first step, our group is calling for the immediate imposition of systematic testing for BSE throughout the European Union and, at the same time, for the use of MBMs in animal feed to be completely suspended on a temporary basis."
"Today, Mr Böge, those who are claiming they have no incidence of mad cow disease on their territory are those who are not looking for it."
"The practices of intensive farming have been the same everywhere."
"So we must have an exact overview of the situation, country by country."
"Our group is calling for an immediate ban on MBMs for all livestock as long as Member States are unable to guarantee the implementation of laws preventing BSE and the strict application of European directives."
"Commissioner, Minister, we must have strict controls in order to guarantee that specified risk materials are separated out throughout the entire animal food chain."
"The Commission proposal to eliminate animal matter which cannot be consumed by humans from animal feed must also be implemented."
"MBMs which largely become, even if only temporarily, a new form of waste may be burnt in cement kilns or used to produce biogas."
"Replacement solutions exist as far as feed for livestock is concerned. MBMs make up but a small percentage of their diet, a fact we often forget."
"The grass in our meadows, white clover and vetch - currently neglected by the CAP - may provide satisfactory solutions for the safety of animal feed and human food."
"It is possible to save livestock production by reforming an agricultural economic system which, even today, makes farmers and consumers hostages to multinationals that are more interested in profit than in food safety."
"Policies must change this situation so that those who are really responsible for this crisis can be penalised and so that precise decisions can make it possible for a first step to be taken towards ending this tragic crisis."
"This is the thrust of the joint resolution."
"It is a heavy responsibility, but we were elected to take it on in full."
"Madam President, I believe that the BSE crisis that broke out in 1996 has revealed the extent to which ultraliberalism can lead to the health of consumers and the interests of livestock producers being sacrificed."
"The work of this Parliament' s committee of enquiry contributed to the application of measures to protect consumer health: in particular by banning animal meal for cattle and through the compulsory labelling of beef."
"But fraud, negligence and the lack of adequate measures mean that the BSE crisis is still not under control, since new cases are being discovered all the time."
"Without becoming paranoid, we must recognise that the consumers' concern is perfectly legitimate."
"My group believes that the health of consumers is an imperative which should have overriding priority over all other considerations."
"It is therefore urgent that measures are taken to reassure consumers and to restore their confidence in food safety."
"I do not know if this is a panacea, Commissioner but, in line with the precautionary principle, it seems to me that experience behoves us to ban, as of today, the use of animal meal in feed for livestock, including pigs, poultry and fish."
"Detection tests must also be extended to all cattle entering the human food chain."
"The current crisis has led to a significant slump in sales and to a fall in prices, which are hurting livestock producers and all those involved in the beef sector."
"It is necessary both to restore consumer confidence and to help the livestock producers affected by the crisis."
"Selective aid, such as market support and a grass subsidy, are essential."
"But, beyond the immediate future, should we not be reflecting on the mechanisms of the CAP?"
"Are these not the very mechanisms which are at the root of the problem?"
"They have contributed to overly intensive production, which has harmed the environment and the quality of farm products."
"They therefore need to be reviewed."
"Perhaps it would be no bad thing if animals returned to traditional fodder."
"I feel like saying, ""Yes, let them have a bit more grass."""
"But the European Union must also encourage the production of oil seeds so that animal meal can be replaced by vegetable meal."
"To achieve this, there would have to be a re-examination of the 1993 GATT agreement, which prohibits the European Union producing more than 25% of its vegetable protein requirements so as to satisfy US exports."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the BSE crisis has turned into a case of collective paranoia."
"The justified mistrust of consumers threatens the entire beef sector and the spectre of ruin haunts our livestock producers and small artisanal enterprises."
"This has come to pass because the incompetence of governments has been aggravated by our own inability to respond to the twofold challenge before us: the health challenge and the economic challenge."
"I will not detail the horrors that have been committed on all sides."
"I find the debate that is underway in this Chamber, which consists in finding out which institution out of the Council, the Commission or Parliament has done the most and which the least, rather unnecessary."
"The reality is something else."
"The facts stand, and they are appalling."
"We were aware of the dangers of animal meal, we were aware of the dangers of specified risk materials."
"The scientific authorities clearly stated that the development of the disease in cattle was not under control and they pinpointed the alarming growth in the numbers of animals affected."
"I believe that the Commission has failed miserably."
"The labelling of beef that was agreed on, which is a minimum form of labelling and only came into force two and a half months ago, does not make it possible for the origin of animals to be adequately traced, and we were very slow to ban specified risk materials."
"The management of the crisis has been terribly poor, and there were tragic shortcomings in our ability to anticipate the foreseeable consequences of the crisis."
"Where are the programmes to reduce the deficit of proteins in the European Union, to which reference was made a few moments ago? Where are the programmes to incinerate animal meal and animal waste and to implement obligatory testing throughout the European Union?"
"The truth is that this is a problem affecting the European Union as a whole, not just a single country."
"The truth is that food quality has been sacrificed on the altar of productivity, the standardisation of lifestyles and flavourless products."
"Consumers used to have doubts about quality; today they worry about their own health."
"Our citizens know - because we cannot lie to people with impunity - that the crisis is serious."
"They know that if we are discovering sick animals in France, it is because we are looking for them, as was said earlier."
"We need far-reaching measures to be adopted at a national and European level if we want to avoid economic bankruptcy and a major health scare."
"We need to adopt the proposals put forward by the President-in-Office of the European Council, especially those banning animal meal in feed in all sectors of animal production."
"But we also need two additional, comprehensive plans, and I am calling for their immediate implementation, because any delay through hesitation would exacerbate the health and economic risks."
"The measures adopted by the French Government in this regard are, as I said, inadequate."
"Firstly, as others have said before me, we must have systematic screening of all cattle slaughtered for consumption by European citizens."
"For more than a year, the European authorities have been examining three screening tests, including the French test, which is deemed to be the most reliable and the most sensitive."
"This test can be developed on an industrial scale very quickly."
"It has to be done, without hesitation and without delay, and on a massive scale."
"Just now, I heard reference being made to random tests."
"Random tests are not going to restore consumer confidence, or producer confidence for that matter."
"Public opinion must be fully informed of the characteristics of the test I am talking about."
"The French screening test for BSE was developed at the CEA (a public-sector research institute)."
"In June it was assessed by Directorate General 24 of the European Commission, which is responsible for consumer protection, and, in July 1999, it was transferred to an industrial partner."
"This test was developed with a view to protecting the consumer, so that it could be extensively used in slaughterhouses, thus preventing animals dangerous to human health entering the food chain."
"The results of the European assessment, which were published in July 1999, suggest that it is 10 to 300 times more sensitive than the three other tests assessed at the same time."
"A new study undertaken in September 2000 has been evaluated by the European Commission."
"It confirms the preceding results in terms of sensitivity."
"The sensitivity of this test guarantees that contaminated animals cannot possibly enter the food chain."
"The result of the examination can be obtained within 5 hours, and the test can be made widely available, as hundreds of millions of samples a year can be produced easily."
"Its immediate widespread use in the veterinary laboratories of the French departments would simply require the allocation of sufficient human resources until it can be automated."
"The test exists, it is reliable, and it can be carried out on a massive scale."
"I hope I have convinced you that it needs to be done."
"Secondly, Community farming needs to be reorganised to put our set-aside lands back into production so that we can grow soya, alfalfa and peas, which will give us the replacement proteins we are lacking and which will feed our animals much better than American GMOs."
"We sacrificed our soya, alfalfa and peas in the course of the COM negotiations in Marrakech."
"Well, the thing with poor agreements is that they should be challenged, especially when public health dictates this."
"By displaying courage and ambition, we can combine the health interests of Europeans and the economic interests of our producers, and thereby restore confidence."
"This will only be possible if there is no longer any doubt in the public mind, in other words, if screening is, as I would insist, systematic."
"Unless there is mandatory general testing, confidence will not be restored, for confidence cannot be restored by decree; it has to be earned."
"These are the reasons why my group has signed the motion for a resolution which will be presented to this House tomorrow, which, I hope, will be adopted with, if not a unanimous vote, at least a very large majority, so that everybody can be made aware that this Parliament is in direct touch with the problems affecting European citizens."
"(Applause from the UEN Group)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to take this opportunity to denounce the scandalous eviction from this Chamber of our colleague, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who would have been able to remind us that the group representing the European right-wing parties was the first, by a long chalk, to reveal to this House, in September 1990, that the pathogenic agent for BSE was able to jump species and to spread to humans."
"What were the reactions at the time?"
"Nothing but sarcastic comments and criticisms came from these benches and from the political class while the media maintained a scornful silence."
"Back then, Mr President-in-Office, you did virtually nothing, just as your colleagues have done virtually nothing about the fallout from Chernobyl, the AIDS epidemic or contaminated blood, and always for the same reason: so as not to panic public opinion."
"The former Commissioner, Mr MacSharry, justified this criminal silence by claiming that the beef sector must not be put at risk and that consumers must not be panicked."
"Now, we are faced with a health and economic catastrophe of unparalleled proportions causing widespread panic amongst consumers."
"In the face of predictable reactions from the public, you hastily pronounce a ban on animal meal for all animals, in line with the infamous precautionary principle."
"Despite the opinion of experts and scientists, who had shown that these MBMs were behind the development and transmission of the pathogenic agent for BSE, you forget to mention in your analysis that the situation is first and foremost due to Anglo-Saxon meal producers who, for commercial reasons, lowered the cooking temperature for MBMs."
"Mr President-in-Office, you also fail to mention that France continued to import possibly contaminated MBMs from the UK after 1989, the year in which they were banned, especially via Belgium."
"The result is a reflection of the impotence of the political class. There have been almost a hundred cases of BSE in France in 2000 and, so far, 80 people have died from variant CJD in the UK and two in France."
"Minister, Commissioner, why has it been necessary to wait until 1 October 2000 before banning the specified risk materials in the European Union, even though they are highly infectious?"
"Why wait until 1 January 2001 before bringing in the rapid screening tests which Mr Pasqua mentioned just now?"
"And what about the labelling and traceability system, which will not be complete until 2003, despite the risks for consumers and the absence of a total guarantee for livestock producers?"
"Now, in a panic, you resign yourselves to action."
"But, faced with the crisis, it is necessary to guarantee health and food protection for consumers and an income for livestock producers, butchers, tripe butchers and wholesalers alike, all of whom are victims of the negligence of the public authorities, at both national and Community level."
"These people are in no way responsible for the crisis, which is why the European Union must show solidarity with them."
"We must condemn those who are really responsible for the crisis - the Anglo-American producers of MBMs - and we must, if necessary, prosecute them if they were aware of the dangers they were causing."
"We must acknowledge the special responsibility of the Commission, as called for by the committee of enquiry of this Parliament."
"There are four real causes of this situation: unchecked profiteering; the violation of natural laws which hoped to turn herbivores into carnivores; the watering down of responsibilities, by transferring sovereignty from nation states to the Brussels eurocracy and finally, your policy of untrammelled free-trade."
"These are the real causes of the crisis, and it is only by tackling these causes that you will be able to permanently solve this appalling problem, which you helped to create."
"Madam President, on behalf of all livestock producers may I express my deep concern at the French Government ban on meat-and-bone meal in animal feed."
"Although a French action, it has widespread international implications."
"The main substitute for MBM is soya protein."
"The French ban will create a massive increase in demand, yet supply of this commodity is limited."
"The result will be exceptionally heavy pressure on prices."
"Finished animal feed costs throughout Europe could rise by as much as 20 or 30%."
"Since feed costs amount to 60% of overheads, producers will be heavily squeezed."
"This may prove to be the last straw for thousands of small pig-farming businesses."
"Furthermore, the ban creates considerable stress in the slaughtering sector."
"Waste products could be sold to processors for £25 a ton."
"They now cost £75 a ton for disposal."
"For a medium-sized slaughterhouse killing 2,500 pigs a week, this adds £120,000 a year to costs, very little of which can be recouped."
"As to the way out, more funding of the agricultural sector is not the solution."
"We need species-specific feedmeals dedicated to specific livestock sectors so that MBM can continue to be supplied to the pig and poultry markets without fear of cross-contamination to the bovine sector."
"If that can be done, there will be no need for a continuing ban or for extra subsidies."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, this debate has one thing in its favour; that at least it is highlighting the differences of opinion that exist among us, especially between the Council and the Commission."
"I too do not accept the arrogance of certain Member States which, since they do not apply the tests, are not pushing for regulations."
"This is unacceptable."
"If France is now in the situation in which it finds itself, it is because it practises controls which do not exist elsewhere."
"Now, it is not just a matter of a crisis in the beef sector, it is a public health problem, and we are also faced with an economic crisis."
"The health of European consumers must be a top priority in all decisions that are adopted."
"The entire food chain is at the heart of this problem."
"Consumers have lost confidence and, in order to contain this phenomenon, there must be systematic BSE tests on cattle and sheep."
"Farmers themselves are demanding them."
"Adopting emergency measures and common sense measures by banning the use of MBMs for all species would indeed be a practical application of the precautionary principle!"
"Commissioner, I have always had a great deal of confidence in you, but I do not understand why you are being so reluctant to act."
"How can you imagine that you are applying the precautionary principle if you are refusing to ban MBMs?"
"Mr Byrne, you are well aware that no MBMs are completely safe."
"It is by adopting measures of this kind that consumers will be reassured and that farmers who support this idea, especially as voiced by their unions, will hear the message of solidarity that we want to send them."
"There are no scientific certainties with regard to the transmission of the disease to other species."
"But what we are certain of is that we must restore consumer confidence and support the farming sector."
"Let nobody tell me that we cannot destroy MBMs!"
"We have wasted a lot of time. We should have put the necessary tools to incinerate these meals in place years ago."
"Let nobody tell me that we are unable to replace these MBMs!"
"Commissioner, I am sorry that your colleague responsible for agriculture is not here and that he does not have the courage to face us and to explain that it is necessary to completely overhaul the common agricultural policy."
"I condemn the limitations and the worrying consequences of this policy."
"A reform of the CAP is not just necessary, it is indispensable, because it is intolerable that a European country should adopt draconian measures and jeopardise its economy."
"European solidarity must also play a role, because our policy has exposed its inconsistencies: set-aside, animal meal for cattle, nitrates, pesticides."
"The CAP must be reorganised to encourage farmers."
"Production must be improved, and the budget of the CAP must be used to reorganise this policy."
"Madam President, less than four weeks ago the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on health rules for animal by-products not intended for human consumption."
"The aim of this is to avoid not only microbiological but also chemical contamination of feedingstuffs in future."
"In my opinion, the scope of this proposal is already wide, and it takes account of the precautionary principle."
"In the interests of a sustainable closed substance cycle it should still be possible to use properly tested animal materials deemed fit for human consumption in the production of feedingstuffs."
"We have to be realistic."
"There is no scientific justification for a general ban on using animal meal for all animals. Why should it cover pigs, poultry and fish, as some Member States and some Members here have been demanding?"
"If you take the arguments of some Members of this House to their logical conclusion, you would also have to ban sales of wild boar meat."
"What is far more important, in the spirit of the Commission proposal, is to work towards ensuring that animal meal complies with the highest safety standards."
"Farms and factories that do not at present apply the highest technological standards to animal meal production should have their production licence withdrawn until they can demonstrate that they are meeting those standards."
"Regular and strict checks of technological standards and compliance with legislation on animal meal production should form part of a comprehensive safety concept."
"Madam President, we have certainly been through a lot with the BSE crisis."
"It has led to the resignation of a Commission, a British government was voted out partly because of it and now there is an internal policy crisis in France - who knows where it will all end! There are people and countries who are using the BSE crisis as a political instrument."
"For example, the president of one country has stood up and announced that no more animal meal is to be used as animal feed - animal meal that should never have been fed to animals in the first place, because France has not complied with the standards."
"And the health minister of one of Germany's Länder recently stated that she was demanding a new import ban on English and French beef."
"This minister had refused to introduce the tests which we called for in association with lifting this ban."
"That would have given us tests in Germany and thus, scientific proof, either that there is no BSE or that cases do actually exist."
"Had that happened, we would not now be complaining that we have been put in an undesirable category just because we asserted that we were BSE-free."
"Then Mr Gollnisch turns round and tells this House that his group has been spearheading the BSE debate."
"Mr Gollnisch, I do not recall your group contributing to the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into BSE."
"You played no part in it whatsoever."
"Then the President-in-Office comes along and tells this House what measures he now intends to take. Of course, what you say is quite right, Mr President-in-Office."
"But what you told us goes without saying, it is blindingly obvious!"
"It is European law!"
"We urgently need to give the Commission the mechanisms it requires, and that is something that should be done in Nice. And if new threats arise in future - Mr Böge has already referred to this - the Commission needs powers to close down factories, negotiate and impose sanctions immediately, so that years do not have to pass before we recognise what needs to be done in scientific and political terms and take action!"
"That is the real scandal, and this is not, for the moment at least, a matter for the Commission. We have to recognise that, Mr Byrne, and I welcome your contribution today."
"But it was indeed a matter for the Commission at one point!"
"Now it is down to the Member States, who do not want to implement the legislation!"
"We have a key role to play in exerting pressure here."
"This is now a European problem."
"That is why I have taken the liberty of talking about France and Germany, because we have to recognise that this is a European problem and stop indulging in national squabbling!"
"We need to establish a precautionary policy for the European public as a whole, and we have done that in a solid and rational way here."
"I accordingly welcome the motion for a resolution."
"We have not let ourselves be lured into calling for a total ban on animal meal, because in that case we would have had to call for a total ban on meat, because if what is deemed fit for us to eat can no longer be fed to animals, that is not just nonsense, it is political populism!"
"We need to steer clear of that and to carry on working in the same sensible way as before!"
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I would advise the Commission not to be so sure of itself or, more importantly, of its forecasts for the future."
"I tabled a question on the danger of BSE in December 1995, three months before the scandal broke."
"The Commission replied to the effect that there was absolutely no problem and no cause for concern."
"So a little modesty is in order, I think."
"I also have a question for the Commission: have you measured the cost today of the current policy of cheap meat-and-bone meal and the cost of doing away with it and supporting vegetable production?"
"I am no longer so sure that meat-and-bone meal, together with the cost of controls and the risks, is any cheaper."
"Thirdly, the whole House is talking about controls."
"When did the Commission carry out controls?"
"Does it have the capacity to do so?"
"Which countries have been referred to the European Court for failing to apply the law?"
"For example, Madam President, for failing to comply with beef labelling, on which I acted as Parliament's rapporteur."
"Does every country apply it?"
"I have yet to see labels in Athens."
"Has the Commission referred anyone to the European Court?"
"I am sure that we would be most interested in knowing so that we could continue the debate."
"As far as the rest is concerned, for once, I agree wholeheartedly with what the honourable lady members, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mrs Grossetête, said."
"Madam President, one of the primary objectives of the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council must continue to be guaranteeing food safety by enforcing effective laws and performing stringent controls which will restore consumer confidence."
"All this must be carried out in a climate of transparency and regularity so that the citizens do not feel that they are being swindled or sacrificed on the altar of major economic interests."
"We must prevent animals suffering from BSE entering the food chain."
"We therefore need to develop an effective control system in all the Member States of the European Union."
"It is becoming vital to stop using meat-and-bone meal until it is proven unequivocally that using these feedingstuffs will not spread the disease."
"The panic spreading throughout the public is destroying an entire sector, and those who are least to blame - the breeders - are worst affected, for it is precisely the breeders, and not those responsible, who are the victims of the situation."
"Breeders feed their livestock on products supplied by the industries, and a similar situation occurred in Belgium a few months ago with the matter of dioxins in chickens."
"We call for financial subsidies to assist breeders so that they do not have to bear all the costs of the crisis."
"We also feel that it would be appropriate to ensure that every outbreak of the disease is contained and to place a ban on the export of meat until such time as it is proven to be safe to eat."
"Madam President, I would like to go into the financial implications of the matter, partly in my capacity as rapporteur for the agricultural budget."
"We have talked enough about the procedural aspect and the ins and outs of the whole BSE issue."
"A trialogue on Budget 2001 is due to start tomorrow."
"Yesterday, the coordinators of the various parties in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development lent their support to the proposal to earmark EUR 600 million of the EUR 1.3 billion still available in the agricultural budget for the fight against BSE."
"I understand that it would cost upwards of EUR 150 million to test all slaughtered cows older than two years in the European Union."
"Well then, Council and Commission, you have a fair amount of financial leeway on which to base your robust policy."
"Let there be no more discussion of this 600 million in the negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"The scope is there in the budget, you have Parliament' s backing on this, and now that everything is in place, it is up to you to see that the funds needed for a robust BSE policy actually hit the mark."
"My second remark concerns the procedures."
"It is noticeable that there is still no official mention of BSE on the official agenda of the Council of Agriculture Ministers due to take place this coming Monday and Tuesday."
"I ask myself how this is possible when last week, on Wednesday 8 November, the European cattle farmers in the COPA association came together for emergency consultations and proposed robust measures?"
"How can consumer organisations really make their voices heard?"
"We are obviously giving the impression in this public debate that we move at snail' s pace when it comes to the implementation of policy by the Council and the Commission, which is totally unacceptable."
"I urge you to pursue a robust policy, or a different one at any rate."
"A number of points have been made about the implementation of legislation."
"I would remind you though, that no human being can go without food, not for a single day."
"On no account should we fail to give this priority its due from the political perspective."
"Should it already be a problem with regard to inadequate levels of protein and other products, then I can assure you that European agriculture has sufficient potential to absorb this, also with regard to cattle feed."
"Mr President, like many others, I want to thank Commissioner Byrne for his customary vigilance and also the French Minister for being here today."
"As an Englishman, I welcome the measures the French have taken."
"There is a general acknowledgement that BSE, which began as a British disease and today is being presented as a French crisis, is really a European disease - a European problem - and it must be tackled on that basis."
"There should not be any recriminations between the nation states or between different generations of government on this issue."
"We must tackle this."
"The Minister said that MBM was a low-cost foodstuff."
"It is not a low-cost food stuff if it helps to spread BSE and its human derivative."
"That is the essential problem here today."
"Many speakers have said that we need to extend the ban on meat-and-bone meal as a mammalian food stuff."
"The UK already bans it from all farm livestock."
"Our own Food Standards Agency will be pronouncing very soon on intra-species recycling, and I hope they will condemn it also."
"We need to take these precautions, and we need to take them quickly for the benefit of all the countries of Europe."
"Mr Byrne did not say very much today, as he was widely trailed to have done, about testing."
"I am glad that we are still looking at the extension of testing on an experimental basis."
"There are still doubts about the validity of tests, particularly on younger animals, and we have heard from other speakers about the huge size of the herd in Europe that would have to be tested even if old animals are to be taken out of the food chain."
"Lastly, we must make greater speed in urging the Council to act on our behalf."
"Everyone has said that and everyone knows it to be true."
"You must move."
"We have just heard that it took four years to agree a ban on SRMs in the food chain."
"We do not have another four years."
"We may not have another one year."
"We must take precautions now, not just on behalf of those of us who are concerned, but on behalf of the complacent minority of Member States as well."
"It is for their benefit that we do it."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am happy to hear within this Chamber that the CAP must be changed at all costs."
"I would just like to remind certain people that the Greens were indeed alone when, at the top of their voices, they called for the reform of the CAP."
"With regard to BSE, I welcome the French decision, but the Presidency must not forget that it too must assume its responsibilities as far as food safety at the European level is concerned. I would like to make two points in this connection."
"I regret that neither the Council nor the Commission has stressed the absolute and immediate need to bring grass and oil seed subsidies in line with those for cereals in order to avoid genetically modified soya being used to make up for the lack of proteins next year."
"I also believe that criminal and fraudulent acts should not continue to go unpunished."
"It is outrageous that, after three BSE crises in the space of a decade, no guilty party has been identified or brought to book."
"This impunity cannot go on."
"That is why I am calling on the European Union to carry out the necessary investigations among manufacturers of MBMs and knackers in order to find those responsible for these health, economic and social disasters."
"Madam President, I would like to make three points."
"Firstly, to respond to the justified and very demanding need of European consumers for food safety, we are going to place the bar of controls and precautions at an extremely high level."
"But if we introduce generalised screening tests, if we destroy MBMs, if we impose the slaughter of an entire herd for just one sick animal, we must demand strictly equivalent health standards from the third countries who are our commercial partners and who seek to export live animals, carcasses and meat products to the Community."
"Secondly, even before this crisis, the Community suffered a serious deficit in vegetable proteins, since we accepted, at Blair House, an incredible limitation on our oil-seed production to 30% of our requirements, just to please the United States and its soya exporters."
"Now, the Community cannot cultivate more than 5.5 million hectares of oil seeds, nor does it have the right to do so, even though our needs are in the order of 18 million hectares."
"That is why food manufacturers have had to make extensive use of MBMs in their products."
"In the future, when these MBMs are banned, we are going to need millions of additional hectares of oil seed crops."
"This crisis underscores the absurd nature of the concessions made by the European Union within the framework of the GATT."
"We denounced this here in Parliament, when Jimmy Goldsmith was here."
"We have the land, the climate and the necessary knowledge to immediately replace MBMs with non-genetically modified vegetable protein, but instead, while financing set-aside, we have given up the right to grow, on our own land, the vegetable proteins we urgently need to feed our animals and our people."
"That is why our group has tabled an amendment calling on the Council and the Commission to find ways of re-launching, in Europe, the farming of vegetable proteins to replace, to great advantage, prion-ridden MBMs and transgenic American soya."
"We also ask that the disastrous Blair House Agreement, which binds our oil seed producers hand and foot, should be renegotiated within the framework of the COM."
"Finally, it is the duty of the Community to come to the assistance of all the beef sector operators who are the victims of the profound destabilisation of their markets in order to help them fund the costs of obligatory testing and the destruction of animal residues which have been withdrawn from the food chain, as well as the costs of vital promotion measures."
"Otherwise, there will no longer be any point in talking about a common agricultural policy."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we began our work on BSE in the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into BSE, the very first thing we had to do was to expose and overcome cover-ups, secretiveness and deceit, and to take measures which, overall, have been very successful and offer a way forward in solving the problem of BSE."
"We have already heard many times today that the real problem facing us is to implement the decisions we have already taken."
"Mr Byrne, I am extremely grateful that so far you have made excellent progress in putting into practice the undertaking that you gave when you were appointed."
"You have brought forward proposals such as the White Paper and the hygiene regulations, and I can assure you that Parliament will deal swiftly with those hygiene regulations."
"We will work quickly enough for them to be effectively implemented in the new few years."
"But I am not aware of anything happening at Council level here."
"There are only declarations and opinions, but no decisions as regards directives or regulations."
"What I find incredible is this tug of war in the Council over meat exports and imports."
"This seems to be all about emotions."
"The public's feelings have really been whipped up, with the sole aim of securing the market for each country's own beef."
"Nothing else has happened!"
"Now emotions are being stirred up again with dramatic announcements about banning animal meal as feed for all animals."
"If you would only implement what we agreed, then you would not need to worry about all this any more."
"It reminds me of witch-hunts in the Middle Ages."
"We are pursuing ""sinners"" who are not guilty at all."
"The causes are to be found somewhere else altogether."
"I would like to suggest rapid introduction of these tests that you too are proposing, Commissioner, and not as spot checks, but for every animal slaughtered, without any age restrictions."
"Only then can we say to the public ""This meat has been tested and you can eat it""."
"There really is no better solution."
"I have worked out the cost - 10 cents per kilo."
"So we do not need to argue here about millions of euros - every member of the public will happily pay this, I am quite sure of that!"
"Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, we must all start from a basic, binding assumption. It is intolerable that raw materials or compound feedingstuffs should be dangerous for animals or human beings."
"Man's food must be safe to eat."
"At this time, in addition to the developments and progress in our legislation, we must send the citizens a loud, unambiguous message."
"We must reassure the public that the Europe of rights does genuinely protect the rights enshrined in its Treaties and in the Fundamental Charter of European Rights."
"I am sure, Commissioner, that Parliament will lend you all the support necessary for the new initiatives."
"We need clear measures."
"I feel that, until it is proved otherwise, a total ban on meat-and-bone meal has become necessary, just as the introduction of general testing and the harmonisation and effective implementation of Community legislation in all the Member States is necessary, and just as it is necessary not just to monitor the application of new labelling rules but to bring forward the introduction of these rules to the earliest possible juncture."
"I will end by affirming this principle: the cost of these measures will certainly be very high, but our priority is health."
"Secondly, without these guarantees, the fall in consumption will impact negatively upon the entire industry."
"Therefore, consumers and producers must unite to obtain greater guarantees of the inviolable principle that food should be healthy."
"Madam President, I am very pleased that the Commission is finally making a strong case for universal testing, because as the situation in France demonstrates ""he who seeks shall find""!"
"Commissioner, I urge you to ensure that these tests are also carried out in other Member States."
"It is not acceptable if Germany, for example, does not introduce universal testing, but just tests in North Rhine-Westphalia, for fear of no longer having BSE-free status."
"That cannot, of course, be allowed to happen and I can therefore only hope that the Commission will exert the strongest pressure on those Member States that do not carry out tests because they are afraid of losing their BSE-free status."
"This amounts to deliberately putting consumers at risk and, as such, is unacceptable."
"What we need here is a wide-ranging information campaign."
"However, I firmly refute the Commission's suggestion that banning the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs now is panic-mongering."
"Quite the contrary!"
"I think that France has set an excellent example by finally deciding to take this step."
"I find it bordering on the cynical, Mr Byrne, when you say that this should not happen on environmental grounds."
"You cannot in all seriousness expect us to eat hazardous waste just to solve the waste disposal problem!"
"All in all, I regard it as somewhat shameful that there is so much talk here about compensating farmers and animal breeders."
"Perhaps we should think about the victims for a change, and all the relatives of people who have died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
"Commissioner, I listened to what you said very carefully and was most surprised when, at one point in your speech, you said that you did not have a magic solution to this problem."
"My reply to you is that we do not need magic solutions, we need two things: first, we need to accept that health, i.e. public health, takes priority over every other policy."
"Once we have accepted this, not just proclaimed it but believe in it, then we come to the second element, which is the question of political will."
"Let me assure you that, if we had had the political will then, we would not be facing this problem now, because we all know what has caused it."
"We know all about meat-and-bone meal and we know that there are tests and that we can find the animals from herds which need to be destroyed in order to deal with the problem."
"We know all that."
"What is preventing us from acting and why must there always be a crisis for us to come here and confirm that we, the European Parliament, believe that public health is the number one priority?"
"And you are saying the same, but just how well has the Council understood it?"
"Because, basically, at some point we seem to be unable to act."
"We seem to be unable to apply what we know."
"And we all know that prevention is the best cure."
"Except that there is no cure here. We know that this epizootic disease brings terrible suffering and tragic consequences in its wake but we do not know where they will lead us."
"Because not all its epidemiological elements have been identified."
"So we are playing with fire."
"And what amazes me is that we come here and repeat the same things over and over again."
"I have listened to my fellow members."
"They are all right in what they say."
"Our aim must be to apply it."
"We want application, members of the Council, we want action and we want it throughout the European Union; we do not want fragmented action by France or this or that country."
"It must be taken everywhere and it must be taken at once."
"Madam President, I am totally convinced that the Union in its entirety lacks the political, moral and educational authority to talk about the quality and safety of food."
"Nor is it a coincidence that the President-in-Office and the Commissioner refrained from mentioning the main source of all of these problems in the food chain, which is, of course, the common agricultural policy itself."
"Parliament has voted half the budget to be spent on encouraging production."
"Today' s modern farmers are not what they produce; they are what they are able to produce whilst maintaining quality and safety."
"But you are not helping them to achieve this!"
"I say this because you only help large-scale producers and, as a consequence, you spend a large part of the budget on encouraging these very problems!"
"These problems and those that will follow!"
"You do not, however, want to accept the principle of doing away with animal feedingstuffs that contain the remains of other animals..."
"We have already discussed the United Kingdom and Portugal in this Chamber and now we are discussing France."
"I am now waiting for the Commissioner to announce the next case, because we will have reached this point within a year with another country and further cases."
"The fundamental issue is that the President-in-Office and the Commissioner must accept that a policy guided by post-war principles is no longer possible today and is no longer acceptable."
"You must end all aid for production and instead help to bring about quality, food safety and the conservation of resources."
"Otherwise, we will not have a food chain that can provide guarantees for consumers."
"We will be perpetuating the fraudulent treatment of both farmers and consumers."
"Madam President, there is no let up in media interest in the BSE issue. The same goes for those dreadful pictures of people affected by the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, despite all the action taken in the Member States, not to mention at EU level."
"The debate we are having today on the consequences of the BSE crisis and how we can actually tackle them, is dealing with some very crucial issues."
"Firstly, there is the issue of the tests that need to be carried out, and I welcome the fact that we are not going to stipulate a specific age for them."
"Secondly, there is the question as to whether it is acceptable to use bonemeal in cattle feed, which has been the subject of lively debate here in this Chamber."
"The link between feeding cattle bonemeal - which is, as it happens a very unnatural way to feed animals - and BSE is now clear to everyone."
"So action is called for."
"In the Netherlands, the legislation governing the use of offal in animal feed is already relatively stringent as matters stand."
"There has been a ban on using proteins from mammals and ruminants in animal feed destined for ruminants since as early as 1989."
"What is more, this regulation is continually tightened up and complies with requirements made at European level."
"The use of fat and blood is also subject to strict rules."
"Therefore, I am amazed, under these circumstances, that it is still permissible for corpses to be used or processed."
"Although there is no evidence of an absolute risk, I welcome the Dutch proposal to place a complete ban on the use of meat in animal feeds with effect from 1 July 2001."
"We cannot afford, in the light of past events, to allow this offal to enter the food chain, no matter what."
"Together with my fellow honourable Members, I advocate that we do not wait until July 2001, but enforce this ban now, with almost immediate effect."
"There is clearly a need for stringent European measures."
"So not just national measures, because the functioning of the internal market will be seriously disrupted if we constantly leave it to the national governments to decide to what extent the use of offal in animal feed should be banned."
"Therefore, for the sake of the internal market, and in order to boost consumer confidence, I would advocate a complete and immediate ban."
"I would also ask the Commissioner to initiate something of a uniform European approach to the issue of animal corpses and the collection thereof."
"There are increasing incidences, also in my own country, of dead sheep or calves simply being left behind because it costs too much to have them collected."
"Therefore I would ask the Commission to work towards a degree of harmonisation on this score too."
"If it is not going to do so now, then could it at least put this in writing before long, so that we know where we stand."
"Madam President, I speak today both as an MEP and a beef farmer from the United Kingdom."
"The farming industry in Britain has suffered greatly from the BSE crisis, both financially and in terms of consumer confidence."
"However, we have learnt a great deal over the years as to how to put our house in order."
"We now have a belt-and-braces system for the safety of our beef."
"Recently, the Phillips inquiry into BSE has been published in the UK."
"I am pleased that you, Commissioner Byrne, have read that report. I hope that you will act on it."
"The French Government should also read this report because they are in danger of making exactly the same mistakes as were made in the UK at the time of our BSE crisis."
"But we now have the benefit of hindsight."
"I suggest that the French Government should learn from us."
"I have never been convinced by the argument put forward by France that the whole-herd slaughter policy was the right way to tackle outbreaks of BSE in their country."
"The recent problem in Normandy of an infected animal being presented as a healthy animal highlights the resistance there is in the farming community to having their entire herds slaughtered."
"Furthermore, the recent tests that have been carried out in France of fallen stock have shown several hidden cases of BSE."
"I have long been suspicious that in order to avoid having their whole herds slaughtered animals have been secretly shot and buried on farms in France."
"The British system of removing infected animals from the herds and paying good compensation for those animals encourages farmers to declare their cases of BSE."
"I call upon the European Commission to carry out a total review of the systems that are in place in France to deal with cases of BSE."
"In Britain we have also learnt that it is very difficult to stop meat-and-bone meal, that is produced and incorporated in the feedingstuffs for pigs and poultry, also - either by accident or by intention - landing up in feed for cattle and ruminants."
"It is very difficult for a feed mill to guarantee that its production lines are completely cleared of meat-and-bone meal before they start manufacturing feedingstuffs for pigs and poultry."
"I have long been of the opinion that a complete ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal in animal feeds should be in place throughout Europe."
"France has recently introduced a ban on beef on the bone and many French provinces have stopped school children from consuming home-grown beef."
"One of the main reasons for this action is that the French Food Agency takes the precautionary principle very seriously."
"I would suggest that the European Commission also use the precautionary principle in regard to beef from France."
"Until such time as the French Government can guarantee the absolute safety of their beef the Commission should ban all exports from France to the rest of the Community, especially from beef animals that are over 30 months of age."
"There is, at the moment, £2 million worth of French beef for the meat processing industry consumed in the UK."
"This is totally unacceptable considering the problems regarding BSE in France."
"Over a year ago, 16 of Europe's best scientists, including a French chairman, declared British beef safe for consumption throughout Europe, and yet France has illegally maintained a ban on the importation of British beef."
"It is total hypocrisy for France to maintain its ban on British beef."
"The United Kingdom has suffered with this terrible plague."
"I would like to say, on behalf of the farming community, that they are the people at whom the finger is often pointed, but they are not to blame."
"Commissioner Byrne was very strong today in his opening statement when he said to the House that he was prepared to look at this matter of meat-and-bone meal and take it on."
"I would like to say to him today as he has listened to this debate: does he not realise that this is something that must be taken on immediately?"
"As the previous speaker has just said, the only way to deal with banning meat-and-bone meal is to have an entire ban otherwise it cannot be policed."
"As a result, the poison goes into the system and, as it does, it destroys the system."
"I make a special appeal to the Commissioner today to take note of what has been said, practically across the board in this debate, and move quickly and speedily to impose a ban on all meat-and-bone meal in the European Community."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I have listened with great interest to everything that has been said."
"The main thing now is not to be accusing people of delaying implementing regulations or establishing responsibilities, but rather, to have a common imperative, that of ensuring food safety."
"It is a legitimate demand on the part of all European consumers."
"It is imperative upon government authorities, be they national or European."
"I believe that we must now try, following your debates, to define the key ways, in terms of both method and means, in order to ensure compliance with this imperative."
"The Presidency believes that this method is based on scientific research and consultation."
"As there is still a lot of uncertainty, we must know what the scientific facts are and what action must be taken."
"We must also study the feasibility of these measures, and that involves processing MBMs and setting up tests."
"The speedy implementation of these means comes next, and finally monitoring."
"You have dealt with all these problems in turn."
"As regards the last item, monitoring, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his comments, which demonstrated the Commission' s open-mindedness and showed that it was possible to study all these problems and to set up the European Food Agency quickly."
"Monitoring can never be anything more than monitoring, however, and if there is still even the slightest possibility that there may have been fraud or embezzlement, or errors of use, this doubt, however tiny it may be, sticks in people' s minds and sometimes brings the entire sector into disrepute."
"As far as carrying out generalised testing is concerned, I believe, certainly, that we must increase the number of tests, as indeed you have all called for."
"Some countries have already gone down this road."
"We hope that the number of tests carried out on the targeted cattle and sheep populations will increase."
"I cannot currently see, however, how it will be possible, given the resources available to each of the Member States, to carry out 28 million tests a year, in either technical or financial terms with any degree of effectiveness. What is more, these tests, however good they are, will still leave a margin of doubt since even the best tests, and these have been highlighted, only make it possible to detect the presence of the disease in the last months of incubation, just before it turns into the full-blown disease, and not right at the start."
"So there are doubts, there are uncertainties, but I believe that our joint text and your debates here in this House have enabled us to make progress."
"To this end I listened most attentively to all your speeches, and it seems to me appropriate and crucial that the debate on the safety of our citizens is settled at the European level."
"It is indeed difficult to have national legislations and a European legislation existing side by side."
"I believe we should have a single, comprehensive set of laws, which can be applied to meet this demand and thereby avoid distortions of competition, thus making it possible for the single market to operate smoothly."
"Rest assured that, when it comes to continuing the work in the Council and my exchanges with the Commission, I will bear all this in mind, in the full knowledge that reaching agreement within the institutions is one of the best ways of dealing with a problem as complex and universal as that of food safety."
"On 30 November, during the Council meeting, the French Presidency will launch an important debate with a view to providing the first responses to a situation of widespread suspicion, which calls into question the credibility of our institutions in the eyes of our citizens."
"We are talking about public health, and hence of serious events, which must be treated as such, in a strict and, of course, transparent manner."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, rest assured that, in the twofold undertaking which has fallen to us (in which, I will see to it, the Council will play its part to the full), I am determined to restore consumer confidence and to strengthen the credibility of the European institutions."
"Each of you here has sought to question or to refer to the survival of the common agricultural policy."
"Some of you have spoken of the inordinate emphasis placed on productivity and the possibility of going back on the Blair House Agreements, which can only take place in the context of the new round of COM talks."
"I have listened to all these proposals - I am not insensitive to them."
"I shall wait for the results of your debates and I am convinced that we will be able to tackle this safety imperative together, and that we will be able together to find ways and means to guarantee the safety of our fellow citizens."
"Madam President, I would like to make a very brief personal statement, since our fellow Member, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, has attacked the members of my group for not taking part in the committee of enquiry into BSE."
"I would just like to make the following clarification. There have been two committees of enquiry within this Parliament."
"Mr Martinez took part in the first one, and right here I have, if my fellow Member would care to consult it, his minority opinion, which was expressed in writing at the time of the Böge committee."
"We did not take part in the second committee of enquiry quite simply because we were excluded by the operation of the d'Hondt law and by the Rules of Procedure, or lack of them, in this Parliament."
"Not inviting us to participate is the best way to avoid having to listen to us."
"In any event, Mr Martinez gave his formal warning in 1990, a full 6 years before the first committee of enquiry."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0553/2000). We shall examine the questions to the Commission."
"You will realise what an organisational disaster situation we are in because we should now be finishing Question Time."
"I must say that miracles are not included in my mandate or my abilities."
"So let us cooperate in using this half-hour because we are going to fail to comply with all sorts of things."
"We are not going to have an hour and a half, nor are we going to finish at 7, nor are we even going to have an hour, because the Commissioners have to travel at 7.30."
"To share the time out proportionally, the only solution I see would be to have two questions in the first part - there is no time for any more."
"I request that only one supplementary question be asked by the Member who prepared the question, and exceptionally one other."
"Then we shall invite questions to each Commissioner so that everyone can participate and no one will feel left out."
"The panel of Commissioners is very respectable and I believe all of them are entitled to answer a question."
"This is a fair way to share out the time."
"Question No 17 by (H-0848/00):"
"Subject: Minimum standards governing the expulsion of immigrants The Council meeting of 18 December 1997 adopted a resolution laying down the priorities for cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs for the period from 1 January 1998 to the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which clearly set out the objective of 'improving cooperation regarding the expulsion of... immigrants' ."
"The recent spate of instances in which various Member States have failed to respect the most basic human rights when expelling immigrants is such as to warrant special attention for this issue from the Commission."
"These instances include the 'pillow technique' which led to the death of a female immigrant in Belgium, the use of strong sedatives in Spain, the transporting of immigrants in cramped conditions in the holds of ships in Italy and Spain, the tragic case of the 58 Chinese immigrants found dead at the UK port of Dover after they had been detained on a number of occasions on European soil, and the widespread use of various forms of coercion and intimidation against expelled immigrants."
"Does the Commission plan to make a proposal of any kind with regard to asylum and immigration policy, with a view both to averting such terrible incidents and to harmonising and coordinating expulsion policies in the Member States which respect human rights and United Nations conventions on this matter?"
"Mr President, in my contribution to a secular miracle, I wish to say that, with regard to the harmonisation of asylum policy, the main measures that the Union will be adopting are defined not only in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, but are also part of the scoreboard that the Commission presented to the Council and to the European Parliament, and will develop in two basic stages."
"The first stage - which I hope can be fully concluded by next June - involves laying down common minimum standards for the basic defining elements of an asylum policy."
"In the later, more long-term stage, the objective will be to define a fully comprehensive common asylum system."
"With a view to defining this overall asylum system, at the end of this year the Commission will present a communication to promote debate on the matter."
"With regard specifically to the issue of its legal basis, Article 63(3)(b) of the Treaty establishing the European Community provides for the adoption of measures on illegal immigration and on illegal residence in the Union' s countries, including measures on the repatriation of illegal residents."
"A first initiative by the French Presidency is currently being discussed by the Council, the aim of which is to adopt a directive on the mutual recognition of judgments expelling citizens from third countries. Parliament is also to be consulted on this draft directive."
"Public opinion in the Member States views existing repatriation policies as poorly coordinated and largely ineffectual."
"The Commission considers that readmission agreements have an important role to play in clarifying and coordinating these policies, and the first Community readmission agreements are currently being negotiated with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco."
"The Commission hopes that, under the 2001 budget, a financial cooperation instrument will be adopted with the countries of origin and of transit, enhancing their powers in the field of readmission and of voluntary return."
"With regard to future policy, it is the Commission' s view that in view of the need for an overall and coherent strategy in the field of repatriation, we must aim above all to prioritise voluntary repatriation."
"Bearing this voluntary repatriation in mind, I would remind the House that the European Fund for Refugees provides for specific financial measures to support the development of Member States' policies on repatriation, and that, with regard to the way this repatriation is carried out, I share the concerns expressed by Mrs Cerdeira Morterero about the need for us to adopt common minimum standards establishing dignified and humane procedures and conditions for repatriation."
"I am convinced that this will be a worthy topic for the Commission' s work programme for 2001."
"Mr President, I too will try to help in this miracle ""timesharing"" between the panel of Commissioners and MEPs."
"Mr Vitorino, you know perfectly well that we share your concerns, the work that you personally have explained to the Committee on Freedoms, the scoreboard and the priorities that the Commission has set for all these issues."
"We are working on it in this Committee."
"Clearly, circumstances such as those I mention in the question I have put to you must give any European citizen, and especially those for whom we are responsible, an acquired political obligation. We are working doggedly on these issues, and asking for the greatest effort to speed up the work, so that none of the situations I have mentioned, like the expulsion of immigrants, can ever happen again, because this makes us ashamed to be Europeans and even more so to be those politically responsible."
"Mr President, I wish to state that I share Mrs Cerdeira Morterero' s concerns and that I hope she is not only addressing her appeal to the Commission, but also to the Council, so that we may have the entire legal framework adopted by next June."
"That is my commitment, for which I accept responsibility."
"Mr President, I only want to say two things."
"The list of examples given in the question is the result of selective memory, which I feel is hardly appropriate in these cases."
"But in short, Commissioner, as of today we do not have an updated scoreboard, nor do we have a legal instrument to regulate the conditions and material assumptions of expulsion."
"On 12 December in Palermo, the United Nations is going to sign the World Convention on Organised Crime with a protocol on the traffic in human beings."
"There is a direct relationship between organised crime and immigration."
"What proposals does the Commission have concerning this matter on the basis of Article 31 of the Union?"
"I apologise again for the excess of zeal shown in cooperation over the secular miracle: I should also like to say to the honourable Member that I hope that by the end of this year the Commission will be able to present to the Council and the European Parliament two framework decisions under the third pillar, including common definitions, criminal charges and sanctions for trafficking in human beings for the purposes of sexual or economic exploitation."
"This will be the foundation stone of the European penal structure for eliminating trafficking in human beings, which generally goes hand in hand with organised crime."
"The solutions that the Commission will be proposing are fully in line with the content of the United Nations Convention, which I hope will be signed in Palermo in the week of 12 to 15 December."
"Question No 18 by (H-0860/00):"
"Subject: UN report on the exploitation of women The UN report paints a very black picture of the situation of women throughout the world, referring to tens of millions of unwanted pregnancies, risky abortions, rapes, cases of abuse, infanticides and crimes of 'honour' ."
"The report states that each year 60 million girls are reported missing, 5 000 women are murdered for reasons of family honour, and about 4 million are sold to service the sex industry, while those that manage to escape end up working in wretched conditions."
"The report makes the significant point that one in three women world-wide has been a victim of abuse, rape or forced sex at least once in her life, while the perpetrators go unpunished."
"What measures does the Commission intend to take to put a stop to this intolerable situation of shameful exploitation, abuse and the white slave trade, and to eliminate all discrimination against women?"
"Second Part"
"Questions to Mr Solbes"
"Mr President, obviously the issue of the exploitation of, and violence against, women is one of the biggest social problems of our times."
"It also has huge economic repercussions, as a result of the host of illegal economic activities springing up in this sector worldwide."
"Violence against women takes many forms: there is violence in the home, a crime which does not speak its name, there is sexual exploitation and there is trafficking in women, i.e. trafficking in human beings."
"Allow me to remind you that, following Beijing and again in New York this year, the whole world reiterated that all these issues were human rights issues and should be treated as such, as violations of human rights."
"The Commission approved a pan-European policy to combat trafficking in human beings back in 1996, with particular emphasis on the issue of women, who are the worst hit by this scourge."
"May I remind you of the DAPHNE and STOP programmes, of last year's campaign on domestic violence, on violence in the home, a problem which has huge dimensions at European level, and of the joint action approved in 1997 on trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children, the basis on which all Member States are called on to review their legislation, take account of certain forms of conduct and encourage cooperation between the judicial authorities."
"The programme presented by the Commission on the question of gender equality for the next five years contains five priorities, one of which concerns violence and human rights and we expect to work with governments, local authorities and non-governmental organisations here in order to put programmes in place in all the Member States over the next five years."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"What you have said is all well and good, but there is no substance to it."
"What I should like to ask is this: do you not think, Commissioner, that the disgraceful phenomena which we condemn and which, as you yourself added, relate to the economic climate prevailing in the countries of the European Union, elsewhere in Europe and throughout the world, are the result of impoverishment caused by the policy of elevating the demand for maximum profits to the highest ideal, come what may?"
"In Europe, modern slaves for every conceivable purpose come mainly from the countries of the former Soviet Union, where women previously had the social status which they deserved."
"Today, with the tragic changes which you - I mean your system - wanted and pursued so enthusiastically, the women and children exported to our countries account for most of the exports from these countries..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, just one word: it is not true that women are only trafficked from the countries of the former Soviet Union or that most of them come from there."
"Unfortunately, Asia wears that crown, together with the countries of Africa."
"Poverty, wherever it exists, is the main reason, the main factor which causes this phenomenon."
"I apologise to Ms Schreyer and Mr Fischler but it is impossible for them to answer the questions."
"Questions Nos 19, 20 and 21 will be replied to in writing."
"Question No 22 by (H-0809/00):"
"Subject: Monetary policy and the role of the Commission During a debate in the European Parliament' s Committee on Constitutional Affairs, former Commission President Jacques Delors said that the Commission ought to be responsible for public announcements concerning European policy on the state of the single currency and fluctuations in the exchange rate."
"Does the Commission intend to take any steps at least to put an end to the current diversity of opinion which is so prejudicial to the euro?"
"Questions to Mrs Wallström"
"Mr President, I would say to Mr Nogueira that clearly, in the model that we have defined, monetary policy is the responsibility of the Central Bank and it is the European Central Bank that takes action in line with the criteria established in the Treaty."
"A problem of greater consequence is how to make a single monetary policy compatible with economic policies that are national in accordance with the Treaty."
"This operation consists of everything included under economic policy coordination, which has two basic aims: first, that the economic policies of the various Member States should not be incongruent with each other, and secondly, that they should not be incongruent with monetary policy either, generating a situation that could result in an over-restrictive monetary policy."
"We mean to carry out this coordination basically through the instrument of major economic policy guidelines, which are applicable in each Member State that approves them and which include not only the major lines of economic policy but also specific recommendations for each Member State."
"As a result of the stability and growth plan, however, we have also launched the so-called stability programmes."
"Here we take a much more precise, more specific approach, since we are introducing just the public finance element."
"The aim during this period has been to reduce government deficit in order to achieve a more flexible monetary policy, lower interest rates and greater growth."
"The stated objectives are being satisfactorily achieved."
"We hope next year we will achieve a zero deficit situation."
"In these circumstances, as the body basically responsible for economic policy coordination, we in Eurogroup are planning to take our fiscal obligations further and, above all, improve the quality and sustainability of public finances, which will certainly mean an improvement in the Stability and Growth Pact and the tackling of more exacting topics with greater content."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you have given me an answer about European economic policy and the practice in the Member States and the Commission on this."
"With the current state of the euro I believe the problem is not one of economic policy, and other answers need to be given."
"If I could make your answer more comprehensive, I would add the evidence that dollars are being systematically purchased from Europe, an extraordinary investment in the United States, and if I governed this country I would be extremely concerned. In any case, the fall in the euro is favouring European exports enormously, which is not detrimental to Europe."
"But I do not think you know how to explain this or you dare not do so, and anyway, the fundamental problem with the fall in the euro in fact lies in the lack of confidence in a common policy, because the Member States resist accepting the strategic and political reality of the euro' s actual existence."
"There is no question here either, Mr Solbes."
"You can see that all MEPs almost without exception are born to be Commissioners, as they want to expound on the issues."
"We all know there is no time."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please begin with the question and not with the explanation."
"Mr President, from a public relations point of view, I believe it is very important to distinguish between internal and external effects, and I would be interested to know if the Commission intends now, with the physical introduction of the euro not far off, to launch a campaign to explain the difference between the internal and external effects of currency stability to the public?"
"Mr President, I shall try to answer both points quickly."
"First of all, it is a fact that we have an internal euro effect and an external euro effect."
"In overall terms, the euro effect must be seen as a total, absolute success: we have managed to improve growth, improve the conditions for stability in our economy, we have managed to keep inflation down to a relatively low level despite the risks we are facing, and we are achieving the basic objective, which is to keep inflation under control."
"From an external viewpoint, it is true there is a problem - and indirectly I am answering Mr Nogueira - which is, we must not forget, that savings in Europe are much greater than in the United States."
"Part of these European savings are allowing European firms to go abroad and become international; in some cases they are European investments produced abroad, and in others still they are just countries or issuers that act in Europe, where they can raise funds better and then transfer them abroad."
"But to answer your actual question, what are we going to do?"
"In 1999, we set in motion a number of specific programmes in cooperation with Parliament to publicise the euro as thoroughly as possible."
"I always say that the euro will not be introduced on 1 January 2002: the euro is already in our pockets; we have it in coins of different guises, but we already have it in our pockets."
"Now that particular point needs working on."
"Whereas in 2000 we have devoted more attention to small- and medium-sized enterprises, 2001 must be the year of the people."
"We are doing this in cooperation with the Member States, which are responsible for the specific euro changeover programmes."
"Parliament is taking part (remember the meetings held on 23 and 24 October), and for our part what we are doing to help the Member States make progress and achieve this visibility that we all want is to inform Ecofin every month."
"You too are receiving this information on the current situation of each plan for changing over to the physical euro in each of the Member States, so that everybody can choose the best practices in one country or another and we can all make as much progress as we can together and achieve the best possible results before the end of next year."
"Question No 23 will be replied to in writing."
"Question No 24 by (H-0787/00):"
"Subject: Atmospheric pollution in Greece According to estimates by Greenpeace, which has followed the WHO methodology, and according to the latest data (1997-1999) on atmospheric pollution as measured by the relevant state organisations, the cost in human lives in Greece is comparable with the number of road deaths (1342 and 7247 additional deaths annually, due to short and long-term consequences, respectively), while the social cost is put at Drs. 548 bn. and Drs. 2096 bn. for short-term and long-term consequences, respectively."
"Athens in particular suffers from high concentrations of particulates, ozone, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide."
"Will the Commission say whether Greece has notified it of the measures it has taken to transpose Directives 96/61/EC and 96/62/EC in national legislation, whether Greece is correctly implementing the above directives and, more generally, how it views the quality of the air in Greece, especially in the light of all the studies which it itself has commissioned to address the problem?"
"Questions to Mr Monti"
". First of all, Directive 96/61 on integrated pollution prevention and control. which was to be transposed in the Member States by 30 October 1999, has not yet been implemented in Greece."
"The Commission has therefore sent a recent opinion to the Greek authorities."
"Without action being taken from the Greek side we will pursue the procedure already underway."
"In relation to Directive 96/62 on ambient air quality assessment and management, the Commission has brought a case against Greece for non-transposition before the Court of Justice."
"During the procedure the Greek authorities made known that the directive had now been transposed."
"The Commission then applied to the Court of Justice to withdraw the case initiated against the Greek authorities."
"A study on air quality in Athens, performed under a programme between the Commission services and the municipality of Athens has resulted in the installation of a monitoring network to comply with the requirements of daughter legislation under Directive 96/62."
"The study also assessed present-day air quality in Athens."
"During the measurement campaign elevated levels of sulphur dioxide were observed in some hot-spots."
"Existing limit values for nitrogen dioxide and lead were not exceeded."
"The ozone thresholds pursuant to Directive 92/72 were not exceeded in the city of Athens, but it should be noted that no measurements were made in mid-summer."
"Other monitoring data show ozone thresholds frequently being exceeded outside the Athens agglomeration."
"I am hopeful that this situation will improve with the implementation of other Community initiatives such as the recent agreement on the Commission's proposal for a directive on national emission ceilings."
"In addition, daughter Directive 99/30 must be transposed in Member States by 19 July 2001."
"It sets future limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead."
"According to the study, current concentrations of nitrogen dioxide are higher than the limit value for nitrogen dioxide to be met by 2010 and the new limit value for particulate matter to be met by 2005 is, at present, widely exceeded."
"The recently adopted limit value for benzene is also exceeded."
"This situation is expected to improve with the implementation of Community legislation, for example, in the transport sector."
"However, the Greek authorities will have to take supplementary measures at local level to ensure that the new air quality standards are respected."
"I am most grateful to the Commissioner for such accurate and detailed information."
"Mr President, just to set a precedent, I shall not take up a position."
"I just have two questions to put to the Commissioner: you said that at times we exceed the limit values."
"Have you been notified of any measures taken since the limit values were exceeded?"
"Secondly, the budget of the Cohesion Fund and the budget for the third Community Support Framework include investments; have you discussed investments to set up the measuring networks provided for in Community legislation throughout Greece and not just in Athens?"
"If values are exceeded, the Member State, in this case Greece, will have to take action."
"What we do is to guarantee that there is a system of monitoring and measuring."
"If values are exceeded we ask the Member State to take action and we follow developments."
"There is the possibility of using Community funding for establishing networks and for measurements in Greece."
"It is extremely important to keep an eye on the development of air quality in Greece, and not just in Athens."
"Questions Nos 25 to 28 will be replied to in writing."
"Question No 29 by (H-0811/00):"
"Subject: Government aid to the audiovisual sector During a seminar on the arts sector organised by the French Presidency, a representative of the Commission's Directorate-General for Competition expressed the view that the legal requirements to invest imposed on the networks constituted government aid by virtue of the very fact that such investment was made compulsory by the legislative authority."
"Can the Commission confirm whether it does in fact take this approach when considering government aid granted to the film and audiovisual industries?"
"The resources allocated by the networks under a legal obligation are, in fact, government resources."
"The fact that a legal requirement to invest exists for networks does not necessarily imply that the said investment is government aid under Article 87(1) of the EEC Treaty, but rather that the Commission must exercise control pursuant to Article 87 of the EEC Treaty."
"The principle by which the Commission determines if such investment is aid and, accordingly, costs such aid is the principle of the private investor operating under normal market economy conditions. The purchase of audiovisual products for subsequent broadcasting by radio is part of the normal commercial activity of TV networks."
"Investments made to finance such products would only constitute government aid if the networks did not obtain equivalent concessions or adequate remuneration."
"This remuneration can take the form of supplies, purchases of audiovisual products, coproduction shares or broadcasting rights."
"It could also consist of other forms of commercial compensation from their investments."
"In other words, investments may constitute aid when they finance production projects which are not financed by the networks in the absence of a legal obligation."
"Quite clearly, the aid given to these projects would not consist of the entire financing provided by the networks."
"Rather, it would consist of the difference between the normal yield and the actual yield from the financed production."
"Finally, it must be pointed out that the fact that certain of these investments are in the form of aid does not preclude their ultimate compatibility with the rules of the Treaty."
"They could be regarded as compatible by virtue of the special support they provide for cultural productions."
"Commissioner, could you clarify whether, in this case, there is not a contradiction with the fact that 'television without borders' also helps to produce the content of the works."
"As regards the cut-off between the amount of government aid and its territorial use, do you not think that this cut-off ultimately threatens the possibility, and hence the existence, of national aid?"
"What is the Commission' s opinion on this?"
"Essentially, my problem is to understand why you work with bilateral notifications and not with an official text which would enable you to consider the problem as a whole, given that you have just raised it with the question of the Treaties."
"In its decision to approve the French scheme of supporting film production, the Commission set four specific compatibility criteria."
"In the same decision, the Commission undertook to review the aid schemes in all the Member States on the basis of the specific compatibility criteria approved until 2004, the date on which the validity of the authorisation for the French support scheme will expire."
"The objective of the Commission' s action is to establish the legal safety and regulatory stability the industry needs in order to develop, which is so far lacking. The Commission also intends to set the minimum compatibility criteria without, however, wishing to harmonise the aid schemes whose diversity is a reflection of the cultural diversity that the Commission seeks to preserve."
"This bilateral approach simply aims to examine the conformity of the different schemes with the prototype which was established at the time the decision was taken to approve the French scheme, based on the four specific compatibility criteria."
"Questions Nos 30 to 59 will be replied to in writing ."
"Today we could use that Vulgar Latin saying, ""Ite cuestiones sunt"" ."
"That concludes Questions to the Commission."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Combating social exclusion (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A5­0307/2000) by Mrs Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on combating social exclusion."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights says in its preamble: 'It places the individual at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship of the Union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice' , and in its first article it adds: 'Human dignity is inviolable."
"It must be respected and protected' ."
"I bring in this quotation from the Charter of Fundamental Rights because some situations described in this magnificent report - I congratulate the rapporteur on it - are probably incompatible with this declaration that has just been willingly adopted by this Parliament."
"Compared with these statements, reality is stubborn."
"Eurostat data tells us that 18% of the population of the European Union live on less than 60% of average national income or, in other words, 65 million Europeans are living in poverty."
"Naturally the national poverty rates are varied and different, as are the types of poverty: urban, in industrial slums, in isolated rural areas, etc., or the poverty linked to sex or age discrimination - I am referring, of course, to poverty among women and child poverty."
"Today' s worlds, the society of globalisation and the world economy, the society of information and technological development, may also have a not very positive influence and create, or help to create, new forms of poverty, on account of the intrinsic difficulties in this kind of society in opening up access to employment - to me this is the fundamental route to social integration and inclusion - and because of the need to improve employment and obtain higher-quality jobs."
"Europe has created a lot of employment."
"In my country, Spain, José María Aznar' s government has made an effort and adopted a commitment: it has succeeded in bringing down a high unemployment rate, and it is still upholding this objective, which is being met, and this commitment."
"But I do not think we should be satisfied just with what has been achieved."
"To achieve a Europe that encourages integration, in the words of the Lisbon European Council, requires joint effort and joint action."
"This comes through knowing the characteristics and the means that can get everyone involved, in society as a whole and in the various governments, on account of the need to quantify objectives and eradicate child poverty, because child poverty must generate other kinds of poverty and perhaps establish formulae of social exclusion that perpetuate poverty and perhaps even destitution."
"Therefore, Commissioner, I ask for a special effort to be made to eradicate this child poverty."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to thank our rapporteur and welcome the initiative she has taken to engage in dialogue with the Council and the Commission immediately following this first reading in order to work towards ensuring that better consideration is given to the amendments desired by Parliament."
"Following the mass unemployment of the 1980s, social exclusion risks becoming the new evil which will gnaw away at Europe over the coming decade."
"When growth returns, it will be a challenge we need to take up if we want it to actually benefit everybody."
"This is not self-evident as this new growth is very unfair and, as we have seen in the United States for some ten years now, may be accompanied by persistent insecure employment, exclusion, poverty and urban ghettoisation."
"Growth will take place under conditions inherited from the crisis: a lot of jobs are being created, but there have never been so many insecure jobs, temporary jobs and imposed part-time work."
"I believe that we must ensure that the phenomenon of the working poor does not become widespread over here as well."
"For many people, economic exclusion is accompanied by exclusion from decent housing and the lack of access to healthcare, training and culture, with certain groups being more exposed than others."
"This Community programme does not aim to take it entirely upon itself to combat exclusion in the European Union, but it must make it possible for Europe to take action in a more determined, effective and coordinated way."
"To achieve this, it must be closely linked to the commitment that the Heads of State and Government made in Lisbon in March 2000 to give a decisive boost to eliminating poverty by setting proper objectives which must be approved by the Council by the end of the year, in other words, before the Nice European Council, which will take place in a few weeks' time."
"I believe that the programme will not be fully meaningful unless it is linked to achieving this objective."
"How can this be done?"
"Firstly, by improving our understanding of exclusion by establishing an indicator and evaluation criteria directed at target groups in particular."
"Secondly, by making it possible to take better account of the experience of operators in the field, NGOs, local authorities, social organisations and of people who are themselves being excluded."
"Thirdly, by helping to assess the impact of government policies that are being pursued in the different Member States in order to draw lessons, establish good practices and reflect on good strategies and, in particular, their consistency with other economic and social policies."
"Fourthly, by helping to define guidelines and national action plans along the same lines as the Luxembourg procedure on employment, based, therefore, on indicators and objectives which are not minimal but of a high level of requirement corresponding to the idea we have of the European social model."
"The amendments proposed by the rapporteur - which we support - aim to reinforce the programme along these lines. I believe that they converge on a number of points with the proposals made by the high-level social protection group in the Employment Council in the run-up to the Nice Summit."
"These proposals relate, in particular, to the idea of promoting access to lasting, high-quality employment, to social protection and healthcare. Added to this is access for all to decent and salubrious housing and to essential services; the high-level group mentioned in this connection electricity, water, heating and also real access to education, justice and public services."
"To conclude, I believe that we will only be able to combat exclusion effectively if we guarantee access to fundamental rights to everybody, because dignity and real involvement as a citizen are conditional upon these rights."
"Mr President, combating social exclusion is a political desideratum we can all support, but what is to be understood by social exclusion and how is it best to be combated?"
"What must the EU' s role be?"
"It is the answers to such questions that we shall find in this programme, designed to promote cooperation on the part of the Member States in combating social exclusion."
"The idea is that all interested and concerned parties should be involved in a type of work in which the individual countries describe the extent of social exclusion and their efforts to combat it."
"This will form the background against which we shall acquire a more common framework of understanding, for the concept of social exclusion is not so simple to define."
"When we think of the long-term unemployed - young as well as old - do we not think of physically or mentally handicapped people, of the mentally ill and of the poor and people with limited means?"
"No doubt we each of us have our own particular ideas about what the concept should cover."
"What we lack is a common definition."
"The Commission experimented with a definition in its consultation document for the Lisbon Summit, proceeding on the basis that the excluded are those who have an income of less than 60% of average earnings in the country concerned."
"The governments of the Member States did not accept this definition, which is also rather simplistic and unduly bland."
"We need a more detailed description of the problem areas."
"The very open approach adopted by the Council to the issue is, in my view, quite correct."
"There is a need to gather statistics, prepare analyses and, by means of conferences and other devices, create greater common appreciation of what we understand to mean by social exclusion."
"With regard to the actual report, Mrs Figueiredo wants to see the word 'poverty' introduced into the legislative text."
"This is something to which my group is generally opposed for technical reasons, namely the issue of what the basis would be in terms of the Treaties."
"We recognise, of course, that poverty is a source of social exclusion, as is also stated in the text."
"I believe we are all agreed about that."
"Parts of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party also have reservations about increasing the appropriation and inserting a reference to the focus group into the legislative text, but we are otherwise able to support Mrs Figueiredo' s report."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for her great commitment in dealing with this report on a programme of Community action for combating social exclusion in which, as many have said, poverty can be an important factor."
"We are told that finding paid work is the best way of preventing social exclusion but I would agree with those who have said that we would have to take account of the fact that gainful employment alone is no guarantee of social participation."
"There are many elderly people who would agree with that, as would those who had worked for hours for low wages which do not provide a decent living - farm labourers, for example."
"It is a pity that poverty is proving such a controversial addition to the title of this programme, for the reason that it is not mentioned in the Treaties."
"It would be interesting to hear from the Council, at some point, whether they are proposing to rectify this omission at the Nice Summit."
"Combating poverty proves controversial because it raises the issue of social protection as a productive factor and the issue of redistribution - deeply unfashionable concepts with some Member States."
"It would be useful to use some of the increased sum which is requested in this report to fund comparative studies to demonstrate how such developments might be managed."
"I am sure that many of the NGOs and local and regional authorities - which Mrs Figueiredo proposes to include in the programme and its evaluation - would be happy to share their considerable expertise."
"If we are going to avoid social exclusion we have to ensure that our macroeconomic policies do not act in a way which increases social exclusion."
"It would be totally counterproductive to have policies which undermine local economic development, make employment less secure but more demanding and then have to mop up the casualties through programmes which try to combat poverty and social exclusion."
"Mr President, we live in a paradoxical society."
"In economic policy, we in fact do all we can to increase efficiency, dynamism and response rates."
"In the harsh climate which then arises, there are more and more people who cannot keep up and who are marginalised and excluded."
"So the more the economy flourishes, the more people seem to be consigned to poverty."
"It is easy to become pessimistic."
"In spite of the fact that there is money around and in spite of the fact that Europe has never been richer, it appears to be more and more difficult to protect the weak and give the marginalised a proper chance."
"That is why Mrs Figueiredo' s report is very important and welcome."
"I want to congratulate her warmly on the report."
"It is about how the Member States are to be encouraged to do something to combat poverty and social exclusion."
"What is particularly good is that she emphasises so strongly that fine words are not enough and that solidarity costs money."
"The ideal, of course, is to be able to offer good work to as many people as possible, but in a tough competition-based economy there are many who do not cope."
"According to the report, this may be true of women with two jobs who therefore work both outside and inside the home."
"It may be true of older people whose knowledge is no longer needed."
"It may be true of people with mental difficulties and of large groups of people who do not have a good enough knowledge of the language in order to get jobs."
"Above all, it is no doubt true of the many people who work but who have wages too low to live on."
"All these groups are threatened by social exclusion if very extensive measures of support are not provided."
"The Member States must therefore allocate much more money than at present to social initiatives aimed at combating exclusion, poverty and social destitution."
"I mentioned what is paradoxical in society."
"According to the current ideology, people must take responsibility for their own lives."
"I believe, however, that social exclusion and poverty are caused by social conditions and that responsibility is therefore shared."
"In a good society, there must be room for everyone, and that means shared responsibility."
"Mr President, in this Chamber we never cease to sing the praises of the European Social Model, the social market economy, which many feel with pride compares very favourably with the primitive model of the United States of America."
"However, the figures on poverty in Europe, upon which our report is based and which have been mentioned today - the 18% poverty line - are evidence of a situation which is anything but exciting."
"The main problem is still understanding what it is that is not working in the economies and societies of the European countries and which reforms should be carried out in order to reduce substantially the zones of poverty and social exclusion burdening many areas of the Union."
"What proposals does the decision under consideration make?"
"To guarantee rights, to establish coordination, to create committees to study the situation and draw up action plans to combat social exclusion, to promote dialogue between the parties concerned and to create NGO networks at European level, and for this we will appropriate EUR 70 million or maybe EUR 100 million."
"Now, I am not questioning the good intentions behind this decision, but I am concerned at the results to be expected from this five-year plan."
"At the end of the day, we will in all probability, be more familiar with the statistics of social exclusion and poverty - which is a good thing - and we will have guaranteed operations to assist some tens of thousands of people in Europe - which is also no bad thing - but we will not have made any progress towards structural reforms which could have convincingly reduced poverty and exclusion."
"The report stresses two points: unemployment and the extremely low pension levels for certain categories."
"It is certainly true that these are two factors which lead to exclusion and poverty, but we must treat the disease rather than the symptoms."
"If we want there to be more jobs, we must have the courage to liberalise the labour market."
"Where this has been achieved, even in Europe, unemployment has fallen convincingly."
"In the United States, a more flexible labour market means that periods of poverty and unemployment are only very short."
"If we want to find the resources to give to the pensioners with the most paltry pensions, we must have the courage to admit that we need to stop people retiring at 50 years old and, in all probability, create a completely new social security system."
"If we do not reform the labour and welfare markets, re-establishing them on the basis of individual freedom and responsibility rather than on State and trade union paternalism, then I am afraid that our committees and our efforts at coordination will do very little for the poor of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the technical problems, I would like to speak."
"18% of the European Union's population lives below the poverty line."
"These 65 million people are often overlooked."
"They do not fit into the image of a prosperous Europe with enormous growth potential."
"The cause of this poverty is a lack of jobs, inadequate wages - the phrase ""the working poor"" comes to mind - and insecure jobs."
"If we are to achieve the economic and social cohesion to which we aspire we need not just a high level of employment, but also a high level of social protection."
"Mrs Diamantopoulou, I welcome the fact that the Commission ...."
"(Technical fault)"
"I am being sabotaged, Mr President!"
"This should help to recognise the symptoms of exclusion and provide for an exchange of experience based on precise qualitative and quantitative data."
"A dialogue is needed between interest groups and the relevant NGOs."
"National monitoring centres and regional and local authorities need to be involved."
"The benefits of synergy are felt when Member States' measures are linked with Community policies, actions and instruments and with the European Structural Funds."
"This can lead to successful practices which act as a model."
"Another result is building and extending networks."
"And another still is the promotion of innovative projects."
"I regard it as essential to set up a reflection group at European level with representatives of the NGOs, the social partners, the Council and the European Parliament taking part in an annual round table."
"The concept of open coordination in employment policy since Luxembourg needs to incorporate exclusion and to be reflected in the Member States' National Action Plans."
"In 1992, the Council called on the Member States to combat social exclusion."
"In 1999, it agreed to promote social integration."
"We should reinforce this active role as from 2001, in order to give those afflicted by poverty and social exclusion access to economic, social and cultural activities."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner's initiative and this report which seeks to improve upon it."
"Europe has managed to avoid the economic crises that have hit many parts of the world over recent years."
"Growth is picking up, inflation has been brought down to its lowest levels for a generation, yet we still have persistent poverty and exclusion."
"Europe's unemployment rate is still far too high at 8.3%."
"Well over half of the 14 million unemployed, according to Eurostat's latest figures, have been out of work for over a year."
"Furthermore, according to the EU's statistical service, 18% of European citizens live below the poverty line, while one-third of those living in poverty are working."
"In my own country something like 75% of those who are working and living below the poverty line are women."
"The situation seems to be getting worse."
"Between 1980 and 1995 overall inequality rose in Member States."
"Globalisation, technological innovation and the emergence of a knowledge-based economy are coinciding with changing family structures, shifting gender roles and increasingly diverse societies."
"The simple fact is that social exclusion is a brake on economic growth, while an inclusive society enhances growth and the well-being of everyone."
"The Commission estimates that the under-use of available human resources and the wider cost of ill-health, crime etc. could be between EUR 1 billion and EUR 2 billion annually."
"This is an enormous figure."
"It is absolutely imperative that Europe address the divisions that already exist and prevents new ones arising."
"The existence of a single currency and an increasingly coordinated economic and fiscal policy mean that social policies cannot be the sole responsibilities of national jurisdictions."
"It is imperative, however, that Member States engage fully with this programme and consult widely with civil society to establish ambitious targets for eliminating poverty and exclusion."
"The first test of the Member States' seriousness will be their approval of Parliament's decision that the funding should be increased from EUR 70 billion to EUR 100 billion."
"This in itself is a paltry sum given the extent of the problem."
"Finally, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for a report that identifies the true extent of poverty and social exclusion and questions the notion of a Europe committed to defending social justice and solidarity unless all European institutions and civil society engage seriously with the issues."
"Mr President, I am truly grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Figueiredo, both for the hard work which, in her customary manner, she has lavished on this document, and also because she has accepted some of the amendments I tabled, one of which states that poverty and social exclusion are the result of Member States' laws providing for paltry pensions, as Mr Della Vedova said, referring precisely to the Fatuzzo amendment which has been incorporated into the Figueiredo report."
"If only we could do something about social exclusion and poverty!"
"If only we could reduce the scale!"
"Every year, my friends Mr Thomas Mann and Mr Mario Mantovani and I go to the Poor Sisters' institute in Brussels to serve meals to the town's poor tramps, and our hearts bleed and we feel guilty that we are only able to do this once a year: we would like to be able to do it every day but, in all honesty, it would be impossible."
"Well then, we must endeavour to implement this major undertaking, at least in part."
"I am aware of the good intentions of Mrs Figueiredo, the Commission and, in particular, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, but I would stress once again what I said in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, namely that we must put an end to programmes combating social exclusion."
"This must be the last programme: all we need to do is to endeavour to conquer poverty."
"Poverty must be eradicated once and for all!"
"Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur for a quite excellent report."
"We have all spoken of the extremely beneficial economic development we are seeing, with good growth, declining unemployment and a greater number of jobs."
"At the same time, I believe that, in all EU countries, we are seeing increasing and persistent social divisions due to the recession we experienced."
"This indicates that labour market policy and traditional employment policy are not enough. Instead, we must include more policy areas if we are to be able to combat social exclusion and poverty."
"It is a multidimensional problem."
"Naturally, labour market policy is part and parcel of this issue."
"It is important for unemployment to decline and for there to be more jobs."
"That is not enough, however, since education policy too must be included, especially in view of the fact that, when knowledge is as important as it is in the new society, everyone must have access to it."
"Social security policy is also an important area."
"People in different life situations, for example those who are parents of small children or who are unemployed, ill or old, must not inevitably become poor or socially excluded but must be able to participate in society."
"Housing policy, too, is an important area. For example, it is important for people to have the right to housing if they are to be included in society."
"Moreover, all political levels must be involved."
"We are used to the local level and we are used to the regional and national levels."
"We also know however that, in view of the present economic situation with its cross-border economy, it is necessary for us to act at a European level in order to create added value and not in order to take over anything else."
"The process involved in this programme is therefore important, just as it is important to combine different policy areas."
"This was discussed in Lisbon and will continue to be discussed at the Stockholm meeting. It involves our combining social security policy, labour market policy and education policy with economic policy."
"A programme like this, designed to combat social exclusion and poverty, is most excellently suited for this purpose."
"Mr President, Eurostat states quite clearly that around 18% of the European Union' s population live on less than 60% of the average national income."
"This represents around 75 million European citizens."
"In general terms, over the last ten years, the national poverty rate has ranged from 10 to 11% for Denmark and the Netherlands to a very worrying 24% for Portugal."
"To this we must add the fact that more than 10 million people depend on assistance from social welfare systems, in a situation which is growing worse in most Member States."
"This report is extremely important because it aims to improve the circumstances of the most underprivileged, thereby representing one more step towards strengthening social cohesion."
"For this I wish to congratulate the rapporteur."
"This is an ambitious programme of Community action which, in line with the Commission' s proposal, will be given budgetary appropriations of EUR 70 million and should remain in force for a period of five years."
"This budget should be increased, bearing in mind the processes and the realism that are necessary in this field."
"There must be further dialogue with non-governmental organisations and with other social partners, aimed at vigorously detecting the most concentrated areas of poverty and social exclusion and at defining the most efficient and effective ways of combating them."
"We must nevertheless issue a warning about the inadequacy of the NGOs' financial control mechanisms, and demand a better system of financial management equal to the task of ensuring that public funds are spent in a sensible and rigorous way."
"The beneficiaries of this programme should be the victims of poverty and social exclusion, and we must prevent this from becoming in practice merely a means of financing bodies which investigate the problems of poverty and social exclusion."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent contribution to identifying the causes and the scale of poverty, which is an appropriate term for a social reality whose cruelty should not be watered down into a concept as wide-ranging and abstract as social exclusion."
"I support the Commission' s initiative to create a programme which meets the objectives of the Treaty' s new social agenda, and which puts the Lisbon decisions into practice."
"I also hope that it will welcome the amendments in this report, on which there was a broad consensus."
"I urge the Council to establish quantifiable goals, and specific, cross-sector action programmes to combat exclusion, based on indicators which provide considerable information so that closer cooperation can be translated into tangible and effective action, more in the social results that it achieves than in satisfying electoral needs."
"I support the need to gain more knowledge about the causes of poverty and I also support preventative action against exclusion resulting from mergers, industrial change, relocations, rural desertification, and urban ghettoisation, with innovative and tangible responses involving both sides of industry, local and national government and concerted action by the public."
"Mr President, first of all, I too congratulate Mrs Figueireido on her work, which was approved unanimously, moreover, in committee, and on the innovative nature of her report on the establishment of a Community programme to combat social exclusion."
"I therefore support the rapporteur in stressing that the programme, or rather the programme's role, will facilitate greater social cohesion where the poor and the marginalised are concerned."
"As is stated in the amendments which I tabled in committee and which were subsequently adopted, I am convinced that an effective, practical fight against poverty must take place according to a timetable of events and targets."
"In fact, a programme with in-built deadlines and checks is easier to assess in terms of quantity and quality."
"It must be taken into consideration that over 65 million people in the European Union - 7.5 million of which live in my country, Italy - live on a low income, and a low income in Italy, Commissioner, means a family living on an income of EUR 750."
"These figures suggest that the budget made available for the programme will be totally insufficient."
"I therefore call for it to be increased."
"Mr President, I will end by stressing once again that mutual support between States must be the reference point upon which we base a fresh fight against poverty and social exclusion, but we must take into account the fact that the economic progress of the Member States, and therefore an improvement in their welfare due to the implementation of a social economy of scale, will certainly facilitate the achievement of a greater, better system of social justice."
"Mr President, I would like to thank and congratulate Mrs Figueiredo and I would like to thank the other Members of Parliament who are not here and who have expressed the opinions of the other committees."
"It is a very important and constructive contribution and it supports the Commission proposal for a joint decision of the Council and Parliament which will establish a community action programme to combat social exclusion."
"After the Treaty of Amsterdam and some months after the Lisbon council, we all know that a new context has been created for Community action in the area of social policies and social exclusion and social protection."
"There is a shift in the political debate at the European level and we can see that there is a strong will to combine social cohesion and competition."
"The proposed action programme has a legal basis, Article 137 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and we had a new mandate after the Lisbon Council."
"This programme has been designed to support implementation of the open coordination method which means that it will be possible to improve knowledge, to develop exchange of information and best practice and to evaluate experience to better combat social exclusion."
"There has been a very interesting debate on the role of employment in combating social exclusion and the role of the social reforms and of the structural reforms."
"There was a discussion about the definition of ""poverty"" and ""social income""."
"The gap is clearly increasing between rich and poor, but unfortunately it is impossible to participate in these discussions since I am obliged to focus on the proposed programme and on the way in which we will cooperate to implement this programme at the European level."
"I would like to inform Members of Parliament that, on 4 December, there will be a discussion in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the new social agenda and on what we have achieved during the last year."
"There will be a very interesting political debate, and social exclusion will be at the centre of this debate."
"As far as the proposed programme is concerned and the report of Parliament, I am particularly happy at your strong overall support for this proposal."
"I can accept a majority of your proposals either in their entirety or in spirit."
"I agree on your proposal to strengthen the reference to the conclusion of the Lisbon European Council."
"I also agree on the importance of improving understanding of social exclusion and poverty and of promoting comparable indicators and assessment criteria."
"I also agree to highlight the importance of NGOs as well as of regional and local actors as you suggest, and of better reflecting their experience on the ground."
"There is a reference to the use of the word ""poverty""."
"You know there is a political and theoretical discussion on the word ""poverty""."
"Of course, social exclusion is the wider notion and social exclusion has three main dimensions: poverty, discrimination and lack of opportunities."
"But I agree that ""poverty"" is politically a very strong word and I agree that we can add poverty to social exclusion where possible in the text of the proposal."
"Unfortunately, we cannot use it in the title of the programme."
"This is a legalistic problem because, according to the Treaty's wording, the reference concerns only social exclusion and not poverty."
"I also welcome the amendment which stresses the importance of coherence between all relevant policies."
"I welcome the amendments which refer to the Social Protection Committee."
"Something which is very important is that the Commission has accepted an exceptional increase of up to 90% in the rate of Community co-funding of European networks of NGOs active in poverty and social exclusion."
"However, I am not able to accept an increase in the budget from EUR 70 million to EUR 100 million."
"The budget that we propose is adapted to the aim of the programme and this aim is to encourage cross-national cooperation and mutual learning and not to fund actions on the ground."
"Through the Social Fund and through the EQUAL initiative Member States' NGOs can be funded for particular projects for particular actions on the ground."
"I am unable to accept the remaining amendments for a variety of reasons: some because they are not in conformity with legal requirements; some because they raise issues which fall outside the scope of the decision establishing the programme; and some because they would confuse the message."
"Finally, I would like to come to your proposal that the Commission sets up, in addition to the programme committee, a reflection group."
"We cannot accept this proposal because it is against the comitology rules."
"But I would like to make the following pragmatic suggestion in response to your concerns because I entirely agree that we must find a way to have close and continuous cooperation."
"We have already agreed that the Social Protection Committee would meet on a regular basis with the contact group of Members of Parliament."
"The Social Protection Committee plays a key role in the development of policies of the European Council."
"Close cooperation between the contact group and the Social Protection Committee will ensure the exchange of views between the Council and Parliament."
"On the other hand there could be a link between the contact group and the Commission's officials on a regular basis."
"They could exchange views, they could cooperate on a permanent basis, and we have already established a similar liaison between Parliament and the Commission for the Unemployment Fund and for the European Social Fund."
"We had very successful and satisfactory results."
"Finally, I would like to respond to your concerns about the involvement of different actors and institutions in the implementation of this programme."
"I suggest that the annual Round Table we have proposed should be prepared in consultation with representatives of all the institutions which work at European level: the European Parliament, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, the social partners and the European networks of NGOs."
"I believe that these proposals constitute a pragmatic response to your request."
"For procedural and institutional reasons it is not possible to incorporate them in the text of the decision."
"To sum up, out of the 75 amendments you have proposed, I can accept either as drafted or in spirit 48 of them, namely: Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 37, 42, 46, 48, 51, 58, 59, 60, 61, 65, 66, 68 and 74."
"I can also accept parts of Amendments Nos 14, 36, 40, 45, 53, 63, 64, 70, 71, 72 and 73."
"Finally, I would like to highlight the importance of simplification of the procedures."
"You have focused on that during the discussion."
"It is true that there is a complexity in the whole procedure but all three institutions wish to reach an agreement as soon as possible."
"This is what we will try to do on the part of the Commission."
"We will try to shorten the procedures as much as we can."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Diamantopoulou."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources"
"The next item is the report (A5­0320/2000) by Mrs Rothe, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on a European Parliament and Council directive on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market (COM(2000) 279 - C5­0281/2000 - 2000/0116(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us, as we have just heard, is about promoting electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market."
"This is therefore the first legislative procedure in the field of renewable energy."
"Commissioner, I would like to express my appreciation to you and your colleagues in the Commission for presenting this legislative proposal."
"The proposal for a directive is a logical consequence of the European Union's strategy to double the share of renewables in energy consumption by 2010."
"As you will see from the committee's report, we agree with the strategy presented in the proposal, which is not to undertake any European harmonisation of support schemes for the time being, but rather to let Member States decide upon support schemes on the basis of nationally set targets and objectives."
"However, the fact that we accept this strategy does not necessary mean that we accept all the detail."
"I believe that the committee's report proposes important and essential amendments to the proposed directive."
"First, however, I would like to make some preliminary comments about promoting renewables."
"Many people think that this smacks of subsidies, aids, and financial support for development."
"In reality, however, support schemes for electricity generation from solar, wind and biomass, for example, are only necessary because at present we are still directly or indirectly subsidising other energy sources, subsidies, which in the energy sector in the past, chiefly benefited pollutant fossil fuels or hazardous nuclear energy, and which continue to be to paid to them to some extent."
"Such subsidies distort competition. This means that promoting renewables compensates for the external costs of other energy sources, takes into account the positive environmental effects of this type of energy production and, at the same, time makes up for existing distortions in competition."
"As long as the external costs of fossil fuels and nuclear energy are not internalised, and as long as other energy sources are subsidised, compensation schemes will be needed for renewables."
"In the Commission's proposal and draft report, it is proposing indicative targets for the Member States."
"Binding individual targets for Member States are only envisaged if the interim reports indicate that compliance with the targets is not meeting the European Union's overall strategy."
"But we do not have that much time!"
"We need binding targets right now."
"The European Union and all the Member States entered into commitments at Kyoto because they recognised the dramatic nature of climate change."
"In The Hague, the western industrialised nations are currently again being pilloried because they are only implementing those commitments half-heartedly."
"There is no doubt that renewables can make a vital contribution to meeting the binding reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions agreed in Kyoto."
"If the commitments entered into were meant seriously, then why not also a commitment to mechanisms which would help to meet those commitments, as I, with the support of the committee, have, after all, built a bridge for the Council and the Member States?"
"These binding national targets are to be worked out within one year, with the assistance of experts from the Member States."
"This makes it possible for Member States to determine the exact level of their respective contributions to meeting the EU's target, in accordance with the principles of burden sharing, and, in this area, also the sharing of opportunities."
"A second important amendment we wish to see is this: the Commission envisages various different targets coexisting over five years."
"If we define a clear, binding framework for the Member States, then there should be a longer evaluation period for the various support systems required to satisfy these requirements."
"A 10-year period would put us in a very good position to judge which system is the most successful and efficient."
"We want to convince people in Europe to switch to energy sources which nature renews afresh every day, which do not entail any environmental disruption or climate change, and which make a positive contribution to reducing CO2 emissions."
"So there should not really be any controversy about which types of energy production we mean and define as renewable."
"We do not therefore seriously want to have to tell the population of our respective regions that domestic waste, which nowadays contains an excessively high proportion of plastic waste, is regarded as a renewable energy source."
"Would we perhaps then have to call on the public to produce more and more of this waste, which would certainly enable us to meet the targets we have set ourselves?"
"It goes without saying that this would discredit us and the European Union's policy."
"I am not against waste incineration, indeed I have even called for a separate directive on this in my report."
"No, what I am opposed to, as is the committee, is playing with words in a piece of legislation."
"As you can see, the draft report refers to separated organic municipal waste, because it belongs there."
"As you can also see, untreated wood and cork waste is regarded as a renewable energy source."
"Even if only hydroelectric installations with a capacity below 10 MW are to be covered by the support schemes, all hydro will, of course, be regarded as a renewable energy source and will count towards achieving the target."
"And one more thing I want to make crystal clear: waste incineration is not a renewable energy source and cannot therefore be counted towards meeting the targets."
"Another vital point that the committee agreed on was the problem of connection to the grid and access to the grid for renewables."
"There is no argument about the Commission's proposal to guarantee renewables priority access to the grid."
"I think that we are unanimous about that."
"The Commission's general text on the issue of cost sharing in the report makes matters substantially clearer."
"This is necessary because we can only create legal certainty and avoid disputes through clarification."
"Those are the main points I wanted to mention today."
"I hope that tomorrow this House will take a step forward on the basis of this proposed legislation and our opinion on it, and that you will be able to state, on behalf of the Commission, that you can accept our amendments and that the Council will then be next in line to do its bit!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Sixth Conference of the Parties on Climatic Change is meeting at the moment in The Hague."
"This is a summit which intends to slow down climate change and at which the Kyoto Protocol will undergo its ordeal by fire."
"In addition, the latest conclusions reached by scientists on the intergovernmental panel on climate change alert us to its alarming effects."
"Energy from renewable sources will not be a panacea that will solve this problem, but nobody doubts that it can contribute greatly to alleviating it and also to diversifying our sources of energy and reducing our dependence on hydrocarbons, which indeed would not be a bad thing."
"I want to point out that the Commission and the Commissioner in particular have hit the mark in proposing this directive to promote renewable sources of electricity."
"We trust that the directive will help these as yet incipient forms of energy to develop and become competitive and that the Commission will soon present us with a similar proposal on biofuels."
"I also wish to recognise Mrs Rothe' s hard work and congratulate her on it."
"Implicit in the report we are to vote on tomorrow is Parliament' s decisive support for this initiative, and I ask the Commissioner to transmit this support to the Members of the Commission because it is in that institution and not here in Parliament that this directive - and others that may follow in the same laudable vein - may find their principal detractor."
"I am referring specifically to the proposed guidelines, i.e. aid for the environment."
"This document is unacceptable because of the way it proposes to treat operating aid for renewable energy sources and cogeneration, since it does not recognise the different degree of competitiveness between these renewable energy sources and conventional ones."
"Neither does it recognise the external costs that are avoided with these types of energy."
"In addition, it is inconceivable that the Directorate-General for Competition should move to regulate this kind of aid without taking into account the results of negotiations pertaining to the directive we have before us, and at the very least it can be seen as a snub to Parliament."
"Therefore, I wish to say that both documents need to be dealt with in conjunction with one another."
"We consider that, if these guidelines are not modified, the environmental impact they will cause will be highly negative."
"In the specific case of my country, Spain, these guidelines would be responsible for an additional 225 billion tonnes of CO2 being emitted into the atmosphere between now and 2010 and for our being unable to meet the Kyoto targets."
"The directive on renewable sources of energy represents a belief in the future and an investment in the environment."
"Investments in the environment are neither cost-free nor do they come into the field of competition."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Rothe."
"Renewable energy is by far the largest source of energy currently in use in the world."
"How else do we see where we are going during the day?"
"More people use firewood than any other fuel."
"But tonight we are talking of extending the use of renewable energy."
"I am going to repeat three of our demands."
"Clarity is essential as we put forward our point of view to the Council."
"We want: binding targets, not indicative cut targets; a rational definition of renewable energy - energy from waste, which is to be incinerated anyway, is a good idea."
"But mixed household waste; old paint brushes, polystyrene packaging and discarded plastic toys are not renewable energy."
"Another directive is needed for energy from waste, as Mrs Rothe suggests."
"Thirdly, we want a reasonable and therefore a longer period of certainty in which renewable energy can continue to receive compensation for the external costs to society which its use avoids."
"Let me finish with one very startling fact."
"The United Kingdom could generate four times its power requirements from offshore wind alone - four times its power requirements!"
"Colleagues, this directive makes sense."
"Commissioner, thank you for your efforts."
"I hope you will support ours."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission' s proposal to create a framework enabling the proportion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the European Union to be considerably increased in the medium term, can only be welcomed."
"The lengths the rapporteur, Mrs Rothe, has gone to to make Parliament' s stance on this clear, therefore deserve our full recognition."
"After all, on the one hand, this directive is an important element in the series of measures taken to enable us to honour the commitment the EU entered into in Kyoto regarding the reduction of greenhouse gases and, on the other, it is a praiseworthy attempt to reduce the European Union' s dependence on the oil-producing countries."
"Under the present circumstances, it must be recognised that the renewable energy sources require some form of financial support, in order to create a level playing field."
"As I see it though, these subsidies should be no more than reasonable and only payable for a limited period."
"Needless to say, the controversial issue in this report is that to do with the stipulation of binding target figures."
"In fact the crux of the report is whether it makes any sense or not to have these binding target figures."
"I would advocate a realistic approach, an approach based on the knowledge that electricity production from renewable energy sources can never form a substantial element of total energy production."
"Stipulating realistic target figures can only increase public confidence in the energy policy to be pursued."
"If the target figures cannot be made binding then we will be creating false expectations, i.e. by pretending to strive for the improvement of the environment without being able to make it a reality."
"This would be to the detriment both of the environment and of the policy' s credibility in the eyes of the citizens."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to point out, on the subject of municipal waste processing, that if a switch is made to separated municipal waste collection, a switch can also be made to separated municipal waste processing, and the latter must certainly be regarded as a renewable energy source."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Rothe, what we need is a clear definition of what is renewable."
"Plastic is not a renewable resource, nor is peat."
"We run the risk of losing the confidence of Europe' s citizens who want to buy green electricity if we sow confusion by coming up with ridiculous definitions."
"We need clear national objectives. I do not agree with Mr Beysen; a liberal should be in favour of the fewest possible distortions in the market."
"If we do not have clear objectives, there will be distortion between those countries which do something to promote renewable energies and those countries which do not do enough."
"Let us now turn to the support instruments."
"The Commissioner agrees with Parliament' s position that it is too early to decide, at this stage, between the two instruments currently in place, i.e. firstly the system of green certificates and secondly the system of guaranteed prices."
"Since the plea by the Advocate-General before the Court of Luxembourg, there is now less risk of seeing guaranteed prices foiled by state-aid regulations."
"But there may still be a threat from seeking compatibility with the internal market."
"I believe that a politician is someone who needs to anticipate problems."
"I do not want electricians to cause interference between the two systems and to sow confusion and doubt amongst investors in Europe by short-circuiting and manipulating the system of guaranteed prices."
"Not only must guaranteed prices be tolerated, they must be protected by the directive."
"That is what politics is all about: making competition possible between the two instruments by protecting guaranteed prices and harmonising certificate-related issues."
"Renewable energies is a subject which unites the citizens of Europe at a time when Europe is finding it difficult to get its citizens to support greater integration."
"I believe that a strong policy on renewable energies is a symbol of the Europe of tomorrow."
"Mr President, the dependence of the Member States of the Union on imported energy is massive and is growing all the time."
"Reliance on fossil fuels is reliance on imported energy and the political decisions of foreign powers."
"Using renewable energy sources will increase the freedom and independence of nations and is in harmony with the principles of ecologically and socially sustainable development."
"In preparing the report, a definition of what renewables actually are has been put forward."
"Without taking a stand on whether peat is a renewable energy resource, it must be able to be used as a fuel in the production of energy, preferably in the combined production of electricity and heat."
"Peat is important in the Nordic countries, and we must have the opportunity there to burn peat, as it is our own source of energy and it reduces the EU' s dependence on imports."
"Burning it produces carbon dioxide, but that is produced when fossil fuels are burned anyway."
"Those countries that burn oil or gas themselves should not prohibit us from burning peat."
"If we do not, we will burn oil or gas."
"We are not trying to deceive others into believing that carbon dioxide is reduced by burning peat, but it is our own fuel, while oil and gas are imported goods."
"Waste is not a renewable natural resource, although there is more and more of it produced every day."
"Landfill site gas can be burned, but the volume of waste should not be increased just so that more gas can be burned than before."
"Mr President, the Commission and the rapporteur are right to formulate long-term objectives for promoting electricity production from renewable energy sources, although what we need is a dynamic approach in these matters."
"I also think we should give special attention to the effect that the anticipated competition from the candidate countries will have."
"They are at an advantage in terms of cost owing to lower labour costs and a lower standard of environmental protection."
"That could push energy prices down."
"So the logical step to take would be to increase the financing for the support measures for sustainable energy again."
"In the meantime, it is absolutely essential, given the variety of energy sources, to establish a sound definition of sustainable energy."
"For example, waste incineration must not be called sustainable as a matter of course."
"After all, this process also releases harmful substances."
"Hence my amendment to maintain the strict emission standards of Annex 5 of the revised directive for waste incineration."
"Setting standards on the output side will foster innovation."
"Finally, the European countries must demonstrate, via these agreements, that they will contribute to the realisation of the Kyoto objectives."
"I support this wholeheartedly because climate change poses a threat to the earth' s flora and fauna."
"Furthermore, it is unacceptable for a select group of rich countries to constantly plunder the resources in God' s creation."
"Mr President, at the weekend the OPEC ministers met in Vienna and came to the conclusion that there should be no increase in production quotas."
"Over the last 18 months we have seen the price of crude oil rise from USD 9.75 to USD 33 a barrel."
"As I see it, we are sticking our heads in the sand if we refuse to recognise that we are in the middle of the third oil crisis since the Second World War."
"The first oil crisis in 1973 was a political one, as was the second oil crisis in 1979, but this is a lasting crisis, because all the indications are that reserves are by no means as large as we have been led to believe."
"This is also what individual studies indicate."
"I could even quote Saudi Arabia's former oil minister, Sheikh Yamani, who recently said on Austrian television that the Oil Age is coming to an end, not perhaps because of a shortage of oil, no more than the Stone Age came to an end for lack of stones!"
"And we cannot replace oil as a primary energy source by other primary energy sources, because they too would then soon be in short supply."
"Oil cannot be replaced by coal, natural gas or uranium."
"So this directive is unintentionally topical right now."
"However, it also provides us with an historical opportunity to give renewable energy sources, which constantly regenerate themselves - that is wind, hydro, solar and biomass - their proper place in future energy supply."
"This is for a variety of reasons - environmental reasons, social reasons, because they create jobs, for peace policy reasons, because this energy source has sparked off wars throughout the century, and, lastly, because they also represent a great economic opportunity for the industrialised nations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we warmly support the draft directive for electricity from renewable energy sources."
"We see it as building on the work of our colleague, Mr Mombaur, in advocating a greater share of electricity and energy in the European Union from these sources."
"Clearly, the issues that divide the House are quite stark: the issue of the definition of renewable energy, for instance."
"Many of us feel that energy from waste should be included."
"It is a valuable resource and it certainly renews itself day-by-day, and that should qualify it to be included."
"It seems a pity to exclude any category which can contribute to the overall achievement of energy from waste - whether it is for small-scale projects or part of the overall calculation."
"The key issue, however, that divides us is the question of the binding nature of the targets."
"We have grave reservations about this being in conflict with the principle of subsidiarity."
"We think our friends on the Left and the Greens are asking too much in this regard."
"It could scupper this directive, but we also think it is a matter of practicality."
"If you aim for these targets, there is a curious range of percentages between 6% and nearly 80% in different Member States."
"This seems a very curious way of going about it, so we think the Commission is right to aim for indicative targets."
"The third point in issue here is the length of support programmes."
"We favour a shorter period followed by a review, and I would say to my colleague, Mrs McNally, that she paints a pretty picture of windmills in the sea, but I must tell her that the engineering difficulties and the costs involved make that technology, as with electricity from the sun, rather a long way off in the future."
"But I warmly support this proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Rothe for an excellent report, which revealed much understanding of the situation, We obviously have to support an increase in the use of electricity produced from renewable energy sources."
"The share should aim to be doubled in the next ten years; it could well be more than that."
"However, the Union' s dependence on imported energy is growing too fast at present."
"In twenty or so years' time it will be as much as 70%."
"That will create uncertainty in our lives - in the economy as well as other areas."
"I think we not only need to develop renewable energy sources but a modern energy savings programme to run in parallel with that process, as this dependence is also starting to become a matter of security for us."
"Peat grows continuously."
"The formation of peat by assimilation and the production of organic debris are the same as with other plant biomasses."
"Instead of a hundred years, as with wood, peat needs thousands of years to regenerate."
"We need peat especially in the eastern and northern parts of my own country, where all other fuels, apart from wood, have to be brought in from far away."
"We do not wish to burn and be dependent just on coal and oil."
"For us an annual growth limit in peat is quite enough."
"It is a lot - too much."
"We Finns regard the forest and the marshes as almost sacred, and we know how to use them in compliance with the principle of sustainable development."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the use of sustainable renewable energy sources must be one of the principle objectives of a modern energy policy in Europe as well, but there must also be obligations and certainties, dictated by common sense, of course."
"In this sense, hydroelectric power is important, and it has been both a burden and a blessing for the mountain peoples, for they have had to pay a very high price for their land and have watched local industrialisation processes spring up, associated precisely with the presence of this energy source."
"Now this resource - renewable energy par excellence - must be fully exploited: without further harm to the environment, of course, and along with the introduction of compensation and repossession mechanisms for the mountain peoples."
"This directive does, of course, take the desired line in that here, at last, is genuine exploitation of renewable energies."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Rothe for an excellent report which is very timely this week when we are struggling with the crisis of climate change."
"Commissioner, we do have a problem: the provision of grid infrastructure to facilitate network access for renewables."
"There is a risk of renewables being stillborn or strangled at birth by the utilities that have a monopoly, if they can charge huge sums for grid access."
"One farmer in my locality with a wind project was quoted over EUR 2 million for a connection and this is clearly a problem that I would like addressed."
"Also, I would like to inform the Commissioner that Ireland can be competitive in wind energy in a very short time."
"We believe that we can be competitive given the correct initial support, and those do include grid access."
"I would like to inform Mr Chichester that off my own seashore there are already well advanced windmills in the sea, certainly a project that is going to be up-and-running within a short space of time, so I would like to invite him to come and see it when it does get-up-and-running."
"I am confident that he will appreciate it."
"Mr President, increasing the proportion of electricity from renewable energy sources is a good move."
"The share of renewable energy sources proposed, 22% by 2010, compared with 13.9% now, is particularly ambitious and I am just wondering whether a directive which focuses on the market and makes no provision for parallel measures such as support for research will suffice in order to achieve it."
"One very serious question is how to deal with the extra generation costs."
"The directive talks about support systems, basically a premium paid to companies which operate in this sector, and relies on so-called market mechanisms for the final solution."
"This basically means that workers will be subsidising both the company's costs and its profits and, of course, this would not happen if the energy generation and distribution industry were a nationalised industry, as we in the Communist Party of Greece insist that it should be, and if it had not been sold off to the private sector on the orders of bid business."
"We therefore believe that this directive will not achieve its intended purpose."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Rothe for her valuable work in drafting this report."
"Promoting the use of electricity from renewable energy sources is a very worthwhile endeavour."
"The EU' s reliance on imported energy will, in any case, rise significantly in the next twenty years."
"Since, at the same time, the EU has to adhere to the climatic targets set at Kyoto, it is especially important that we invest more and more in research into renewables."
"I am satisfied that the new directive takes account of the importance of biomass, peat ands other wood-based raw materials, for example."
"The debate on renewable energy sources must not become a form of populism against nuclear energy."
"We have to remember that only nuclear power in conjunction with renewable energy sources will enable the Kyoto Protocol obligations regarding climate to be fulfilled."
"The controversy over ending the use of nuclear power, for example in Sweden and Germany, has shown that without any visible energy alternatives produced at a competitive price and which are environmentally friendly, the debate is surely lacking something."
"The total deregulation of the electricity markets is also one precondition of the increased use of renewables."
"The artificial barriers to, and restrictions on, trade upheld by the monopolies must be done away with. For example, the cheap energy produced in the Nordic countries in hydroelectric plants is still not freely available to the markets of Central Europe, as the situation stands at present."
"Mr President, you will all have heard how Don Quixote used to fight windmills."
"This fight represents a pointless or impossible struggle against all that we take for granted."
"Unfortunately, windmills are no longer things we can take for granted, but one of the things we can is the subsidisation of the fossil fuel sector."
"The fight against these subsidies appeared to be a hopeless task."
"But this time round, it is a fight for the windmills and that is why it will prove successful."
"As social democrats, we feel that sustainable energy must be given a fair crack of the whip."
"Sustainable energy can contribute to fair distribution between countries."
"Consumers must be given fair choices."
"In addition, sustainable energy provides a solid basis for the economy."
"In other words, the fight for windmills is one where there are no losers."
"We could not have chosen a better moment for this debate."
"The climate conference has just started in The Hague."
"Our objectives in the field of sustainable energy are ambitious, yet still modest in the context of the climate problems we face."
"We need radical technological adaptation."
"So what we must not do is start fiddling with the definition of sustainable energy so as to be able to fulfil the objectives with minimum effort."
"Sustainable energy is often associated with small-scale solutions: solar panels on everyone' s roof and a windmill in every village."
"That would be marvellous, but sustainable energy also demands large-scale investments."
"We need commitment from the government if we are to get the funding together."
"We need a secure market for sustainable energy, because a non-binding approach will not suffice in this case."
"That is why Member States must have binding objectives."
"These must be consumption objectives, because sustainable energy may be imported and exported so that each country can use its advantages to optimum effect."
"In addition, target figures must be set for the production objectives, because that will give each Member State the incentive to exploit their whole potential."
"Mr President, on a final note, I would very much like to thank the rapporteur for her worthwhile contribution to this topic."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work in connection with this report."
"A really excellent proposal has been produced, thanks to cooperation."
"The definition of renewable energy sources approved by the committee is a reasonably successful and all-embracing one. Peat must also be included in it, as many of my colleagues have argued with persuasion here."
"Increasing the use of renewable energy can reduce dependence on oil and also create jobs in sparsely populated regions."
"In addition, it is an important means of cutting greenhouse gases in the Community."
"I think it is good that we are setting our sights high, but it is most important that we can agree common targets with credibility and, furthermore, with commitment, which is what the rapporteur referred to here earlier on."
"I think the principle whereby the directive can create a framework for the increased use of renewables in the production of electricity is a good one."
"Although it will be left to the Member States to decide on the promotional measures to be used and to implement them, we also need increased input from the Union."
"Mr President, let there be no doubt a combination of investments in renewables and energy efficiency is the only realistic way for the European Union to meet the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol and reduce our heavy dependence on fossil fuels."
"I congratulate the Commissioner for her initiative, as well as Mrs Rothe for her report."
"I only wish that this directive were part of a coherent long-term energy strategy of the Union."
"But it is not."
"Instead, proposals related to energy are submitted one at a time and without much consistency."
"This is not your fault, Commissioner."
"It is primarily caused by Member States."
"We will not be successful in our efforts to transform our energy system in the Union unless we make energy policy - including taxation - part of a common policy."
"The problem we have with different support systems in the Member States, referred to by Mr Chichester, is but one example of the need for a more common approach in this field."
"Finally a word on costs."
"All new technologies are expensive in the beginning."
"But experience tells us from almost every possible field that every time demand increases by 100% costs come down by an estimated 10 to 15%."
"Renewable energy is no exception."
"I could show you figures and curves here demonstrating that for both wind energy and photovoltaics this mathematical formula applies."
"Hence, I am optimistic about the future potential for renewables provided the right incentives are put in place."
"I wish you all possible success, Commissioner."
"Commissioner, our debate has come at an opportune time - as a number of us have said - as it coincides with the Hague Conference on Climate Change."
"Everybody is now well aware that the risk to humanity is not just an issue for future generations."
"We are already feeling the negative impact of the greenhouse effect, climatic upheavals, global warming, in short, a whole series of difficulties that are already on our doorstep and call for the adoption of urgent, stringent and firm measures."
"The good proposal that you have put forward, Commissioner De Palacio - and I should like to pay tribute to your realism as regards energy - and the excellent report by Mrs Rothe are a step in the right direction by promoting renewable energies."
"Looking at this issue we see only interests, whether they be in the field of securing supplies, protecting the environment, combating the greenhouse effect or creating jobs."
"Of course, we must agree to finance environmental protection, and that is also where we see the limitations of the market."
"Free competition does not solve all the problems and, more especially, it does not settle the fight against the greenhouse effect or against waste."
"Member States must now accept the proposals that are being put forward."
"We must vote overwhelmingly in favour of the proposals from Mrs Rothe."
"I would like to conclude simply by mentioning three problems which have come up time and time again throughout this debate."
"The first problem is that of peat, which is an important energy source: in my view, it is not a renewable energy."
"The second problem is that of household waste: strictly speaking it is not a renewable energy, but one must guard against sending a negative signal as regards the incineration of household waste."
"Finally, as far as the degree of constraint is concerned, I will simply say - because I do not have any more time - that an objective in itself is never constraining: it is an objective and everything must be done to achieve it."
"This is what we must do at a European level."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank Mrs Rothe for her careful and sensitive work on this subject."
"I believe that it takes great courage to keep renewable energy in the spotlight in the way she has managed to do."
"I have just come from an OPEC meeting, and the price of USD 30 for crude oil provides us with an opportunity to make totally new investments in this sector."
"Particularly in the field of research and development, it is important that, in future, we should pay more attention to renewable energy, and I especially have in mind gas from landfill sites and sewage treatment plants, for which there is a role in this regard."
"But I also believe that we should not forget education, because energy efficiency and energy conservation are undeniably important subjects for the future, in just the same way as making use of an efficient infrastructure."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Rothe on the excellent job she has done with this report and, what is more, on the spirit of consensus she has demonstrated."
"I am convinced that in all energy-related matters we should be aware that either we improve our sources or we shall leave the planet Earth uninhabitable within a few generations."
"In my opinion, it is fundamental that we should ensure support for these kinds of energy sources for a considerable period of time, thus allowing our industries to make decisive, long-term investments in this alternative energy."
"I believe a stable framework for energy from renewable sources needs to be guaranteed within ten years at least; this is a proposal we should all support."
"With regard to our targets in this field, we have to listen to the people and go beyond the Commission' s proposal of 21%, which I think is very positive overall, and increase the renewable portion of the total electricity produced."
"Furthermore, for the sake of coherence, the targets I have mentioned when converted into national parameters must be binding or else the directive will lack content and substance."
"Indeed it is fundamental that they should be binding to demonstrate that in environmental matters, too, the European Union takes its international obligations seriously."
"Lastly, I am aware that all this is easy to criticise and difficult to carry out, but if we do not act immediately, within a few generations we shall be in deep water, and that will lead us to disaster."
"So let us act together and leave an inhabitable world for our children."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Rothe on the magnificent work she has carried out, as well as all the Members who have spoken and who have, on many occasions, tabled amendments to the text proposed to Parliament and the Council."
"This Commission proposal is being presented in circumstances which, while in many ways may be negative for many aspects of our economies and our lives, I believe are positive in terms of this particular initiative."
"A dramatic increase in the price of oil without doubt starkly highlights the problems relating to our dependence on energy from fossil fuels."
"The strategic objective of the directive is to create a stable framework to enable the significant development, in the medium term, of electricity generated from renewable energy sources within the European Union, green electricity, and to provide access to it for the internal electricity market."
"However, it must be done in that order."
"Firstly, we must increase the production of green electricity and then we must deal with issues relating to the market."
"This proposal offers a certain degree of legislative certainty and, at the same time, it respects the principle of subsidiarity, by providing the Member States with the degree of autonomy necessary to take account of their specific circumstances until such time as we can see, according to the way events progress, which is the best way to promote the installation of electricity sources."
"I would like to thank Mrs Rothe for her support for these principles and all the speakers who have also shown such support."
"As you know, the Commission intends shortly to adopt a Green Paper on the availability of energy supply and compliance with the Kyoto objectives and the commitments made there by the European Union."
"We believe that these are two fundamental aspects, of different types but equally important."
"The European Union, which flies the flag in the fight against climate change and in the reduction of emissions, must not be the first to fail to comply with its own objectives and its own commitments."
"As a second issue, the availability of supply is a key element in guaranteeing economic development, the well-being of our countries and of the Union as a whole."
"In this Green Paper, we must talk about the role to be played by the various sources of energy."
"Firstly, energy saving."
"I would like to stress this - as some speakers have done - but I would also like to say that it is not a question of opposing any particular energy source or waging a war against it in favour of another."
"One of the key pillars in relation to compliance with Kyoto and for the future of the Union' s energy is the development and increase of the use of renewable energies."
"In today' s document, the Commission intends to make it clear that the introduction of renewable energy sources does not currently enjoy the same facilities that other sources of energy had in their day, for example nuclear energy, coal and even oil, to mention but a few."
"Aid for renewable energy sources is justifiable also because conventional energy sources do not pay in any significant way for some of the external costs generated by their use."
"Furthermore, renewable energy sources are a factor in the availability of supply, and we therefore have an enormous potential for production within the European Union."
"With regard to the amendments that have been tabled, please let me tell you that their number is simply extraordinary and this demonstrates Parliament' s great interest in this issue."
"They also show that there are differing opinions on the best way to promote this type of electricity."
"Nevertheless, we all agree that in Europe we must speed up and intensify the production of this type of energy and that this requires effort."
"In our fight to create a strong and dynamic green electricity market, the first thing we have to do is listen, so that we can learn from each other."
"I have noticed that there are two trends of opinion, with opposing approaches, on this issue."
"The first stresses the rapid introduction of market forces, while the second underlines the need to establish transitional periods and active public aid."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its proposal the Commission is trying to retain the best elements of these two approaches with the aim of producing a balanced text, but I must also make it very clear that a priority objective at the moment is the promotion and development of renewable energy."
"Therefore, issues concerning the market are of secondary importance."
"They are an objective which must not be forgotten but they are not the priority objective of this initiative, which is fundamentally the development and increased use of renewable energy sources."
"Amendments Nos 1, 2, 8, 20 and 21 highlight the need for a policy favourable to green electricity and its many advantages and can be immediately accepted by the Commission."
"For the same reason we can accept Amendment No 3, in part, but not Amendment No 7, which is too technical to be included in the text of the proposal."
"As for Amendment No 5, I am happy to tell you that, given the importance of this issue, the Commission is studying the possibility of presenting a new directive on biofuels generated from renewable energy sources, specifically from biomass, from agricultural products, which will simplify some of the problems which have been raised."
"When we start to talk about the targets for electricity generated from renewable energy sources, we first must agree on what we understand by renewable energy sources."
"This is of fundamental importance in order to lay the foundations for the future market and some of you have already mentioned this matter."
"This means that we can, to a large extent, follow the definition presented by the European Parliament in its Amendment No 27 but, when we talk about extending the use of biomass - even though, it could perhaps be accepted as it is presented - in no circumstance can it be accepted in relation to domestic waste."
"In the majority of cases that is not renewable energy."
"Neither can the Commission accept peat, since it is clearly a fossil fuel, although it is generated more quickly, but it is fossil nonetheless."
"As I have said, we cannot take advantage of biomass in the case of unpolluted woods and we support Amendment No 24."
"The reference to waste, with no other classification, as a source of renewable energy - as I said a moment ago - is inadequate and contrary to the policy of management of solid waste."
"The Commission rejects this part of Amendment No 27, Amendments Nos 11, 54, 55, 61 and Amendment No 57, which are all related to it."
"The Commission also believes that all electricity generated from renewable energy sources and used in hybrid power plants must be considered as green electricity and not only that to be used as reserve power."
"Therefore, we cannot accept Amendment No 28."
"The annex to the Commission' s proposal includes the indicative targets with regard to the national level of consumption of green electricity necessary for achieving the total quota of 22.1% for the whole of the European Union by 2010, in accordance with the objectives laid down in the White Paper of 1997."
"In this context, I must point out two issues."
"Firstly, the importance of the targets being indicative."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to suggest mandatory targets but we have to be realistic and, although I regret this, I cannot, at this time, accept this suggestion that you have made, because it would be automatically rejected by the Member States."
"This is the first time in a Union directive that national targets of this type are being considered. These are not obligations which must be fulfilled but national targets."
"Of course, we are giving this possibility our consideration but, in principle, because of the negotiations with the other party, that is, the Council, I cannot accept these amendments although I understand their approach and I have enormous sympathy for them."
"Therefore, I repeat that article 3(4) is of key importance."
"When the report which must be produced on compliance and the development of renewable energy in the various countries indicates that a certain country is clearly failing to comply with those targets, proposals will be made to Parliament and the Council to correct the situation."
"Those would evidently be mandatory targets for that State, so that it complies with them, so that in this way it complies with these targets, which are targets and not obligations."
"The task we are taking on by means of this directive must be based on transparent measures, which increase confidence, but this process would probably never take off if we impose binding targets in its text."
"Some States do not even wish to accept the indicative targets, so there is no way they would accept targets if they were binding."
"With regard to the calculation, our calculation of 22.1%, instead of the 23.5% established in 1997, is a response to issues of credibility."
"The figures we are presenting here are not arbitrary or mere whims but are instead a response to the real situation as we find it."
"For this reason, we cannot support the amendments which propose legally binding targets - the creation of the committee or the target of 23.5% - and therefore we must reject for the time being Amendments Nos 6, 9, 12, 25, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 50, 51, 52, 67 and 68."
"In relation to the support systems, this is the second group of amendments where the Commission considered it premature to propose a harmonised support system, but stated that, if necessary, it will present a proposal of this type in accordance with certain principles."
"It considers that many of the amendments proposed by Parliament strengthen the Commission' s pragmatic approach and, at the same time, clarify, improve and complement it."
"We therefore support Amendments Nos 36 and 56 and also certain aspects of Amendments Nos 4, 15 and 62, relating to the idea of internalising external costs and compensating for external costs which are not covered in favour of renewable energy sources."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot accept the parts which prejudice the application of rules on state aid."
"Neither can we accept the part of Amendment No 37 which demands that the future harmonised support system satisfies the need for the internalisation of external costs, since this could only be done through fiscal harmonisation which exceeds the scope of the future proposal in this respect."
"On the other hand, we could accept Amendments Nos 10 and 59, which state that investment aid to large hydroelectric plants would only be possible in the event that they contribute to improving the environment."
"Any other situation would prevent me from including large hydroelectric plants within the aid to green electricity."
"Large hydroelectric plants, in principle, are broadly viable in themselves and have very high environmental costs."
"Amendment No 53 would mean excluding all competitive forms of renewable energy from the subsidies and other advantages and, therefore, the Commission cannot accept its wording."
"With regard to the principles on which the future harmonised support system must be based, the Commission can accept the parts of Amendments Nos 37 and 38 which stipulate that such a system must take account of the environmental objectives of the Treaty, the experience acquired with the support systems, which have proven to be effective and positive, as well as geographical conditions."
"However, the Commission cannot accept parts of Amendments Nos 37 and 38 and Amendment No 39, insofar as they prejudge the type of system which must be applied or they require that there should be no distortion to the biomass market."
"For the same reason, we reject Amendment No 23."
"The Commission can accept the need for the current support systems in the transitional systems already considered in article 4(d) of its proposal."
"However, while doing so, the Commission is very conscious that the terms used should not prejudice its right of initiative and must not be incompatible with the single market for electricity."
"The Commission can accept part of the combined Amendments Nos 17 and 18, insofar as this transitional period of ten years relates to maintaining the confidence of investors and not to the continuation of the support systems as such."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is good reason to feel optimistic."
"As some of you have just pointed out, wind energy is very close to becoming competitive, but we have to continue providing genuine support for the development of renewable energy."
"Others of you have referred to the fact that this support is going to create more demand, greater technological development and, therefore, greater competitiveness, and that is what we are putting our faith in."
"When the time comes, further down the line, we will have to gradually incorporate the market aspects which - as I have said - make up the second phase, since the first phase is to generate a sufficient quantity of renewable energy."
"Nevertheless, for reasons that I mentioned earlier, the Commission rejects Amendments Nos 13, 32, 40, 41, 63 and 64."
"With regard to the amendments concerning market forces and competition, the Commission can accept the relevant parts of Amendments Nos 17 and 18 and Amendment No 22, which stress the need to create a market in ecological electricity, but rejects Amendment No 19, which demands harmonisation of national support systems."
"We must provide a broad definition of a support system and therefore cannot accept Amendments Nos 16 and 19."
"With regard to technical measures and the guarantee of origin of ecological electricity, we cannot, unfortunately, support amendments seeking to extend this guarantee to all types of electricity or to electricity from third countries, since that exceeds the scope of the proposal."
"We reject Amendments Nos 14, 42, 43 and 44 and Amendment No 58, which seeks to achieve cross-border trading in electricity certificates."
"That is premature at this stage and cannot be accepted at the moment."
"We cannot accept Amendment No 45, which would weaken the proposal by forcing Member States to revise the legal framework and nor can we accept Amendment No 46."
"We cannot accept Amendments Nos 26, 47 and 60 or Amendment No 65, which impose binding rules on the distribution of connection costs and other network costs at a European level."
"In relation to Amendments Nos 48, 49 and 66, the Commission can accept that, when the time comes, the national targets for green electricity for 2010-2020 should be indicated, but cannot accept those parts of the amendments which could prejudice the application of the rules of competition law in the field of State aid."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that I have spoken at such length but I believe that the debate warrants this degree of attention."
"I would like, once again, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Rothe, and all of you for your work, and reiterate the absolute need for us, once and for all, to give real impetus to the use of renewable energy in the European Union."
"That is what we intend to do by means of this initiative."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Gender-related aspects of armed conflicts"
"The next item is the report (A5-0308/2000) by Mrs Theorin, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on participation of women in peaceful conflict resolution (2000/2025(INI))."
"Mr President, following the end of the Cold War, the battlefield has shifted to small communities, streets and homes."
"Conflicts are more likely to arise within rather than between States."
"Wars and other conflicts have always been a male province, but the majority of victims - 90 per cent - are civilian."
"It is women and girls who, in addition, are exposed to special forms of atrocity."
"They are raped, abducted and kept as sex slaves."
"Those widowed by conflicts are forced to bring up children and look after the elderly by themselves."
"Women are nonetheless excluded from the peace negotiations, and their needs and priorities are overlooked."
"In the Commission for the Reconstruction of Tajikistan, which has 25 000 widows, only one of 26 participants was a woman."
"In the initial peace negotiations to bring an end to the conflict in Burundi, two out of 126 delegates were women."
"No Bosnian women took part in the peace negotiations which brought the war in Bosnia to an end, and this despite the fact that the whole world was aware of the systematic rape to which women were exposed and of the responsibility they would be forced to accept for reconstructing Bosnian society."
"In the negotiations which preceded NATO' s bombing of Kosovo four years later, there was only one woman in the delegation."
"When the stability pact for the reconstruction of South-Eastern Europe was created, no women at all were appointed in spite of their unique experience in peacemaking at grass roots level."
"They had even less of a role to play in the committee responsible for reconstruction."
"A house cannot be built on half a plot of land."
"If we exclude 50 per cent of the population, we shall not obtain a sustainable peace."
"Women must participate fully in all peace negotiations, in all reconstruction work and in peace-keeping operations."
"While formal peace processes are almost exclusively a male domain, international experience and declarations show the importance of women' s participation in resolving conflicts and building peace."
"In the few cases in which civil society and women have taken part in formal peace negotiations, it has, however, been successful, for example in South Africa, Guatemala and Cambodia."
"This is also apparent from a series of UN documents, most recently the resolution concerning women, peace and security adopted by the Security Council two weeks ago."
"It is a question of protecting the civilian population, refugees and asylum seekers, of combating exemption from punishment for rape committed in war and of promoting women' s active participation in resolving conflicts and building peace at all levels."
"These areas are the subject of my report, which has obtained broad support in committee."
"To make it possible for the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to vote in favour of the resolution, I have gone along with compromise Amendment No 19 up to Paragraph 12, which is backed by both the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I propose a supplement to the fourth Geneva protocol whereby rape, forced pregnancy and sexual slavery are to be defined as war crimes in the same way as terrorism and torture."
"I urge the Member States to ratify the Treaty of Rome for a permanent international criminal court."
"Such a court is absolutely essential if the tendency to systematically use rape as a strategy of war is to be precluded."
"In addition, all peacekeeping personnel, men as well as women, ought to undergo equality training."
"This applies especially to peacekeeping forces."
"The goal should be to have at least 40 per cent women involved in all peace and reconstruction work."
"Local participation in the peace and reconciliation processes is important."
"I therefore urge the Member States and the Commission to support individual organisations engaged in conflict prevention and peace work at a technical, financial and political level."
"Despite the fact that only a limited number of women have been involved, studies show that women' s participation in the UN' s peacekeeping forces improves relations with the local population, as well as general morale."
"However, the presence of male peacekeepers leads to an increase in sexual violence and prostitution around the camps."
"UN soldiers, including soldiers from EU countries, have been sent home following complaints of sexual violence in Somalia and Mozambique."
"Peace is far too heavy a burden to be placed upon only one institution, one government or one sex."
"Sustainable peace cannot be created if half the human race is ignored."
"Peace can only be achieved if women participate fully in the peace process."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Theorin, for adopting this topic, the participation of women in peaceful conflict resolution, as the subject of a European Parliament own-initiative report."
"Women are especially affected by wars and conflict situations because of their responsibility for their family, their children and the elderly, but also because they often assume sole responsibility in the absence of their husbands and fathers and accordingly often have to ensure, single-handed, that their family survives."
"The situation is also particularly difficult for women, however, if they still have to fight for recognition and for equal rights in practice."
"Decisions on implementing relief programmes are the responsibility of crisis teams, and the specialist knowledge and expertise of women is often not recognised or not given due respect by such teams."
"Yet it seems all too obvious that the people to involve in such difficult situations are those who bear responsibility on the ground, on the home front as it were, and can contribute to resolving conflicts from their own experience."
"As, unfortunately, this is not regarded as obvious, this report makes a very specific demand for women to be integrated into these bodies and for them to be given a participatory role."
"The report denounces the fact that conflict situations are still associated with violent assaults and also appalling sexual assaults."
"Preventative measures are needed, including the provision of special protection for women in refugee camps by segregating said camps."
"We must help women who are victims of violence."
"That much we agree on."
"This chapter of violence against women in conflicts goes beyond the actual subject of this report and really should have been developed further in view of its importance and highly explosive nature."
"The Theorin report goes into a lot of detail and repetition, which we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats consider do not belong in an official document."
"We also need to make sure that requests are made in a realistic framework."
"For example, I hope that the compromise reached, which Mrs Theorin referred to in connection with Paragraph 12, will also gain the support of this House."
"In areas where decisions are within the competence of Member States, we in the European Parliament can highlight changes and desirable improvements."
"But we have no legal power to achieve them."
"It is the responsibility of the Member States to take decisions regarding women in refugee camps."
"The PPE-DE Group has gone to great pains to table appropriate amendments, and I ask honourable Members also to support the compromise amendment tabled by the rapporteur on Paragraph 12."
"If we want our voice to be heard on the international stage, we must take matters forward through diplomatic channels, recognising their sensitivity."
"Mr President, up until fairly recently, the role of women in matters of war and peace was very much a fringe issue in international organisations."
"The subject was often exploited as a politically opportunist argument between warring parties."
"This was also clearly the case with successive UN world conferences held since 1975, particularly with regard to the conflict in the Middle East."
"Since the issue of women and peace itself carried little political weight, the utopian movements were able to dominate the debate."
"There has been a sea change since the World Conference for Women held in Beijing in 1995."
"It was there that the initial impetus was given to a mature treatment of the subject."
"In particular, in the years that followed, a great deal of work was set in train within and around the UN and its associated organisations."
"It is therefore high time that we put this into practice at European level too and, as has often proved to be the case with women' s rights issues, Europe is lagging behind somewhat in this area."
"The aversion some men in this House have shown towards having a serious discussion of this issue means the writing is on the wall."
"They obviously want to keep their powerful position in matters of foreign policy and defence for themselves, yet feel that men can promote women' s interests."
"Mrs Theorin should be praised for the tenacity with which she has defended this issue in the face of considerable opposition."
"On 31 October, the Security Council adopted a resolution entitled 'Women, peace and security' , following a two day debate."
"Mrs Theorin referred to this earlier."
"In terms of objectives, this resolution broadly resembles the proposal now on the table."
"That too is an illustration of how important the issue is."
"Finally, Mr President, I wish to express my disappointment at what I see as shifty manoeuvres that have lead to the watering down of Paragraph 12 concerning the rights and freedom of choice of women who fall victim to rape and states of war."
"As far as I am concerned, these rights are not for haggling over."
"Politically speaking, I would be more inclined to interpret the amendment in question, i.e. Amendment No 19, as a tactical defeat or a tactical withdrawal than a compromise on the substance, and in truth that is unworthy of this women' s issue."
"Mr President, in common with other speakers, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her very comprehensive and commendable report containing a series of proposals which decision makers around the world ought to take on board and from which they ought to draw inspiration."
"The problem with a report like this, however, is that it does not list its many proposals in order of priority."
"Nor, I freely admit, was that the intention."
"We are therefore easily in danger, however, of just moving on to the next subject once the vote has taken place."
"I therefore wish to propose that we assign a level of priority to our next step and that we begin with what we can do in practical terms to put these proposals into practice in connection with the civil and military tool which is being developed in the course of these very months."
"I shall therefore urge the Council, Mr Solana and the Commission, including Chris Patten, to go through the many ideas in the report and draw inspiration from them and then introduce these ideas and proposals into the work which is going on right now before our very eyes and the future practical implementation of which we unfortunately do not know very much about."
"It may be a very good test of what all the words regarding equality, mainstreaming, the strengthening of the role of women etc. means in practice."
"Let us begin with practical measures."
"The Council and the Commission ought shortly to be coming back to Parliament with a report on what could be done."
"There are many issues on the table to set to work on, for example, police education or the training of military personnel. There is certainly cause for increasing understanding of the fact that rape really is an atrocity that cannot be accepted, just as we cannot accept torture either."
"There could also be training in involving NGOs and in developing facilities for people affected by crises etc. We could subsequently hold hearings, seminars etc. on these subjects."
"We should also, into the bargain, like to see openness about the whole process and about the development of these preventative measures. If this could happen on the basis of involving women, then we might perhaps, suddenly and quite unexpectedly, have given the EU a human face in one particular area."
"Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my interest in this report and to underscore its excellence."
"Now we have to move on to practical work and I have two topical points to make."
"As regards women, since women are participants in history, they must now become players in the peace process."
"I am one of the ten women MEPs which went as a delegation to the Middle East two weeks ago, so it is topical - Mrs Morgantini will be able to fill you in on the details - not only so that women would be present in the peace process, but also so that there would be a European policy and that we women would support a European policy to promote peace in the Middle East."
"We really need to be practical."
"The second point concerns, not the female peacemakers, but the victims of war. In two weeks' time, there will be a tribunal in Tokyo organised by NGOs."
"This attempt at a tribunal to denounce what 'comfort women' were made to do during the Second World War will take place in December 2000. I call on this Parliament to support it."
"This point is very important because this tribunal also wants to act as a pioneer and to be the first to raise the question of the crimes against humanity committed against women."
"Comfort women, mostly from Korea, were raped and duped into becoming sexual slaves during the Second World War by Japan, which does not want to acknowledge this crime."
"They were held prisoner."
"There is now a film and witness statements which will be presented to this tribunal."
"I hope, Mrs Theorin, that we will take an initiative on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities to support this action with a view to recognising and making reparations for this crime against humanity perpetrated against women."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the participation of women in the peaceful resolution of conflicts is necessary, unfortunately, because of the effect these conflicts have on women' s lives and because women do not traditionally play an active role in such conflicts."
"The majority of refugees are women and children."
"Women are double victims of armed conflicts since they are also subjected to rapes and sexual abuse, which have sometimes been used as weapons of war."
"The serious problems which this causes women are increased, because they are then repudiated in their home communities."
"It has been seen that the participation of women in the resolution of conflicts and in the organisation of refugee camps can be extremely positive."
"We agree that rapes, forced pregnancy, forced sterilisation and any other type of sexual violence should be recognised as crimes against humanity, and legal texts should therefore be updated to protect women effectively."
"Furthermore, there must be financial resources to help women who are victims of this situation."
"Women' s participation in the diplomatic resolution of conflicts and in reconstruction initiatives would be of enormous help in achieving these objectives."
"The training of men in all aspects of gender-related issues would also be of real help to the situation."
"This report, which we consider to be important given the nature of the issue it deals with, is, nevertheless, too repetitive and contains certain elements which we do not like, but we recognise that it deals with a real problem which must be resolved and our group will therefore support it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, currently, 90% of the victims of war and four-fifths of the world' s refugees are non-combatants, mainly women and children. And yet, when we look at the participation of women in decision making about the prevention and resolution of armed conflicts or in peace initiatives, we see that they have a very limited presence."
"We cannot allow this state of affairs to continue, because the rights, priorities and interests of women are often ignored in peace negotiations and also because the few examples of women in decision-making positions in these areas have proved to be very effective."
"I shall mention just two examples that clearly illustrate what I have just said: Mary Robinson, who directs the United Nations' humanitarian aid programmes, has performed her duties with enormous courage and determination, visiting dangerous places in dangerous times, condemning appalling situations, and forcing countries and international bodies not to hide behind a complicit silence and to adopt the measures that are needed."
"Portugal, which only opened up its diplomatic service to women following the ""Revolution of April 1974"" , has recently demonstrated with the case of East Timor and our ambassador to Indonesia, Ana Gomes, how the role of a woman and her sensitivity to the problems and sufferings of a people that fought unaided for its freedom for 25 years can be recognised by the whole world and especially here in the European Parliament."
"The time has come to say ""enough"" to the absence of women in the settlement of this type of problem."
"We must do so in a sensible but determined way, so that in future political leaders will be perfectly aware of the fact that wars are problems that affect everyone and not just men, that women suffer more than anyone and that for this very reason women should be represented in all organisations which address situations of armed conflict."
"Above all, women should be represented in order to sound the alarm and, if possible, to prevent armed conflicts breaking out, or at least to mitigate such situations and to restore dignity to those who are innocent but who are nonetheless the main victims - women and children."
"These are some of the reasons why we shall be voting in favour of this very important report."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Theorin for her excellent report and for the initiatives it proposes."
"As a feminist and a pacifist who is involved, together with other women, in building relations and bridges of peace in places of conflict, I have found that this report contains the wealth of experience gained from many peace-building projects carried out by women in recent years."
"Peace is more than the absence of war: it is recognition of economic and social justice."
"It is true that we women are those who suffer most in war zones but we are more than just victims: we are the bearers of alternatives to war and violence and the builders and protagonists of change."
"There is the example of the international network of the 'Women in Black' who are against war and violence and have been demonstrating for 12 years in Israel against the military occupation of Palestine, in dialogue and solidarity with Palestinian women."
"We women Members of Parliament also saw them during our visit to the Middle East at this tragic time."
"Similarly, during the war in the former Yugoslavia, the 'Women in Black' of Belgrade built up relationships with Croatian and Bosnian women. In various different countries of the world, we have transcended borders, united in the refusal to abide by national allegiance."
"But these projects and the skills which women have, diplomacy on a practical level, which provides an alternative to State diplomacy, can no longer be disregarded; they must be used in decision-making forums and at all levels of diplomacy."
"This is why more women must be involved in negotiations, in prevention operations, in management ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, a great deal has already been said and I am not about to lapse into repetition."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Theorin for broaching a subject at European level that we have rarely discussed."
"When I listen to the various comments made, I find myself agreeing with those who recommend that we take a look at our priorities and then limit the number of aims we want to achieve."
"There is a great deal in the report and we will not be able to do everything straightaway."
"I will mention several of my own priorities."
"Firstly, we must urge all the Member States to ratify the Treaty of Rome."
"Remarkably few have done so up to now; only two or three, so I am told."
"So achieving that alone would be a start."
"It is recognised in this Treaty that rape committed during wars, and all the consequences thereof, must be regarded as a war crime."
"Perhaps that is exactly what you would expect in this day and age, but it certainly was not the norm up until very recently, nor did it happen as a matter of course."
"Secondly, on 31 October a resolution was approved in the Security Council, namely resolution 1325, which 'calls for broad participation of women in peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction""."
"I am referring to the Security Council of the United Nations."
"I think it would be worthwhile, under the circumstances, for the European Union to take a look at what points were raised too, because they have been adopted within the United Nations, and so they must also be taken on board at European level."
"Around eighteen points were raised, which is quite a few."
"Once again, my congratulations, and let us hope that something comes of it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Theorin on her excellent own-initiative report, which deals with an important and topical issue, i.e. how the fundamental participation of women in negotiations to resolve conflicts can change the world and turn the dominant culture of confrontation and violence into a culture of peace, dialogue and democratic conflict resolution."
"This is made possible by the fact that, historically, women as a whole have stood for non-violence, have different experiences from men of war and conflict and devote all their time to protecting life with dialogue, reconciliation and negotiation."
"These pacific qualities in women could provide an alternative solution, the basis for the foundations of a new civilisation, a civilisation of peace, in which dialogue is protected at all levels and from which war and violence are excluded as a means of resolving differences."
"The absence of women, and of the pacific system of women, is all the more noticeable in areas in crisis, such as the Middle East, which I visited recently."
"I am convinced that if women, both Palestinian and Israeli, had a say and a role in the peace process, there is every likelihood that a fair and viable solution to the Palestinian question would have been found and we would not now be facing the present crisis, which is the outcome of 7 whole years of failed negotiation."
"In the case of Iraq, which I visited as a member of a mission to contest the embargo in practice, women would not, under any circumstances, have put political or military objectives above human life and would not have sacrificed 6,000 innocent children a month in the name of any form of political, economic or strategic interest in the area."
"That is why this dimension needs to be taken into account when drawing up European Union policies in the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to concur with the many interventions and congratulations delivered by other speakers, and I would particularly like to echo the sentiments expressed by Mrs Theorin in connection with the role of women in the peaceful resolution of conflicts."
"It is an illuminating report, which has been drafted with great expertise. Some will even find it shocking in its boldness and honesty, but at least it tells the truth."
"That is why I support the full report in its almost original form and we feel that the majority of the amendments tabled by our colleagues have the effect of watering it down and are even downright hypocritical in some cases."
"Mrs Theorin has written a combative report and we hope that the aid for adoption centres will not be scrapped, see Amendment No 19c. The Greens do not support the compromise text drawn up by our fellow delegates in connection with Amendment No 19."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Theorin on her boldness and strength of purpose."
"Mr President, in my view, Mrs Theorin's report goes a long way towards meeting the requirement that women should have equal social status."
"She has chosen her words carefully in denouncing violations of women's dignity and in demanding action to achieve change."
"The report not only refers to the social exclusion of women as a problem in itself, it also rightly emphasises that protection against criminality and personal safety are no longer something that can be guaranteed solely within national borders."
"I therefore support the demands made in the report for women to be given the right to diplomatic influence."
"I support the initiative taken in this report and I support the statement contained in it that sexually abused women need the Community's protection and that it is high time the perpetrators stopped going unpunished."
"Women and men, and people in general, are all different."
"Equal opportunities means treating people differently - but how they are treated is still determined by the people themselves."
"Mr President, the report by Mrs Theorin includes many bizarre and curious elements, and I have to say we should avoid the notion that armies are some sort of social service and that their guiding motive should be political correctness."
"I want to focus briefly on just one paragraph of the report - Paragraph 3 - which condemns the use of so-called child soldiers."
"Unfortunately terms are not defined and distinctions are not made."
"We all condemn unreservedly the brutal abduction of children, some not even in their teens, particularly in certain African countries such as Sierra Leone or Uganda, and their corruption into murderous habits and involvement in barbaric practices such as mutilation and maiming."
"These are not soldiers and they should be distinguished from young people in our own armed forces."
"The trouble is that when we talk of child soldiers, then some interest groups use this as an opportunity to criticise distinguished institutions such as the British Army and this has happened recently."
"As a guiding principle, we try to avoid sending young people into operational areas, but sometimes it happens and they serve with pride in well-disciplined units."
"We should really avoid any possibility of confusing such honourable activity - which should be encouraged - with the sort of barbarism which I am sure the author of this report has in mind."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Theorin on this magnificent report and I believe that all of us, as women, should be happy, since it is we who are going to benefit directly or indirectly from her courageous and innovative proposals and contributions."
"Mr President, this report opens up new territory in European policy, that of women' s' contribution to peace."
"In my view, this territory is full of possibilities and could surely change the grim landscape of failures which, for centuries, have resulted from the exclusive domination of men."
"In this field there has been nothing but shameful failures but nevertheless we are still faced with a brick wall which excludes women."
"This is a very well informed, in-depth, and rigorous report, which is capable of stating fundamental principles with the clarity demonstrated in Paragraph 17. It is audacious but, at the same time, contains considerable practical sense and very necessary proposals."
"Mr President, it is a great shame that it has had to be diminished for the sake of reaching a consensus!"
"My only consolation is that this says a great deal about Mrs Theorin' s parliamentary abilities."
"It is shameful that nobody is here representing the Council."
"Mr President, please tell me who is representing the Council at the moment, or the High Representative for the CFSP."
"The new Common Foreign and Security Policy cannot be created by ignoring Parliament' s proposals or the will of the European women who wish to participate in it."
"Please communicate our protest to the Council."
"The absence of the Council in this debate is a grave error."
"Mr President, it is usual to begin a speech by saying thank you for a job well done."
"In my case, it is impossible to do that because I think that Mrs Theorin' s report ought to be rejected."
"I also think that the draftsperson of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is on shaky ground when she maintains that there is broad support for a report adopted on the basis of eight votes in favour and five against."
"It is an insult to Parliament to use an own-initiative report to push issues not covered by the mandate."
"Mrs Theorin was to write an own-initiative report on women' s participation in peaceful conflict resolution."
"Instead, the report deals with everything from the conditions experienced by women in refugee camps to the ways in which women develop strength and active influence."
"In her eagerness to oppose everything that is evil, systematic rape and sexual slavery are condemned."
"I for my part want to condemn all rape and all slavery."
"There are points in the report, for example the issue of the various diplomatic corps, which might well be suited to a report that could be seriously discussed across all the committees, with parties concerned with foreign and security policy also involved in the discussion."
"Mrs Theorin fought for a long time to stop Sweden becoming a member of the European Union."
"Now, she is suddenly campaigning for the EU to determine which officials our foreign administration is to appoint."
"There is a lack of consistency here."
"Let us instead make conflict resolution an issue through which the conditions for peace at all levels and involving all players can be strengthened, rather than getting bogged down in gender issues."
"I strongly object to the attitude of mind, expressed in this Chamber this evening, whereby one sex is made collectively guilty."
"I think it is an insult to all those men who have died to defend freedom, peace and democracy in their own countries or in the context of peacekeeping efforts."
"To create antagonism between the sexes, as there is a determination to do in this Chamber this evening, is neither peaceful nor constructive in my view."
"That is why I and many others in addition to myself intend voting against this report tomorrow."
"I do not, in fact, consider it to be a serious piece of work."
". (EL) Mr President, I think this really is an innovative report, an innovative resolution, one which introduces a new dimension into foreign policy in a very specific manner."
"No one can claim that women would make better generals or better negotiators."
"No one can claim that women are more democratic or more supportive of peace."
"But what is clear in the resolution is that a basic social component is missing every time there is any political crisis management, every time there is any political conflict management and every time war takes its toll on society."
"The gender dimension is missing."
"Women are not people with fewer or more capabilities, they just have a different take on society."
"They are people with different experiences and these experiences are essential to the way in which policy is applied, especially in conflict management."
"This state of affairs is described in the report with interesting and often shocking details."
"However, I agree with some of the lady members who said that we need very specific objectives and measures if the gender dimension is to inform policies, programmes and individual projects."
"Allow me to refer to some of the basic recommendations in the resolution which require action by the Commission."
"First, the recommendation about raising the awareness of both sexes of initiatives for peace and security is, as far as the rapid reaction facility is concerned, already contained in the regulation which will be voted on 4 December and which clearly states that security and stability beyond the borders of the European Union must take account of the physical integrity of men and women wherever it is threatened."
"Secondly, there are the regulations for human rights."
"These regulations provide for a legal basis for our political activities vis-à-vis third countries as regards action taken by the Union to prevent conflict, deal with its consequences, implement confidence-building measures, promote humanitarian law and support international, regional and local organisations involved in conflict prevention."
"All these projects funded by the European Commission already include the gender dimension."
"Take the example of Angola: last year it received funding so that women and women's organisations could participate in endeavours to achieve final settlement of the crisis."
"The third element is the participation of the European Community in rehabilitating victims of torture."
"One of our aims is to pay particular attention to the special needs of women. The first example occurred last year, with initiatives taken to provide medical, psychological and social support to exiled women in Bosnia."
"The fourth example is the important role of women in the peace process which the European Community is supporting in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean basin."
"The fifth point is the role of ECHO, the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office, which has been invited by Parliament to help evaluate the gender dimension."
"I must say that, as a rule, ECHO programmes do take account of the gender dimension and an effort is always made to include the gender dimension in many of the programmes funded by ECHO for the benefit of other organisations, such as the High Commissioner of the United Nations, the International Federation of Red Cross Societies and others."
"And we have implemented specific projects over recent years on women's protection, health and social status and large chunks of the programmes are dedicated to them."
"Finally, I should like to refer to the European Refugee Fund."
"Article 4.2 states that, as far as terms of acceptance and access to asylum procedures are concerned, special measures may be taken for people who are especially vulnerable, such as women."
"Again in connection with this programme, because it is mentioned in the resolution, I should point out that projects are undertaken by the Member States."
"At the Commission's initiative, 5% of the resources may be provided for special projects, such as training civil servants at reception centres, the police and public hygiene officials in how to deal with the special needs of women refugees."
"As the resolution stresses, the European Fund takes account, where possible, of the gender dimension in this activity."
"Mr President, what is clear is that we are witnessing an initial stage in which the gender dimension, the participation of women, is starting to become, if not the rule, then at least an element in various programmes."
"Clearly it is not enough."
"Clearly it is an initial stage, but I think that, with political action and initiatives such as this resolution and with specific objectives which both Parliament and the Commission must set, we may bring about a change."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Before we continue with the agenda, I would like to make two comments."
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo complained earlier about the lack of a Council representative."
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, the Council never attends sittings in the evening."
"Part of the problem is that when we arrange the agenda we postpone important subjects until the evening."
"The Conference of Presidents is responsible for this, and if we wish to change this, then we need to make sure that debates on renewable energy sources or important women's issues are not scheduled for the evening, because, as I have said, the Council is never present at that time."
"If I may make a personal comment, I believe that we would make rather more progress, regardless of what you may think about the contribution of the only man taking part in this debate, if more men participated in debates of this kind."
"Regulating domestic help"
"The next item is the report (A5-0301/2000) by Mrs Smet, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on regulating domestic help in the informal sector (2000/2021(INI))."
"Mr President, we are now descending to the level of a more everyday problem, namely the regulation of domestic work performed by third parties in private families, for that is the subject under discussion."
"The problem is that millions of people, particularly women, undertake this type of work, and there is a huge demand for it, but it is not subject to any regulations whatsoever."
"It would appear, from the limited amount of information available, to be a very extensive sector."
"I have therefore tried to establish, in various countries, but also at European level, how many people - insofar as this can be established, because the people concerned are often working 'on the black' of course - work in this sector."
"There are many millions of them."
"I have sought in vain at European level for an all-encompassing study that could give us an idea of the scale of the sector and the problems within it, the regulations - however incomplete they may be - in the European countries, the pilot projects, and any experiments that may have been instigated by the left or right, but I have to say that there was nothing to be found in the Commission."
"Hence my first suggestion to the Commission: set up an inquiry, get the funding for this - assuming it is needed - from the funding for women' s studies, for example, because this issue mainly concerns women after all, or get it from the funding for poverty studies because it is often poor women that do this type of work."
"So I think both sources of funding should be considered, with a view to carrying out a comprehensive study of the issue and to finding out what kind of initiatives people are trying to get off the ground in particular countries."
"That was my first specific question."
"Secondly, if it is our intention to regulate the sector, then naturally we need to investigate a number of aspects."
"The first aspect concerns the reconciliation of supply and demand."
"It is not just the case that the demand for domestic help is on the increase whilst the supply of willing applicants is dwindling."
"After all, who wants to work in a sector when you know it has to be done 'on the black' , and without social security, etc., etc. In addition, there is nowhere at all where supply and demand can be matched."
"So that is one aspect."
"A second aspect is that the cost to the employer, i.e. the private family that employs domestic help on the regular market, the white market, must not be notably higher than the cost of such labour on the black market, because otherwise it stands to reason that undeclared work will remain the order of the day."
"A third aspect is that the employee, i.e. the domestic help, must stand to earn more than they would from working 'on the black' ."
"Fourthly, we need to look into what kind of social statute can be established in this connection."
"Finally, all this will inevitably involve financial intervention from the government, be it fiscal or parafiscal, because a private family would not be able to afford a full statute, even a limited one, and then they would all carry on taking people from the black market."
"I believe the best thing to do would be to spur the Member States on to regulate the sector, via the employment guidelines, as has already been called for in Parliament' s opinion on these guidelines."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commission what efforts it is going to make in future to adapt the employment guidelines, at least in terms of including this service in the section on services, and when does it intend to ask the Member States to start finding a solution to these problems?"
"I now come to my final point, that of migrant women, which is, of course, a very specific problematic area."
"Many migrant women are here illegally in that they enter on a tourist visa and go back every three months, for example, to the Eastern block countries, to have the visa renewed, and work here as a domestic help in the meantime."
"In some cases they are exploited and ill-treated."
"There is no one to help them."
"They fear that if they were to turn to someone their illegal situation would be exposed."
"Hence it is imperative that we give special attention to their plight."
"I have discovered over the past few weeks that there is a great deal of interest, both within international trade union circles and within a number of national trade union organisations."
"I have had dealings with the Dutch, the Belgians and the Italians over this issue."
"I would therefore advise the Commission to at least make a start on the search for a solution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, domestic work is the oldest work that women have carried out."
"This work has not been recognised or valued, either economically or socially."
"Today it is part of what we call the hidden economy and this has a negative effect on those who carry it out and also on states' finances."
"However, it is a form of work with a flexible timetable, which is of great assistance in reconciling family life with professional life."
"Changes in family circumstances mean that this work is of increasing importance in the world of work, and it is therefore essential that this type of work be defined and that studies be carried out to assess the numbers of people involved."
"This is an area of work that must be fully recognised and that should be included in the directives on employment to regulate the social rights of the worker."
"The countries of the Union today have greatly differing situations, which should be standardised."
"The workers, mostly women, should be provided with access to training."
"The immigrant population is usually a significant group in this sector, and this requires special measures, such as specialised reception centres, which provide the necessary assistance."
"This initiative report is very timely, since it deals with a growing need within the labour market."
"Mrs Smet has done a wonderful job and of course we are going to support it."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to pay tribute to Mrs Smet for initiating the drafting of this report."
"What we are in fact dealing with here is the breaking of a political taboo."
"Because if you believe that domestic work should be recognised as an occupation in its own right, and Mrs Smet says that, and I echo her sentiments, then what you meet with in the first instance is disbelief and a lack of understanding."
"I shall evaluate some of these arguments."
"Argument one: should domestic work actually be defined as labour?"
"Should it feature among the labour statistics?"
"The answer is 'yes' , but then we will need a European definition, and the countries, the governments, will have to make more effort to get the issue of illegal work out into the open."
"Argument two: are you in favour of introducing pay for housewives?"
"The answer is 'no' ."
"Any one demanding this is confusing two issues."
"What we are discussing here is paid domestic service undertaken by third parties in private households."
"We talk in terms of the 'werkster' (cleaning/char lady) in the Netherlands, and the 'poetsvrouw' (same meaning) in Belgium, where they also use the word 'interieur verzorgster' (interior attendant)."
"How amusing."
"Argument three."
"Regulating the work done by cleaning ladies would simply be making undeclared work all above board, and surely that would make it far too expensive?"
"Now we have reached the heart of the matter."
"Domestic work is performed by the type of person who stands the least chance on the labour market."
"Women with an inadequate and out-of-date educational background, etc., etc. They are completely reliant on domestic work with irregular working hours and no form of legal security or social protection whatsoever."
"This form of exploitation takes place because the employers, i.e. the families that the domestic helps work for, can claim complete innocence, given the lack of legislation."
"However, since there is going to be increased demand for domestic servants owing to social changes, it is high time we reviewed the relationship between the domestic workers, the employers and the authorities."
"The question as to how exactly we should go about this, requires a great deal more study and deliberation."
"But whatever happens, we must ensure that this type of work is established in a legal and social framework which affords those concerned recognition and social security cover, and which improves the quality of the work itself."
"This would also benefit the employers and so it would be quite reasonable to expect them to make a proportionate contribution to the costs involved."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur."
"Allow me to state that domestic work is important."
"It must be respected, and it needs to be valued more highly."
"Those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are therefore able to back most of the report' s conclusions."
"We shall nonetheless be voting against the report as a whole in the light of the subsidiarity principle."
"This is an issue for the Member States."
"Certain proposals are too detailed."
"The following are nonetheless important points for the Member States to take into account. Attention needs to be given to situations in which women have two jobs."
"Domestic work is often heavy, involving many places of work. Wages are too low, there is an increase in illicit work, and a situation often prevails in which women, often immigrants, are the first to be exploited."
"Many end up outside the social security systems."
"In the interests of a social Europe, the Member States have an urgent duty to ensure that immigrant women, often from the applicant States, obtain tolerable working conditions."
"A broader approach to domestic work would enable many people, including young people and immigrants, to see such work as a good way of getting into the labour market."
"'Legitimate' domestic help is often too expensive nowadays when VAT and employers' charges have to be paid."
"Experiments involving tax deductions and ways of simplifying the system ought to be made."
"It must be made easier to start up and run companies which provide domestic help."
"In my own country, Sweden, two main arguments are often advanced against facilitating paid domestic help."
"First of all, that it would militate against equality between men and women."
"Wrong!"
"It would make things easier for many families and increase equality."
"Many women can opt to have careers and go out to work if they are given help with practical tasks - perhaps that is the case for some of the women in this Chamber."
"The second argument is that it would create a B team within the labour market."
"Wrong!"
"All those who are at present engaged in illicit work would obtain work with decent social conditions."
"There are therefore both economic and moral reasons in favour of the report's intentions, but these issues must be resolved at national rather than EU level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a very interesting report on the regulation of domestic help which the rapporteur, Mrs Smet, has tabled, but I do in fact have mixed feelings about it."
"It is, of course, absolutely essential to try to get to grips with illicit work within different sectors of society, especially when it comes to domestic services."
"It is also high time that we accorded more status to work in the home and recognised domestic work as a perfectly valid occupation."
"It is important, too, to ensure that immigrant women are not exploited in terms of everything from poor wages to a lack of social security and outright oppression."
"To demand, as proposed in the report, that the Member States use a directive or some other form of legislation both to adjust prices and to offer tax deductions for domestic services would, however, be to send out a completely wrong signal."
"It would be to go too far and would also be the wrong route to take."
"It is inconsistent with the determination to see domestic work as a perfectly valid occupation."
"What, in fact, is the rationale behind saying that you are to have tax deductions for having your floors polished but not for having your rubbish taken away?"
"To see domestic services as something completely different from other services is not at all the same thing as raising the status of domestic work."
"Finally, I just want to add that I should like to have seen a report which acknowledged that, within the near future, we shall be in great need of the manpower offered by our immigrants."
"Mr President, Commissioner, domestic helps, who were formerly almost exclusively employed by more wealthy households, nowadays provide much-needed and essential support for working men and women and, above all, for single mothers and the elderly."
"Demand has risen many times over in recent years, and yet this fact has scarcely been taken into account in general working life and as regards the rights and duties involved."
"Just where does this activity fit into the scheme of things?"
"We need a legal framework that recognises domestic work, which is given many different names, as a fully fledged job in all Member States, and which provides for the implementation of appropriate labour law provisions."
"A pan-European description of domestic work as an occupation is needed, bringing in the social partners, and where this does not exist employment policy guidelines should be adopted."
"However, defining domestic work is certainly difficult."
"Where do you draw the dividing lines with such a variety of domestic duties?"
"Is domestic work just cleaning or cooking, or just child care or just gardening?"
"The fact is that there are thousands of women who have been doing all these jobs for years without insurance cover or pension rights."
"Of course, both employers and workers - generally both women - are often happy with this state of affairs, which saves money."
"We need to educate people and to expand and improve the basic framework that already exists in some countries, so as to provide incentives to phase out the present grey economy."
"In Austria, and especially in my own region, an EU-assisted project involving a women's advice centre acting as an agency for domestic helps has been very successfully running for three years."
"Many women have been able to obtain a permanent job through this work."
"In addition, as a result of this project, two or three families have often clubbed together to employ a domestic help."
"What we are talking about is registering every contractual relationship between employer and employee and ultimately enhancing the work prospects of domestic employees."
"Mr President, I am forced to admit, following Mrs Smet's report to Parliament, which I welcome, that I am in the unfortunate position of having to say that the Commission has no special policy or information on regulating domestic help in the informal sector and on transferring domestic help from the informal to the legal economy."
"Of course, we do have the Commission communication on undeclared work which was recently adopted by Parliament and which could be used as a basis, including by the Member States in collaboration with the Commission, for policies to bring domestic work within the legal economy."
"According to the communication, the first two basic steps are, first, you must record and compile statistics on domestic help - as Mrs Smet has said, there are as yet no statistics at European level or in many Member States on this problem - and, secondly, you must deal with it by integrating it into the overall strategy on employment."
"This strategy to transfer undeclared workers to the legal economy calls for a combination of individual policies which might be sanctions in the case of exploitation, information campaigns, which are needed at all levels, on the benefits of legalising these people and, thirdly, constant effort to harmonise and modernise legislation."
"We have little experience and few Member States have specifically tackled the problem of domestic help."
"I am loath at present to commit myself and say that we could tackle it through the employment guidelines for 2002."
"However, what I can say is that the guidelines for 2001 are the first to clearly mention undeclared work and that we intend to work on the basis of the proposal in the conclusions and compile statistics and studies to record the problem so that we can hold a second debate and discuss what the next step should be at European level."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)"
"Address by Mr Kostunica, President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"
"Mr President, it is with tremendous pleasure, profound respect for you and the people of Yugoslavia, and with great hope for the future that is opening up in your country and in the new relations between us that the European Parliament welcomes you here today."
"I extended this invitation to you on the very day on which the result of the democratic elections left us with no shadow of a doubt of the will of the people, which had been expressed freely and overwhelmingly in your favour."
"Now that the dark pages of the last ten years have been turned, your presence before this House bears witness to our common desire to see Yugoslavia quickly rediscover its rightful place in the family of Europe."
"You expressed this wish yourself when you took office and, for its part, the European Union immediately made the first significant gesture of confidence that you were seeking, the lifting of international sanctions."
"We were sitting in the first part-session in October when, at the time we were debating the situation in Yugoslavia, we learned of the courageous reaction of the Serbian people and, ladies and gentlemen, you well remember I am sure, we immediately called for international sanctions to be lifted."
"But the jubilation accompanying this great victory for freedom, which you gained by peaceful means at great risk to your own freedom, must not lead us to underestimate the enormous challenges that await you: the consolidation of democracy; the restoration of peace and harmony among all the communities living in Yugoslavia; its reconstruction with a view to rediscovering the road to prosperity; its peaceful relations with its neighbours; the return of displaced people to their villages; those missing in action, whose families desperately wait for news; the necessary cooperation, when the time comes, with the International Court of Justice in the Hague, to ensure that what took place can never happen again and, finally, of course, the institutional future of Kosovo, whose wounds are still open, as well as the future of Montenegro."
"The European Parliament is indeed well aware that, after ten years of conflict, not everything is possible in Yugoslavia, at least not straightaway, and that urgent actions need prioritising. The Balkans, to which you belong, are on the dividing line between the great civilisations and religions which have, all too often, left their tragic mark on our common past as Europeans - on you and us alike."
"As regards the most sensitive issues that remain to be resolved, notably in relation to Kosovo, the European Parliament has always hoped that peaceful solutions will be found, in accordance with UN resolutions on the integrity and sovereignty of Yugoslavia, in terms of fundamental human rights."
"Rest assured, Mr President, that it is in this spirit that the European Parliament, co-decider of the Community budget, will lend you its full support so that European aid for the reconstruction of your country is truly in line with its needs."
"More specifically, as far as necessary emergency measures are concerned, as you know, on Monday, the first convoy of tankers transporting heating fuel and heating oil from the European Union arrived in your country."
"As your Minister for Mines and Energy, Mr Antic, so aptly remarked, I see in this the proof that Serbia has friends in Europe."
"I would like to conclude by saying that the European Union is preparing to welcome more than ten countries from Central and Eastern Europe who have regained their own freedom and democracy."
"Their accession will be a major step towards the reunification, in an expression of solidarity, of the family of states and peoples that make up Europe."
"I am certain that there are many of us in this Chamber who are in no doubt that, one day, if Yugoslavia so wishes, the doors of the European Union will open to welcome it in. This would be entirely natural, as we are on the same continent of Europe and we share the same values."
"Mr President, we are very much looking forward to your address and we hope it will trace out the paths of our rediscovered cooperation and brotherhood, which we will henceforth be travelling along together."
"(Sustained applause)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, is there any political institution before which we could talk more openly and sincerely about the historic wishes and political aspirations of a small European people than the European Parliament?"
"Europe is lucky to have such a representative body elected directly by citizens, although, for the time being, we are talking about a rather small number of countries."
"It is also a great pleasure to lay before such a forum, even in this brief address of mine, the internal problems of a country that, having gone through its own historic storm, has finally made out the coast of peace and freedom on the horizon."
"There is no better landmark for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in its state recovery and social development than the European Union."
"It is crystal clear that it will take time before our country will be truly able to become a member of this grandiose transnational establishment."
"But now, in the wake of the decisive political turn of 24 September, or the even more decisive shift of 5 October, the major goal in Yugoslavia's foreign policy is to approach in a comprehensive manner a family of nations comprising the European Union and then join it."
"It is precisely the European Union's experience that sets a shining example not only for European countries that have yet to join, but also the whole world, when it comes to a direction mankind should take if it wishes to leave behind force, wars and domination as the means to achieve particular national interests."
"Having created this community of nation states, the European Union has opened the perspective of a new era for all mankind."
"And not only in terms of the results achieved, but, perhaps even more so, in terms of the way in which they were achieved."
"Thereby Europe has demonstrated the vitality of its civilisation within the framework of world history, and its capacity for creative political imagination for its future development."
"Just as the onset of the new century coincided with Europe's invention of a new political forum, the nation state, whereby it overcame the crisis of medieval particularism, in this post-modern time of ours Europe has invented a higher form of political organisation, a transnational community which helped it meet the challenges of globalisation."
"The European Union model is a double challenge for Yugoslavia as a Balkan country."
"First of all, we in principle prefer a non-coercive way of integration into European economic, cultural and political courses, given that we have encountered different domination strategies devised by great powers throughout our contemporary history."
"Secondly, the step-by-step approach Western European countries have taken towards integration is a model we should adopt in the Balkan processes of integration in order to qualify for entry into the European Union."
"We are aware that none of the Balkan countries will be able to join the European Union on its own, which makes it clear we have to develop good neighbourly relations, free trade and collective security structures first."
"We are certain that the European Union will support precisely that kind of development of South-Eastern Europe, and contribute to overcoming the historic shortcomings of those countries through the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe and in other ways."
"It is because of our firm commitment to step on the soil of European development that we wish to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union as soon as possible, and use the provisions of the agreement to direct our political and economic recovery, and subsequent development, towards European integration. We are aware that in that desirable case we would have to change many of our habits and institutions of political and economic life, both as a people and as a state."
"Not only should we build democratic institutions, a task we have already embarked on, we should also imbue them with the democratic spirit, which may prove much more difficult."
"Not only are we to carry out privatisation of our centralised economy, but also create a legal system that would guarantee the freedom of business operations and the entire economic process."
"Not only are we to create the internal system of freedom and peace, but also harmonise it with the rules and customs that the European Community and the European Union have maintained for decades."
"Simultaneously with building the confidence of our citizens in our state institutions, we have to persuade them to trust the European institutions that, in nearly fifty years of their existence, have brought to their citizens lasting peace and prosperity."
"The democratic changes that began in Yugoslavia on 5 October have produced at miraculous speed extraordinary results on the international political plane."
"Yugoslavia has regained its seats in the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, joined the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, while proceedings for its admission to the Council of Europe have been initiated."
"Our most important task now is to begin to settle democratically internal relations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"Kosovo, of course, is unquestionably our most difficult problem."
"There cannot be any doubt that the issue of Kosovo's status is a democratic issue."
"We have proceeded from the point that the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 offers possibilities of intensifying many important humanitarian and democratic processes."
"We need European assistance and support in securing the return of Kosovo refugees to their hearths as soon as possible in the spirit of the best democratic traditions."
"Of course, we need great help in rehabilitating their destroyed homes so that the refugees have somewhere to return."
"We call upon Europe to come resolutely to our aid in creating security and the economic conditions to help the exiled feel completely safe on return to their homes."
"I believe Europe has both the strength and the will to help us exercise the fundamental right of each and every human being to live in his own home."
"Also, we will need Europe's assistance in establishing and resolving the great ecological problems caused by the use of depleted uranium in the bombing of Yugoslavia."
"We are ready to begin open dialogue with Albanian parties about political, humanitarian, security and all other key issues of relevance to a democratic solution to Serbian-Albanian relations in Kosovo."
"When it comes to relations between Serbia and Montenegro within the federal state, the former, non-democratic organisation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia seriously threatened the functioning of the state."
"The first step ahead of us in a bid to restructure the federal state constitutionally is to define a framework for the broadest possible democratic dialogue about the character of relations between the two republics."
"It will take a lot of patience and wisdom for us to identify, through talks in the republican and federal parliaments and a wide public and expert debate, the best solution for restructuring the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into a good, operational, rich and just state that cares about the interests of its citizens, and safeguards the full equality of the nation-building traditions of Montenegro and Serbia."
"It is important to say that Muslims and Albanians inhabit Serbia and Montenegro in significant numbers."
"There is not a single good reason for them not to be a factor of integration in Yugoslavia."
"A democratic joint state makes it possible for Muslims and Albanians in Montenegro and Serbia to live in a single state, and enables us to join forces in building our equally joint state."
"Support from Europe is essential in our effort to seek solutions through sincere dialogues only and with respect for full democratic procedure, without pressures and ultimatums on any part."
"On the other hand, we would like to be given a chance to prove to Europe that we are able to develop the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia on our own, by recognising the genuine principles of democracy."
"Development and local self-rule inYugoslavia is the issue we pay special attention to."
"We are aware that it is the very core of any democratic system, and it is with due consideration that we are analysing European and our own experiences in developing local self-government."
"The grave situation in the Yugoslav economy has been discussed at length."
"The humanitarian aid to our country that has been initiated is priceless, but we hope that Europe will replace it with investment programmes that would make it possible for us to work and earn enough for a normal life."
"Bearing in mind all these enormous problems, it is clear that our road to rightful entry into Europe, in which Serbia and Montenegro used to have places worthy of them, will be a long one."
"Yet it is certain that our chances today are much more realistic than they were a mere month and a half ago."
"Perhaps the citizens of the European Union can understand that best if they evoke their historic memory and those long-past years after World War II, when the prospects for the Continent and European civilisation itself were extremely uncertain."
"Then your brave predecessors embarked on an uncertain project that bore historic fruit."
"You, the representatives of the European Parliament, who directly represent the citizens of its member countries, the citizens of Europe, are best placed to understand why the very possibility of entry into Europe seems extremely uncertain to us, the citizens of the present-day Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"Therefore, as the first democratically elected President of Yugoslavia, I am turning to you not so much because of much needed assistance in the reconstruction of the country as because of your support and understanding of the situation our people and our state are in."
"After all, Europe is a home we all share."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"Let us resume our session."
"I should explain to you that there appears to be a gremlin in the system somewhere in the building."
"The people who installed the system have been here for some time trying to find out where the problem is."
"It seems to be an intermittent problem."
"I hope it can be resolved as soon as possible."
"The Minutes of the previous day's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, on page 27 of the annex to the Minutes my vote is recorded as having been cast in favour of Amendment No 20 to the Morillon report."
"I do not subscribe to the views of that amendment and I would wish that my vote be recorded as having been cast against it."
"That will be put in order in the next Minutes, Mr Watson."
"Mr President, on behalf of Mrs van der Laan and myself I want to register that we voted against Amendment No 15 in the Morillon report."
"We want to be registered as voting in favour of the release of Leyla Zana and the other Kurdish prisoners."
"Mr President, it might be helpful if I could make a procedural point on this matter."
"Yesterday my group, as in so many votes in this House, were on automatic pilot, but some of us rather crash-landed, as we discovered, in the vote in respect of Amendment No 15, which was from the GUE Group and called for the release of Mrs Zana and others. We had voted the wrong way."
"I have already had a correction made but I would ask you formally to facilitate through the day the possibility for colleagues in the ELDR Group to contact sessional services."
"Some are not here now, partly because of the interruption and partly because the issue had not been foreseen."
"I would welcome your assistance in the matter."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, what I have to say concerns rather the future than the past, in other words, I would just like to make sure that we are to vote on the BSE issue in today' s vote."
"This is a very important matter for the public, and one that is of interest to them, and it would be only right to get a decision on the matter this afternoon."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"Public access to documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission"
"The next item is the report (A5-0318/2000) by Mr Cashman on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents [COM(2000) 30 - C5-0057/2000 - 2000/0032(COD)]."
"I have the honour to present this report on a subject that is crucial to the lives of the people we represent and, indeed, to the future of the Union."
"My aim throughout the report has been to produce a proposal which is politically mature, eminently reasonable and practical for both the institutions and the citizen."
"I believe my report reflects that and the view of my fellow rapporteur, Mrs Maij-Weggen, to whom I pay special tribute."
"Let me stress that this is a legal text; it must be detailed and watertight."
"It is not an information pamphlet."
"That will come later."
"However, I regret that the report has been misrepresented by some for short-term political gain."
"A few cheap headlines, a few inches of print remove such people from reality."
"This report is even more urgent in light of the rules which were adopted by the Council in August, the so-called 'Solana Decision' ."
"My report specifically states that the August Decision should be repealed along with other decisions."
"What we are seeking is a change of culture."
"As a collection of 15 Member States we approach the issue of public access to documents differently, but I am glad to see that, largely, the European Parliament stands as a bulwark against the forces which seek to keep the doors of the institutions closed to the public."
"Access to documents and information regarding the activities of the institutions enables citizens to hold the EU governing bodies accountable and stimulates greater efficiency."
"I remain confident that, with the crucial input of Mrs Maij-Weggen, we have produced a mature and sensible text and introduced revolutionary changes for the institutions, but also real and tangible benefits for the European citizens."
"It is clear that Article 255 of the Treaty permits a broader interpretation of citizens' access to documents of the institutions, so allow me to outline some of the changes in my report."
"All the institutions and bodies covered by Article 255 should be expressly stated in the regulation and should include not only committees and working groups, but all agencies created by the institutions."
"All documents of the institutions should be public unless there is good reason why they should not be - based on a harm test and on a limited number of exceptions."
"These exceptions are discretionary, not as others would have you believe, mandatory."
"The term 'document' should be interpreted widely and must include internal documents of the institutions, although information documents, the 'space to think' , can be excluded."
"As in the Commission proposal, a register of documents should be established. It should contain documents which are directly accessible."
"It should also include documents which are classified as 'non public' with the exception that applies."
"That way, the public knows of the documents and can challenge such classification."
"Furthermore, access to documents must be user-friendly via the Internet or traditional methods and there will be ongoing scrutiny - extremely important - of the new process and implementation by Parliament."
"I would like to clarify some other aspects."
"The classification system outlined in my report is intended to make the process of access to documents easier."
"An application for a document would challenge the application of the exception."
"At the time of the request for a document, the application of the exception must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis."
"What we must ensure is that the existing or future interinstitutional agreements, referred to in my report, have as their legal basis the Article 255 rule in order to ensure that a coherent framework is agreed between the institutions, with the maximum right of access for the citizen."
"Some Members have suggested that in my text I come too close to the Council and Commission view."
"In fact, the fundamental problems which the Council and Commission foresee with my report are, interestingly enough, the very same differences apparent between the majority of Parliament and some of the smaller groups in this House."
"Therefore, I urge the Council and Commission to embrace the change."
"The Union must move closer to the citizen."
"It must be more accountable and more transparent, especially as we approach enlargement."
"Together we must seize this opportunity and together solve the problems that it poses."
"I urge the House to support my report."
"Mr President, it was a long time before the European Commission submitted a proposal in the field of openness of government."
"A number of MEPs had been asking for one for years."
"At the beginning of this part-session I even submitted a complete proposed initiative to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"The latter then announced that it would produce a concrete proposal within six months, and it has kept its word."
"It is just a shame that the content was not what we had expected it to be."
"There has been a fair amount of criticism on the part of the journalist organisations, the NGOs, a number of Member States and also Parliament."
"It therefore comes as no surprise that there is a broad package of amendments, so broad in fact that the regulation is being adapted to a quite considerable extent. Adapted to the legislation on openness of government in a number of Member States, but also to the Freedom of Information Act of the kind in force in the United States."
"After all, why would we want to give our European citizens less openness with regard to Brussels than the Americans get with regard to Washington?"
"So there is a huge number of amendments and I would like to thank the rapporteur for the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Michael Cashman, for his cooperation with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and with myself."
"What we have before us is, in fact, the work of these two committees."
"So what are the most important amendments?"
"The most crucial one is of course the amendment relating to Article 4, in which the Commission laid down 17 exceptions for access to documents and we managed to whittle the exceptions down to six."
"Moreover, when it comes to information on military and defence matters we suggest that an interinstitutional agreement should be concluded between the Council and Parliament so that secret information can be imparted to a so-called select committee."
"This committee could then assess if it was right to keep it secret."
"In this way, Parliament would function as a link between the Council and the citizens, and that is why it is entirely appropriate that this proposal should be incorporated into this regulation."
"Another important amendment is the proposal to have not just the Council, the Commission and Parliament fall within the scope of the regulation, but also all the external bodies."
"Why should we not force these bodies, which are funded by the Commission and whose staff are European officials, to adopt a culture of openness?"
"I think that is a very important point, and a substantial annex will be appended to this regulation in order to ensure that this is done."
"Turning now to classification: in short, I completely agree with what Michael Cashman had to say."
"I, too, find it quite hard to understand the criticism voiced by the Liberals and the Greens because classification is exactly what we need to achieve openness."
"That explains why the Council has such an aversion to the idea."
"I consider a fifth important amendment to be that relating to the annual report, which must relate specifically to the documents that must be kept secret, or which are kept secret at any rate."
"That could be reviewed again on an annual basis in order to establish whether it is reasonable or not."
"The European Commission has advised us on an informal basis that it has not quite finished working out the position vis-à-vis Parliament."
"That might not be a good thing, but if Mr Cashman is of the same mind then we can consider whether it might be possible to postpone the final vote."
"Finally, Mr President, this proposal is particularly important in terms of democratic standards within the Union."
"That is what it is all about, i.e. the citizens, which is why I hope that the broad majority here in Parliament will vote in favour of this document."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the right to become acquainted with the contents of the documents of the European Union' s institutions is a precondition of the public' s ability to monitor decision-making generally and influence it."
"At present, we are creating an open and modern-style administration, in which it is natural that the public should have this direct right."
"Obviously there have to be limits to such a right, and that is something we are also discussing today."
"At the moment in the European Union there already exists the practice of public access to documentation, and we should remember that brave citizens and many progressive Member States have been fighting for increased transparency for many years."
"We are not exactly starting this discussion from scratch: we can consider it our duty to see to it that transparency is increased and the criteria of the Treaty of Amsterdam are met."
"The report we are now examining in many respects takes the situation in a better direction."
"It is excellent that the report should state that public access to documents and the obligation to release documents affect all the institutions, and not just the three main ones."
"It is also excellent that the institutions should be obliged, or they should be allowed, rather, to release documents also to those not resident in the European Union, or who are not citizens of the European Union."
"This principle should be strengthened further."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you can no doubt imagine that one day an EU citizen will need information, for example, on what the administration in the United States of America is doing."
"In fact, there is no reason for restricting public access geographically."
"However, the report does not sufficiently explain how possible separate provisions, which would remain in force at the same time as this regulation, would meet the criteria of greater transparency."
"This is a vague area, and it is possible that more restrictive provisions may also remain in force, and this is one point in respect of which we have tabled amendments."
"As regards the definition of documents, this is a crucial question, and we could surely argue about just that for a whole year, which is probably what has happened."
"It is essential that scope for practising some degree of internal thought process should be allowed for the institutions, but we have to be very careful here, as we might create a situation in which documents drafted to prepare a decision may be excluded from the principle of transparency, and obviously decision-making cannot then be influenced."
"In my opinion, the report also goes too far in its recognition of the rights of so-called third parties to restrict the availability of documents."
"It may be the job of the Council and the Commission to uphold such restrictions, but I think it is not in the interests of Parliament or the public."
"The list of exceptions, as Mrs Maij-Weggen said, is essential, and perhaps the most important part of this work."
"That aspect of the matter has made substantial progress, but I would like to focus special attention on the fact that if we want our citizens to be able to follow general developments in security policy in the future, I repeat, general, an exception regarding defence, security and military matters is much too broad in scope."
"It should be defined more precisely or a harm test should be attached to it."
"Mr President, the right of Members of Parliament to confidential documents is a very important issue, but it cannot replace the direct right of access to information on the part of the public."
"Parliament still needs to work on this report more, and for that reason I believe that it must be improved upon still here."
"Mr President, like Mrs Malmström, I too would like to emphasise that transparency is the essential precondition for democratic control and participation of citizens in the decision-making process."
"Transparent procedures enable the administration to enjoy greater legitimacy and to be more effective and closer to the citizen."
"They also provide effective protection against the arbitrary use of and the abuse of power and against corruption."
"These are the considerations that led the Committee on Budgetary Control to deliver an opinion under this procedure."
"We are glad that the report repeats a crucial principle that we in the Committee on Budgetary Control also vehemently support."
"It is this: there can only be exceptions to the requirement of transparency in exceptional cases."
"That is why we cannot accept the long list of exceptions set out by the Commission."
"Here we are sending out the right signal to the citizens by radically cutting the list of these exceptions in our Amendment No 30, but, personally speaking, I find it most regrettable that we have only managed to simplify and clarify matters on this particular issue, however important it is, and not in the regulation as a whole."
"Unfortunately, the wish to anticipate any eventualities and to produce a regulation that is as complete and comprehensive as possible seems to have prevailed."
"Instead of a shorter text, we are therefore ending up with a longer one."
"I fear that will make it less legible or user-friendly."
"So it will become even more important for the citizen not to be left on his own with this regulation, but that each institution should establish contact points to which applicants can turn and where they can obtain practical assistance in their search for documents."
"If we really want to make it easier for the citizens to exercise their rights in practice, we will need specially trained staff in these contact points, who can, so to speak, take the citizen who is seeking information by the hand and guide him through the complex labyrinth of the institutions."
"The same applies to the use of languages."
"Mr President, Article 255 of the Treaty is now, therefore, to be implemented and, with the Cashman report, we are moving a long way in the right direction, but not far enough."
"All the same, I should very much like to commend the considerable work Mr Cashman has put into this report."
"As I see it, it is one of the most important pieces of work done this year."
"The statement by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, too, in fact goes farther than the Commission had proposed."
"We drew inspiration from the Nordic models for transparency in administration, for the Nordic countries have a very long tradition of having the right of access to documents."
"Naturally enough, it has also been the task of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport to emphasise that the language in the rules must be as clear, simple and understandable as possible. In the same way, we have also pointed out that openness and transparency are the best tools for solving the problems which may arise as a result of cultural and linguistic differences between the Member States, on this issue too."
"As I see it, right of access to documents is an important part of the EU' s information and communication policy."
"All investigations have, of course, revealed the distance between the European citizen and Brussels, and people themselves think they know too little about the EU."
"What they learn is at the media' s discretion or depends upon special interest groups, and they often feel powerless over and against the institutions."
"Now, they will be given the opportunity also to acquire some insight into circumstances which do not receive the special attention of the mass media and special interest groups and, in that way, they will be better able to participate in the open and democratic debate which is so important to confidence in the EU."
"I hope the Commission will make a big effort to inform people, including the man in the street, about this legislation, for the media and the special interest groups will no doubt find their own way to the documents they are interested in."
"I also hope that the Council and the Commission can give us a commitment today to continuing to deal with this issue in a positive way so that we might, as quickly as possible, start making the necessary changes to the business procedures in such a way as to benefit people and the image of the institutions."
"At a hearing in September in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, we learned that it takes ten years for an administration to change mentality, so the sooner we get started the better."
"Mr President, a lot of wise things have been said regarding the background to this report."
"I nevertheless think that we should emphasise that this is a question of standing matters on their heads."
"It is now a question of giving citizens the power to control the institutions."
"In the opinion of the Committee on Petitions, the importance of registers is mentioned."
"Registers are important if we are not to have a form of public access to documents that is insider access."
"The Committee would like all documents to be included, irrespective of whether they have been drawn up by the institutions or whether the institutions have them in their possession."
"Of course, the institutions can be given time to consider documents, but in that case it is not a question of forever preventing these documents from being released."
"When this time is up, it must also be possible for these documents, too, to be evaluated."
"We must also do the balancing mentioned by Mr Cashman as rapporteur."
"We must always weigh different interests against each other: the interests of having a public discussion and the interests of protecting individual people, for example."
"It is also important that the parties affected have rights."
"We wish to emphasise that these parties must have more rights than the general public."
"However, the issue here is the public's, not Parliament's, access to documents."
"The Committee on Petitions would like to see shorter waiting periods before documents are released."
"Time is power in our society."
"We would also like to emphasis the important role the Ombudsman has played in the progress that has, nevertheless, been made."
"I believe that he will also have an important role to play in the future."
"We would also like to underline the fact that this is not a matter of harmonising national regulations."
"National cultures must be able to continue, for example in the country I come from, where some time ago the whole principle of public access to official records was conceived."
"Mr President, the Cashman report can be summarised in four words: citizens' power over bureaucracy."
"The general public's right of access to the EU institutions' documents is one of the mainstays in the establishment of an open and democratic EU."
"Access to information also stimulates increased efficiency."
"This is a significant step towards a more open and more democratic EU."
"It is gratifying that Parliament has succeeded in producing a large majority in favour of more openness."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Cashman and also Mrs Maij-Weggen for an excellent collaboration, which has in fact created a good basis for the continued negotiations."
"There are no block exemptions relating to foreign affairs or security, and neither must there be any block exemptions in these areas in the future."
"The principle of access to documents must of course include all the institutions and bodies of the EU."
"It is therefore extremely important that we keep a record, a register, so that citizens have a reasonable chance of seeing what documents exist."
"Public access to documents must be all-embracing and the main and basic principle, but it must naturally be supplemented with certain well-defined exceptions."
"Citizens must of course be protected."
"The Commission suggested 16 exceptions, which we felt was far too many."
"We have therefore reduced them to six."
"Justification for a document being classified as confidential must be required in each individual case."
"Furthermore, confidentiality may not be assigned permanently."
"As soon as confidentiality is no longer justified, the document must naturally be made publicly accessible."
"There may, of course, be negotiation strategies whereby a document may need to be kept secret before a meeting, but once decisions have been taken there may no longer be a need to maintain confidentiality."
"The document should then be made available."
"In addition, it must be possible to appeal against all decisions relating to confidentiality."
"It must be possible to appeal to the European Court of Justice, the Ombudsman or the relevant EU authority, and Parliament must always be able to question the grounds for confidentiality."
"Another important principle, which has been one of my hobbyhorses since the debate on openness began, is that, as far as possible, documents must be made available in electronic form on the Internet."
"This is something that Parliament has supported and will probably also emphasise again today, which is important."
"I regard this as a very good example of Swedish and Nordic influence on the system of the EU."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for an excellent piece of work."
"Increased openness will reduce bureaucracy and the opportunities for cheating and fraud and, at the same time, increase the legitimacy of the institutions among citizens."
"I will not get too bogged down in some of the details of the report - it is always possible to wish for more when it comes to details - but keep to the main principles."
"The basic principle of the proposal on our table now is that all documents must be made public."
"The exceptions are considerably fewer and clearer than those in the Commission's proposal."
"The general public is guaranteed the greatest possible access to documents and in the easiest possible way."
"The same thing applies to citizens in third countries."
"A register of all documents must be established."
"Requests for access will be handled relatively quickly."
"Those countries which have better systems will not be adversely affected, but will be able to retain their systems."
"Furthermore, a report must be sent to Parliament every year so that we might continually follow up this action."
"I would also like to emphasise that all citizens must be guaranteed access to documents in as many forms as possible."
"In our group, we have also discussed the possibility that the visually impaired and those with other types of functional disability should be able to receive documents in a form other than written form."
"I would like to draw attention to the Internet and other possibilities which in the future may facilitate access to documents."
"I would like to conclude by saying that, in Parliament, we must be very unified in supporting this comprehensive proposal, because the problems do not lie with ourselves."
"It is now a matter of our producing a proposal and achieving a good result in our negotiations with the Council and the Commission."
"That is the most important thing, and that is the task we face."
"Mr President, transparency and openness do not appear in a good light in the European Union."
"In the eyes of the citizens, the European Union is a cumbersome bureaucracy that spends its time cooking up all manner of regulations behind closed doors."
"As a parliamentarian, I can confirm the accuracy of this impression."
"The Council of Ministers, in particular, is a sealed fortress."
"And the present legislative proposal from the Commission is no cause for celebration either."
"Fortunately, this Commission proposal has been heavily adapted by the various parliamentary committees, due in part to the contribution of a number of liberal draftsmen of opinions that have just spoken."
"The guiding principle must be that all documents are accessible, subject to certain exceptions."
"That is the will of this Parliament."
"All in all, the ELDR Group feels that the proposal has been substantially improved on, but that there is still room for improvement nonetheless."
"I would point out that the arrangements pertaining to the registration of documents are too complex, the grounds for exceptions could be formulated better, and that non-European EU citizens have a right to openness too."
"The stipulations concerning the duty of the Commission and the Council to provide Parliament with information, have no place in this legislative proposal."
"The doctrine of political responsibility must not be confused with the citizens' rights to openness."
"All in all, I call upon the Social Democrat and Conservative groups, and, of course, the others too, to support our amendments."
"Mr President, a word about the position of the European Commission, because I have already talked about the Council."
"My group and I have our doubts about the European Commission."
"According to reports, this regulation on public access has rarely been discussed in the college, and has been regarded by it up until now as a predominantly official matter."
"I am keen to hear what the Commissioner in attendance today thinks about this."
"If it were to be the case then it is a miscalculation because this is about the credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens."
"I call upon the Commission to give its full cooperation in delivering a sound regulation based on the principle of public access subject to certain exceptions."
"Mr President, Mr Cashman, let there be no mistake, my group also feels that your report is a major step forwards in comparison with the Commission' s report."
"There are fewer exceptions and it gives Member States the option of retaining their own national, more far-reaching legislation."
"But there are also points of criticism and I would like to highlight one of them."
"It relates to the announcement in our report of the so-called 'select committee' , the committee of inquiry."
"And just remember, what we are talking about here is a 'select committee' of the European Parliament."
"A small group of MEPs who may be able to gain access in the future to secret military documents."
"My problem, and that of my group, is that this provision for parliamentarians is incorporated in a provision which should be about accessibility to the public, i.e. to the citizens."
"It is totally unacceptable, Mr Cashman, for us to get a good deal out of all this ourselves where access to documents is concerned, but to then leave the citizens out in the cold on that very point."
"I would remind you that this is not an imagined danger because Parliament has decided to lodge an appeal against the Solana decision."
"But at the same time, it has said that whether or not we go ahead with this case depends on the progress of the negotiations as regards the select committee."
"In other words, as I see it, a link has been established - erroneously so - between the rights of parliamentarians and the rights of the public."
"I would therefore urge the rapporteurs to delete any reference to the rights of parliamentarians from the provision concerning public access to documents, and I call upon all my fellow delegates to make very sure that their interests are not played off against those of the public."
"Mr President, we have talked such a lot in Parliament about bringing the Union closer to the people, and I think then, if this is what we really want, that this project is crucial."
"It is a project which may lead to citizens being placed in a position in which they are co-players and active participants and are not just spectators or like pawns in interesting, large-scale games of chess."
"I therefore also think it is important that, in this report, we should concentrate on citizens' rights. We should not confuse this issue with every other possible matter connected with the right of access to documents and we should not confuse it with Parliament' s, the Commission' s and the Council' s internal quarrels about access to documents."
"It is citizens' rights we are dealing with on this occasion."
"I should like to emphasise that we shall, in any case, vote in favour of as broad a definition as we possibly can of what the documents in question are."
"There is a multiplicity of documents nowadays, and we should like to ensure that there is a high degree of access to as many different types of document in as many different forms as is humanly possible."
"This also means, of course, that, conversely, we want to ensure that the exceptions are as minor and as few in number as they possibly can be."
"I simply cannot understand why, in the context of this cooperation, it should be necessary to introduce rules more restrictive than those which individual Member States can live with. I cannot understand how it can be accepted that citizens of the European Union should have poorer rights of access to documents than citizens in some individual Member States."
"I cannot understand why it should be more important or dangerous if something were to be leaked from this 'Community' , as it is called, than if something similar were to be leaked from the Swedish, or possibly Danish, government."
"That is why I think it is so crucial that citizens' rights should not be restricted in those Member States where there is at present good access to documentation and why I think that cooperation should instead be used to increase citizens' access in the individual Member States and, indeed, in the European Union as a whole."
"If, then, we mean what we say about citizens' rights and bringing the European Union closer to the people, then what is needed are not flashy documents and high-minded speeches but quite specific citizens' rights."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Members of the Bonino List, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Cashman for what we consider to be excellent work."
"Before focusing on our concern over certain points, I would first like to state that the right of access to information should be recognised as a civil and political right."
"Today, as a tool to help us exercise this civil and political right, we have the Internet, a term which has a strange ring within the European institutions and which, although we are starting to make use of it, is not exploited to the full."
"The Internet is a remarkable tool, and it is certainly now the simplest, most economical and most easily accessible tool available."
"We will therefore vote for the amendments facilitating its use."
"Our concerns are threefold: the first is regarding the common foreign and security policy sectors, but also the sectors of justice and home affairs."
"Access to documents is not guaranteed in these sectors and is denied not only to the citizens, but even to the European Parliament. Moreover, Parliament is neither kept formally informed nor consulted regarding fundamental documents."
"Our second concern stems from the way the Council takes legislative decisions behind closed doors."
"The citizens and Members of Parliament are currently denied the right to be aware of the positions adopted by the national delegations within the Council and the way these delegations vote. If the Council of today is supposed to be a co-legislating organ, a sort of upper House with legislative power, then, logically, the Council's votes and proceedings ought to be made public."
"The citizens have to be able to find out how their government has voted on highly important matters."
"The third concern relates to the limited access to examination scripts from the Union's recruitment competitions."
"There is, in fact, a grey area which leads to incidents of discrimination and poor administration."
"These incidents have a direct bearing on the quality of the work produced by the institutions."
"At the same time, we Members of the Bonino List feel that we must not go too far and introduce extreme regulations allowing indiscriminate access to information or opinions which are of no decision-making import."
"Our vote will therefore be targeted at finding the right balance between the two extremes."
"Mr President, the Commission' s attitude to the right of access to documents may be seen from the internal handbook sent on 11 October to employees of the Commission to tell them how to deal with requests from MEPs for access to documents."
"On 13 October, it was sent to Parliament, but I have only just seen it tonight."
"It appears from this document that, if an MEP asks for information as part of the discharge procedure, Mrs De Palacio' s employees must refuse to respond to such requests."
"There is only one person - the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control - who is in a position to request information in connection with the discharge procedure."
"This internal handbook for employees goes on to state that, if an MEP finds an interesting piece of information in a newspaper and would like to see the document concerned, then there is only one Member of Parliament who can submit such a request, and that is the President of Parliament."
"This is scandalous, and it shows what the Commission' s intentions were in connection with the framework agreement."
"If not even Members of Parliament can obtain the information they ask for, how for heaven' s sake are ordinary citizens to obtain such information?"
"All MEPs are therefore justified in going to their groups..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, transparency ensures greater participation by the citizens in the decision-making process together with greater legitimacy, efficiency and responsibility on the part of the administration in a democratic system."
"It is essential and fundamental to the system for the citizens to have the broadest possible access to the EU's documents."
"In principle this regulation is positive, especially the clarification that it covers all areas of activity and all the institutions of the Union."
"But one serious cause for regret remains."
"If it is applied extensively, the list of exceptions in Article 4 could totally destroy the object of this regulation."
"The regulation is marked by imprecision, which will produce legal uncertainty for the citizens."
"I consider it extremely questionable to deny access to documents where - and I quote from Article 4 - disclosure could undermine ""the effective functioning of the institutions""."
"That provision could open the door wide to arbitrariness."
"The concept of the ""effective functioning of the institutions"" is vague and inconsistent with the case law of the European Court of Justice."
"According to that court, the decision on whether to grant access to a document must take account of the relative interests of the institutions, the confidentiality of the document and the interest of the applicant."
"The argument that it could undermine the effective functioning of the institutions is not sufficient grounds for the denial of access to documents."
"This provision must be deleted or at least supplemented by the obligation to weigh up the various interests."
"The purpose of this regulation is to optimise access to documents while adhering as far as possible to the principle of openness."
"The proposed regulation can only achieve that aim if the list of exceptions in Article 4 is toned down, to say the least."
"Mr President, today the House is debating a very serious and important issue because this debate is about one of the most important legislative texts which we, as a Parliament, are required to examine."
"And it is an important legislative document because it concerns the quintessential relations between the man in the street and the institutions, these relations being no more and no less than his facility to access the institutions."
"The context of this debate is defined in the proposal made by the European Commission and it is this proposal, via the report by our fellow Member, Mr Cashman, whom I congratulate on his excellent work, which informs the position of the European Parliament."
"However, the question which begs to be answered is: what about the Council?"
"So far, the only proposal to have come out of the Council is the absolute and, in my view, unacceptable position of Mr Solana on issues relating to the common foreign policy."
"I call on you to pressure the Council into changing its mind and, at the same time, I call on you to vote in favour of the Cashman report."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Cashman for the splendid work he has done on this report."
"I think the report sends a powerful signal to all the EU' s institutions and to the general public."
"Openness in legislative work and in public administration is, of course, crucial to our democracies being able to function."
"It is therefore not enough that a system should be formally open."
"It must also be experienced as such."
"The Commission' s draft Regulation is in reality reminiscent of Hans Christian Andersen' s story of the Emperor' s New Clothes."
"There is a difference between words and deeds."
"Here in the European Parliament, we must adopt the role of the little boy in the story."
"The usual method of international cooperation, with all the customs and ground rules of diplomacy including the rule that everything must take place behind closed doors, will not do in the modern form of cooperation the EU has developed into."
"We must give up this habitual way of thinking."
"With relatively few exceptions, documents must be fully accessible to the public. Otherwise, we shall lose people' s support for European cooperation."
"I might also add that, even if the rules in question only affect people in the EU, Mr Cashman' s proposal will also have a knock-on effect in the Member States where it will no longer be possible to keep documents secret on the basis of the standard justification we almost always encounter, namely that it is an EU matter."
"This is the attitude behind the poor opinion people have of the EU, an opinion which Mr Cashman' s report will change for the better."
"The report is also good for people' s confidence in European cooperation."
"I shall just conclude by saying that I think it was a pity that Mr Jens-Peter Bonde had got the wrong script for his intervention today."
"It was not, in any case, relevant to the Cashman report."
"Mr President, I thank Mr Cashman for his assiduous and inspired work in committee."
"Freedom of information and a culture of open and transparent administration are powerful tools for better government and for rooting out corruption and malpractice."
"Since it was Mr Prodi who presented proposals to us in January, we had hoped he would be here to reply to this debate."
"Indeed the Commission has maintained a curious silence throughout our deliberations, but we look forward to the Commissioner's remarks this morning."
"Mr Solana in the Council has made an audacious bid to be crowned the prince of darkness."
"But once this report is voted on today, Parliament will stand ready to negotiate with the Commission and the Council a code which will cause citizens to blink in the bright Strasbourg sunshine."
"Publication must be our presumption and the onus placed squarely on those who seek to withhold it."
"It is grotesque that in the European Union national governments make public policy behind a heavy curtain of secrecy."
"The freedom of information act foreseen in Article 255 will rip it asunder."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and everyone else involved in this work."
"This is a very important report, which forms an important part of what we might call the EU's new principle of public access to official documents."
"Included in this, apart from this draft legislation which regulates citizens' right of access to documents, are the framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament and other agreements such as the Solana Decision."
"It is now that we have the chance to make the EU more open and more democratic."
"It would be an enormous disappointment if we did not succeed with this."
"It is a matter of legal security, an efficient administration and effective democracy."
"We must remember that this proposal shall establish citizens' right of access to documents without them having to provide a reason for this or to demonstrate that they are affected."
"We must not confuse this with the role of the European Parliament or with future interinstitutional agreements."
"The Cashman report constitutes an improvement on the Commission's proposal, but in my opinion the improvement is not sufficient."
"We still need to vote in favour of many of the amendments that have been tabled, among others by the Group of the Greens and by the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"The amendment concerning a register is particularly important."
"Furthermore, citizens will not need to have their rights interpreted. Instead, they will have the right of access to documents in order to determine for themselves what is important."
"Mr President, the report before us points in the right direction."
"But it should aim further."
"The general public is often given the impression today that good information means being swamped with mounds of glossy brochures."
"However, people do not measure information by the shiny cover, but by the content, transparency and legibility."
"It is true that transparency and openness can help prevent corruption and the waste of resources."
"The latest report by the Court of Auditors shows how urgently we need changes here."
"Let me turn to three other aspects. Firstly, democracy is based on the participation of the citizens and is meant to be an incentive to action."
"But what if people are not or not adequately informed and then encounter a jungle of provisions through which not even a Member of Parliament, let alone the man in the street, could find their way?"
"Surely information also implies that the citizens can recognise their own interests in our decisions, for instance in decisions on aid projects and so forth."
"Secondly, documents are often couched in the kind of language not even a lawyer can understand, let alone a citizen."
"Finally, so many documents are kept secret even from the Members of Parliament that many of the facts we would need in order to reach a decision remain so hidden that..."
"(Technical disruption)"
"Mr President, there is no trace of the 'Europe of the citizens' rhetoric that we hear so much about in the restrictive rules governing access to documents proposed by the Commission and the Council."
"Do these institutions really want to bring the citizens closer to Europe?"
"Their attitude would suggest a propensity towards the centralisation of power."
"Why did they opt for a regulation?"
"Surely this is about documents belonging to the institutions?"
"And why have access exemptions been formulated so broadly?"
"One thing is for sure, now that unanimity is no longer required in the Council, the only possibility of redressing the balance rests with Parliament."
"Fortunately, the Cashman/Maij-Wegen report represents an attempt to compile a document which lays down the citizen' s right to access to documents, and not the right of institutions to impose restrictions."
"But Parliament is no stranger to these little power games either."
"For example, the report contains amendments about the right of the institutions to classify documents as secret or public."
"These are amendments that are mainly geared towards increasing our own influence."
"But does this subject actually belong in a regulation on the right of the public to have access to documents?"
"Besides, Parliament' s passion for regulation, as borne out by so many amendments, will result in a regulation that is difficult to implement. And bear in mind that transparency and openness, which are necessary to guarantee the involvement of the citizens, would be best served by the exact opposite, i.e. a clear and simple regulation."
"That is certainly what we as a Parliament should stick to."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Cashman for his report, which is enriched by the opinions of Mrs Maij-Weggen, Mrs Hautala, Mrs Malmström, Mrs Theato, Mrs Thors and Mr Andreasen."
"However, I think that he is referring to all the institutions except the Council, for the Council is a black hole in the European Union."
"The Council is the unknown on the far side of beyond."
"In my opinion, a step has been taken towards making it possible for citizens to avail themselves of their right to information and knowledge."
"In all probability, the advent of electronic data will eventually bring the citizen this possibility, providing information automatically without the citizens having to make an - albeit legitimate - request for it."
"Furthermore, I feel that, as the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman have requested, we also need to endeavour to outline clearly the institutional and bureaucratic stages in the process, defining the responsibilities which - rightly - still lie with the institutions, therefore without separating the different responsibilities within the organisation."
"I have mentioned responsibility precisely because the information has to protect the citizen from errors of public administration."
"If this were not so, we would merely be talking about a desire for knowledge, pure and simple."
"However, the citizen's right to defend himself against the public administration means that information must be provided."
"One last point: information cannot be made available, that is, the right to information, the right to protect the citizen from public maladministration cannot be provided if the procedures are not made simpler and more comprehensible, if the number and complexity of procedures is not reduced, because, although the citizens are familiar with the complex procedures, these procedures are the antithesis of transparency and deny the relationship between the citizen and the institution, which ought to serve as a channel for improving the quality of life of the citizen."
"Mr President, first of all warm thanks to the rapporteur Michael Cashman and to all those who have contributed to this report."
"Until now, transparency has been little more than a much-misused slogan when applied to the activities of the EU institutions."
"The Cashman report with its demands is now a first, valuable step forward, although, in my view, no more than that."
"We Members should be more courageous."
"We will be setting up an inter-party and interparliamentary European transparency initiative, known in short as ETI."
"It will be made up of MEPs, members of national parliaments, but also media representatives, because it is important to defend ourselves jointly against the intolerable habit of secrecy in the EU institutions."
"It is not just a matter of the principle of unrestricted access to all documents but also, of course, of finally managing to open the doors of Council meetings, so that in future the Council can no longer take lonely decisions in camera à la Metternich and then go in for cheap 'Brussels bashing' ."
"The media representatives, in particular, are warmly invited to support our parliamentarians and to work together with us so that we can find out all the things the citizen wants to know and needs to know."
"Tomorrow there will be a meeting in London."
"We will ask the British Foreign Trade Minister and the Minister for Science to show their understanding for our concern. The weekend after that, the European Council of Artists will be meeting in Madrid and there, too, ETI will feature large on the agenda."
"The model for us all is the American Freedom of Information Act and the living practice of transparency in Sweden."
"It is not just chance that we have heard almost only Scandinavians speak here, with very few speakers from Germany or Italy and, so far at least, I believe, none from France."
"It is fortunate that the Swedes will be taking over the presidency of the Council next year; perhaps they will be able to send out a much clearer signal."
"In any case, we need a new age of enlightenment and this is a great opportunity for us MEPs to show our true colours."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Cashman for his excellent work."
"However, he is not the only one I should like to thank, as my sincere thanks also go to Hanja Maij-Weggen, of the PPE-DE Group, who is the other rapporteur, thanks to the enhanced Hughes Procedure."
"I am glad that they have been able to work in close and successful cooperation in this matter."
"Transparency and democracy are important values in our work, and they will come about if registers on existing information, including that deemed confidential, are made obligatory."
"This is the principle which I have made the starting point in my own report on the accessibility to information on the environment."
"It would also be important if the public were given information as to when a document, which is not available to the public at the time a request is made to examine it, because it is incomplete or confidential, will actually be made available."
"I would like to focus attention on something which concerns public accessibility to documents which fall within the authority of the Commission or are in the possession of bodies set up by the institutions."
"These latter would include, for example, the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen as well as the Food Safety Agency, which is soon to be established."
"Naturally, the documents these bodies hold must unambiguously be included within the scope of provisions on accessibility."
"I do not think Mr Cashman' s chosen technique here is a good one, however."
"It is technically cumbersome to classify these bodies in a separate Annex, as new bodies are forever being created or changed."
"It would be better to create provisions in the paragraphs themselves, which would oblige all bodies to publish their documents and create registers on them."
"Secondly, I would like to draw attention to the work on derogations."
"The provision of derogations is a very delicate matter, and what is otherwise an excellent report and a huge increase in transparency will very easily be overshadowed in the minds of the public by any clumsy set of provisions on derogations."
"Naturally we have to finally decide on the sort of practices which would shed public light on the work of the Council, and no set of derogations must be allowed to let the Council retreat behind it in the way it did before."
"But it is just as important to temper public opinion, which borders very much on the paranoid as a result of exaggerated secrecy with regard to documents on such matters as security and defence."
"In fact, it is important, as far as security is concerned, that the public can judge, using facts and documents, just how much confidence they have in European defence."
"Mr President, we are now in a situation in which we can really say that steps are being taken in the direction we have wanted for many years, and the principles of which were agreed in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Transparency must become a founding pillar of all the work of the European Union, but the right to access documents is still not enough in itself to establish transparency."
"We must see to it that the work of all the institutions is based on transparency, clarity and intelligibility, and that means that the decision-making structures are clearly visible."
"Bureaucracy has also to be avoided here."
"The times being proposed for the release of documents must be absolute deadlines, because in normal circumstances documents are readily available to the public."
"I also think it is very important that this report proposes a yearly review as, then, lists of documents that have not been able to be made public, can justifiably be gone through."
"At this stage we would also then have the chance to examine, on political grounds, whether the suppression of documents has been judged entirely appropriately."
"I hope that this report is received favourably here in Parliament."
"Mr President, there is a yawning gap between Parliament' s position and those of the Council and the Commission."
"This gap is symbolic of the distance between the European Union and its citizens."
"Our people regard Europe as being undemocratic, a place where decisions are taken behind closed doors."
"The gap is also becoming a democratic deficit in Europe."
"At the end of the day, exchange of information is an essential foundation of modern democracy, which is nurtured by public debate, media and public control and the contribution of social organisations."
"Parliament' s proposals bridge this gap."
"I would also emphasise that the vast majority of MEPs support the proposals, and that includes delegates whose own countries may be less familiar with the tradition of openness."
"I regard this consensus throughout Parliament as a great achievement, enabling us to demonstrate that this has become a Europe-wide fight for European democracy."
"I would conclude that the Council committed a serious error in July when it categorically declared all documents about military affairs secret."
"This decision illustrates just how far we still have to go before Europe actually has a democratically controlled security and defence policy."
"That is why Parliament is calling for European security and defence policy to be embedded in the structures of the European Commission in future."
"Firstly, we must tackle the insupportable decision taken by the Council."
"Naturally Parliament recognises the need to keep certain military matters secret, but only if this is done on the basis of an assessment of the content of each individual document, and with the aid of verifiable criteria and procedures."
"Parliamentary control of secret documents could then take place via a parliamentary select committee."
"Mr President, access to documents is fundamentally important to our European democracy."
"The Council and the Commission must deliver the goods with interest in the negotiations due to take place in the coming weeks."
"Otherwise, the Social Democratic Group, along with others, will endeavour to enforce this right to information by having recourse to the law."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to express my satisfaction at being able to explain to you the Commission' s position with regard to the amendments tabled by the various committees on the proposal for a regulation, a regulation which we all consider to be of great importance to the reality of democracy and progress in our society."
"I would also like to say how much the Commission and myself appreciate the efforts made by the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, and the draftsperson of the proposal, Mrs Maij-Weggen, to present this report in such a short period of time."
"In accordance with Article 255 of the Treaty, the proposed regulation must be adopted before 1 May 2001, that is to say, two years after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Before presenting the Commission' s position, I would like to point out that, in drawing up its proposal, the Commission based its work, on the one hand, on the experience and functioning of the voluntary code of the last six years and, on the other, on a study of the legislation of the Member States, some of which have a great deal of experience in providing their citizens access to documents."
"The Treaty recognises the citizens' right to have access to the documents of the European institutions in accordance with certain principles and conditions."
"As the proposal indicates, the Commission feels that providing citizens with access will mean that they are guaranteed better information on decision-making processes, and that administrations will have greater legitimacy, efficiency and responsibility in a democratic system."
"The fundamental principle is therefore openness, but this must be reconciled with safeguarding the public interest and respect for certain rights which warrant special protection."
"This is the fundamental balance that we must achieve."
"Our legislation must also respect another type of balance which is equally essential: the balance between the three institutions that are considered in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"This does not mean that it would not be appropriate for the other institutions also to adopt the regulation when we adopt it."
"When President Prodi addressed Parliament on 3 October, he referred to the institutional triangle and stated that, in a European system based on checks and balances, the efficient functioning of each institution contributes to the common interest."
"Each of the institutions has a different task to perform and its needs and obligations are therefore different."
"As a result of Mr Cashman' s report we now have a clear idea of Parliament' s priorities."
"However, the Council' s position with regard to some of the most important provisions of the proposal is still not clear."
"This element of uncertainty means that the Commission, at this point in the procedure, can only offer a general position."
"We are therefore unable to agree to some of the amendments without prejudging a future negotiation and a definitive position in relation to it."
"The Commission is pleased to see that the European Parliament agrees, to a large extent, with its view of many of the aforementioned issues."
"Furthermore, other amendments do not present any problems of principle."
"We must go further in relation to the ways in which the regulation will be applied and implemented, because openness, transparency and the provision of access to documents is an attitude which must be strengthened in our respective administrations and which must become a reality."
"I believe that many of us who are in favour of the maximum degree of transparency, which would allow the institutions to become more efficient, were truly amazed, a few years ago, to discover that, in a country which always sets an example in these areas, certain sterilisation practices had been taking place for several years, specifically in relation to certain categories of citizen, in the most shady and least transparent manner."
"I believe that this demonstrates that there are no perfect situations and that we all have to make progress in order to prevent situations of this type."
"I now wish to address certain problems that currently prevent the Commission from accepting certain amendments."
"One of them is the need to achieve a fair balance between openness and efficiency."
"I am referring in particular to texts for internal use and to initial drafts and preparatory study documents for exclusively internal use by the institutions."
"All national legislation in this field excludes these documents."
"Forcing institutions to publish these internal notes could, in many cases, simply lead to confusion amongst the citizens."
"As one Member has said, there is a paradox here, and that is that sometimes the worst type of disinformation results from an overload of information."
"In this respect, I believe that access to preparatory documents would not provide much information."
"Furthermore, an attitude such as this would discourage creative thinking and would encourage strictly bureaucratic approaches within the institutions."
"I believe that this is precisely the opposite of what the institutions intend."
"I must acknowledge that the great challenge of this regulation is the precise definition of what documents are."
"In this respect, I believe that we must now continue to make progress in seeking a common definition, on which all the institutions can agree."
"Therefore, although I cannot agree to the amendments to Articles 3 and 4 today, that is to say Amendments Nos 28 and 30, this does not mean that we do not have to hold discussions and make progress in this regard."
"Another problem lies in the treatment of entry documents, that is to say, documents drawn up by third parties."
"The institutions lack experience in this field, since the current system only deals with documents presented by the institutions themselves."
"The Commission' s proposal on third-party documents takes account of what was agreed at the last Intergovernmental Conference - in Declaration No 35 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which we cannot ignore - which gives them, both the institutions and the third parties, the final word on whether to publish these documents."
"Parliament' s amendments completely reverse this approach and we therefore believe that greater consideration is required and that the proposal for a new Article 4c, Amendment No 36, is not yet sufficiently mature to be accepted favourably by the Commission."
"With regard to other amendments, we believe that we need time to assess the consequences of the proposal from the operational point of view and we must ensure that the procedures incorporated are not bureaucratic, but are truly accessible to all the citizens."
"I include here amendments such as those tabled on measures which must be agreed by means of an interinstitutional agreement: Amendments Nos 34, 45, and 48."
"As I pointed out previously, in certain cases we can agree in principle to the amendments, but we have to work together from a technical and administrative point of view, for example with regard to the amendments referring to the classification of documents and the register."
"For several decades the Commission has had a system for the classification of documents."
"Therefore the principle that documents should be subject to a classification system does not raise any problems."
"Nevertheless, there has been no discussion as to whether or not the rules for classification should be common to all the institutions."
"It is premature at this point in the legislative procedure to take a position on whether there should be a direct relationship between classification and access to documents, as proposed in Amendment No 29, or whether rules to this effect should be included in the present regulation."
"The relationships established by the amendments between rules on classification and rules on the content of the register therefore prevent us from accepting at this stage Amendment No 46 relating to the register."
"I would like to highlight that, at the right time, the Commission could accept practically all the amendments, such as Amendments Nos 9, 18, 21 in part, 23, 25, 26.1, 28(f), 35, 38, 40.1, 40.6, 41.1, 42, 43.1, 47, 49 and 52."
"Furthermore, the Commission believes that we will be able to reach agreement, with some modifications, on Amendments Nos 11, 12, 40.4, 40.7, 43.2, 47, 48.4, 50.1 and 50.2."
"Perhaps also Amendments Nos 63, 66.2, 73.1, 74.2, the final part of 75, and 78.2."
"I would like to highlight the fact that, although the Commission is only able today to express certain global and positive approaches in certain respects, and with regard to other amendments we are making no comment or only doing so cautiously, this does not mean that we do not want to go ahead with the debate, the negotiation and the search for common ground between the three institutions."
"We hope to be able to work in this respect so that the appropriate regulation will be approved by May."
"Once again, thank you very much to all the rapporteurs for the efforts they have made."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner"
"Mr President, I have a point of order."
"We have just heard the Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, briefly listing dozens of amendments that the Commission can accept and others it recommends that we reject."
"Would it not be possible to have that list in writing, since we will be voting in ten minutes' time?"
"Nobody had time to note down the amendments the Commissioner listed."
"I am making this comment because as a rule the Commissioner present gives the Commission' s voting recommendations orally."
"We have no written document before us and, in future too, I would like the Commission to inform the Members of its recommendations in writing."
"I have to disagree with my colleague, Mr Poos."
"It is not for the Commission to tell political groups what decisions they should make on the amendments that have come from the different political groups and therefore the Commissioner should not be placed in this invidious position."
"Mr President, I asked for the floor to make the same comment as Mr Poos."
"Mr Cashman was right to say that it is not up to the Commission to tell the political groups how they should vote here in plenary."
"Yet, there are some Members, including myself, who, on occasion, also trust in the wisdom of the Commission."
"Sometimes I would indeed like to vote for the Commission' s proposals and that means that Members really do need a list of the amendments the Commission can in fact support and of the amendments it does not wish to support."
"It will be up to Members, who in any case vote according to their hearts and their conscience, to make up their mind on the basis of this Commission list."
"Mr President, I would agree with Mr Cashman that the process of parliamentary decision-making is taking place as we speak."
"I have also heard from the Commission -which I would sincerely like to thank incidentally, for being so very accommodating, because that much I can say - that it is unable as yet to give a definitive answer on certain aspects."
"That is a very important point, of course, and I am sure it will have certain repercussions."
"But precisely because the Commission - I see the Commissioner is nodding - is unable to give a definitive answer as yet, it is in fact a little risky to get everything down in black and white at this early stage, because then we will lose control of the situation."
"So what I would actually like to ask now, is whether Parliament can pursue its own decision-making process, in a sense independently of the Commission' s position, and then we can explore how the rapporteurs can engage in further consultations with the Commission in order to reach a definitive viewpoint."
"That seems to me to be a better order in which to do things."
"I have taken cognisance of the opinions expressed here."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to welcome to the European Parliament the Delegation of the Chamber of Deputies of the Republic of Malta in the Joint Parliamentary Committee European Union-Malta, headed by Mr Louis Galea."
"The Joint Parliamentary Committee EU-Malta held its 14th meeting here in Strasbourg, yesterday and today, and focused its discussions on the EU-Malta accession negotiations, on the basis of the periodic report by the European Commission on the progress Malta has made in its preparations for accession, which, as you know, was published in November 2000."
"The Joint Parliamentary Committee was informed about the most recent developments by the European Commission, the incumbent President of the Council of the European Union, and by the government of the Republic of Malta."
"I would like to remind you of the pivotal role that the Joint Parliamentary Committee EU-Malta is playing in the ongoing negotiations towards the Republic of Malta' s membership of the EU."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I hope that your meeting here in Strasbourg has been successful and productive, and I wish you a safe journey home."
"Own funds of banks"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Villiers (A5-0282/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the evaluation of Directive 89/299/EEC on the own funds of banks [2000/2207(INI)]."
"When a bank fails it has wider-reaching implications than a failure of another sort of business because people's savings are jeopardised and the stability of the financial system can be jeopardised."
"Therefore, we have special rules to ensure that banks stay solvent and stay afloat and do not fail, and these rules are designed to protect savers and to maintain financial stability."
"They are globally agreed in Basel but the current framework is out of date because it requires the same regulatory capital reserves."
"The same amount of money needs to be put aside for a wide range of different risks."
"This actually encourages banks to opt for higher risks because it means that a bank can go for a higher premium for the same regulatory capital charge."
"The Commission's new proposal, the main thrust of which the committee warmly welcomes, is that the lower the risk, the lower the regulatory charge."
"That means banks will be encouraged and rewarded for minimising risk and maintaining proper reserves of capital against their liabilities."
"We make a number of political demands in our report from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Firstly, that the new rules take account of the diversity of the banking and investment sector in the European Union."
"These rules apply to many thousands of small and large banks and investment firms and must be designed to suit all their needs."
"The rules should be as easy as possible for these institutions to use."
"We are moving to a more sophisticated system."
"It does not need to be a more bureaucratic and complex system."
"We, in the committee, cautiously accept the role proposed by the Commission for external ratings, with the reservation that this is a role with limitations - most importantly, small businesses will not need to be rated, nor will businesses without a rating be disadvantaged."
"Nevertheless we believe it is important to state that banks' internal credit scoring and internal rating systems must be at the centrepiece of the new framework."
"They offer the best way to deliver a risk-sensitive framework over a wide area of the banking sector, as well as to clients and small businesses."
"We welcome the enhanced status accorded to credit risk mitigation, particularly the collateral which may be offered by small businesses."
"We also accept that, in the long term, there is probably a need for a new charge for other risks, but we make the point that there should be no such charge until there is a sensible method of measuring other risks."
"We also accept that there is a need for regulators to have the power to impose particular and additional charges on particular banks."
"The new framework puts trust in banks."
"We are not allowing them to set their own capital charges but we would be getting suspiciously close to that if we did not keep a close eye on their internal systems."
"That is why supervisors need to have these extra powers to impose individual charges, to make sure individual banks are sticking to the rules."
"Lastly, and most controversially, the committee strongly called for the use of a fast-track procedure to implement this legislation."
"Amendments have been tabled which take a more cautious approach, but what unites us all is the knowledge that the last time there was a Basel Accord, the United States took three months to implement it and the European Union took over three years."
"That was not only three years when EU banks were at a severe competitive disadvantage - and there is evidence that they suffered severely - but also three years when European consumers were denied a modern, state-of-the-art regulatory framework."
"We need to ask ourselves tough questions as legislators, as to whether we are doing the best for the people who elected us if our regulations and laws are out of date before they hit the statute books."
"We must review all our options, including comitology, fast-track and other procedures, because it is dangerous to be regulating yesterday's markets."
"That is what we will be doing unless we review our procedures."
"What we need to ensure is: that we have legislation which is flexible; that we have a means of implementing it quickly; that we have a means of updating it quickly and easily; that we have a means of ensuring consistency across Member States; and that we have appropriate democratic scrutiny of any new procedures introduced."
"I would call on Mr Bolkestein, here today, to put forward proposals, that Parliament can consider, to address these vital needs. They are vital for the health of the financial services sector in the European Union."
"VOTE"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0321/2000) tabled by Mr Blokland, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the incineration of waste [C5-0371/2000 - 1998/0289(COD)]"
"(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)"
"Report (A5-0307/2000) by Mrs Figueiredo, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion [COM(2000) 368 - C5-0317/2000 - 2000/0157(COD)]"
"Figueiredo (GUE/NGL), rapporteur."
"(PT) Mr President, I wish to inform the House that the amendments that appear under the name of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, which I have tabled in my capacity as rapporteur, are the result of discussions with the Council and the Commission and also have the support of the coordinators of the political groups that are represented in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"They result from the need to ease the way of the codecision procedure to which this report is subject, as you all know."
"These amendments replace various other proposals in the report that will probably be rejected in the vote and which will then be replaced by the new amendments arising from this consensus"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, we have just voted, in the absence of a number of Members, on a declaration on BSE."
"Let me say that there is certainly one organ that has been struck by mad cow disease or by Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and that is the computer controlling the lifts."
"We were stuck for ten minutes because, at the time of the vote, out of all the lifts only two were working."
"I would like someone to find out what variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has infected our computers."
"Mr Bourlanges, I am afraid that this is a serious illness. We will inform our services of the matter."
"Report (A5-0320/2000), by Mrs Rothe, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market [COM(2000) 279 - C5-0281/2000 - 2000/0116(COD)]"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0318/2000), by Mr Cashman, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents [COM(2000) 30 - C5-0057/2000 - 2000/0032(COD)]"
"Following the vote on the ninth part of Amendment No 28"
"Mr President, might I ask the Liberal Group - I am also asking in my capacity as one of the co-rapporteurs - to take a slightly more pragmatic approach?"
"Because they keep going for split voting on so many articles when there is often only one aspect they want to vote against."
"So I would be grateful if the Liberals could take a more pragmatic and speedier approach."
"Mr President, it is a great shame that neither rapporteur has entered into proper consultation over this."
"We are dealing with a very important piece of legislation and with important articles."
"We Liberals, along with certain other members of this House, would like to take this opportunity to make it absolutely crystal clear that we are in favour of improving this openness regulation."
"So I am sorry there has not been enough consultation."
"We want to show how we uphold the interests of the citizens in this Chamber."
"Mr President, in the light of the excellent vote of support for this report and given the Commission's response this morning, it is obvious - if you look at all the parts we have voted on - that under Rule 69(2) we should postpone the vote on the draft legislative resolution in order to allow us to enter into fruitful negotiations with the Commission and the Council."
"I hope the House will support that proposal."
"(Parliament decided to postpone the vote)"
"Mr President, I understand that there is now no possibility of voting on the Theorin and Smet reports."
"I would therefore like to recommend that the vote on these reports be postponed until the November II part-session."
"I also put to the vote Mrs Theorin's proposal to postpone the vote to the November II part-session."
"Mr President, the Theorin and Smet reports were debated late yesterday evening, and the intention was that we should vote on them now."
"The Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats has presented to me the same request that I have just expressed, that is, that we postpone the vote on these reports until the November II part-session and not vote on them this evening."
"The majority of the women will be travelling to a conference of Members of Parliament in Berlin."
"It is therefore a joint request from the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists to postpone the vote until November II."
"Mr President, let me make one thing clear."
"The EPP Group did not itself ask but was asked to postpone this."
"I personally said that I could agree to that."
"But there are many other views in our group."
"I could agree to postponement under one condition, namely if Mrs Theorin used the time up to November II to improve her report, for as it stands our group cannot endorse it."
"I want to make one thing quite clear, and it is a point of principle. If we do not manage to complete the voting by Thursday lunchtime, then the normal procedure is for us to continue voting on Thursday evening."
"It is not in order for us to postpone the vote because some colleagues cannot be here in the evening."
"So, to put it in a nutshell: on behalf of my group I would agree to postpone it to November II, if Mrs Theorin states that she will continue to work on her report and to improve it."
"(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)"
"As far as the second point is concerned - namely that the votes will take place in the afternoon - I think that we are all aware of this and that we should be present."
"Mr President, I apologise for saying that the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats had also requested that the vote be postponed, but your coordinator in actual fact came to me and said that you also wished to postpone the issue until the November II part-session instead of taking the vote this evening."
"Mr Poettering, we have worked together with your people, and the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists have agreed on how the report should look."
"We were united on the central issues and came to an agreement in the negotiations."
"I submit to what Parliament wants to do, but it is, nevertheless, a matter of an agreement between the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, concerning both my report and the central issues it contains."
"I must say, therefore, that I am very surprised by this."
"(Parliament decided to postpone the vote)"
"Mr President, the vote on Mrs Villiers' report is also on the agenda."
"It so happens that the report has not yet been debated, and will not be until after the voting this evening."
"Mrs Villiers' report deserves better than to be voted on tomorrow morning."
"I therefore move that we postpone the vote on the Villiers report until the November II part-session."
"The vote is scheduled to take place tomorrow."
"However, tomorrow, it will be possible to request that it be postponed."
"For the time being it will remain on tomorrow's agenda since the debate has not yet taken place."
"Mr President, I am totally opposed to what is happening here in Parliament."
"More and more often, over the past few part-sessions, steps have been taken to try to postpone votes scheduled for the five days of our part-session for reasons relating to personal problems, attendance, etc. I think our Parliament brings discredit upon itself by taking decisions of that kind."
"Mr President, unlike Mrs Theorin, I do not suggest moving votes and debates to suit my own personal agenda."
"I will indeed be here to debate my report this afternoon and I will be here when it is scheduled to be voted on tomorrow."
"The reason why I would suggest that we postpone the vote is because - as Mr Goebbels has said - it is a very important issue."
"Not only does it raise the financial services issue, it could have far-reaching implications in terms of our procedure, in terms of the codecision procedure and in terms of our relationship with the Commission."
"That is a vote at which colleagues should be present."
"I would strongly urge that the vote be postponed until the Brussels part-session."
"Motion for a joint resolution on the third Asia-Europe Meeting"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, on a point of order, I just wanted to say that I too have an important report on this agenda."
"It will be debated and voted on tomorrow, and I am very grateful and proud that this is to happen on a Friday!"
"Mr President, a vote has just been taken in favour of postponing my report."
"I will go along with this, but had you gone down the list in the right order and not had the vote on the Cashman report first, because a number of people are absent this evening - for that is the reason - then there would still have been time to vote on the Smet report."
"I followed the order established by the sessional services and the House did not make any changes."
"Otherwise I would have been very happy to do so."
"Mr President, I find, somewhat to my consternation, that the vote on the report I was to present in plenary and which is on this morning' s agenda has been postponed inadvertently without anyone noticing."
"I understand that it is not easy, but changes to the agenda are something we need to be notified of."
"As a rule I am always here on Thursdays. This afternoon, however, I have to give a talk."
"So I will not be here for the votes this afternoon because I was not warned in time."
"I am one of those Members who attends sittings quite faithfully."
"I too would move that the vote be postponed to the November II part-session. First, however, there is just one point I would like to add."
"This morning we witnessed a moment of particularly extreme parliamentary idiocy."
"I do not know how much roll-call votes cost, but no doubt it comes to hundreds of thousands of French francs, or Belgian francs, out of our budget."
"Just to please some people, under ludicrous conditions, we have wasted time and money."
"Mr President, I feel you should refer the matter to the Conference of Presidents, so that excessive numbers of requests for split votes or roll-call votes can be identified and perhaps roll-call votes can even be restricted."
"All this is out of order and Parliament made itself look ridiculous this morning."
"Mr Rocard, I can assure you that this matter will be brought to the attention of the Conference of Presidents."
"With regard to the list of votes, the President cannot change the order of the list. Where necessary, it is the House which decides to make any changes."
"My role is simply to put one point to the vote after another."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"Michel Rocard is quite right."
"What is happening here is that a very few people are trying to take the opportunity yet again to put forward their interests, which they did not manage to get through in committee."
"They then see to it that we have to hold roll-call votes, which in fact are no longer really roll-call votes."
"This is a deliberate attempt by a very few people to raise their profile at the expense of others."
"So, first of all, we need a sensible system for roll-call votes."
"Secondly, we cannot accept the fact that after what I regard as a classic mistaken decision by Parliament to abolish Friday sittings, the very same people who once said they no longer wanted Friday sittings are now protesting!"
"My question is: have there meanwhile been objections to Parliament's decision to scrap Friday?"
"Have there been any legal objections?"
"What will things look like next year?"
"In future we might even end up in the same situation as now, where we keep having to postpone reports to the Brussels part-session instead of dealing with them here in Strasbourg."
"Can you give us any information on the matter?"
"Mr Mann, your first comment will naturally be brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Bureau and the Conference of Presidents."
"As President on duty today, I have to tell you that, as your fellow Member, all I can say is that I agree with you."
"I am afraid that we will have to set about changing the Rules of Procedure."
"With regard to Friday, there do not appear to have been any further developments, and in any case, this will also be brought to the attention of the Conference of Presidents."
"Resolution on BSE (B5-0880/2000)"
"Mr President, I should like to give an explanation of vote on the BSE feed resolution."
"I voted against whole herd slaughter because I do not believe it is the best way to eradicate BSE."
"I have heard that there are some farmers who, rather than report they have an animal with BSE, shoot that animal and bury it."
"I know that in France they have had whole herd slaughter and this does not seem to be the best way forward."
"Even the Scientific Steering Committee says it is not necessarily the most effective, and feed cohort slaughter - which we have in Britain - is effective."
"I also voted against Amendment No 7 because I do not believe it is possible, but I did vote for the resolution as a whole, especially the ban on the mammalian meat-and-bone meal feed for all farm animals, as we have had in the UK since 1996."
"I voted for the resolution because we have to have strong rules applicable across the EU."
"Mr President, I voted for the report on our great Parliament's initiative on the serious crisis in we which find ourselves due to the spread of this epidemic amongst cattle."
"I would like to point out that my intention in voting for the motion was, inter alia, to support point 7 of the report."
"Indeed, I hope and call for an analysis to be carried out immediately of all the cattle carcasses which have been placed on the market in butchers' shops throughout the European Union, in order to discover whether they are infected with BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy)."
"A check must be carried out on all the carcasses immediately, whatever the cost, for otherwise beef and veal sales will fall below zero."
". (EL) The Commission and the Council of the European Union have a great deal to answer for as regards the proportions which the issue of BSE has assumed."
"Apart from the negativity which they demonstrated during the first stage, when the European Parliament called attention to the risks in Great Britain, action during the second stage, when the crisis was at its height in Great Britain, was basically limited to that country, and there was no immediate programme of strict controls or attempt to restructure animal feedingstuffs at pan-European level."
"Cases of BSE have been identified in France because it was the only country in the European Union which took the initiative to apply a system of extensive controls."
"Today, complete uncertainty reigns in a climate of anxiety as to the risks in store, and neither consumers nor government authorities have any information on them."
"We must immediately:"
"take measures at pan-European level,"
"introduce extensive and strict controls on all European Union herds and imports,"
"remove meat-and-bone meal from animal feedingstuffs, not just for cattle and sheep but also for pigs, poultry and fish,"
"take measures, by completely restructuring animal feedingstuffs, to ensure that genetically modified soya flour from the USA, Brazil and elsewhere cannot infiltrate the system until scientists have given a full guarantee, which they have yet to do."
"Yesterday' s debate in this Chamber on mad cow disease and the safety of animal feed displayed, above all, the extreme confusion in regard to the allocation of responsibilities and in people' s minds."
"At present, responsibility is shared between the Community, which has already laid down some partial rules (the ban on feeding meat-and-bone meal to ruminants, rules on the heat/pressure method for producing meal, the compulsory removal of specific 'at risk material' ) and the States, which want to retain their right to enact measures appropriate to their own situation, together with their right to protect themselves and to react rapidly for public health reasons."
"The confusion that already exists in this context is exacerbated by a twofold difficulty. First, there is the difficulty of further standardisation with a view to introducing tighter controls, because some countries, such as Germany, do not want to pass on the extra costs to their farmers given that they are hardly affected by this disease."
"Secondly, and, conversely, there is the difficulty of applying different national rules, for now that border controls have more or less disappeared and labelling does not mention the country of origin, there is a significant risk of eating pork from pigs fed on meat-and-bone meal, even in a country where this is banned."
"We have now reached the pinnacle of confusion, as became abundantly clear from yesterday' s statements by the French minister, Mr Patriat, and the European Commissioner, Mr Byrne, who both seem to be completely at a loss."
"This situation shows how irresponsibly the unification of the internal market has been pursued in recent years."
"The first step we need to take is to start again from scratch, to review the labelling rules, to restore certain national controls, to create others and always to set out carefully, and in a clear and practicable manner, minimum European rules, while giving each State the essential right either to go further or to take safeguard measures."
"If we do not begin by clarifying responsibilities, rationalising and recognising the overriding right of nations, Europe will merely continue, as today, to play its sad part in watering down these responsibilities."
"Turning to the substance of the matter, my group recommended extremely stringent measures to fight this epidemic."
"But we must not stop there."
"It is all very well to put out fires, but it would be even better to prevent them breaking out."
"That is why we want to learn four major lessons which should be borne in mind for the future."
"The first lesson is that we must reject production methods that go against nature, that are doomed to lead sooner or later to tragedies of this sort."
"Perhaps quality farming is a little more expensive, but the apparent savings gained by farming geared to productivity in fact end up as terrible costs for society as a whole."
"In that respect, we are appalled to see that the Commission is doing all it can to re-authorise GMOs, at a time when we still have no real idea of their effects and they are liable, 10 or 20 years' hence, to cause new tragedies along the lines of mad cow disease."
"Lesson number two: quality farming, which ensures a certain independence in regard to food, cannot survive in Europe in the context of a global free market."
"Yet at this very moment, after Seattle, we feel that Commissioner Lamy is just itching to start up a new round of international trade negotiations, to include agriculture, with the intention of once again bringing about a fresh alignment with the world market."
"That is unacceptable."
"Lesson number three: the Member States must keep a closer eye on the Commission during international negotiations to prevent any further false moves - or should I have said betrayals? - such as the Blair House and Marrakech agreements, which, by cutting down on our vegetable protein products for the benefit of the Americans, drove us to respond by developing the meat-and-bone meal production that lies at the root of our current problems."
"We believe that, instead of giving the Commission even greater powers in international negotiations, as is currently proposed, the future treaty of Nice should subject the Commission to closer scrutiny by the national governments and parliaments."
"Lesson number four: we must radically review the policy of totally abolishing internal border controls, since it encourages trafficking of all kinds and makes health and safety controls more difficult."
"Similarly, we should temper the dogma of free movement at all costs, which led the Commission to threaten those States that wanted to introduce an embargo on British beef in 1996 and to drag France before the Court of Justice in 1999 for having refused to lift that embargo."
"Despite all that is happening today, the Commission has the audacity to uphold its complaint, thereby showing the extent to which it regards the free movement of products as the ultimate dogma."
"If the Member States want to put an end to these aberrations, they will have to take the treaty of Nice as an opportunity to clearly re-establish a national right of protection for reasons of public health."
". (FR) We voted for this resolution even though it is very belated and even though we distrust some of the ambiguous wording in it."
"We condemn the delay in the total and general ban on the production and use of meat-and-bone meal, given that we have known for ten years that it is responsible for the spread of BSE."
"Moreover, the ambiguous wording of Paragraph 4 is bound to raise questions about the resolve of the authorities to oppose, by all possible means, the fraud and swindling of the agri-food trusts, when it would have been so much simpler to say in a few words that the production and use of meat-and-bone meal are totally forbidden."
"- (FR) We voted in favour of this joint resolution."
"We are in a crisis situation, but we are not facing just a beef crisis."
"In fact, we are up against a real public health problem and an economic crisis."
"It concerns all the stages from 'farm to table' ."
"The consumers have lost confidence, and to contain the situation it was essential for us to reiterate our call for the rapid introduction of compulsory tests to identify BSE for all bovine animals. This measure had to go hand in hand with an immediate ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal for all species, throughout the Community."
"That is certainly a practical way of applying the precautionary principle."
"We have been waiting for far too long."
"The Union as a whole must be involved, for it is unacceptable to have one country taking draconian measures and putting its economy at risk while others carry on business as usual."
"Moreover, we are still, unfortunately, seeing many cases of fraud and the only way to put a stop to that is to ban meat-and-bone meal throughout the Community."
"These are the kind of measures that will reassure the citizens and that will send the farmers the message of solidarity we want to convey to them."
"The European Parliament must exert pressure on the Commission, which was overly cautious in the proposals it made during the debate."
"We are astounded that the Commission does not seem to realise the scale of the problem."
"Finally, this unprecedented crisis emphasises the limitations of the common agricultural policy, which we have seen for many years now."
"Today we must help farmers not to increase their production, but to improve it."
"There too, we have been waiting for far too long."
"Some people are concerned about the emergence of genetically modified products to replace meat-and-bone meal."
"A radical change of course in the CAP, which has now become vital, towards growing vegetable crops on fields hitherto left fallow could prevent people from resorting to massive imports of GMOs from the United States."
"The CAP must make public health its top priority."
". (PT) The growing number of cases in Britain of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and the current situation in France have placed the 'mad cow' or BSE issue even more firmly on the agenda."
"This affair has been characterised throughout by a lack of transparency and an extremely serious covering up of information at the highest level in some Member States of the European Union."
"What is at risk here is food safety, from the 'mad cow' issue, from dioxins and even from GMOs. All of this makes it clear that when the quest for maximum profit is the sole consideration, human and animal health are threatened."
"The lack of consumer confidence is spreading and the agricultural markets are battening down the hatches."
"Unless there is a change in the common agricultural policy, the food safety problem will only get worse."
"The CAP has always promoted intensive production, the gradual 'stepping up' of production and land concentration, which has basically served the interests of the agro-food industry and the big transnational food companies."
"The basic problem will not be solved simply by having a European food authority and belated one-off legislative measures, however positive they may be, such as the ban on meat meal in all animal feedingstuffs."
"It is crucial that we go further and promote a change in the common agricultural policy."
"The recent cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) are, I am afraid, condemning confirmation of the Union's delays in tackling food safety, delays which are even more to be condemned if we consider that the use of meat-and-bone meal in feedingstuffs has been considered dangerous for some time - it was condemned by this House a long time ago - and yet no measures have been taken."
"It is therefore necessary to establish as soon as possible the procedures to prevent the use of anatomical parts liable to lead to the transmission of the virus."
"The Commission's proposals contained in the White Paper on food safety and, in particular, the establishment of the authority which is to guarantee this safety, must be implemented as soon as possible - over a year has passed and the authority is not yet operative - in order to avoid the confusion of actions carried out by the governments on the subject causing damage such as that which we are witnessing now."
"The damage is extremely serious in that it affects two strictly related areas: human health, on the one hand, and, on the other, the health of the cattle species and, consequently, the economy of the zootechnical sector."
"We should remember that Europe banned France from continuing to enforce the embargo on beef and veal from the United Kingdom and that the lack of measures has allowed the epidemic now to spread to France."
"It is, nevertheless, necessary for the Commission to ban the use of meat-and-bone meal henceforth and to provide for - as far as is known - safer procedures to destroy the parts considered dangerous such as the brain and bone marrow."
"Until we are given more information by the scientific bodies, it would be appropriate to destroy the cattle carcasses as well to provide the highest possible guarantee of the protection of human health."
"The cases of BSE which have arisen in France, in the same way as the dioxins in chickens issue in Belgium, are the latest in a long series of irresponsible incidents."
"For fear of spreading panic among the citizens or with a view to avoiding commercial disasters, certain governments did not provide the Commission with the necessary information quickly enough or did not immediately call a halt to consumption of the products in question or ban their export at the first signs of danger."
"These irresponsible attitudes must be strongly condemned and, to avoid these incidents reoccurring, appropriate regulations must be established for all the States of the Union."
"It is unthinkable that we should be trying to run a single market without common rules for such a major sector as that of public health."
"In the face of these uncertainties, the citizens' reaction is, rightly, one of fear and the refusal to consume those products which are suspected of being dangerous for health."
"This attitude is combined with lack of confidence in the European Union, which appears to the citizens not to be able to guarantee the safety of the foodstuffs on the market."
"To restore the confidence of the citizens as well as protect their health, it is vital that the Union speeds up its decision-making, defining common rules on the matter and placing the scientific and control bodies in operation as soon as possible to monitor food safety."
"The ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal for feedingstuffs is only the first step along this road."
". (FR) Meat eaters are starting to be overcome by paranoia, regardless of whether the meat is produced by traditional, high-quality production processes, which do not use meat-and-bone meal."
"The constraints some producers, especially in France, have imposed on themselves to guarantee the quality and traceability of their products may already have been compromised by the loss of consumer confidence, not only in the products but also in measures to guarantee their safety, since products labelled AOC, IGP, etc. are also affected."
"We cannot allow an entire industry to be destroyed."
"We must tighten up our health and safety controls, impose a procedure for systematic BSE testing, and ban the use of proteins derived from animals."
"That is where Europe can assume its legitimate role in full and where it must play its rightful part."
"Any efforts the Member States make will remain fruitless unless the same requirements are imposed on imported products from the European Union and from third countries."
"Today we have to ban the use of meat-and-bone meal in animal feed, given that we cannot guarantee the traceability of the inputs, but this raises a number of problems."
"Should we burn them or store them?"
"Provided we set up specialised facilities to control the impact of this on the environment."
"Should we replace them? For the time being with oilseed imports, even though we cannot distinguish between imports that have or have not come from genetically modified varieties."
"It is crucial to resume the negotiations in the WTO so as to enable European farmers to increase their production of vegetable-based proteins."
"The farmers cannot tackle this crisis without help: we need to draw up a support plan for stock-farmers and introduce measures to restore consumer confidence."
"Moreover, the politicians must fulfil their responsibility for dealing with the human situations these difficulties have produced."
"The time has come for a global debate."
"The discussion of the White Paper on food safety is an opportunity to do so."
"Let us grasp it."
". (FR) Yesterday' s debate on mad cow disease was an exemplary one in many respects."
"Let me point to the key role the UEN Group, and also the very coherent draft resolution we tabled, played in ensuring that it took place."
"We finally agreed to co-sign the joint draft resolution and we are delighted it was adopted by a very large majority, despite its inadequacies and weaknesses."
"At the same time, we keenly regret that the amendments our group tabled were not adopted."
"We consider it crucial, however, for the Community budget to help implement the new safety measures imposed on stock-farmers, and especially on all those working in the beef sector who are hard hit by the loss of consumer confidence."
"It is equally crucial to demand the immediate resumption, in the framework of the WTO, of the talks on the provisions of the Marrakech agreement relating to oilseed, an agreement which goes very much against European producers, so as to prevent the ban on meat-and-bone meal from resulting in mass imports of oilseed that may contain genetically modified organisms."
"Above all, yesterday' s debate highlighted the differences of opinion on how to deal with the crisis: differences between Member States, differences of political approach, differences between the Community institutions."
"There are deep-seated differences on the question of meat-and-bone meal and also on the subject of tests."
"So we are now facing an absolutely fundamental safety problem affecting the public health of our peoples and the very future of an entire industry that plays a decisive role in the social balance in some of our Member States."
"In the face of this crisis, we cannot therefore confine ourselves to half-measures or to compromise provisions, i.e. to options that are totally inappropriate when what we should be doing is applying the precautionary principle by taking the relevant measures to ensure the maximum safety of our peoples."
"The debate has shown that the Council Presidency and the Commission are very much at sea on this issue."
"It was rather pathetic to see the Council Presidency try to pass the buck by putting its salvation in the hands of the future European Food Safety 'Authority' , as though the fact that it was European were in itself a guarantee of absolute trustworthiness."
"The accusations flying around on all sides in yesterday' s debate - 'The Council is to blame!'"
"'The Member States are to blame!' 'The Commission is to blame!' - show the extent to which the Community machinery actually works rather like a system for the reciprocal denial of responsibility, at the expense of the sole purpose of the debate: the effective protection of the public health of our people."
"For its part, the Commission had to note the wide divergence of views on the remedies needed to contain the crisis."
"It decided it was a good idea to pour derision on the protective measures adopted by some Member States, in particular with its reference to 'magic' in regard to the total ban on meat-and-bone meal."
"While denouncing the lax approach taken by some Member States, it certainly did not point out its own reluctance to drag France before the Court of Justice because it quite appropriately decided to maintain its embargo on British beef."
"The Commission is clearly envisaging no more than half-way measures, which will take away from and not add to the countries with the most stringent safety, whereas, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, it should be giving Member States back the freedom of action they need to protect their people effectively, to ensure their safety, taking account of public opinion in their country, the political resolve there, the scale of the epidemic in their country and the place of the sectors involved in that country' s economy and their society."
"Because of the inability of all the European institutions, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, to define an appropriate Community policy that responds to the safety needs of the Member States most directly concerned, problems will arise in deciding whether it is the constraints of the single market or the health and safety needs of our people that come first."
"How, indeed, can we restore consumer confidence in France and prevent the collapse of the sectors linked to stock-farming if, on the one hand, we put a total ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal by French farmers while at the same time authorising imports of meat from Member States that continue to feed their animals with meat-and-bone meal and refuse to carry out tests?"
"We must strictly respect the wishes of those Member States that intend to put food safety and consumer health above all other concerns, their resolve to give priority to scientifically based decisions and to the precautionary principle in regard to any measures they take, while choosing the middle road between the positions of the various partners, and especially those who are most lax."
"Otherwise it would become quite clear that the conduct of Community bodies is not being guided by the principle of subsidiarity."
"Blokland report (A5-0321/2000)"
"Mr President, as we are all aware, the fight against air pollution is an extremely important issue."
"The main source of air pollution is the large manufacturing companies, as in the case of waste incineration, which is a result of the waste produced in other daily industrial activities and other common daily activities of the European citizens."
"I voted for this directive but I would like to stress that, in doing so, I am calling upon the European Union to commit itself and concern itself, rightly, with those who breathe the toxic air produced by these industrial activities. It must also - and even more so - concern itself with those who work in these sectors."
"I feel that it would be appropriate to reduce the working hours of the people who work in pollutant companies."
"For if these companies pollute the air outside, I hate to think about the state of the air inside the factories!"
". (FR) We have now reached the end of a long process leading to the adoption of a Directive on the incineration of waste."
"The Commission proposal goes back to 1998, but, because of the many points of disagreement between Parliament and the Council, the Conciliation Committee had to be convened on 11 October."
"So today we are deciding on the text that has emerged from the conciliation procedure."
"Let me remind you that the directive covers the incineration and co-incineration of waste."
"These two treatment methods must form part of a global strategy that covers the prevention, re-use and recycling of waste, a strategy that is coordinated at European level."
"In the course of the debates that marked the two readings by the European Parliament, I expressed my doubts and fears about lumping hazardous and non-hazardous waste together in the same directive."
"These are very legitimate concerns and they have led Parliament to be very vigilant and to table amendments aimed at establishing very stringent controls over everything connected with the process of incineration and co-incineration."
"After extensive discussion with the Council, we achieved what we wanted on several points."
"On co-incineration, for example, which is generally carried out in cement kilns, the limit values for emissions are specified in an annex."
"However, if more than 40% of the waste incinerated in plants of this kind consists of toxic waste or untreated, mixed municipal waste, the plant will have to comply with the more stringent standards of another annex on incineration."
"The European Commission wanted to exclude vegetable agricultural waste and waste from the forestry and food industry."
"At second reading, Parliament added fibrous waste from the production of raw pulp and pulp-based paper where this waste is intended for co-incineration."
"It managed to get this point through during the conciliation procedure."
"Parliament also succeeded with another point: plants in which radioactive waste is incinerated must be expressly excluded from the scope of the directive."
"Parliament also succeeded in obtaining stricter rules on the operation of incineration plants, together with improved public access to information."
"I will conclude by emphasising once again that the widespread treatment of hazardous waste must not lead us to tolerate the production of such waste."
"Our priority is and must remain to prevent the production of waste, in accordance with the line adopted in the European Union' s strategy in this field."
". There is a serious concern within the European Union that not enough is being done to implement new waste management proposals."
"The 370 million citizens of the EU are demanding action on this subject and they are right to do so."
"Waste in Europe is being generated at a rate of over 1kg per person per day."
"Two billion tonnes of waste is being generated within the EU on an annual basis."
"This situation cannot continue for ever."
"The European Union must be clear about one aspect to solving waste disposal problems."
"The future of waste disposal does not lie in local authorities up and down the length and breadth of the European Union searching for new landfill sites."
"There is serious growing concern about the actual environmental consequences of landfill sites in general."
"I share this concern."
"I believe that nothing less then a major shift from reliance on landfill sites to more integrated waste management plans will suffice."
"The European Parliament has been to the forefront in devising new waste management strategies in recent years."
"I support the objective of the directive which we are discussing here today which is to reduce the adverse effects of incineration on the environment and on human health by considerably reducing the emission levels into the air of several major pollutants."
"This is also part of broader European Union environmental policies which are designed to reduce the use of pollutants across all economic sectors in Europe, in accordance with obligations laid down by the Kyoto Accord."
"The European Union fully supports the strict, ambitious but attainable recycling and recovery targets that have been laid down by the Irish Government."
"These targets which are to be achieved over the next 15 years include the following: a divergence of 50% of overall household waste from landfill sites; a minimum 65% reduction in bio-degradable waste which is presently consigned to landfill sites; the development of waste recovery facilities employing environmentally beneficial technologies capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of bio-degradable waste per annum."
"All these measures reflect changing public opinions on the issue of waste management."
"The days of landfill sites are now coming to an end and must be replaced by more environmentally beneficial technologies."
"Figueiredo report (A5-0307/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Figuereido report on the eradication of social exclusion and poverty, to quote the actual text of the report."
"However, I am amazed and extremely disappointed at many of the votes cast regarding some of the amendments."
"I am absolutely convinced that 99% of the responsibility for social exclusion and poverty lies with the governments of our 15 States."
"In the past, they have all vied with each other to increase social exclusion and poverty and they are continuing to do so now. If indeed, for example, pensions were less inadequate in terms of the standard of living they allow, there would be fewer poor people."
"Group of the European People's Party, why did you vote against the Fatuzzo amendment - tabled by myself - which stated that poverty is also one of the causes of low pensions?"
"I am extremely disappointed and I hope that you will vote differently next time."
". (EL) The report by Mrs Figueiredo could make a very valuable contribution to the fight against social exclusion by developing cooperation between Member States along these lines."
"The Council should therefore ensure that:"
"funding for the programme is substantially increased,"
"a chart of specific targets is incorporated into national programmes,"
"all related policies are adjusted in a bid to integrate social groups with special needs,"
"new forms of exclusion are included, such as exclusion from the information society,"
"social agencies, especially representatives of the vulnerable groups targeted by the programme, are involved in the procedures,"
"the programme is spearheaded by measures to help child poverty, women and the elderly,"
"a network is established at European level to record, develop, promote and adjust the programme to combat social exclusion."
". (FR) We abstained on this report, even the amended version."
"The main reason we did not vote against it is because its author set out a few good intentions."
"Unfortunately, however, good intentions do not make a policy, even one of condemnation."
"The official count is 65 million poor in Europe, or 18% of the population."
"That means that a considerable proportion of the working class of one of the richest regions in the world is reduced to poverty."
"This figure of 65 million poor is not the effect of some misfortune that has come out of the blue; it is the result of the greed of a privileged capitalist class intent on boosting company profits and stock exchange rates, which therefore makes people redundant, closes down factories, reducing 15 million women and men to unemployment, and puts such pressure on all wages that the lowest wages are not enough to live on."
"The report proposes a budget of EUR 100 million over five years to combat poverty."
"That comes to one and a half euros for every poor European."
"Even as a handout that would be derisory, quite apart from the fact that the issue of poverty does not call for charity."
"We realise that no report and no vote, even by the European Parliament, can alter this situation."
"Yet the report could at least have put the blame at the door of those responsible."
"In any case, though we did not vote against the report, we did not feel able to vote in favour of it either, because not only are its practical proposals inadequate but, alas, it conceals rather than combats the actual situation, namely the exploitation that is the real cause of poverty among the working classes."
". (FR) This programme to combat social exclusion is one of the priorities of the French Presidency, which has made the social Europe the leitmotif of its proposals."
"Let me remind you that Lisbon defined a common strategy of social inclusion."
"I welcome this initiative, which responds to the expectations of our fellow citizens, the citizens of Europe."
"Indeed, while we welcome the return to growth and the fall in unemployment, we must not close our eyes to the fact that inequalities are still with us, if not getting worse."
"Social exclusion is a very real phenomenon, as the Eurostat statistics show: some 18% of the population of the European Union lives on less than 60% of the average national income - this is the low-income threshold taken to measure relative poverty - which means that 65 million people live on low incomes."
"Even though the unemployment rate has fallen, there are still 16 million unemployed in the European Union."
"Moreover, although unemployment is still the main factor behind poverty and exclusion, job insecurity and low pay are nonetheless obstacles to full integration into society."
"Too many of our fellow-citizens are left by the wayside."
"We must therefore adopt proactive measures to provide social protection and access to public services in the field of health, education, housing and so on."
"I unreservedly support the proposal to implement a second Luxembourg process to deal with social exclusion, containing guidelines and national action programmes."
"Indeed, we can see all the benefits of this method in the employment field."
"The Lisbon European Council set the European Union the objective of becoming a knowledge-based, competitive and inclusive society."
"That can be achieved only at the cost of considerable efforts to guarantee all men and women access to training in the new information and communication technologies and also to the new telecommunications networks."
"Universal service has a prime role to play in this regard."
"The next meeting point is Nice where, I hope, the Member States will send out a powerful message indicative of their political resolve to embark on a global strategy to strengthen the European social model by adopting the Social Agenda and the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The primary purpose of the report is to support a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between Member States of the EU to combat social exclusion."
"I believe that the establishment of such a programme of community action is both wise and can be very helpful."
"We do not want to build a two-tier Europe, a Europe of the haves and have-nots."
"We do not want to accentuate the gap between the rich and poor."
"The fact of the matter is that long-term unemployment and youth unemployment are quite concentrated in particular areas within the European Union."
"They are concentrated in specific black spots within many rural and urban parts of the European Union."
"Devising initiatives to defeat the problems of social exclusion and to give hope and opportunities to the disadvantaged in our society must be a central core policy of all governments within the EU at this time."
"The principles underpinning this programme are to create an open method of coordination between Member States to help eradicate poverty and social exclusion."
"This will be achieved by setting specific objectives to be integrated into national action plans and implementing policies to promote equal opportunities."
"I believe that the rapporteur is right when he calls for greater participation of public authorities, social partners and civil society in measures to defeat poverty and social exclusion at this time."
"As a result of the Amsterdam Treaty, all governments within the EU must send new action plans on employment to the European Commission for its evaluation and consideration."
"The European Commission must evaluate all these plans to see how successful the governments of the EU are in defeating social exclusion."
"We must learn from each other on this specific matter."
"Otherwise the gap between rich and poor will widen within the EU."
"In this context, I welcome the key provisions of the Social Policy Agenda Programme 2000-2005 as recently published by the European Commission."
"This will give an increased role to EU social partners in terms of the drafting of different EU directives and regulations."
"Employer relations will be improved."
"There will be continued national and European support for local job creation programmes."
"There will also be an improved coordination of policy programmes in the area of the information society, modern telecommunication services and Internet related activities."
"Ireland has quite an advanced system of social and employment rights and many EU directives are being drafted, particularly on the Irish model in the field of social partnership and employee/employer relations."
"- (FR) There is 18% of the population of Europe, or 60 million people, living on less than 60% of the average national income (the low-income threshold used to measure relative poverty)."
"Simply mentioning these figures ought to drive us to act, which is what the Heads of State and Government did in Lisbon by entering poverty and exclusion on the European agenda for the first time."
"Since Europe cannot be economically strong without social justice, we can only welcome this progress."
"That is why I have no option but to vote in favour of this report by our colleague, which not only endorses the Commission' s proposal but also enhances its content."
"The report calls for qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion to be established."
"It is fundamental within the 15 States of the European Union for us all to able to speak of the same thing on the basis of identical data."
"Moreover, the report calls on the Member States to be more proactive and set precise objectives when they draw up their national action plans."
"Finally, the report goes back to the open method of coordination, calling for dialogue between the players involved (social partners, NGOs, local and regional authorities) and networking."
"In conclusion, our Committee on Social Affairs, is proposing a budget of EUR 100 million instead of the EUR 70 proposed by the Commission."
"All in all, this is a step forward that we must consolidate and encourage, since economic progress by itself can certainly not guarantee the citizens a better quality of life."
"- (FR) This report has the merit of revealing the true face of European integration today: 62 million poor and 18 million unemployed."
"The ongoing restructuring processes and mergers involve new redundancy plans."
"Although we are seeing strong economic growth and a fall in unemployment, in the modern world work offers no protection against exclusion."
"The 'working poor' , most of them women, working part-time, for a pittance and in the most insecure jobs, join the trail of poverty so loftily ignored in the official speeches about economic recovery."
"Quality jobs, health care, housing and education are indeed basic rights, which, if they were binding upon employers and states, would be able to offer protection against social exclusion."
"That is why we will vote in favour of the report on combating exclusion."
"Yet the Members who will be endorsing this text today did not show the same surge of solidarity when they voted for a Charter without social rights which, in reducing measures to combat exclusion to the level of measures of assistance, constitutes a step backward in relation to much of the legislation now in force."
"A more effective way of combating exclusion would be, for example, to establish a European minimum guaranteed wage."
"- The special Lisbon Summit on employment, economic reform and social cohesion of 23-24 March 2000 brought poverty and social exclusion back onto the Union' s agenda for the first time in a long time."
"In submitting its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission is complying with the Council' s call to present ""by June 2000"" an ""initiative for cooperation in this field""."
"According to Eurostat figures, some 18% of the population of the EU live on less than 60% of the average national income (taking the low-income threshold as a measure of relative poverty)."
"The Commission proposal establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion (2001-2005) consists of promoting a better understanding of social exclusion, mainstreaming the promotion of inclusion and developing priority actions addressed to specific target groups."
"This strategy is to be implemented through three main strands."
"Strand 1: analysis of characteristics, causes, processes and trends in social exclusion; strand 2: policy cooperation and exchange of best practice; strand 3: dialogue involving the various stakeholders."
"The open method of coordination is emphasised which respects the principle of subsidiarity whilst actively involving all relevant actors."
"This is all welcome, but like the rapporteur I believe the programme could be more radical."
"I support his amendments."
"- I welcome this report which calls for more funding for the proposed European programmes to combat poverty and social exclusion."
"Cooperation between Member States is crucial for tackling these deep rooted problems that exist all across the EU, but particularly in my own constituency in the North-West of England."
"Moss Side and Salford are amongst the most deprived inner city areas in the whole of Europe."
"We are sadly all too familiar with the spider's web of problems impoverished areas face - deprivation, social exclusion, unemployment, crime and drug abuse, but with the help of European schemes tackling social exclusion and European cash, local communities can begin to free themselves from this evil tangle."
"The British Labour Government has been leading the fight against poverty and social exclusion."
"Three years ago, the Prime Minister set up the Social Exclusion Unit which coordinates government action to reduce social exclusion by producing joined up solutions to joined up problems."
"It works with other departments which have a close bearing on social exclusion."
"I fully endorse this innovative measure that has benefited many young people in particular, through strong action on truancy and school exclusion, sleeping rough, teenage pregnancy and providing support to 16-18 year olds not in education, employment or training."
"This is a great example of the Labour Government delivering concrete benefits to ordinary people."
"With a new, radical approach, I strongly believe that we can, not only turn the corner, but reach the finishing line too and, one day, banish poverty and social exclusion from the North-West entirely."
"Rothe report (A5-0320/2000)"
"Mr President, I abstained from the vote for one specific reason: in my opinion, this report has not made the environmental progress that I hoped and called for."
"I did vote for all the amendments intended to increase alternative energy sources, but I had hoped that we would be able to take a further step forward."
"I know that it is difficult, I know that this report has, in any case, adopted the right line, but further endeavours are necessary and, to this end, I call for this alternative energy policy to be pursued more vigorously."
"Mr President, with the Rothe report - at least with the interventionist aid system for renewable energy sources that it describes - we are about to make mistakes in energy policy, which will have a very serious impact on Europe in the long term."
"That is why I rejected the report."
"Energy policy must look to the future, be sustainable and respect market principles."
"What the report seeks is precisely the opposite."
"The policy of constantly subsidising wind, biomass and solar energy is mistaken and purely symbolic."
"Billions are paid out in subsidies to the few who are ruining the countryside with their wind turbines."
"We now have a plant with more than 60 rotors, taking up as much land as 1000 football pitches."
"Left standing are the consumer and Europe itself, for this policy undermines all the advantages of our policy of liberalising the electricity markets."
"Mr President, I voted for the report on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources."
"I am, of course, in favour of saving energy, which is extremely important for us, but it is very important for pensioners and elderly people as well; if possible they need a constant supply which is always available."
"The cold winter days and nights of both northern and southern Europe come to mind, where, sadly, many elderly people are forced by their low income to turn off the heating to save money."
"An excellent example of energy-saving is the town of Brescia, in Italy, where district heating, which is actually generated from waste incineration, is used both to generate electricity and to generate heat which is then transported to all the houses of the townspeople of Brescia."
"I call for a similar system to be adopted in all the towns of Europe."
"- (FR) We will certainly not dispute the benefits of ""the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources"" ."
"All the better if, as an added bonus, this leads to the creation of 500 000 jobs, as the report states."
"Nor do we have any problem with the idea of giving support to research in this field or even the use of these sources of electricity, so that consumers will not hesitate to choose them over electricity produced by more pollutant processes."
"But why should support also involve private profit?"
"That is the case today, because the proposed subsidies would go to private companies involved in research or marketing, including trusts such as Total Energie, Shell Solaire, ABB Alstom Power, Dalkia, a subsidiary of Vivendi, Arthur Andersen, Tiru, a joint subsidiary of Suez-Lyonnaise des eaux and Vivendi, and other industrial groups that make enough profit as it is without the need to turn to the taxpayer yet again."
"Electricity production and distribution ought to be a public service."
"So why could the States or the European institutions not take over this public service as a regional authority and hire the necessary 500 000 workers directly?"
"The savings that would result from not having to pay out profits to the shareholders of a private firm would allow the workers to be paid proper wages and provide a decent public electricity service."
"- (FR) During last night's plenary debate, many of us spoke of the need to promote renewable energy sources at a time when the Conference on Climate Change is being held in The Hague."
"Indeed, scientists and climatologists are increasingly less worried about hiding their fears in relation to the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions, and even the general public is starting to become aware of them."
"These projections, which are dramatic in the very short term, should convince us of the need to adopt clear, proactive measures at European level targeted at checking this process of degradation in the quality of the environment."
"The Commission proposal and the Rothe report we voted for today follow that line in calling for the promotion of renewable energy sources, which are alternative sources that respect the environment in the production of electricity."
"This follows up the statements by the Commission and the call from the European Parliament for major progress to be made towards implementing the target set out in the White Paper of doubling the share of renewable energy in energy consumption by the year 2020."
"The Member States must now pursue the same line and respect the environmental objectives they endorsed both at European level and at international level, but they must also ensure their independence as regards energy and security of supplies."
"At present, the Union is dependent on outside supplies for about 50% of its energy, and that figure may well rise to 70% by the year 2020 unless we develop renewable energy sources."
"Today the European Union is leading the way in the construction of plants for the various types of energy production."
"If the Union wants to remain competitive in this sector, it will have to contribute by using and developing the technologies concerned, which implies major public funding."
"For all these reasons, and because the Rothe report is an excellent report, I voted for it in the hope that the Commission and the Council will follow us."
"- (FR) Naturally I am in favour of actively promoting renewable energy sources."
"It is technological progress that will promote the use of 'friendly' energy sources, rather than appealing to ideological principles."
"It is not enough to proclaim ambitious targets and to make it binding upon States to reach them."
"After all, the States need the resources to do so."
"Some of the European Parliament' s proposals are unrealistic and I cannot endorse them."
"It is the European Commission' s aim to double the share of renewable energy sources in the total consumption of energy by the year 2010."
"Renewables are a very important part of an effective climate protection strategy."
"In Finland peat is an important renewable energy source, and accounts for 6% of all fuel used."
"Unlike in Central Europe, there is a lot of peat in the Nordic countries such as Finland."
"Specialists worldwide have also said that peat is an important biomass fuel, whose annual growth clearly exceeds its consumption in Finland."
"The northernmost areas of Finland are in the tundra zone, where not enough wood grows to constitute a source of natural energy."
"Peat is an important fuel particularly in these regions, where it also has an important impact on employment."
"I am satisfied that the European Parliament recognises these facts and includes peat in its report on renewable energy sources."
"The Member States of the European Union, including Finland, are committed to achieving the Kyoto targets, conservation of natural resources and a reduction in emissions of harmful substances."
"The importance of nuclear energy is increasing constantly, for this very reason."
"Obviously we have to observe more progressive and effective safety and security rules when using nuclear energy and when storing nuclear waste."
"Yesterday, 15 November, the Finnish energy company, Teollisuuden Voima, requested the Finnish Council of State to give a decision, in principle, on the construction of a fifth nuclear reactor."
"I hope our government and parliament will take a positive view of this request."
"The responsible use of nuclear energy provides the opportunity for an energy source that is environmentally friendly and economical, and there is no reason to place restrictions on its use."
"."
"(DE) We all know that we cannot base the future of our energy supplies on the energy sources of the past."
"The Commission realises that, even more so the rapporteur, by calling for greater priority than before to be attached to alternative energy sources and alternative energy production."
"I therefore thank Mrs Rothe for her good report."
"The first lesson we must learn from past experience with conventional energy sources - for instance, their impact on the climate and on nature, the incalculable safety risks and the foreseeable shortage of resources - is that we must considerably strengthen our support for the development and use of new energy sources."
"In the long term, that means we must move away from the policy of subsidising conventional, fossil energy sources."
"A first step here is consistently to break down all obstacles to the use of renewables."
"Moreover, in future we must do more to make existing best practice more widely known to the public."
"Secondly, the aim of any energy and economic policy must be to reduce and optimise energy consumption, for only the careful treatment of resources of whatever kind can help minimise the external costs."
"In that regard, we call for more targeted research into the external costs of the production and use of renewable energy sources."
"Lastly, we can only restructure energy supplies if we take account of the special conditions pertaining to alternative energy suppliers."
"Decentralised electricity provision is not just a structural but also a social aspect."
"Thirdly, therefore, we must not liberalise the energy sector without defining minimum social standards."
". (NL) We cannot carry on producing electricity from the customary sources."
"Coal and oil supplies will eventually run out and are responsible for CO2 emission."
"Nuclear energy can cause disasters capable of rendering large parts of the earth uninhabitable, and produces a hazardous waste product."
"So we must go in search of energy that is already present in nature, but which has remained unused because no one has developed the technology to tap into it."
"It is not very ambitious of Parliament and the Commission to only want to double the use of this form of energy over the decade to come."
"There is still too little water, wind and solar power, which is what makes it comparatively expensive."
"Everyone wants a method of electricity production that is as environmentally-friendly as possible, but they also want it as cheaply as possible."
"This particularly applies to people who are not very well off and whose first concern, therefore, is that their household costs should remain as low as possible."
"If clean energy remains an expensive option then it will also remain an elite form of energy for some time to come."
"Environmentally-aware high-earners are free to make a voluntary contribution to cleaner forms of energy, within a liberalised market, whilst everyone else carries on in the same old way."
"Clean energy must be available to all and affordable to all."
"As far as the six points are concerned, such as the incineration of peat and organic waste, I support the veto requested by Greenpeace."
"ASEM III resolution (B5-0811/2000)"
"- (FR) In Seoul we saw the blatant contrast between the official summit of the Heads of State and Government and the citizens' and popular movements in which I took part."
"The first is aimed at speeding up the neo-liberal reforms, against which the second were protesting."
"The unions and the social movements reject the dictatorship of the ""chaebol"" , the large, traditional industrial conglomerates, but that does not mean they want this to be replaced by the dictatorship of the IMF or the WTO. Nor, indeed, by a new - economic - colonisation of their country, at a time when everyone is wondering which western firms will be buying out the South Korean industries that are in trouble."
"The alternative forum also encouraged interparliamentary contacts, punctuated by a meeting at the South Korean National Assembly on 18 October."
"What it found is beyond dispute: the elected assemblies have been kept out of the ASEM process, even though businessmen were systematically involved."
"It is urgently necessary to breathe new life into the interparliamentary dialogue (ASEP) between Europe in the west and Asia in the east."
"The preparation of ASEM IV must be used as an opportunity to set out our requirements for democracy, on the one hand, by ensuring that the elected assembles and civil society are kept informed and able to intervene - which involves, in particular, the establishment of a social forum - and, on the other hand, by adhering fully to social, environmental and human rights."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Central American Parliament"
"Mr President, as we all know, the European Union has, through the Commission, the Council and, particularly, the European Parliament, for a long time maintained excellent relations with Central America, its institutions and, specifically, the countries that comprise it."
"We have done so out of respect and in order to assist the consolidation of democracy in that part of the world, to support and assist social and economic development and also to ensure that human rights are respected there as elsewhere in the world."
"One of the priorities that we have supported for the countries in that region is regional integration."
"We feel that regional integration is a crucial instrument for promoting the three fundamental objectives that I have just mentioned."
"In Central America, there is already a Secretariat for Regional Integration, a Central American Bank, a Central American Upper House and a Central American Parliament. Curiously, this and the European Parliament are the only Parliaments in the world to directly elect their members."
"The Central American parliament appears to have recently been the subject of certain misunderstandings and even criticism."
"We received a delegation from that parliament and made a commitment to improving the political profile not only of its role in that part of the world but also of relations between our Parliament and the Central American Parliament."
"Hence the motion for a resolution that we are tabling following a project that was started a while ago by Parliament' s delegation to Central America, chaired by Mr Salafranca, and which we have modestly continued with during our term of office."
"This resolution, therefore, means giving political support to the Central American Parliament, to the democratic stage par excellence, which must strive to be the focus of pluralist debate in that part of the world, and, at the same time, it means sending the message that Europe is in favour of regional integration in that part of the world."
"There is just one aspect that we are unhappy with, which is not a problem of substance, but concerns item 5 of this resolution: we feel that, by adopting this item, the European Parliament has adopted an excessively paternalistic attitude."
"We shall abstain from voting on item No 5, but our aim is to provide political support to the Central American Parliament and regional integration there."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the resolution being tabled in this House today on the situation in Central America is timely given the recent visit of a delegation from the Central American Parliament to Brussels."
"It is timely for three important reasons that affect this special American region, not to mention the importance and political appropriateness of strengthening the dialogue between the European Parliament and the Central American Parliament."
"The three reasons are as follows: firstly, because it promotes the process of the consolidation of democracy and the deepening of the demand for human rights to be respected, particularly in relation to indigenous populations."
"Secondly, because it coincides with the tenth Latin American Summit, which will take place shortly in Panama, and which will deal with commitments to children and young people on the basis of justice and equality in the new millennium."
"Thirdly, because it also coincides with the current philosophy of the European Commission in favour of redirecting Union external action towards the countries of Latin America with the potential impact that this may have."
"In this regard, we hope and trust that the necessary amounts will be allocated to provide impetus for the process of regional integration in Central America, where dialogue is becoming necessary and essential as a permanent political exercise."
"We are therefore pleased with this political declaration by our Parliament in relation to the Central American Parliament, because it recognises the role that this institution plays in the process of integrating the countries of this area, situated between the north and south of America."
"Mr President, I would like to remind you that for eight years I have been a member of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of Central America and Mexico, firstly under the chairmanship of Mr Salafranca and now under the chairmanship of Mr Seguro."
"I remember very well that throughout these years this delegation has maintained extraordinary relations with Parlacen and with the other Latin American parliaments."
"This is perhaps because Parlacen and the European Parliament represent their citizens in a similar way."
"In both cases we are directly elected."
"I remember very well that Mr Salafranca signed a document with the President of Parlacen on political dialogue between the two parliaments."
"At that time I believe that our political will was to enable Parlacen to have ever more competences and more economic resources and to play an effective role in the integration of the region it represents."
"I believe that four years ago - Mr Salafranca perhaps remembers this better - we held a meeting, called by IRELA, in Antigua, a beautiful city in Guatemala, where we debated along with our colleagues from Parlacen what the future should be, not only of Parlacen, but also of the European Parliament."
"We saw that Parlacen was going through the same changes that this Parliament went through at the beginning, since it had to fight and continues to fight to have more competences, more resources and more presence and to be recognised as representative."
"I believe that this is one of the central themes of the debates at every interparliamentary conference, along with the economic and social difficulties experienced by some of the countries of Central America and South America."
"Two fundamental objectives are to try to ensure that social differences are not made worse by the economic policies that currently prevail in that region and to try to ensure that the parliaments help with the integration of the area, which would be beneficial to all."
"That is the purpose of this resolution."
"We believe that, not only now but since Parlacen was born, there are people who wish it to have fewer competences and less of a presence, because a parliament always creates discomfort, but I believe that the vocation of Parlacen, and of this and other parliaments, is to be of benefit to the people it represents, even if this may make the established powers feel uncomfortable."
"I therefore hope, Mr President, that this resolution will be approved by a large majority."
"Mr President, in this debate, we wish to express - as many previous speakers have done very effectively - this Parliament' s solidarity with, and support for, the Central American Parliament at a time when we are fighting to continue to prioritise the European Union' s external relations with the countries of Latin America."
"This is the approach of the report, an own-initiative report, which we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy are going to produce in conjunction with the competent delegations."
"Mr President, parliaments - as you and all of us in Parliament know very well - have today, more than ever, the difficult task, amongst others, of showing leadership in the development of our societies, of leading the quest for solutions to the many problems facing us by strengthening the values of democracy and social justice which we stand for."
"In the case of the Central American Parliament, this task is, if possible, even more important given the enormous challenge of the integration and structural development of these societies on the basis of peace, dialogue and reconciliation."
"I believe that, on the basis of the 1997 Declaration, which Mrs González Álvarez referred to, we have achieved the objective of maintaining useful and realistic cooperation which we must continue, in my judgment, I would not say modestly, as Mr Seguro has said, but brilliantly, which is how he usually carries out the work in which he is involved."
"I believe that the European Parliament is capable of demonstrating, through its actions, that it has a very positive view of the work of Parlacen by offering it its support and experience."
"Within the framework of our respective integration processes, it is clear that both the European Parliament and the Central American Parliament are required to play an increasingly important role."
"I believe that it is not our job as Members of the European Parliament to give advice to the Members of the Central American Parliament."
"The Central American Parliament will continue on its own course and will take a political path in a Central America which, I believe, wishes to and must regain possession of itself in a full union of diversity."
"On the basis of its shared roots, it must discover the broad range of its possible courses of development and the multiple possibilities that its project presents, by opting for peace, freedom and solidarity and also by responding to the age-old requirement of self knowledge."
"I therefore believe that we have to flatly reject the self-interested criticisms of those people who brand the activity of the Central American Parliament an artificial system and accuse it of being a cardboard parliament which is hollow and devoid of substance."
"The Central American Parliament, like the European Parliament, must gain prestige, credibility and legitimacy on the basis of the activity of its political groups, because the life of the parties is, or at least should be, a faithful reflection of the societies they represent."
"The aim should be to create strong parliaments which participate, act, debate and rebut, ratify and rectify, which energetically defend the values of freedom, which are the driving force of the region' s political development, and which also inform the people of the progress that has been made."
"Mr President, through this resolution we therefore wish to express our support for, and solidarity with, the Central American Parliament and also to ask the Commission to decisively support the multiannual programme which Parlacen has presented to the Commission, since we believe that, as an institution, it legitimises the process of integration in Central America and serves as a symbol of a new era of dialogue and peace."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I hope that our European Parliament' s relationship with the Central American Parliament works, in any event, much better than the microphones in this House."
"This is one of those questions on which we all feel practically the same, not only in this House but also amongst those many Members who, as result of our own origins, view with great sympathy the processes of cooperation and consolidation of the institutions in countries which we consider to be our own."
"I agree with the words of the honourable Member from the Canary Islands Coalition insofar as we show our support for Parlacen because of its importance in terms of the consolidation of democratic structures and, therefore, we, as the European Parliament, must stand united with an institution such as that."
"I do not share the reservations expressed by our honourable Member, the Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of Central America and Mexico, Mr Seguro, with regard to the issue of human rights."
"You can change the language if you like, but not the intention."
"I believe that on these issues we have to continue to preach at home what we want to happen throughout the world, without averting our eyes when human rights are trampled underfoot in other parts of the world."
"With regard to the last part of Mr Salafranca' s intervention, I would also like to express my desire that the budgetary allocations should be at least sufficient for the work, which we consider to be important and which must be carried out in cooperation with Parlacen to be completed."
"In any event, I would like to express my conviction that we must ensure that actions take over from words."
"In relation to cooperation with Latin America, actions are the most effective possible yardstick, from our - that is, Spain' s - point of view."
"Mr President, the Commission takes note of the proposals for resolutions tabled by Parliament on respect for human rights in Central America, the process of democratisation and regional integration, and on the special importance which you attach to the role of the Central American Parliament."
"The Commission follows the situation in the region with great interest and our priority objectives in our relations with the region focus on the three points which you have highlighted: respect for human rights, the consolidation of the democratic process and the strengthening of regional integration."
"In this context, the Commission is taking action and we have specific projects for each of those three areas."
"With regard to human rights, we have, since 1990, been supporting the cooperation programmes in favour of respect for human rights by means of education and raising awareness in this area."
"You are well aware that between 1990 and 2000 EUR 65 million has been spent on this activity, which we continue to support with a view to the future."
"For the next multiannual programme, which will begin soon, we are considering an additional contribution of more than EUR 10 million in order to continue this activity."
"In relation to Parlacen, I must point out that since its creation it has been treated as a privileged partner by the Commission for the programmes for strengthening the process of democratisation and regional integration."
"Within our framework of cooperation with the area, we have paid special attention to all those institutions which support regional integration, the general secretariat of the Central American Integration System, the Court of Justice and especially Parlacen, which is one of our priority objectives."
"In particular, the Commission is currently studying the framework of that new strategy which Mr Salafranca referred to; let us hope that we can soon reach a conclusion that will allow us to release funds to support the Central American Parliament."
"Finally, in the dialogue with the Central American authorities, the Commission is also reiterating the importance which must be attached to the process of regional integration as an instrument to consolidate democratisation and development in the region."
"On this issue, we are also working on the definition of a new cooperation programme which should allow us to concentrate on these three fundamental elements: economic integration - the implementation of common policies - the strengthening of the institutions and the strengthening of civil society."
"These points seem to us to be essential and should be the key elements of our multiannual programme between 2000 and 2006."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 5.30 p.m."
"Côte d'Ivoire"
"Mr President, for a long time Côte d'Ivoire stood out as a pillar of stability and relative prosperity in the tormented life of West Africa."
"That is why we were so disturbed and sad to see the slow political, economic and human ruination of this country, orchestrated by the military junta of General Gueï."
"In order to hold on to power, General Gueï hijacked the constitution adopted by the people of Côte d'Ivoire for his sole benefit and used it as a means of excluding his political opponents."
"In order to hold on to power, he did not hesitate to exploit the bitter debate on Ivoirian nationality, sparking an explosion of xenophobia: hatred of others, of foreigners, whether from Burkina Faso or Mali, even though so many of them have lived and worked in the country for many years."
"In this way he has brought Côte d'Ivoire to the brink of civil and ethnic war."
"But the Ivoirian people did not allow the junta to play their murderous game to the bitter end: they forced the tyrant to flee and, by electing a long-standing opponent, Laurent Gbagbo, to rule the country, they brought Côte d'Ivoire back onto the track of democracy."
"Now this process needs to be confirmed rapidly by the organisation of free, transparent and pluralist legislative elections in which all the political forces can take part."
"At least, that is what both the political leaders and the people are calling for today."
"The political forces of Côte d' Ivoire have already shown their sense of responsibility by playing the card of appeasement, of constitutional legality and of national reconciliation for some weeks past."
"We must take note of this return to a democratic process that may indeed be incomplete, but that we must continue to support."
"I believe that will also contribute to the stability of the entire region, for West Africa is going through a highly vulnerable period from that point of view."
"The European Union must therefore accompany Côte d'Ivoire along the road it has itself chosen: the road towards a return to constitutional legality, to civil peace, to economic and social progress, while giving material and financial support to the organisation of the legislative elections scheduled for 10 December this year and, of course, ensuring that they are fair and pluralist."
"It must also continue to cooperate with Côte d'Ivoire, so as to help it find the most appropriate solutions to the social crisis in urban areas and to tensions related to land in rural areas."
"That is precisely the point of our resolution."
"The extreme confusion that has characterised the electoral process over recent weeks in Côte d'Ivoire, which had looked like a model economy until now, is symptomatic of a country in crisis, reflected by an economy in crisis, social despair and, consequently, political chaos."
"The real issues and national debates were overshadowed by the spurious yet contentious debate about Ivoirian nationality."
"Côte d'Ivoire was driven into this widespread catastrophe because it was caught in the stranglehold of its financial commitment to lend credibility to its economic prospects and the cruel and indiscriminate fallout from international trade negotiations."
"That really is the antithesis of the model of true sustainable development, the policy for the future that we Greens advocate."
"The West bears a patent and overwhelming responsibility for the current collapse of the Ivoirian system."
"By introducing oils and fats other than cocoa butter into the ingredients of chocolate, the European Parliament has brought about the ruin of this top international cocoa producer's entire national industry."
"It knocked its social and political system off balance and has even led to the mass graves of Ivoirian civilians, the ultimate but also the direct victims of this chain of decisions and consequences starting in Brussels and ending in Ypougon."
"The Greens firmly condemn all the acts of violence committed following the elections and lament the victims."
"Real democracy cannot now be established in Côte d'Ivoire unless an independent commission of inquiry is set up to look into the crimes committed and unless an official undertaking is given on respect for human rights and civil peace."
"Similarly, this democratic process can only become more credible if a national reconciliation committee is created, together with a national electoral committee to prepare and guarantee future elections, especially the elections of 10 December."
"It is vital to have foreign observers at these elections to make sure they are conducted legally."
"Mr President, has peace really returned to Côte d' Ivoire or does it only seem that way?"
"Gbagbo has provisionally been recognised as president on the basis of elections from which his most important opponent was excluded."
"If the parliamentary elections in December do not proceed in a fair manner then the unrest will undoubtedly flare up again."
"After all, the violence of recent times has left the people with deep scars."
"If there is even the slightest political lapse their anger will take hold again."
"It is therefore absolutely essential that the parliamentary elections due to take place in December, proceed fairly, and needless to say, exclusion for reasons of ethnicity is absolutely out of the question."
"Côte d' Ivoire will only be able to regain its stability if the new rulers are prepared to engage in power-sharing."
"It is also impossible to envisage lasting peace in the country without religious and ethnic tolerance."
"The political, military and religious leaders must pull out all the stops to make national reconciliation possible."
"What is needed is a constitution which guarantees the rights of the citizens and the political parties and rules out abuse of power."
"It is also vital for relations with the neighbouring countries, especially Burkina Faso, to be restored."
"We as a European Union, must be prepared to continue to provide assistance, but this will only be possible if the country is run properly and democratisation really takes shape."
"The leaders have now been given a new chance and let us hope they seize it."
"Côte d' Ivoire could become a role model and take the lead in the region."
"But this will only be feasible if everyone takes responsibility and peace is restored for good."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe the first question that arises in Côte d' Ivoire is that of democracy."
"Some people believe democracy is only of relative importance when it comes to Africa, that democratic procedures are a complex matter, that we have to give it time, but I personally believe that there can be no compromise with democracy and the question that arises for Côte d' Ivoire today is the same one that arises for Guinea, for example, where we now know that there are people in prison and that the system is not democratic."
"For almost a year now, a few of us in this House, in particular most of my colleagues, have been alerted to the situation in Côte d' Ivoire, which I really believe offers a perfect example of how not to do things."
"Firstly, a regime was allowed to take over by force, by armed force."
"Nothing was said about the persecution of opponents and journalists, or about the establishment of a racist constitution based on ethnic discrimination."
"Everybody just let it happen, as though they had not learned any lessons from Rwanda or former Yugoslavia. And now they are surprised to see General Gueï end up rigging the elections."
"First of all, I believe the European Union should welcome the fact that the new president, Laurent Gbagbo, is setting up a national reconciliation committee."
"We must also welcome the organisation of legislative elections next month, but we must insist that these elections are transparent and do not exclude any political force or any candidate."
"Equality between the political movements must be guaranteed."
"And indeed that is why President Gbagbo must not dismiss the possibility of holding presidential elections, as the direct follow-up to these legislative elections."
"But above all, we must, in my view, insist much more firmly on this racist constitution being declared null and void."
"The debate on nationality Ivoirian - that confused debate that tends solely towards introducing discrimination in favour of a country' s own nationality, something we are combating in our own countries, and whose logical conclusion is the practice of ethnic cleansing - must be used to totally oppose any reference or connotation to Ivoirian nationality and to have these removed from the Ivoirian constitution."
"I do not agree with all Mr Ouattara' s view - you need only see where I am sitting on this side of the Chamber - especially in the liberal and economic field, but I do believe that it is not acceptable, in any country whatsoever, and particularly in Côte d' Ivoire, to exclude Mr Ouattara solely because he does not have a mother and a father of Ivoirian origin."
"In the same way, I believe that the 14 parties that have been excluded must be reintegrated and play a full part in these elections."
"Otherwise it would mean that when someone like Mr Ouattara is excluded, second-class citizenship is de facto being introduced, and there would be two kinds of citizens and discrimination would eventually become established as a state system."
"The European Union must also make sure that none of its members establishes relations with its former colonies - and let me emphasise this - that are based solely on economic interests or geostrategic location."
"It was on the basis of such considerations that Hubert Védrine, the head of the French diplomatic service, actually went so far as to explain that from a certain point of view these elections were legal because they were founded on a constitution."
"If we take that line, let me say that we should in fact have accepted apartheid, given that it was entirely constitutional. Excuse me if I go even further and say that we should consequently have established better relations with Milosevic in former Yugoslavia."
"Let me finish by saying this: dictatorships come into being only because there are people who are destitute and who have no access to learning, no access to knowledge."
"So from that point of view I believe that it is essential that we urgently target our aid for those countries, in order to help them move towards a democratic system, at combating illiteracy, poverty and destitution."
"It is at that price and by giving assistance to these people that we will finally help them to set up a democratic system."
"Mr President, it is tempting to present the recent political events in Côte d' Ivoire as the victory of democracy over dictatorship, as a repeat performance of the Belgrade scenario, but this time taking place in the heart of West Africa."
"It is tempting, but it would be wrong, because the reality is rather more complex and the position of the new president is quite a lot more controversial."
"Naturally we welcome the fact that junta leader Gueï failed in his scheme to legitimise his power through sham elections."
"The European Union, and also this Parliament, made an important contribution to this by demanding that democratic elections take place and instituting the suspension procedure."
"But that still does not give Laurence Gbagdo, who won the elections, the legitimacy he needs."
"After all, he drew the nationalist card too."
"He also supported the amendment to the constitution, with the intention of cutting out his most significant opponent, Watara, on the grounds that one of his parents is not an Ivoirian national."
"This law led to the serious disruption of traditional ethnic harmony in Côte d' Ivoire."
"Since it came into force, people of foreign extraction, and in fact we are talking in terms of a third to half of the population, have been the object of discrimination and even of attacks."
"Another consequence of the law was that Watara' s supporters, particularly Muslims from the north of the country, managed to successfully boycott the elections, which meant that the turnout was no higher than 40%, i.e. too low to give the new president a credible mandate."
"When Watara' s supporters took to the streets in order to demand new elections their protest was put down using violent means."
"Muslim quarters in the city were attacked."
"At least 170 people died and 350 were wounded."
"Fearing a civil war, Watara reconciled himself to the result."
"It would not be illogical for the European Union to immediately demand new presidential elections, in which all candidates would be able to participate this time round."
"But I recognise that there are a number of reasons for not doing so."
"Firstly, it would undermine the new president' s attempts to restore national unity and reconciliation."
"After all, against this background, he offered his opponents various ministerial posts and declared 9 November a national day of mourning."
"Conversely, all the parties have now declared themselves willing to help to restore the constitutional state and peace."
"As some delegates have already said, this must inevitably lead to the parliamentary elections on 10 December, which all parties must be able to take part in."
"I do not believe it is for Europe to add fuel to the fire and stir up tensions even more when those concerned are evidently willing to engage in reconciliation."
"But the real test for Gbagdo will be on 10 December."
"All we can do is ensure that these are free and peaceful elections, and hope that the new Ivoirian government has a broad democratic basis. This is what is needed to restore ethnic harmony and help this country out of its economic morass."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even if Côte d'Ivoire used to be a bastion of stability and democracy compared to other states in western and central Africa, for a long time now it has seen ethnic and religious tensions and, most recently, the abuse of power by the former government under President Bedié, which eventually led to the violent military coup."
"But the fact that this military regime was recently ousted in the elections, under difficult circumstances, says something about the democratic resolve of the people of Côte d'Ivoire."
"I believe there is now a chance to restore democracy and the rule of law."
"Here I wish the current president a good hand and a very delicate touch."
"The unrest surrounding the elections produced a death toll of about 200, which of course places a heavy burden on the future of the new regime."
"But we must also say that the day of reconciliation on 9 November will send out new signals in regard to establishing democracy and the rule of law and taking seriously the demand for national reconciliation."
"The European Union has been asked, and has declared itself prepared, to help ensure that the elections in December, as well as the local elections in January, are conducted in a peaceful, fair, free and transparent manner."
"Here, too, we must keep a watchful eye and take a constructive approach to this process."
"Much will depend on whether it really proves possible to consolidate these first cautious steps."
"Of course that also means amending the constitution so that ethnic origin can no longer be taken as grounds for discrimination."
"Very many parts of Africa comprise very many different ethnic and religious mixtures."
"To draw such narrow boundaries between them can only produce problems and difficulties."
"We know that millions of people living in Côte d'Ivoire come from one of its neighbouring countries."
"I will not even broach problems such as child labour - for there also there are problems."
"A peaceful environment needs to be created for these people as well, and they, too, must be given some political responsibility in the country and must not be excluded."
"In that regard, I believe that the resolution reflects Parliament's resolve to make its contribution and I hope we will also manage to succeed in doing so."
"Mr President, obviously it would be better if the European Parliament condemned Robert Gueï' s dictatorial manoeuvres, the transformation of the presidential elections into a farce by eliminating most of the candidates, and the ethnic violence triggered by all this."
"But, as usual, the European countries in general and France in particular are disclaiming all responsibility for what is happening."
"Why did the French authorities never fail to support Konan Bédié through the years, after he launched his xenophobic campaign against the large minority group of Burkinabe origin that makes up one third of the population of Côte d' Ivoire?"
"Why did the French Government support the election rigging by Gueï, which the European Parliament resolution is set to condemn after the event?"
"Why do the French Government, and the resolution itself, conceal the role of Gbagbo, the current president, in fomenting xenophobia?"
"The non-intervention policy which the French Government put forward to justify its guilty silence is merely a fig leaf to hide its sordid material interests."
"For decades France supported the dictatorship of Houphouet-Boigny and his one-party regime in order to protect the enormous interests of French capitalist groups that are established in Côte d' Ivoire and dominate its economy."
"For the same reason, it is tolerating all the villainies of its protégés who run the Ivoirian State, provided they protect French interests in return."
"From Bédié to Gbagbo, not forgetting Gueï and Ouattara, all those who are vying for power in Côte d' Ivoire bear some responsibility for the rise in xenophobia and the worsening ethnic conflicts there. But the leaders of the French State also share this responsibility."
"We condemn the ethnic violence and in particular the political leaders who fomented it with their demagogic rhetoric."
"We condemn the army and the police, many of whose members took part in the assassinations."
"Conversely, we refuse to associate ourselves with the representatives of political parties who were or are involved in France' s Africa policy."
"We declare our solidarity with the working people of all origins in Côte d' Ivoire who not only are being kept destitute but whom their leaders are trying to set one against the other."
"Mr President, by means of various recent declarations, the European Union has condemned the abuses of General Gueï' s regime; it has also expressed its regret at the outright exclusion of the main opposition candidates from the election of 22 October, which has to a large extent limited the credibility of that very electoral process."
"The Union has condemned General Gueï' s attempt to confiscate the election results and subsequently the army' s violent repression of the demonstrations in favour of Laurent Gbagbo and, above all, the bloody inter-ethnic massacres which have been perpetrated on the native people of the north of Côte d' Ivoire."
"The Commission believes that in the current circumstances the priority should be for the legislative elections that are scheduled to be held on 10 December to be open and transparent."
"I would like to stress these two adjectives."
"These elections must enable the political parties that were excluded from the presidential election to be represented at national level and thereby compensate, though only partially, for the defects of that first election."
"These elections should make up one of the key elements of the national reconciliation that we all wish to see and are calling for."
"The European Community will provide financial support for these elections to be held, and we will also cooperate by providing some one hundred observers."
"Once these elections have taken place and depending on the way they are carried out, we will be able to consider holding in-depth discussions with the new Ivoirian authorities in order to determine the conditions in which we can re-establish our cooperation."
"This clearly does not exclude the consideration of emergency situations, such as providing aid for the injured and victims of the recent inter-ethnic confrontations, and ECHO has allocated EUR 300 000 in emergency aid for this purpose."
"The Commission recognises other priorities with regard to emergencies, which are closely related to issues such as health or education, especially in rural areas, and this is fundamental to this process being carried out in an open and democratic manner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 5.30 p.m."
"Human rights"
"Mr President, I am very glad that there has been such strong support across the House for the powerful statement we have in this resolution condemning the military junta in Burma."
"But, at the same time, I am extremely sad that we must have yet another resolution on Burma because the situation there, far from getting better, is actually getting much worse."
"The need for this further resolution stems from a number of reasons."
"Among the most important is the fact that the SPDC has vowed to crush the National League for Democracy by the end of this year."
"The signs are that they are serious."
"Their attempt to evict the NLD from their current location looks like a systematic campaign to achieve that."
"The number of political prisoners appears to have risen from 1,500 to 3,000 very recently, many of whom are forced to carry out hard labour and are subject to cruel forms of torture."
"The forthcoming EU/ASEAN meeting in Laos in December offers us a crucial opportunity to demonstrate our condemnation of this regime in the strongest terms."
"We are calling for the Council and the Commission to postpone that meeting, to call it off, until the Burmese junta releases all political prisoners without conditions and allows freedom of movement for Aung San Suu Kyi and her party members and until the Burmese junta enters into a meaningful dialogue with the election-winning NLD and the ethnic minorities."
"Aung San Suu Kyi herself has said that the constructive engagement approach by ASEAN in relation to Rangoon is not working."
"The opportunity to call off and to postpone this meeting that is due next month in Laos offers us the opportunity to make the statement in the strongest terms, to send the strongest possible signal that we condemn this illegal regime."
"Mr President, in an answer to me on Burma in the October session Commissioner Patten said that if things deteriorate in Burma, then holding the EU-ASEAN meeting planned for 11 and 12 December would be reconsidered."
"How bad do things have to get?"
"Aung San Suu Kyi is held incommunicado."
"There are 3,000 political prisoners, 23% of the population live below the poverty line and 40% of the children in Burma are malnourished."
"Burma is now the world's second largest producer of heroin and opium after Afghanistan."
"They are conducting a major offensive against the Shan people and the Karen people and, as the UN rapporteur has said, there is no sign of any dialogue between the SDPC and the NLD."
"Today in Geneva the ILO are meeting as we speak and it looks very likely that they are going to support sanctions against Burma in protest about the use of forced labour."
"It is my understanding that the French representative in Geneva has supported that view."
"Now is the time to actually impose strict conditions on that meeting in December."
"Aung San Suu Kyi must be released and allowed to travel freely and a troika must be allowed to go to Burma and to go anywhere and meet anyone they like."
"Also today, Thailand, an ASEAN member, has said that Burma must allow a permanent ILO presence in that country, that there must be a mechanism to monitor forced labour and that ILO sanctions should not be lifted on their fellow ASEAN member until real results have been achieved."
"How will the EU respond to these strong voices from across Europe and indeed from the region for the first time?"
"It is surely indefensible for the Commission and the Council to continue with any idea of holding this meeting."
"It will clearly be interpreted as a softening of Europe's approach at this time."
"Aung San Suu Kyi has reiterated recently that constructive engagement with Rangoon is not working and she and the NLD have asked for the meeting to be postponed."
"If the EU goes ahead, the junta would be encouraged and heartened by the decision to sit our foreign ministers from democratic European governments around a table which includes the military junta of Burma."
"We should be ashamed of such treachery."
"ASEAN would also continue to feel that it is not necessary to do anything about the pariah in their midst."
"Do we intend to collude with this or will we make a decision now to pull out?"
"By standing by our own principles and the values that we cherish, we will also be cherishing the values of the people of Burma who are being so systematically persecuted by the military regime in their country."
"Mr President, there are several reasons as to why we are once again discussing Burma - in fact this is the second time since the summer - and nor is this the first time this year that this country has been on the agenda."
"There are several reasons for this."
"Not long ago, Aung San Suukyi was again denied permission to leave Rangoon and talk to the supporters of her party, the NLD, a party which won the elections by such a large majority and has never been allowed to wield power."
"It is true that James Mawdsley, the activist we talked about two months ago, has been released since then."
"We might think that this is a small ray of hope, but that must not divert us from the major issues, from the big picture that we get in Burma."
"At the end of the day, the fact remains that the UN rapporteur for human rights returned from Burma with a negative account."
"The human rights activist Soe Thein has been treated in a lamentable manner."
"So there is every reason to talk about Burma again, and unfortunately there is no hope of it being the last time."
"Of course, slavery in Burma is talked about at length within the IAO."
"This is a subject that has not been given very much attention here to date, but, naturally, it must be discussed within the context of the European Union."
"The political repression continues and the flood of refugees, mainly headed for Thailand, continues - and for that matter, Thailand is putting troops into action."
"This is unacceptable in every sense by international standards."
"The military regime in Burma claims to be able to maintain order and stability in a country where ethnic rivalries are never far away."
"But the repression perpetrated by the regime only strengthens the rebellious feelings that can arise there and does not in any way, shape or form, lead to a resolution of potential ethnic conflicts."
"The problem of course, is what should we, as the European Union, do now?"
"Our answer is to suggest that we keep the sanctions in place."
"I really do not think we have any alternative."
"The sad thing is that sanctions have proved ineffective so far."
"But ASEAN' s constructive contribution has fared no better, and I also have the feeling that increasingly, the other ASEAN countries, i.e. Burma' s neighbours, are beginning to feel ashamed of their decision to allow Burma to join ASEAN."
"Their philosophy of taking a constructive approach has failed and I feel that we, as the European Union, ought not to let them forget it."
"Round table talks with Burma do not work."
"In any case, I would not trust our own ministers to raise the matter there."
"They did not say a word about human rights at the ASEAN meeting in October, and I am not confident that they would do so now."
"That is why we are going to keep the sanctions strategy in place for the time being."
"We readily support the amendments that Mrs Kinnock tabled on that aspect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, when Thursdays arrive and we deal with the situation of human rights in the world, I am put in mind, to some extent, of what the Wailing Wall must be like."
"Its sad inheritance of colonialism and neo-colonialism obliges the European Union to take a firm, very brave and decisive stance, in order to aid the re-establishment of democracy in various parts of the world, such as Latin America, which currently faces the problem of Guatemala with its fight against the impunity of military figures, Africa or, in this case, Burma."
"As has been said, the truth is that the situation in Burma is getting worse; it is incredible that there is still this persecution of such an important leader of democracy as Aung San Suu Kyi and that the Democratic League cannot operate normally in its work for the re-establishment of democracy, especially when there is still economic investment in that country which is taking advantage precisely of that lack of freedom, that lack of union rights there."
"We therefore believe that the European Union is obliged to take strong action at international level so that, both through sanctions and through imposing a negotiation with leaders of the democratic opposition, democracy and the normal development of the right to freedom of the people of Burma may be restored and so that we can stop talking about situations which remind us with such sadness of the facts of the past."
"We therefore reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of Mrs Maij-Weggen in this resolution, and we have had some excellent speeches this afternoon."
"As we sit here in our climate-controlled comfort, the democratically elected parliamentarians of Burma are under house arrest, in hiding and under the gravest possible threat."
"Meanwhile the communist junta maintains its iron grip on the people, press and the National League for Democracy."
"Members of that junta have boasted about how they will exterminate the NLD before the end of this year, and for years made the same boast about the minorities."
"Twice since last September we have passed resolutions deploring the administration in Burma and despite our clear and heartfelt views on this matter, we know that the EU countries will be sending foreign ministers to meet their ASEAN counterparts in Laos next month."
"We must say loudly and clearly that we believe that it is absolutely wrong for them to do so, as is planned."
"We, in Europe, must not give them that spurious legitimacy and we heard some excellent speeches from Mrs Lucas and Mrs Kinnock on that point."
"We all know the story of Aung San Suu Kyi and we must be aware that constructive engagement between ASEAN and Rangoon has not worked."
"Therefore we must call upon our governments not to do the opposite of what the Nobel and Sakharov Prize winner has asked."
"Yesterday Mr James Mawdsley, who was released from Burma, sent me a message which I want to read out to you."
"His words are far more eloquent than my own when confronting the evil of the Burmese regime."
"He says: ""the military junta in Burma is terrified of the NLD."
"They are afraid of anyone who refuses to bow to their brutality."
"It is abundantly clear to them that the world and NLD led by Dr Aung San Suu Kyi will not now bow."
"Therefore the regime feels it must utterly destroy them."
"Military intelligence officers have boasted to me that the NLD is to be crushed."
"It is to be destroyed."
"They laughed when they said it."
"This is not sane behaviour. They sit and laugh about the murder and repression of Burma's elected representatives."
"The regime also boasts that they will kill all Karen and they are committing genocide among the Karen, Karenni and Shan ethnic groups of Burma."
"I have walked through this territory: from the top of the mountains as far as the eye can see, all villages have been destroyed and the populations murdered or displaced."
"I have seen victims of repression, women and men wounded, dying and dead."
"The regime's hatred of the ethnic groups and for the NLD cannot be checked by appeals to reason or morality."
"The regime responds only when it feels threatened."
"My release demonstrates that.""."
"It demonstrates that the regime will only do something when it feels threatened."
"These are the words of James Mawdsley, not mine."
"He suffered mightily at the hands of the Burmese and he says that only when they are threatened will they do something."
"We have to recognise that in relation to the ASEAN meeting."
"Mr President, for many years I have had a poster on the wall of my office of Aung San Suu Kyi when she was awarded the Sakharov Prize by this Parliament."
"The poster has got ragged and shabby and curling at the edges."
"I kept it there in the hope that I would be able to replace it with a happier and more triumphant poster."
"But, as has been said by many of the excellent speeches this afternoon, there remains still nothing but despair about this wonderful, gentle, charming and immensely brave woman and her attempts to keep the flag of freedom flying in her own country."
"Her country has become an international pariah state."
"ASEAN has become, in every sense of the word, a paper tiger in its failure to deal with the awful events in Burma."
"An added failure on the part of the West has occurred with the departure of the UN's special rapporteur on human rights in Burma, Mr Rajsoomer Lallah."
"He left because he alleged that he was getting virtually no support from the Human Rights Bureau of the United Nations."
"I know myself what a source of anguish this is for the Commissioner, Mrs Mary Robinson."
"Mr Lallah has said: ""I see very little changing."
"Year after year the General Assembly and the Commission pass resolutions."
"I feel disappointed."""
"We feel disappointed."
"We feel that notwithstanding the many expressions of support and concern from this Parliament we have failed to succeed in making the military junta respond to the concerns of the outside world."
"I believe we should have sanctions."
"Mr Deva has given the views of my group, which I totally support, and it is significant this afternoon that there is not one single person who has spoken who is not at one with these ideas and with the general support for Aung San Suu Kyi and her party."
"She has had a special place in our hearts here in Parliament for many years."
"It is almost unbelievable that to this day she remains a prisoner in her own home and has suffered as she has done over the years."
"I know that it is of some small comfort that we continue to bang on the door of this evil and vicious regime and I hope very much that the suggestions that have been made by both Mr Deva and Mrs Kinnock will be recognised by the Commission and respected."
"I, too, reluctantly welcome the opportunity to debate our concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation in Burma and, like many before me, I would have preferred that the situation there had improved so that we did not have to keep returning to this issue over and over again."
"I hope that, by prioritising this issue as an urgency, this Parliament is giving a clear message to the Burmese people that their plight is not forgotten and that we recognise that the situation in Burma is worsening rather than improving and are determined to try and do something about it."
"However, I do believe that the international community needs to move on from rhetoric to real action and, as a member of Parliament's Delegation for relations with the Member States of ASEAN, South-east Asia and the Republic of Korea, I am disappointed and concerned like others before me that the EU has decided to enter into dialogue with ASEAN in Laos next month at ministerial level."
"I know the arguments that the ASEAN Member States have put to our delegation about including Burma in this group."
"They believe that, by entering into dialogue with Burma, somehow or other they can influence it to change its oppressive practices because it will see the clear economic and political benefits of improving its human rights record."
"Burma has been a Member of ASEAN for a number of years and there is absolutely no evidence to date that shows any improvement or an end to forced labour or executions or suppression of free speech and free movement."
"The list of human rights violations by this regime continues to get longer and longer each year."
"Engaging with them is a ridiculously naive concept so long as there is not even a glimmer of liberalisation in their attitude."
"What this dialogue is achieving is legitimising the Burmese junta's continued brutal regime."
"As I said earlier, what we want is action and not words."
"If we are really serious about improving and having an impact on the lives of Burmese people we need to do some of the following."
"Like others have said before me: we should postpone the meeting in Laos next month; and the Burmese junta should lift all restrictions on democratically elected political members and the leaders of NLD."
"The junta should also enter into dialogue with the NLD and the ethnic nationalities."
"Finally, we should consider supporting ILO economic sanctions to prevent Burma from taking advantage of European trade, investments and tourism until they stop the system of forced labour."
"We have a moral responsibility, as a community of values, to ensure that the citizens of Burma can enjoy the same fundamental rights as those enjoyed by citizens of Europe."
"Mr President, the human rights situation in Burma continues to deteriorate under the not-so-gentle control of the military junta."
"The plight of Aung San Suu Kyi continues to worsen."
"She has not been allowed to travel since she was placed under house arrest on 21 September when she attempted to travel to Mandalay."
"She apparently has no access to a telephone and no visitors."
"There are even rumours that she has been handcuffed in her own house."
"The plight of the rest of the members of the National League for Democracy is hardly any better."
"Large numbers are under arrest or are being harassed, and attempts have been made to close down their offices in Burma."
"The junta has said that it is their intention to try and smash the party as a whole."
"But it not just Aung San Suu Kyi, it is not just the military, it is not just the NLD - there are almost 3 000 political prisoners who are suffering from hard labour and torture."
"There are forced relocations of populations of ethnic minorities and there is forced labour."
"The ILO has been in and tried to look at the situation and see if constructive engagement led to any improvement."
"As we know, the ILO is meeting today."
"It is likely to recommend sanctions because there has been no improvement."
"I am beginning to get thoroughly fed up with making this speech - I have made it on three or four occasions now to the Council and the Commission - but the situation is worsening, so what are you going to do?"
"Council and Commission, it is now finally time to act."
"You must recognise that we are making no progress whatsoever with the current approach."
"Please look at imposing sanctions."
"Make it absolutely clear that we are not going to attend the meeting in Laos in the presence of the Burmese military junta because that will be intolerable and the message will be that they can get away with it."
"Vietnam"
"Mr President, I am delighted that Vietnam is on the agenda at last."
"It has taken a long time."
"I feel that special praise must go to Mr Dupuis for his assiduousness in this respect, because otherwise we might have had to wait even longer."
"What do we see in Vietnam?"
"We see a country whose people are becoming more liberal whilst the powers that be are old men who cling for dear life to old ways."
"It is so tragic, because Vietnam is a country with so much potential."
"It has a dynamic, healthy and well-educated population."
"It has natural resources such as oil, fish, coffee, rice and timber."
"You feel like telling those old men to open the door and success will flood in."
"Instead, we see a complete lack of press freedom and ongoing political oppression."
"Just look at how the dissident Ha Is Phu was treated."
"I am fully aware that the Vietnam debate is historically charged."
"We must be careful what we say about Vietnam, or at least that has been customary hitherto."
"After all, the West has had a certain level of involvement in the country."
"It is historically charged and naturally it is an awkward situation."
"When it comes to human rights, we cannot say whether the glass is half full or half empty."
"The glass is not full in Vietnam."
"That is what it is all about."
"We work with Vietnam; it is our partner, and so we cannot afford to keep our lips sealed about the situation there."
"Mr President, one might ask why the European Parliament is so deeply concerned with Vietnam."
"Some might say: surely Vietnam is a very long way away from the European Union."
"But I can tell you that Germany and Bavaria, for example, see Vietnam as very close."
"If you travel from the Bavarian border country to the neighbouring Czech Republic, you will see many Vietnamese markets, meet many Vietnamese who are playing a very active part in that border region."
"If you travel to the eastern part of the reunited Germany, you will find Vietnamese who made their home there in what used to be the Communist bloc. And in the western part, you will find Vietnamese who fled that same Communism and came to Germany as asylum seekers and refugees."
"That shows how closely our destinies have been intertwined in this Eurasian continent for many years."
"That also becomes very clear when you look at the parallels in the history of Europe and Germany and also of Vietnam."
"Germany and Europe were divided."
"Ten years ago they were reunited, in the name of freedom."
"Vietnam suffered terrible wars and was torn apart by the interests of the great powers."
"One day Vietnam too was reunited, not peacefully however, but by the force of arms, and it was reunited under a Communist system, a dictatorship."
"We now have a situation in Vietnam in which economic reforms are certainly being carried out."
"Many people believed that this would automatically also lead to political reforms."
"But we can see quite clearly in many states of Asia, including Burma which we just discussed - it is a parallel case - that economic reforms, trade and cooperation, however welcome, do not automatically bring more freedom or constitutional legality."
"There is a particular risk in Asia of dissociating economic and political reforms, of economic progress and economic liberalisation without political liberalisation or greater constitutional legality. I believe that without a constitutional state that is functioning properly, in the long-term Asia will lose out on trade, subsidies and investments."
"That is why the economy also needs the framework of constitutional legality."
"This explains why it is so important that we call clearly for the rule of law, for the so-called retraining camps to be dismantled, and above all for freedom of religion."
"In Vietnam this year, part of the land of a Catholic monastery was confiscated, small groups of Protestants were harassed, missions were closed and missionaries locked up. The Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, with its wealth of tradition, was brutally persecuted, although it had played such a major part in the national rebirth of Vietnam."
"That is why it is our duty to stand up for these political prisoners and, regardless of any justified economic interests, to call clearly for democracy and the rule of law. Instead of turning a blind eye to violations of human rights we must say, as the largest economic power in the world, that we want to and will cooperate with Vietnam, but only provided that it adheres ever more to democracy and the rule of law and finally initiates the overdue process of political reform."
"Freedom of religion, freedom of conscience and freedom of the media are the crucial yardstick by which we will measure it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think Mr Maaten has put his finger on an important point: Vietnam has all the factors needed to become rich and yet today it is one of the poorest countries in the world."
"It could be an Asian dragon, like the others that were discovered in recent years; nonetheless, as I said, it is one of the poorest countries."
"Another problem - Mr Posselt put it better than I could - is that there is one thing lacking: over and above the question of human rights, there is a lack of democracy in Vietnam today."
"That is what prevents the country from taking off; it is what prevents it from effectively combating the corruption which blights it."
"So the European Union must begin to take a firm stance towards Vietnam and raise the issue of the rule of law and not just - I repeat - the issue of human rights, where there have been some signs of improvement."
"These slight improvements - which we certainly do not owe to the author of the Socialist Group amendments, Mr Sakellariou - have come about over the last few years and given rise to a situation that is certainly no longer tragic but that remains disastrous and in any case still is no match for the real issues of modern-day Vietnam."
"The Commission must therefore take resolute action to ensure that the question of democracy, the question of the rule of law, becomes the key to the European Union's relations with Vietnam."
"So I believe this is an important resolution."
"We adopted a resolution two years ago, the most recent one on Vietnam, and there, too, I do not remember - nor do I think Mr Posselt remembers - the Socialist Group giving any particular undertaking to support that resolution at the time."
"We adopted the resolution and we have had occasion to note that it brought about a few small improvements."
"I hope that after this resolution is adopted - without Mr Sakellariou's amendments - we will hear a firm undertaking from the Commission and a few practical responses from the Vietnamese authorities."
"Mr President, I agree in many important respects with the previous speakers, because much of what is happening in Vietnam today is unacceptable."
"I myself once travelled in this country and came to know its vitality, beauty and wealth of resources."
"That makes me all the sadder that it is not summoning up the courage to introduce greater freedom and power of initiative, that the government and the political leaders are preventing that."
"Nevertheless, in answer to Mr Dupuis, I regret in that respect that we could not agree on a joint resolution, that important and justified points that are also endorsed by the Human Rights Watch - not the most tolerant organisation when it comes to violations of human rights - were not accepted."
"If you are now more or less announcing that you will vote against these amendments, then unfortunately I must announce that we will probably abstain from the vote on this resolution."
"That is not because we are against its fundamental content, but because we believe that we should have found a common basis here."
"Mr President, with your permission I will misuse a little of my speaking time and draw attention to a case which could not be included in the list of urgencies because it only recently became known."
"In Iran, two individuals, Said Sadr and Khalil Rostamchani, have been threatened with the death penalty, or at least the public prosecutor has applied for it, in a case relating to an event held by the Heinrich Böll Foundation in Berlin after the elections."
"I would ask you to draw the attention of the President of this House to this very precarious situation."
"I am not necessarily calling for intervention, but we should follow this case very closely and then, if it seems necessary, also make it clear that we are against the death penalty under all circumstances, but especially for what are no more than 'ideological' crimes."
"I would just ask you to approach this matter with delicacy, and I hope you will pardon me this misuse of my speaking time on the question of Vietnam."
"Mr Swoboda, the European Parliament is flexible and efficient."
"We have taken immediate note of what you said."
"When it comes to saving lives, there are no bureaucratic obstacles."
"We will ask you to supply us with the relevant facts and then we will, of course, react."
"Mr President, like many others in my generation, when I walked through the streets in my home town 25, 30, 35 years ago and called out, ""USA out of Vietnam!"", I would never have thought that a quarter of a century later I would be forced to stand here in this House and criticise Free Vietnam partly for the same type of violation of human rights that we criticised the USA for then."
"Unfortunately, it is not the case that countries that have themselves been subject to violence, oppression, torture, mutilation and mass murder automatically become angels who cannot perform such acts themselves."
"Israel is probably one of the most obvious examples in world history of the fact that it is not so simple."
"Every nation must learn over and over again what democracy and human rights are."
"Now, however, Human Rights Watch, as Mr Swoboda mentioned, is saying that Vietnam has recently taken steps to improve the situation regarding human rights."
"Tens of thousands of political prisoners have been released."
"I think that is it appropriate for such a thing to be mentioned in a resolution."
"We must be harsh in our criticism, but we must not ignore what is nevertheless being done."
"This only weakens the criticism, and those who are being criticised get the feeling that it is of no avail what they do - if they do not do everything at once, which is something they neither can nor want to do."
"Criticism can be counterproductive if it does not take into account what has actually been done."
"Vietnam deserves harsh criticism of the kind reflected in the motion for a resolution - there is no doubt about that - but I think that it is appropriate for us also to include a few sentences demonstrating that we are aware that certain improvements have been made."
"Mr President, it is gratifying that with President Clinton' s state visit to Vietnam, which began today, another major step has been taken towards reconciliation with the past."
"The war between these two countries has not led to lasting bitterness."
"It would be better still though, if the President were not just to concentrate on reinforcing mutual cooperation, when he visits Hanoi, but if he were to make this very cooperation conditional on the extraction of firm promises from Vietnam to drastically improve the prevailing lamentable human rights situation."
"For there is certainly a great deal amiss in Communist Vietnam."
"Contrary to Amendment No 1 tabled by the PSE Group, I noted in a document published on 10 November, that Human Rights Watch regards the human rights situation as being grave on quite a number of counts."
"Think of those imprisoned for political and religious reasons, some of whom are in re-education camps."
"Equally, consider how the special UN rapporteur' s recommendations regarding religious intolerance were ignored, and think of the lack of freedom of expression and the ongoing media censorship."
"In particular, I would now like to take a brief look at the grave persecution of Christians taking place at present."
"It is therefore right that these acts should be referred to in recital E and paragraph 5 of the joint resolution."
"The most recent edition of the Asian weekly 'Far East and Economic Review' today refers to the existence of top secret documents originating from Vietnam."
"These extremely secret documents give us a rare look behind the scenes of Vietnamese government policy."
"Closer examination of these official papers - I have read them myself - reveals that the Protestants are the main target of persecution."
"Hanoi has been particularly alarmed by the unexpectedly rapid growth of Protestant Christianity under the Hmong minority in the country' s mountainous north-western provinces, and this has prompted it to instigate cruel repressive measures."
"What is telling about this is the promotion of a district official whose fury has driven hundreds of Christians to take flight."
"This persecutor of churches has been asked by the powers that be to cleanse not just his own province, but also the entire district, of Christians."
"The documents that have come to light are nothing less than a smoking gun."
"They reveal that church closures, arrests and bible burnings are not isolated acts perpetrated by overzealous party officials."
"No, these outrages derive from the political directives issued by the Vietnamese Communist party."
"The lie has now been exposed."
"After all, the Vietnamese government claims to have introduced freedom of worship in recent years."
"President Clinton would do well to raise this matter during his present visit to Hanoi."
"I urge the Council and the Commission to protest in robust terms against this flagrant abuse of freedom of worship by the Vietnamese authorities."
"Mr President, I will try to speak about both issues."
"Firstly, with regard to Myanmar, my colleague Chris Patten has already condemned before this House the constant violations of human rights by the military regime in Burma: executions without trial, the widespread imposition of forced labour, the enforced uprooting of local populations, hundreds of political prisoners in the country' s prisons and the clear hindering of the free functioning of political parties."
"He also expressed his concern about the detention and harassment of Aung San Suu Kyi and the members of the National League for Democracy."
"We in the Commission fully share your concerns about this situation and we agree wholeheartedly with the numerous criticisms expressed here today of the way in which the military regime usually makes a mockery of each and every principle contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"The resolution recently adopted by the United Nations demonstrates that it is not only the European Union that harbours these concerns."
"However, the Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation can only be found by means of dialogue between the military regime, the democratically elected opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities."
"The General Affairs Council has tried to persuade the military regime of the value of this argument in favour of political dialogue and to exert pressure so that there might be changes and it will continue to do so."
"The Commission supports this initiative."
"Despite everything, we are convinced that we must not allow the situation prevailing in Myanmar to hijack the dialogue between the European Union and ASEAN."
"Three years have passed since we held a ministerial meeting with our ASEAN partners, which is far too long a time in our relations with a region that is important for the European Union from the political and economic points of view."
"That is why we believe the meeting should not be postponed."
"However, that does not mean that, either now or in December, we should behave as if the accession of Myanmar to ASEAN had not affected our relations, because it has."
"Our ASEAN partners know this very well and are concerned to repair this damage; on the other hand, they know that encouraging Burma to make a genuine effort and to put an end to its appalling behaviour in the field of human rights is the best way to revive relations between the Union and ASEAN."
"Given the importance that both they and we attach to these relations, we hope that our ASEAN partners will continue to communicate our concerns - which we believe the majority of them share - in relation to the military regime."
"I believe that the European Union-ASEAN ministerial meeting should be taken as a new opportunity to clearly and firmly express our opinions on the situation prevailing in Burma, both to the regime itself as well as to the members of ASEAN."
"We will therefore exert pressure on the military regime to put an end to the violations of human rights and begin a dialogue with the democratically elected opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities."
"With regard to the issue of Vietnam and the human rights situation, I would like to point out the following: we must remember that Vietnam is a country in transition, that its government initiated a process which led to the adoption in 1986 of a reform programme that embraced external relations and political and economic change."
"Since then, Vietnam has pursued an open-door external policy, and that is why that country occupies the place that it deserves within our international relations."
"Furthermore, the process has led to the signing of a cooperation agreement between the Commission and Vietnam in 1995."
"During this time, Vietnam has made advances towards a market economy, which has, in particular, led to its presentation of a request to join the World Trade Organisation."
"Furthermore - and I think this should be highlighted today - within the framework of the new constitution adopted in 1992, Vietnam has an elected national parliament, which has the duty of adopting legislation and to which the government must answer in relation to its policies."
"According to our information, the members of parliament rigorously fulfil their function of examining legislative proposals and supervising the initiatives and policies of the government."
"I believe it is important to acknowledge these advances and the context in which Vietnam continues to make progress."
"It is clear, therefore, that things have been achieved, but it is also clear, as you have pointed out, that there is still much more to be done."
"I fully share the concern about the problems raised by some Members: although it is true that almost 23 000 people have already been freed as a result of general amnesties, we must continue to show concern for those are still in prison for their political or religious beliefs."
"It is a source of satisfaction that there is no official censorship in the Vietnamese press, but it is also absolutely clear that there is occasional censorship in the foreign press."
"There is also clear pressure from the Vietnamese authorities for their own press to operate a system of self-censorship."
"Furthermore, although it is to be welcomed that there has recently been a reduction in crimes punishable by the death penalty, it is clearly the case that, in our view, the death penalty should be abolished completely."
"The circumstances surrounding the execution at the beginning of this year of a Vietnamese-Canadian citizen undoubtedly support our convictions in this regard."
"Along with the Member States, the Commission participates in all the initiatives adopted by the European Union directed at the Vietnamese Government in relation to human rights and I can assure you that, within this process, we will continue to raise specific problems and cases and to promote a steady improvement in the human rights situation in Vietnam."
"Mr President, may I briefly correct a mistake made by Mr Swoboda."
"In fact, there certainly were negotiations, and we agreed a joint motion for a resolution."
"Your group did not even bring up the three points you are addressing during the consultation procedure, otherwise we certainly would have found forms of wording on which we could perhaps have agreed."
"We fully agreed the text."
"Subsequently, you tabled amendments, which is entirely legitimate; it is just that we cannot accept the way they are worded because they seem to relativise the question."
"I just wanted to point that out in order to clarify the procedure; the content of the resolution will be decided by the vote."
"Mr Posselt, of course that was not a point of order but a substantive question."
"I now give the floor to Mr Swoboda - Mr Dupuis, perhaps you will agree not to speak - but I would ask him to be very brief."
"After all, we know what the issue is."
"Of course those are points that were contained in the motion for a resolution we tabled."
"In that respect, they are indeed based on negotiations, but the vote will show in what direction we are heading."
"Mr President, I just want to ask Commissioner Solbes Mira whether he can give a few details of this revolutionary development, namely the elections of a democratic parliament in Vietnam, to which he referred in his statement. I have to say it is not something that I or, I believe, my fellow Members are aware of."
"Commissioner, I would ask you to take note of that and to be kind enough to reply to Mr Dupuis in the appropriate form - either in writing or orally."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"Floods in Europe"
"Mr President, unlike many others who will be speaking this afternoon, I do not have many constituents who suffered horrendously from flooding in the UK."
"Luckily, London escaped with small-scale floods, partly from rivers we had forgotten still existed because we run them through culverts."
"We have, however, contributed to the causes of these floods of which those in Western Europe are only the latest result of a series of extreme and fluctuating weather conditions."
"This, of course, will be of small consolation to those living with filthy water running through their houses and who might be facing enormous financial loss."
"I agree that we need to do all that we can to assist them, but we would help most by changing the situation that has caused their misery and that of countless others throughout the world."
"Locally, we can stop covering flood plain and water meadows with concrete."
"We can change our pattern of agricultural production and we can use strategic environmental impact assessment to enable us to work with nature rather than assuming we can conquer it."
"In global terms, we know our use of fossil fuel is profligate and we have not taken sufficient steps to reduce the climate-change gases we produce."
"We have an opportunity to make progress at The Hague in the discussions there this week and next."
"We have to implement the agreements we have already reached, but we also have to do as the Treaty states and integrate the environmental perspective into all areas of Union policy and practice, and Member States must be prepared to do this as well."
"We have to move away from running our economies as if cheap fossil fuel is a good thing."
"We have to pay the full price for these fuels and we have to shift to a low-carbon economy."
"For once, I can agree with the words of the British Prime Minister on this and I now await his actions with eagerness."
"The EU has a wonderful opportunity to really take a lead in this change to an ecologically sustainable society where we will not have to deal with floods partly caused by our own inability to face up to the consequences of our own actions."
"Mr President, Europe suffered across the whole continent from the recent spate of flooding, whether it was in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Spain or France; hitting, amongst other regions in the United Kingdom, Wales and Yorkshire; in Ireland, Leinster and Munster; in Italy, Liguria and Lombardy."
"There was a destruction of homes, of energy, communication and transport networks."
"In my own region, the Southwest of England, we had all of these consequences."
"The main railway line between Cheltenham and Swindon remains closed."
"It will be closed for a month because of the damage caused by the floods."
"We came within an inch or so of the town of Tewkesbury being cut off."
"Two major roads were cut for a number of days: the A38 north of Gloucester and the A417 west of Gloucester."
"It is the worst flooding in the United Kingdom since 1947."
"In Devon, the River Taw had the highest level since records began."
"In Somerset, we had tidal flooding across the coastline. In Dorchester, the River Frome was so high that a major-incident plan was invoked to deal with the possible consequences."
"We still remain on stand-by at the moment."
"Tens of millions of pounds' worth of damage has been done and I agree with Mrs Lambert that we must take action to deal with our contribution towards the cause of the flooding in terms of our planning regulations, in terms of reforestation, in terms of all of the actions we have taken to make flooding that much more dangerous than in the past."
"We also require the EU to give help and assistance, not just in the southwest but across all of the areas that have been affected."
"The resolution calls on the Commission and the Member States to waste no time in expressing their support in practical ways by marshalling workers and equipment under the five-year plan establishing a Community action programme in the field of civil protection which was adopted on 9 December 1999."
"We also call on the Commission to make use of all existing funding: ERDF, EAGGF, Guarantee Section, which have already been assigned for use in dealing with disasters of this nature to provide financial aid to SMEs, to farmers, to households, the elderly and others affected, particularly those living in exposed areas who have limited protection as recompense and as assistance towards a speedy recovery."
"Mr President, I find myself on my feet again and this time on a matter which is of great concern and importance to the people of Europe as a whole and also relevant to the people of my own constituency of South East England and particularly in Sussex, Berkshire, Kent and the town of Maidenhead."
"I speak of the extraordinary series of floods across Europe."
"I am very well aware, from my work on the Committee on Development and Cooperation, of the recent floods in Mozambique, the Indian sub-continent, Bangladesh, the Mekong Delta and so on."
"If you look at the list of countries and regions in the resolution, you can see quite how serious this matter has become."
"There has been loss of life in more than one EU Member State."
"There has been enormous damage, running into billions of pounds, to small and medium-sized businesses, householders, farmers, the elderly, individuals and particularly the poorest and weakest in our society."
"It is obvious to me that something is going very seriously wrong."
"Today there is a gathering in The Hague of the representatives of COP6."
"They are meeting to discuss progress on climate change."
"Last Monday Jan Pronk, Holland's environment minister, stated that the effect of climate change is irreversible for ecosystems, agriculture, water supply and health."
"The less we do and the longer we wait to tackle the root of the problem, the more serious the effects and the greater the strain on the resilience of peoples, plants and animals."
"This is undoubtedly true."
"The issues that are being discussed are for the medium and long-term."
"However, this resolution tabled right across Parliament, including by my colleagues from England, deals with a very real and short-term problem faced by thousands and thousands of people in Britain and across Europe."
"In Britain alone the estimated cost of the damage is about GBP 4 billion, only half of which is covered by insurance."
"Across Europe this bill will rise and rise like the water level."
"The Commission must make all speed to use its energies and funds to ensure that those affected in the hardest hit areas are helped immediately, through such instruments as the ERDF and the EAGGF Guarantee Section."
"We must in particular help our farmers, small businesses, the elderly and the householders who have been inundated time and time again."
"There is a question as to whether some of these people who have been flooded will be able to be reinsured and whether the insurance companies will take this on again."
"There must also be a realisation that the rush to build housing all over the green belt and in rural areas is dangerous folly."
"There was often a good reason why our forefathers did not build on these areas because they flood."
"Yet today there are governments, like the present Labour government, which are steamrolling informed local opinion into building on precisely these areas."
"I do not know exactly the situation across Europe but in the south-east of England this is a real and present danger."
"We must fight this headlong rush."
"We must take stock and take serious action to cut carbon dioxide emissions."
"We must prepare effectively and in a coordinated way in order to protect ourselves."
"We must do all in our power to help those already suffering from the terrible effects of the weather, both here in Europe and across the world."
"I further ask, in addition to the resolution that we have tabled, that we here in Parliament hold a public hearing on climate change in the near future and I now ask the Committee of Presidents to consider this."
"I ask you all to support our resolution."
"Mr President, the recent floods wrought havoc and destruction throughout Europe, particularly throughout Britain and Ireland."
"In my own constituency the towns of Clonmel, Fermoy and Mallow were the worst affected."
"It was heartbreaking to witness the scenes of destruction of so many peoples' homes and to learn of the problems that were being experienced by many communities, businesses and farmers."
"It is very regrettable that we, the European Union, do not have a budget line to assist those who face these particular difficulties, despite my attempts and attempts by others over many years to get such a budget line instated."
"What I find puzzling about it is the damage it has done to areas of the economy where the European Union commits significant funds, particularly in relation to infrastructure."
"It is about time that we rectified it."
"The EU, in cooperation with Member State governments, should initiate a preventative action programme to strengthen infrastructure in order to stop the same scale of destruction recurring in the future when extreme weather conditions prevail."
"The problem is that we know when these weather conditions are coming but no one seems to do anything to prevent the worst damage being inflicted."
"The other problem I would like to raise is the additional burden that the victims of these particular tragedies will also experience, the point mentioned by my colleague, Mr Deva, namely the refusal of many insurance companies to continue insurance cover."
"I wonder whether or not we, as a Union, could force these insurance companies under existing law to discharge what are essentially moral obligations, rather than do as they do at present and cherry pick and prefer a no-risk situation."
"However, if we cannot force them to do that then it is an area into which Member State governments must step, to see whether or not it is possible, under the umbrella of the EU, to oblige Member State governments to provide state cover."
"It is not fair that people should experience tragedies of this proportion and then face a very uncertain future when, given the climatic changes already taking place, there is an absolute certainty that the problems they have experienced over the last couple of weeks will recur, if not next year, then certainly in the years that follow."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the floods which have affected various areas of northern Italy and other European countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Ireland and France in recent weeks once again raise the issue for Parliament both of an extraordinary, urgent intervention to alleviate the distress of the people, communities and companies affected, and a longer term policy to prevent the repetition of natural disasters of this scale."
"Certain regions of Italy have suffered particularly badly for the second time in less than a month."
"The damage is considerable this time as well, people have died and the material damage has been enormous."
"In Liguria, in particular, entire plantations of specialised flower and fruit and vegetable crops have been destroyed and there has been a great deal of damage to seaside resorts, civil engineering works and factories, caused by storm surges as well as the floods."
"And given the remarkable scale of the disaster, the request made in the resolution which we tabled together with other groups is totally justified, despite the fact that these issues have been debated recently in this House - on 26 October to be precise - and that a Parliamentary resolution was adopted on that occasion as well."
"We call upon the Commission to set aside part of its budget for emergency funds, so as to incorporate the interventions envisaged by the national authorities in the areas affected, and, pursuant to Article 87(2) of the Treaty on European Union, immediately to grant fitting financial assistance to the sectors affected by the disasters and, in general, to take into consideration the fact that the majority of the disaster areas are eligible for assistance from the existing funds: the Regional Fund, the EAGGF Guarantee Fund and the LIFE programme, which can provide a genuinely substantial contribution to the reconstruction work and restore the normal lives of the peoples who have been the victims of these disasters as soon as possible, but, above all, which can contribute to preventing further such damage."
"It is vital that the Union does not restrict itself to making one-off interventions after disasters have occurred."
"Europe must remind the Member States to update their legislation on the environment, construction abuse, reforestation and the promotion of farming methods which seek not only to increase production quantities, but also to protect and replenish the land."
"Clearly, such large-scale action cannot be developed effectively at national level alone, due, primarily, to the amount of resources necessary but also because of the very nature of the natural disasters in question which, like those resulting from climate change, certainly have no respect for borders."
"With this resolution, we call for an urgent intervention contributing to repairing the damage and also for a longer-term policy to make Europe an increasingly safe and accommodating region for its citizens to live in."
"Mr President, throughout their various interventions, MEPs have concentrated on two quite different points: in the first place, the problem of climate change and, in the second place, what the Commission or the European Union can do in a situation like the present one, with the extremely serious floods that have occurred."
"With regard to the first subject, I should like to point out that, as Parliament also does, we attach great importance to the problem of climate change and to the conference that is at this moment taking place in The Hague."
"We actively participated in the preparations for the conference and insisted that the European Union must assume a leading role in it."
"We agree with a number of assertions already made to the effect that we are in this way contributing to the protection of the environment and to the credibility of the environmental protocols with a view to their ratification in 2002."
"We are aware that the global destabilisation of the climate caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will be the most important challenge for Europe' s energy sector."
"The energy and transport sectors produce 85% of the total emissions of greenhouse gases in the European Union."
"It is therefore these industries which ought to be making a major effort to reduce emissions."
"Given its anticipated continuous growth - of more than 38% in the next decade - the transport sector will be that which requires the more important measures."
"On this basis, the Commission is shortly going to be proposing two strategic documents: a combination of policies and measures designed to provide a response to the Kyoto commitments and to the objectives regarding transport and energy."
"The first will deal with the security of the energy supply and the second with a revised common transport policy."
"Apart from environmental problems, however, I should also like to comment on what we are able to do at the moment."
"As you know, we have a basic difficulty: the legal basis for taking action."
"You know that, historically, there was a budget heading dedicated to emergency aid for populations in exceptional situations."
"This heading disappeared from the Budget some time ago on the basis of the argument that these were matters to which the subsidiarity principle applied and which ought to be raised at national, rather than Community, level."
"Ever since then, the Commission' s margin for manoeuvre has been very limited."
"The Commission has taken two initiatives along these lines."
"One of these is very clear and is connected with civil protection: on 27 September 2000, we presented a draft Council decision for reinforcing Community instruments designed to coordinate the various systems of civil protection at European level."
"This will be effective in helping us solve problems, but it is not going to solve problems such as those we are creating now."
"All that we shall have left are the financing instruments that already exist."
"Mrs Ghilardotti raised the possibility of seeking funds."
"It is not so easy to do that."
"As you know better than anyone, funds are fully allocated and there are no generalised fund surpluses, even though there may be specific instances where there are no budgetary implementations."
"What is certain is that, if there is no legal basis for using these funds, it is very difficult to obtain them."
"The Commission' s proposal, which Commissioner Wallström explained in detail in this Parliament, is therefore to use the currently existing EAGGF funds, or the structural funds of the Interreg funds."
"The fact is that, in these cases, we cannot speak of actions of the Commission involving a global programme."
"Either we totally change the model or we shall have to think of the actions concerned as being at the request of the Member States and involving programmes or specific actions dependent upon the use of these funds."
"As we said just now, we are entirely sympathetic to these practical projects, and I want to insist upon this point today, but it is absolutely essential to be able to rely on these proposals if we are to be able to take action."
"With regard, finally, to the possibility of using Article 87.2, established in the Treaty, as a basis for Community aid, I believe that this involves an extravagant interpretation of this article, and that is leaving aside the budgetary problems it would create."
"The article does not relate to Community aid, but relates to the compatibility of national aid with Community legislation."
"What this article says is that, in the case of natural catastrophes, national aid may be compatible."
"Each time the Commission has proposed the compatibility of such national aid following natural catastrophes, there has always been such compatibility."
"We are therefore entirely sympathetic to acting right now within the legal and budgetary margins available to us."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"We now adjourn the sitting until the beginning of the vote at 5.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 5 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)"
"VOTE"
"The next item is the vote on the topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Joint resolution on Central America:"
"Mr President, a purely linguistic error has occurred in introducing one of the amendments in the joint resolution."
"To rectify this, I propose replacing the words '... increase in its powers' in the last sentence of paragraph 6 with the following words: 'and supports an increase in its powers as a means of deepening democracy' ."
"Mr President, despite the oral amendment tabled by Mr Salafranca, the Socialist Group will adhere to its proposal for a split vote on this paragraph."
"Mr President, I regard this a relatively important report, because it concerns a policy that accounts for a significant share of public expenditure, both at European Union level and at the level of its component Member States."
"Depending on the state concerned, it accounts for least 10%, approximately, of public expenditure."
"In addition, the report responds to what the EU Member States envisaged at the Lisbon Summit."
"Moreover, the text we will be voting on calls on the European Commission to draw up a Green Paper specifically on this question."
"So we should now be voting on this highly important text in the presence of only 171 MEPs, which is the number just counted."
"Perhaps that is established practice here in Parliament, but I think it is very chancy to give the impression that the European Parliament as an institution is committing itself on a subject such as this one and considering entrusting the Commission with this kind of task, given the very low attendance here."
"So I wonder whether Parliament could not consider postponing the vote on this document."
"Mr President, I am in favour of postponing the vote out of respect for the rapporteur, Mr Rocard, who specifically asked this afternoon for the vote to be deferred."
"I think we can postpone this vote out of respect for him and the work he has done."
"Mr President, I have concerned myself very closely with this question and have taken part in many discussions both in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"This House unanimously believes that we need to work very quickly on the Commission's document, on the basis of the Rocard report, so that we can continue the political debate and take concrete measures."
"Postponing the vote would mean postponing the task we entrust to the Commission."
"Given what we all want to achieve, I think that is a bad idea and I therefore ask you to proceed to the vote now."
"Mr President, since you have already exhausted the possibilities for points of order, this probably is not one."
"But if you would permit me please, I should like to say that, whatever the view of the House on this issue, I do not appreciate the fact that almost constantly today various colleagues, in various groups, for various reasons - which may be sound - have removed our right to vote here in Strasbourg on Thursday, let alone Friday."
"As a general principle, this is a very bad way to proceed."
"I would urge caution on all colleagues in all of the committees and groups who choose now progressively to undermine the dignity and substance of the work of this House."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you Mr Cox."
"I respect the remarks you made and can assure you that they will be recorded in the Minutes."
"(Parliament rejected the request for deferral)."
"Mr President, on behalf of rapporteur Rocard, I would like, in any case, to table an oral amendment to Amendment No 1."
"I would like to propose - and this has been agreed in consultation with other political groups, that 'and with the support of Eurostat' be added at the end of this amendment."
"I understand that this will meet with the approval of the other groups."
"So let us add 'and with the support of Eurostat' ."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"Mr President, last night I had a dream which I can still remember (fortunately for I usually forget what I dream)."
"There was a large crowd of pensioners and elderly people and they said to me: ""Mr Fatuzzo, we were not able to vote for your Pensioners' Party because, as you see, we are here in the afterlife."
"Life is not bad here, but we would like to warn you that, tomorrow morning, Parliament will be voting on a report - the Rocard report - which contains an amendment tabled by yourself, Mr Fatuzzo, worded: 'calls upon the Commission ... to ensure that all necessary medical treatment and care is guaranteed to the elderly also' ."
"If this amendment had been adopted earlier, we would still be alive to vote for you."""
"I was therefore very happy to vote for the report."
"Mr President, the case of the Rocard report shows quite clearly how important it is for Members to be in the House on Thursdays too because, as on Fridays, we have many important matters to vote on."
"So I want to thank all those who are present here today."
". (EL) Health is a blessing, not a commodity which can comply with the rules of competition."
"In its drive towards further liberalisation, the Commission is endeavouring to pave the way for new arrangements in the health and medical care sector which broaden the scope of activity of insurance companies and remove any obstacles to the business of private insurance companies at national and Community level."
"The ÅU attaches greater importance to the principle of the free provision of services than to the right to heath and medical care, methodically and systematically undermining the public health system, especially in the medical care sector, by disgracefully promoting private forms of insurance as a 'necessary' complement to and/or substitute for the public-sector system of social protection."
"The economic and social policy of the ÅU, which has resulted in the reduced purchasing power of and facilities available to workers, as regards the payment of contributions, the emergence of new diseases and the unaccountability of pharmaceutical companies, have caused health costs to spiral."
"Because there are problems meeting the cost of medical care as the result of the budgetary discipline and cost restrictions imposed by EMU, measures are being taken to pass the cost of health care on to the workers."
"Differences between insurance systems in individual Member States and obstacles to the free movement of people and freedom of residence in another Member State cannot be used as a pretext for privatising a large part - and later all - of the health care system."
"The real aim of these proposals is to extend liberalisation to sectors which are of crucial importance to companies in monopoly positions, ensuring that insurance business and financial business in general are highly concentrated and meshed so that they can increase their holdings in portfolio companies."
"We believe that the aim should be to strengthen the public health system and the system of social protection and to safeguard its basic content, in the sense of a universal service, by supplying high-quality medical care and preventative care to every citizen, paying particular attention to those living in remote or island areas, within the framework of a single public-sector system of health and social insurance."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Michel Rocard' s report on supplementary health insurance."
"The report takes as its starting point the observation that an ever greater proportion of health insurance in Europe is covered by supplementary health insurance schemes."
"This is a serious problem if it means that people are to be treated differently on the basis of their financial circumstances and health situation."
"In the course of the debate in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the matter was brought to a head when our fellow MEPs from the British Conservative Party said that, in insurance, the premium is based on the risk assumed by the insurance company."
"For example, a woman genetically disposed to breast cancer must pay a higher premium than other women."
"This is a breach of absolutely fundamental principles of solidarity on which the European social model ought to be based, and a common initiative ought therefore to be taken to ensure that no one is excluded from such supplementary schemes."
"Michel Rocard' s report emphasises that health insurance is primarily a concern for the Member States and that the proximity principle should apply."
"If the European Parliament is asking the Commission to produce an inventory of the Member States' policies, it is precisely because we have a common interest in all Member States having access to high-quality health services."
"The better the health services provided by the Member States, the less need there is for supplementary insurance."
"This is an area on which it will be natural to work within the framework of the open coordination method, as the European Council has begun doing in connection with combating social exclusion."
". (FR) We are firmly opposed to this resolution, which is totally hypocritical and endangers the public social protection systems in the European Union."
"In fact, despite the very legitimate recitals on the rights acquired within the existing systems, seeking to give all citizens a high level of protection, regardless of their personal resources and the individual risks incurred, which also highlight the risks of transfer from public to private schemes, and outline the growing involvement of the latter in overall expenditure and the resulting inequalities, all the practical proposals set out in the resolution do nothing but promote the faster growth of private insurance schemes throughout the Community."
"What this encourages is not a move towards efficient Community-wide public services but, on the pretext of the costs involved and the principle of subsidiarity, towards actually minimising the public service. It would be reduced to a 'basic service' or to 'minimum standards' , which are called a 'safety net' and which would only cover a specific range of health care."
"For the rest, this opens the door wide to private insurers, on condition only that they do not (from the outset) select the patient and the insurance premiums by type of disease."
"In fact, the aim of this resolution is merely to organise the insurance market, whereas we should instead be organising Europe and moving it in the direction of encouraging high-quality collective schemes accessible to all."
"."
"(DE) We are dealing again with an own-initiative report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which, although supplementary health insurance is a highly topical issue, is not totally endorsed by the committee or here in the plenary of the European Parliament since, after all, 12 members did not vote for it in committee."
"It is all very well to call on the Commission to present a Green Paper indicating ways in which the existing health insurance systems could be effectively supplemented and maintained by means of supplementary care schemes while providing high-quality medical care, and it is important that we should welcome the development of a single market for supplementary health insurance."
"But let me specially emphasise the accuracy of the statement that all other health protection should be a matter for Member States rather than the European Union and that publicly funded healthcare systems should remain, as ever, within the exclusive competence of the Member States."
"Because that is so, I think it is premature to incorporate in this resolution a long and very detailed list of points to be included in a proposal for a Commission directive."
"I find it rather odd that people are already trying to tie the Commission's hands in relation to the proposal for a directive, while at the same calling on it to present a Green Paper on the current situation with regard to optional and supplementary health insurance schemes."
"Are we not putting the cart before the horse?"
"Notwithstanding these observations and reservations, I voted for the report."
". (NL) Health insurance and pensions ought to form part of the remuneration people receive from their work."
"Supplementary arrangements should only be necessary if the real provisions fall short of the mark."
"They are a source of profit for banks and insurance companies, which rake the money in that people save from reductions in premiums and taxes."
"Instead of regarding health insurance as part of remuneration for work or as part of payments replacing wages, increasingly, this provision is being made dependent on savings and investments."
"There is a feeling that collectivity and solidarity should be done away with so that everything can be settled on an individual basis."
"Everyone is being compelled just to think of their own interests, and to start attending to all kinds of unnecessary financial matters."
"People who do not earn or spend much no longer count for anything."
"One of the things this will do is create a divide in health care."
"People who have ordinary health insurance will end up on waiting lists and receiving second-rate care, whilst those who pay extra will be able to buy the right to priority treatment and luxury."
"It surprises me that rapporteur Rocard - whom as I recall, was the leader of a leftwing socialist party in the dim and distant past - is now delighted about the development of an internal market for private health care."
"The remainder of his proposals serve to dress the wounds that this option will cause."
". I wholeheartedly support this report by my Socialist colleague, Michel Rocard, on the future financing of health insurance systems."
"At a time when the population is ageing dramatically, it is crucial that we look at improving the health care system for people across Europe."
"We should not undervalue the basic state provision and importance of arrangements between countries."
"Having been ill myself in Belgium, I have witnessed at first hand the benefits of mutual recognition of health care systems."
"From my own heartfelt experience, I would certainly not want to see these benefits ruined."
"We are asking the Commission to look at the various national health schemes and to examine ways of ensuring a fair deal for those who spend time working in another EU country."
"These national provisions are life-saving measures."
"However, if we are to have an effective system that can cope with increasing pressure on existing national services, and that makes Europe a healthier place for our citizens, then we should also recognise the importance of supplementary insurance providers."
"We should not discriminate against citizens applying to join private health care schemes."
"The health of our citizens is extremely precious."
"Citizens across the EU must be confident of receiving effective health care no matter which country they are in."
"I call on the Commission to take heed of Michel Rocard's report."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"Own funds of banks (continuation)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly pleased to be able to speak today in the presence of a group of visitors from my lovely constituency, whom I welcome very warmly."
"We are continuing the debate on the report by Mrs Villiers, whom I want to congratulate very heartily on her report. She has managed to reconcile the different opinions across the committee, so I believe this report represents a real step forward."
"In particular, it is important that she managed, by achieving a very broad majority in committee, to ensure that the requirements of the small institutions - the savings banks, the cooperative banks, the small and medium-sized businesses - are also given due consideration in this important legislative project and that what is called internal rating, i.e. the internal assessment of credit risks, will be given the same status as external rating, as proposed by the Basel Committee."
"I regard that as major progress."
"I believe it is also important in terms of the public debate to make it clear that it is not the Basel Committee, a non-elected body, that will be deciding the definitive directives, but the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, by the codecision procedure."
"In that public debate I keep finding people referring to the Basel Committee."
"In fact, the European Parliament will decide on the final legislative text jointly with the Council of Ministers, and we should make people more aware of that."
"But for me the question now is the procedure that will apply."
"The banking sector is very keen that we decide by a fast-track procedure."
"I, too, believe that Parliament should play its part here and, if possible, take the final decision at first reading."
"However, we must create the necessary conditions to ensure that the European Parliament's rights are in no way weakened. If possible, by one means or another, we must ensure that Parliament and the Council of Ministers can reach agreement at first reading on the legislative text that is then finalised."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first let me make an observation regarding my group."
"At the actual vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we did not have a very large majority."
"At least, the majority of my group voted against; and after all we did ensure that the report was not adopted during the last plenary part-session, but postponed until today."
"But let me say quite emphatically, that has nothing to do with the actual content of the report, but only with the fact which Mr von Wogau has just touched on, namely that we were worried that if we tied our hands in regard to the further procedure, Parliament would be renouncing its rights."
"Obviously we cannot accept that."
"In the committee itself, there was consensus on the issue as such."
"And the rapporteur really tried, made a real effort to bring about a consensus."
"We want a consensus on this question."
"And we would be well advised to reach a very broad consensus on it here in Parliament."
"The forthcoming changes to own funds rules for credit institutions and investment firms will have a far-reaching impact on the banking sector and beyond."
"These provisions very much influence the practices of credit institutions in granting loans."
"When we see how very heavily our European economy, and especially our small and medium-sized businesses, depend on loan financing, we soon realise that this is a very large-scale economic project."
"The very intensive debate on external rating made that abundantly clear."
"At international level, the proposal from the Basel committee to classify risks mainly on the basis of the results of ratings by external institutions would lead to considerable distortions of competition."
"It would create especially serious competitive disadvantages for medium-sized businesses."
"To prevent such distortions, it is therefore most important for the institutions to have a simple, alternative means at their disposal for identifying their own funds requirements, in fact one based on the use of internal ratings."
"It should be regarded as a success that the European position, as proposed from the outset by the Commission in its consultation paper, prevailed in Basel, so that the inclusion of internal rating procedures is now at the centre of the debate."
"Since as things stand at present, it seems that both the Basel Committee and we ourselves have accepted internal ratings in principle, our primary task now is to formulate these procedures in such a way that on principle all credit institutions within the European Union can introduce internal ratings across the board."
"That is the only way to create equal conditions of competition."
"However, that also means that these institutions must be given enough time to prepare for the new rules."
"The most recent information seems to suggest that the new regulation, first planned to enter into force on 1 January 2003, will be postponed until 2004."
"That would give the institutions more time to implement the provisions."
"So we simply have to ensure - and here I entirely agree with Mr von Wogau - that we work as closely in tandem as possible."
"In particular, we must ensure that there are no major differences between Basel and ourselves in relation to timescales. Otherwise the institutions concerned would just face unreasonable burdens, additional costs or competitive disadvantages."
"But one thing must also be made clear. Parliament cannot and will not give up its rights of codecision."
"So that means that if we manage to reach a decision at first reading, jointly with the Council and the moderation of the Commission, we will be happy to do so, but we will not give up our right to the codecision procedure from the outset."
"It is up to the Council."
"It is the Council that has always delayed legislative procedures in the past."
"It must get its act together and ensure that we can proceed rapidly."
"Parliament has never been responsible for the failure of such procedures."
"Nor would it be responsible for failure in this case."
"So, ladies and gentlemen of the Council, do get on with it."
"Mr President, there is a strong case for fast track when it comes to implementing the results of the Basel review on bank capital adequacy."
"The Americans will be able to introduce its provisions immediately without primary legislation, unlike us, and they will be able to lend more cheaply than European banks."
"Moreover, Parliament has had ample time to inform itself on the issues with this welcome Villiers report on capital adequacy."
"In effect, we are having a first reading before the proposals have been tabled."
"Some people in this House think that it fatally undermines Parliament's powers."
"We disagree."
"Delegating powers over technical matters is essential if regulation is to keep up with the innovations in financial markets, as long as those delegated powers are subject to proper scrutiny."
"We are here to use our powers in the interests of European businesses and our constituents, and we shall not be forgiven if we fail to do so."
"Dogmatically insisting that Parliament should get involved with every technical judgment will simply mean that regulation will be out of date before it even starts."
"It takes two to three years to pass EU law but only weeks to launch a new financial services product with implications for bank capital, such as credit derivatives."
"I appeal to all colleagues and particularly to the Socialist Group, to re-examine their views on this matter and look at what safeguards they would like to see in primary legislation to enable the delegation of powers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is difficult to argue with the general substance of Mrs Villiers' report."
"But what we could find surprising is its very existence, and the existence of the Commission' s new initiative here."
"What are we talking about?"
"The issue is to do with updating the European rules on banks' own funds, funds that are supposed to be proportionate to the nature and scale of the risks incurred by these establishments."
"The report refers to a growing consensus that the present framework fails adequately to capture the changes in the financial sector over the past ten years."
"Given that the phrase ""growing consensus"" - I am quoting from the report - in fact implies that there is no consensus on the subject as yet, we are justified in asking whether the institution promoting this reform, the chosen instrument and the chosen time are really appropriate."
"One cannot help feeling that Parliament, following the Commission, feels obliged to align its activities with those of the Basel committee, which, let me remind you, has no legitimate right to impose its views on the Member States."
"Let me also remind you that only eight Member States are represented on that committee, which on the other hand includes representatives of countries that are the main competitors of European countries."
"But let us, after all, assume that the referee has not sold out to the other side and let us accept the idea that the texts by the Commission and the rapporteur respond to a real and growing problem, as the report has it, and that the fact that these matters are being considered here at the same time the Basel committee is considering them is a chance to settle them finally."
"Do you not think it is paradoxical to try to catch up on free America by imposing a further constraint on the European banks?"
"Does it not seem paradoxical to translate what is no more than a recommendation to the large banks into binding provisions for EU credit institutions?"
"The rapporteur is probably aware how grotesque it is to call for simple rules to reflect a situation that is complex and has become more complex."
"As for the sense of urgency that Mrs Villiers has added to the Commission' s sense of the need for these measures by calling for a fast-track procedure for adopting them, we have to say that the rapporteur herself acknowledges that these new rules will have no effect on the anti-competition practices that are, alas, so widespread in the United States."
"Under these circumstances, this kind of initiative is more likely to have an effect opposite to that anticipated and to impose additional constraints on our banking sectors, without any guarantees of compensation."
"Despite the exhortations of Parliament, the Commission has absolutely no means of guaranteeing that the American authorities will stop discriminating against EU banks."
"Yet this report does have some merits, ladies and gentlemen, including the fact that it represents real progress in relation both to the first Basel text and to the Commission text."
"Mrs Villiers is aware of the concerns of the small and medium-sized businesses, which to a large extent depend on bank financing, and she has sensibly asked the Commission to carry out an internal assessment of the central component of its new rules, so as not to raise the cost of loan finance granted to these enterprises."
"If, in its wisdom, Parliament decides by a majority to confirm a principle to which we should not like to see any exceptions, the Union for the Europe of Nations Group will be happy to vote for the report."
"If not, we will show that we are sceptical not about your work but about a procedure that we regard as a new stage in a process..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, my colleague, Mr von Wogau, and I would seem to share something more than just the same opinion today."
"I also have guests there in the public gallery. They are from Finland, and I would like to wish them welcome."
"Commissioner, we surely agree that Europe must never encounter the same sort of profound banking crisis that we had to undergo at the start of the 1990s."
"We shall, however, see losses in the banking industry in the future too."
"When a bank suffers losses, its own resources function as a buffer, which helps to cover the losses that ordinary business profits cannot cover sufficiently."
"For that reason, the proposal now under discussion is of major importance, as we are trying to ensure that European banks are sound and that their clients' savings are therefore protected."
"Their shareholder' s equity relies on their ability to take account as best they can of the nature and extent of banking risks."
"With modern techniques in risk management it is possible to gain much more precise data on risks than previously."
"So it is natural that the banks should also be given the opportunity to use these resources and create a more risk-sensitive working environment."
"To increase risk awareness both the banks' internal and external evaluation methods must be available."
"In fact, I believe that internal classification will, in future, enjoy a more important status, as often it is within the banks themselves that key personnel from companies to be allowed credit are well known, as are the companies' operations generally."
"There is broad consensus in Parliament on the content of this proposal."
"Actually, the only significant difference of opinion among the groups concerns the procedure that should be applied to this proposal and other proposals on legislation on financial services in the future."
"Our rapporteur, Mrs Villiers, who has been responsible for some excellent work, mentioned in her report the possibility of applying a fast track method."
"I support her fully in this idea, as I think it is important that the financial service sector action plan be got through in accordance with the briefest possible timetable."
"In practice the only way to do that is to speed up the legislation procedure and agree that more issues should be handled on an emergency procedure basis."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad such a large majority has agreed with the arguments of this important report. I can only congratulate Mrs Villiers on it, for as Mr von Wogau said, she has managed to cover the spectrum of banks and their clients in Europe in this good report."
"We are in favour of matching the own capital held to cover credit risks more closely with the economic risk level and further developing the rules on own funds."
"We are in favour of putting more emphasis on risk mitigation techniques; and we are also in favour of broadening the basic concept of the Basel Committee."
"The Basel Committee's proposals only concern the large banks and external rating, while we believe it is necessary to broaden them to cover the small banks and to include internal rating."
"Another positive note in this regard is that it was clearly accepted that internal bank collateral mitigates risks."
"One reason that is so important is that purely external rating would have significantly increased the costs of loans for small and medium-sized businesses."
"It is the small and medium-sized businesses that create most new jobs and protect existing ones."
"The merit of this report is that it emphasises the links between loan costs, job creation, support for small and medium-sized businesses and the recognition of internal in addition to external ratings. We will therefore vote for it with great conviction."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to begin with very warm thanks to Mrs Theresa Villiers."
"In her report, she has splendidly succeeded in reconciling the entire spectrum of opinion in our Parliament."
"Let me briefly address the problem that in Basel we are creating a framework for systems that are not necessarily compatible, systems in the USA and systems in Europe, and here we must ensure that we do not ride roughshod over a particular area."
"Basel is looking primarily at the large banks."
"But we in Europe must look at the small banks."
"Their clients have few funds."
"We know that the large banks are no longer interested in them."
"Of course we must also make sure that Basel does not produce a second disadvantage for banks, as a result of higher own-funds requirements."
"As we keep repeating, it would be the small and medium-sized businesses that would bear the brunt, although we keep urging that they should be bolstered up."
"Internal and external ratings have just been discussed."
"I would also raise the question of portfolio straddling."
"We must ensure that the level of risk is assessed, and not just credit in the abstract, i.e. that we leave some room for manoeuvre in relation to small loans for small and medium-sized businesses and craft firms."
"I believe it is important that we also make it clear that what is going on in Basel is an undemocratic procedure, that the European Parliament is the only democratically legitimate organisation that is adopting a position on this in Europe."
"During the procedure we must not think about whether we are surrendering rights, but about the degree of detail to which we regulate matters in Europe in future, or where we should simply establish the framework and pass on certain instruments of adjustment to other institutions, such as the Commission, but also Basel."
"I also call on the European Central Bank and the Commission to take great care in Basel to ensure that Basel takes account of the structure of the European systems."
"Today we in the European Parliament must also send out the signal that we will not allow our established systems to be put at risk and that the large banks will also face problems if a legal framework is created in Europe."
"What we need is sufficient flexibility in this area."
"Mr President, in the first place, I would point out that the Commission is pleased to see that Mrs Villiers' report relates not only to the evaluation of the Own Resources Directive but also to the current revision of the changes to the regulations concerning capital adequacy."
"We also think that this report makes an important and satisfactory contribution to the whole process."
"The reaction to the two consultation documents on this subject - that of the European Commission and that of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision - has been positive, and I should like to comment on the latter document."
"I appreciate that the capacity of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has nothing to do with that of the European Parliament."
"It has no legislative power, but nor should it be forgotten that it is a matter of actual fact that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision belongs to the Group of the Ten and that, even though it is not a legislative body, its standards apply in 130 countries and are used by a multiplicity of international organisations, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and, obviously, third countries."
"It is therefore important not to dissociate ourselves from what is happening in Basel, even though we obviously have our own legislative procedure."
"It is, of course, crucial that we should define our own rules to enable us, as the European Union, also to influence what is being decided in Basel."
"Having made this initial comment, I should like to point out that I believe that economic operators are also satisfied with the approach adopted towards these regulations on capital, which help deal with the issues related to risk."
"The Commission believes that the high degree of support given by the report to the aforementioned approach of the Commission' s consultation paper is obviously to be welcomed."
"The report coincides, to a large degree, with the ideas of the Commission and the objectives we are trying to achieve."
"The Commission will continue to be especially vigilant in ensuring that the potentially most vulnerable sectors are taken into account."
"The report highlights a number of valid concerns regarding the possible damage that may be caused, for example in the SMEs sector, and also to our banking system and to those of our investment institutions which do not maintain a competitive level within the European Union and between the European Union and other countries in the world."
"We all know that, on this point, Mr Lamfalussy has prepared a very clear and enormously useful report which may help us produce legislation that is more effective, more efficient and, so to speak, better adjusted to the changes occurring in the market."
"We have to confront a situation in which we must ensure that the new directives are not superseded as soon as they are adopted and that the standards under existing directives are capable of keeping pace with the rapid development of the financial markets."
"Inflexibility and lack of adaptability are damaging the competitiveness of our financial institutions."
"I should like to say, in the first place, that our legislation must be sufficiently up to date and be flexible enough to respond to the rapid developments in the market."
"Secondly, we must avoid the excessive costs which can affect financial institutions and, consequently and indirectly, the clients of those financial institutions."
"We ought to support these objectives by means of sound and prudent standards which guarantee the security of our markets and institutions."
"And finally, and this is a key point, we are entirely alert to the fact that we ought to respect the institutional balance established in the Treaty."
"It is at present far too soon to speak of the Commission' s adopting a formal position on these subjects, but perhaps we can define a number of outline features of the possible approach."
"This approach could refer to different levels."
"A first level would include the basic principles, or codes principals, to be included in certain norms such as directives."
"In the second place, there would be a level of technical detail covering that area which will be most subject to change if we want the regulations to reflect best practice."
"This could be included in annexes to these directives, and we would have to devise a satisfactory system for modifying them quickly."
"We would be talking about a second level of decision-making."
"There would also be a third level corresponding to the implementation of mechanisms enabling us to promote consistency and convergence in the area of supervision and to reinforce what is stated along those lines in the paper produced by the Member States and the Commission."
"A basic point for us in the process is the way in which we seek to maintain the present institutional balance."
"Parliament will, in future, require that the principles underlying its decision-making should be observed by means of an agreement on this future regulation model and that these principles, to the extent that they can be applied, should be of substance and respond to more practical issues rather than to generalities."
"These are a few initial thoughts on how we might succeed in devising a rapid legislative process which is controllable and efficient within the current Treaty regulations."
"I hope that Parliament will take an active part in the discussions over the next few months."
"Turning to the points in the specific amendments which are to be made and which have been included in the report, I should like to make two comments."
"Regarding, in the first place, Amendments Nos 8 and 13: the use of an approach based on internal ratings must be introduced in a sound and prudent way."
"For many institutions, this approach may be neither desirable nor appropriate and, of course, its use must never be compulsory."
"Right from the start, the Commission has been in favour of developing a full internal ratings system, subject to standards which may be achieved by well-managed institutions, independently of their size or of the sector in which they operate."
"This is a positive development we should like to see adopted by as many institutions as possible, but we appreciate that it would not be right to insist on an internal ratings system for all financial institutions."
"With regard to Amendment No 12 on the supervisory review system, I should like to point out that it is already within the powers of the supervisors to request or establish levels in excess of the minimum capital requirements."
"The proposal to use this instrument solely as a type of last resort would reduce the impact of the supervisory review process as a key element of this framework."
"I therefore think that the position needs to remain as it is."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"The European Ombudsman"
"The next item is the report (A5-0293/2000) by Mrs Almeida Garrett, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the modification of Parliament' s decision of 9 March 1994 on the regulations governing performance of the Ombudsman' s duties."
"Mr President, we are here today to debate the first of two reports on modifying the statute and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman' s duties."
"I apologise to the House for being tempted at the end of the afternoon at the end of this part-session to take some of my longings for home as my inspiration for the debate on this report."
"If we think about it, as in relations with children, there comes a point in the process of the birth and growth of institutions that develop within others when we have to show, through our actions, that we acknowledge their independence."
"The time has now come to acknowledge that the institution of the 'European Ombudsman' is sufficiently grown up and has shown sufficient signs of maturity to have its own budget."
"Although, in the early stages, it seemed right and proper to have the independence of the Ombudsman' s mandate and actions coexist with a dependency on the financial resources of the European Parliament budget, today this no longer makes sense."
"What we are now proposing is precisely that this separation should be acknowledged, as in the Council regulation of December 1999, approving the creation of a specific section for the Ombudsman in the general budget of the European Communities."
"This was a fundamental step forwards, as the Ombudsman was considered to be an independent institution in terms of the application of the Financial Regulation."
"This step was nothing more than the acknowledgement that the growing visibility of an institution which was born and which grew out of the need to bring European citizens closer to the life of the Community institutions also needs financial independence in order to take full responsibility for the budgetary provisions it makes and considers appropriate for the material and human resources necessary to ensure the proper discharge of its worthy duties."
"We therefore now need to adapt its statute to the Financial Regulation and propose that two articles be deleted - Article 12 and Article 16 of Parliament' s 1994 decision - which, as we all know, approved the general conditions of the performance of the European Ombudsman' s duties."
"These rules stopped reflecting the budgetary situation after the last amendment to the Community Financial Regulation."
"We therefore need to recognise that this does not correspond to the real situation and approve its deletion."
"Given that we will soon have to apply ourselves in this Parliament to fundamental changes to the statute of the European Ombudsman, which are still being discussed in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to whose report I have been given access and which addresses the issue of extending the Ombudsman' s powers of investigation, we will wait until then for a complete, qualitative revision of the text of that statute."
"Before I finish, Mr President, I wish to take this opportunity to welcome the rapporteur, Mr Söderman, and congratulate him on his work on fighting maladministration and thereby also bringing European citizens closer to the life of the Community institutions."
"Mr President, I hope the rapporteur will not mind if I say that this is a relatively obscure report that we are taking fairly late on a Thursday evening and that it goes right to the very heart of democracy in the European Union: How do we protect the rights of European citizens?"
"There is no doubt that in that role the position of Ombudsman is absolutely critical."
"The Ombudsman has a distinctive role and position in the framework of the European institution, but it is a role that requires autonomy."
"As we all know, if you are to be independent you need to have financial independence."
"In English we have a phrase: ""He who pays the piper calls the tune."""
"Those who pay for activities or organisations are generally seen to wield some power over those activities or organisations."
"That is why the Ombudsman needs to be financially autonomous and as independent as possible so that we in this Parliament cannot be accused of calling the tune."
"The public need to have the utmost confidence that the Ombudsman is completely impartial in his investigations."
"I, of course, like all Members of this Parliament, have total confidence that Mr Jacob Söderman discharges his responsibilities totally independently but that must be seen to be the case."
"That is why financial autonomy is necessary."
"It is perhaps also worth pointing out to European citizens that the Ombudsman's office - not him personally - costs something like EUR 3.9 million a year or less than one cent per person in the European Union."
"To my English listeners that is roughly half a penny per annum and that is money well spent."
"Thanks to the initiative taken by the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, Mr Gemelli, the correct legal action has been taken to amend the 1994 decision by the European Parliament on the Ombudsman's competencies and duties."
"As a result of this, the Petitions Committee, in the González Álvarez report, said that the procedure to amend the Ombudsman's statute should be seen in the light of Article 195 of the European Communities Treaty."
"Let us never forget that the role of the Ombudsman is one that is enshrined in the European treaties."
"The EPP/ED Group supports the view of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the Ombudsman's competences should be enlarged and the sooner the better, especially in the fields of the Ombudsman's investigative powers laid down in Article 3 of the 1994 decision."
"The quality of the Ombudsman's actions taken so far proves that the institution of the Ombudsman is growing as a full and necessary instrument for European citizens to submit complaints of maladministration by European institutions."
"We in my group appreciate the Ombudsman's support for the Petitions Committee, the committee that is responsible for relations between the Ombudsman and Parliament."
"In this respect the EPP/ED Group encourages the Ombudsman to continue his work through his special reports which we are always ready to consider in a positive spirit of cooperation with the Ombudsman."
"I hope that in the very near future Parliament will consider enhancing the Ombudsman's investigative powers."
"If that happens, the Petitions Committee would expect to be fully and carefully consulted by the Constitutional Affairs Committee."
"We are, as I have already said, the committee with responsibility for relations with the Ombudsman and we work closely with him."
"The EPP/ED Group supports this report therefore and hopes that this, along with the Bösch report on the Ombudsman's report on recruitment procedures, is a sign of the European Parliament's continued commitment to increasing transparency and accountability."
"We do not need extra work and we do not want to see examples of maladministration, but it is important that we remind European citizens that the office of Ombudsman is there to help them if problems of maladministration arise."
"A lot of people unfairly criticise us for the democratic deficit."
"The Ombudsman's office certainly helps to redress that democratic deficit."
"Mr President, in accordance with the Nordic public service tradition, the European Parliament has, positively enough, claimed that the Ombudsman's position should be strengthened and consolidated."
"The European Ombudsman ought to be completely impartial when carrying out his or her duties and when he or she - right now it is Jacob Söderman, a man and a good Finland-Swedish representative - defends the rights of citizens in cases of bad administration."
"Only in this way can the office of Ombudsman, at EU level too, serve its important and more profound purposes."
"Therefore, we in the Swedish Christian Democrat Party warmly welcome the steps that are now about to be taken also to promote the Ombudsman's independence in such fundamental areas as the budget."
"This is an important credibility issue for the independence and impartiality of the office of Ombudsman."
"We in the European Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs have consistently given our full support to this positive measure."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Almeida Garrett, for her contribution in this important matter."
"Finally, allow me to take up another topical issue which concerns the development of the office of Ombudsman."
"It concerns the right of access to documents without restriction, something which is only rarely utilised."
"This is a prerequisite for giving the institution of Ombudsman high credibility among citizens."
"An Ombudsman is naturally bound by secrecy provisions, but it is good for citizens to know that, as Ombudsman, he or she can obtain access to documents which they cannot access themselves as citizens."
"It is also important to realise that the Ombudsman's right of access to documents has nothing to do with the current regulation on openness, which is a frequent misconception."
"The European Parliament, its Committee on Constitutional Affairs and, we hope, the Commission and the Council too, want to see continued development and a strengthening of the office of Ombudsman and its independence and, alongside that, its credibility among citizens."
"Mr President, the Commission can be very brief on this matter."
"The sole purpose of the report is to establish a concordance between the European Ombudsman' s statute and a modification of the financial regulations, and this modification, as the rapporteur has pointed out, seeks to include a separate section for the Ombudsman' s budget in the general Budget of the European Communities."
"The Commission has already signalled its agreement on this matter in the past, both for technical budgetary reasons and for reasons to do with the independence of the Ombudsman' s duties."
"We therefore fully support the changes to the Ombudsman' s statute proposed to us by Mrs Almeida Garrett."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Special report by the European Ombudsman on Commission recruitment"
"The next item is the report (A5-0280/2000) by Mr Bösch, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the special report from the European Ombudsman to the European Parliament following the own-initiative inquiry into the secrecy which forms part of the Commission' s recruitment procedures (C5-0082/2000 - 2000/2048 (COS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the report we are debating this evening fits very well into today's agenda, because around midday today we already adopted an important report on access to documents, and I believe what we are discussing now and will have to decide tomorrow is very closely related to that."
"In relation to the Ombudsman, a matter we have just been discussing, there were several complaints in the past about the lack of transparency in regard to recruitment, and that is a very crucial point, because we entirely agree with the Ombudsman's view that recruitment procedures are many young EU citizens' first contact with the European institutions."
"Here it is important for the procedures to be highly transparent, comprehensible and open."
"Accordingly, the point of departure of this report was the recommendation by the Ombudsman to the Commission to give applicants access to their own marked examination scripts during the selection procedure it organised."
"The previous Commission did not comply with this recommendation, despite several requests."
"That was one reason why the Ombudsman adopted a special report in which he once again emphasised his concern in this respect."
"Meanwhile, the Prodi Commission has agreed to implement the fourth recommendation addressed to it and to allow applicants access to their own corrected test papers in a selection procedure."
"Our committee, the Committee on Petitions, looked into the matter and adopted the report before us."
"When we adopted this report in committee we decided on principle to accept the Ombudsman's recommendation. We would also like to give warm thanks to the Commission and congratulate it on its positive response to the Ombudsman's proposal."
"The hope was also expressed that all other European bodies and institutions will follow the Commission's example and grant job applicants access to their own, corrected test papers."
"We believe that giving applicants for jobs in the European institutions this kind of more transparent and open access would also represent an important step in the widely broadcast reform of the European Commission. It would also bring Brussels and Europe closer to the citizen and make them more comprehensible."
"A word now on the amendments, on which we shall be voting tomorrow."
"To a large extent, they respond to the recommendation made by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and on that basis, they are clearly intended to spell out in a little more detail what we actually expect of the Commission in this respect."
"In particular - and this is also part of the amendments - I think it is important to set the Commission a sensible timetable for implementing these announced reform measures. I hope - that is my position as rapporteur - that the House will endorse this view."
"Mr President, speaking both as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and on behalf of my own group, I, too, very much welcome this."
"I am speaking today on behalf of our Co-President, Mrs Hautala, who is unable to be here this evening."
"It is her opinion in particular that I want to draw attention to as I speak tonight."
"We very much welcome the Ombudsman's report."
"We particularly welcome the reforms and changes which we believe ought to be and, Commission-willing, will be introduced as a result of this report."
"After all, access to documentation is a fundamental civil right and no documentation is more important to a candidate than documentation in relation to examinations."
"The core of the Ombudsman's report is the fact that candidates for Community recruitment are entitled, if they so request, to see their examination scripts."
"We also want to make a particular point about minority languages."
"There is a great difficulty about examining people in a different language."
"I have had to do it myself from time to time, looking at scripts in Italian or German as a native English - or at least a kind of English - speaker."
"The difficulty is resolved by translation, but then we must be sure that the quality of translation is high and that the candidate can check that what was written in the original language is what appears in the paper as examined."
"If there are inconsistencies it must be open to the candidate to draw attention to them."
"We are glad that the Commission is going to do this."
"Not only the Commission but the other institutions and bodies of the Community ought to comply with the Ombudsman's recommendations, even in the case of recruitment procedures which have already been initiated."
"It is regrettable that the Commission agreed to apply the Ombudsman's recommendation only for recruitment procedures launched after June 2000."
"We believe that the institutions of the Community should conduct their staff recruitment procedures, and indeed all recruitment procedures, with a maximum of openness and transparency in order to avoid the suspicion of partiality, injustice and administrative incompetence."
"We must also make sure that the procedures encourage the appointment of women to salary groups, including the highest salary groups in which they are under-represented."
"We would also like to draw attention to the point about temporary and auxiliary posts in the institutions, offices and bodies of the Community and the Union."
"These should be published in the Official Journal and in the press and on the Internet to guarantee a genuine sense of competition."
"Senior officials must ensure that merit is rewarded and that all vacant posts, even the most senior ones, should be published in the Official Journal and on the Internet."
"Further, persons employed in the private offices of members of the Commission must be obliged to take part in a general selection procedure before they can take up any other vacant post in the institution in question."
"We note, for example, that Mr Prodi's former chef de cabinet was transferred to another post in the Commission hierarchy."
"We hope that he will see that he should resign when the mandate of the current Commission finishes, since he has never passed a Commission competition at all."
"It is a byword throughout the Union that it is difficult to get into jobs unless you are well connected."
"We must do all that we can to make that byword not merely false, but seen to be false."
"Mr President, Mr Bösch has drawn up an excellent report and we thank him for it, as we do Mrs Hautala, representing the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"In fact, we must thank all those involved in this matter."
"We thank the Ombudsman for his initiative, his determination to achieve transparency and his extreme attention to relations between citizens and the European administration."
"Congratulations also to the European Commission, which, after some hesitation, cooperated fully with the Ombudsman and responded to his demands, especially to the recommendation that is the subject of this report."
"We thought it legitimate for candidates to have access to their marked test papers, since access to documents is a fundamental right and one that is also recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights we adopted this week."
"In the same way, we find it entirely justified for candidates to be able to take the examination questions home with them after the test."
"The recruitment procedures must be transparent to avoid all abuse; that is obvious."
"Yet, we feel that a certain flexibility is required."
"We must not introduce more rigidity into provisions that may apply to institutions as different as the Commission and the Court of Justice."
"Nor do I think we should further burden some procedures with cumbersome provisions that are disproportionate to the real risks of dispute."
"I am referring here to an amendment on the need to provide indisputable proof relating, for instance, to oral test procedures."
"Our group was very satisfied with the vote in the Committee on Petitions."
"The rapporteur proposed new amendments in plenary session."
"We studied them and we can accept three of them, which are in line with the way we voted in committee."
"We think the others are difficult to implement, or even rather out of context."
"In conclusion, I would say that we welcome the fact that the European Commission followed the Ombudsman' s recommendations."
"This dialogue between the mediator and the Commission proves that the latter wants to follow a policy of transparency and good administration."
"That resolve will encourage a rapprochement between the institutions and the European citizens. It also shows very clearly how useful and effective the Ombudsman is."
"Mr President, the job of the European Ombudsman was established in the Maastricht Treaty at the same time as the concept of citizenship of the Union was introduced."
"The Ombudsman looks after the public interest in the direction of the administration."
"The Ombudsman, Jacob Söderman, works, by virtue of his job description, for the people and in order for good administration to take root in the Union."
"We all know that there is still much to do."
"It is, however, vitally important to adopt good, open and effective administrative practice, so that the European Union will gain the support and confidence of its citizens more satisfactorily than it does at present."
"The Ombudsman' s report discussed this time regards the secrecy attached to the Commission' s recruitment procedure."
"The report contains recommendations that the Commission has already begun to implement."
"The rapporteur, Herbert Bösch, from the Committee on Petitions, states in the explanatory statement in his report that the principles that led to the Ombudsman' s recommendations proved to be the same as those adhered to by the European Parliament: correctness, transparency and the desire to create confidence."
"And that is how it should be."
"Parliament is a body elected directly by the people."
"Its job is legislation and to monitor the Union' s bureaucratic machine on behalf of the public."
"Parliament and the Ombudsman must therefore work for the same causes."
"The report by the Committee on Petitions states that the Committee approves the special report being discussed and, in particular, the point which states the desire to improve the impression the public gets of the institutions from our competitions procedures."
"The most important of Mr Söderman' s proposals is the right of applicants to have access to their corrected examination papers afterwards."
"The Committee says that the Commission has informed the Ombudsman it was implementing this recommendation as from the start of July 2000."
"In addition, the report urges all the institutions and bodies of the European Communities to allow applicants to have access to their corrected examination papers in future recruitment competitions, if they so request."
"My colleague, Mr Bösch, has already briefly presented here the amendments to the report he tabled."
"I hope they will be supported in Parliament."
"Mr President, if the European Union is to have any future it needs the supports of its citizens and this can only be achieved if people trust the Union and its institutions."
"As things stand, the institutions are too often experienced as remote and bureaucratic - something which has had negative repercussions for Parliament as shown, for instance, in the low turnout in the last elections."
"Taking part in competitions for jobs in the European Union is for many people their first close-up experience of the European institutions."
"Any doubts concerning the fairness of the competitions must therefore be taken seriously."
"The fact that these competitions have been surrounded by suspicions of irregularities and favouritism in the media has been quite damaging to the public perception of the institutions."
"Having good staff and officials is obviously in itself essential for well-functioning institutions and this can only be assured if the recruitment procedure is impartial and as objective as possible."
"Transparency in the procedure, with due respect for the independence of the boards, is central in this regard."
"Allowing the candidates to see their marked tests is a simple means of increasing transparency and confidence in the procedure for the recruitment of European civil servants."
"The Ombudsman's initiative and recommendations can therefore be warmly welcomed, as can the decision by the Commission to follow them."
"The example should be followed by all other institutions and bodies, as the Committee on Petitions has recommended."
"It is vital to the construction and administration of a multinational community such as the EU that there should be no suspicions whatever of discrimination between candidates for posts in the administration, whether on national or other grounds."
"I therefore thank the Ombudsman for his report, which I fully support."
"I also thank the Commission for having agreed to follow the Ombudsman's recommendation to allow the candidates access to their marked tests in future competitions."
"I call for all other institutions to follow this example."
"Mr President, the Members of the Bonino List firmly support the Bösch report and, since I do not suffer from the ideological prejudices which often characterise the behaviour of certain elements of the Socialist Group towards us, I would like to thank the Group for the amendments which it has tabled."
"They are extremely clear, concise, pragmatic amendments which represent genuine reform, that is, the only reform worthy of the name which the European institutions ought to adopt on the recruitment procedure."
"However, between the fine words and noble principles expressed by the European Ombudsman and practice, things are not always so cut and dried."
"When I tabled two questions to the Commission on the management and organisation of the last internal competition, I received clear, detailed replies."
"These replies revealed a clear case of maladministration, if not abuse of authority, by the Director-General for Personnel and Administration, and the second reply implicated Commissioner Kinnock."
"I notified the Ombudsman of this, who, in his reply, said that he had decided not to open an inquiry because the competition was already far advanced."
"Unfortunately, I did not - and still do not - possess those paranormal capacities which make it possible to predict the future."
"Not only that: Article 2(4) of the European Parliament Decision on the Regulations and the General Conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties stipulates that the Ombudsman must be notified within two years of the date on which the petitioner becomes aware of the grounds for the accusation."
"Insofar as my duty and my political responsibilities are concerned, the Ombudsman's decision is a routine defence of the Commission. This is not the mandate that Parliament conferred upon Mr Söderman."
"Mr President, before I begin may I also recommend that while they are replacing the wiring they could paint all the black walls white or some other colour."
"May I begin by congratulating Mr Bösch on an excellent report and also congratulate the European Ombudsman on the work he is doing."
"I know that, though this was before my day, there was concern in the House about whether to have an Ombudsman at all, because it would then seem like a conflict of interests."
"But history has shown that this is not the case and that an Ombudsman does work very hard to protect the interests of our constituents and becomes a point of access for legitimising complaints and finding out what has gone wrong."
"I had the privilege of serving on the select committee on the Ombudsman in the House of Commons and that was a very powerful committee."
"We could summon anyone in the country before the Ombudsman committee, and the select committee procedure which I will discuss in two minutes is something that we could learn from."
"Citizens of the European Union should receive a positive impression when encountering the Community institutions."
"The question is, has this been achieved?"
"I fear that the short answer is: ""no""."
"I congratulate the Commission on accepting the four recommendations made in the special report on the Ombudsman."
"Access to official documents by citizens of the Union is a hallmark of a responsible and fully functioning democracy."
"The fact that applicants for Community institution jobs should see their marked scripts shows that institutions are confident in the way they run their application and selection procedures."
"It is a hallmark of a confident democracy if the processes by which selection is made is done openly and without any recourse to confidentiality or secrecy."
"In the select committees of the House of Commons we had the power to introduce a regime of monitoring of every level of the executive, not only the ministers in the same way we monitor the Commission sometimes in terms of them coming here and answering questions, but a two-hour session with the particular minister with officials in attendance where the elected Members could ask questions and be prepared to ask questions in detail and to get detailed answers."
"This is the beginning of opening up the process of government and making it transparent."
"In our resolution we talk about transparent government and we should start to implement it in the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate both the rapporteur and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"However, congratulations must, of course, go first and foremost to Mr Södermann; he has been highly receptive to numerous complaints from European citizens about maladministration in the Commission recruitment procedure and has drafted an own-initiative report in order to solve the problem."
"I am delighted that the Commission has accepted many of the Ombudsman's suggestions."
"However, I think there is still one lacuna: it refuses to design a system of integrated principles with clear guidelines which would result in completely objective recruitment competitions."
"This is the only way to limit arbitrariness and the resultant complaints - well-founded or not, that we do not know - about competitions with pre-determined results."
"Technical problems, however difficult, cannot obstruct the political objective of transparency."
"If they could, there would be no point in even discussing transparency."
"The President of the Commission himself has repeatedly assured us that transparency in the administration of European affairs is an absolute priority."
"I do not believe, when he said this, that he was unaware of the difficulties in achieving this objective."
"Allow me to finish by saying that the Commission has a obligation to comply with the recommendations of the European Ombudsman and to design a full system of objective examinations for two reasons: first, because it is legally obliged to do so under Article 255 of the Treaty, as revised by the Treaty of Amsterdam introducing the principle of transparency."
"This is why we are calling on the Council to work with the Commission and issue the relevant directive."
"And secondly, because, from a purely political point of view, its credibility depends on it."
"Unlike the Member States, with their long history, the European Union has only a short past, which is why it must create the expectation of something new."
"And the something new in this case is that it must apply best practices and avoid anything which experience tells us will damage its credibility within the Member States."
"The European Union needs to give a greater impression of reliability than the Member States, which have different ties with their citizens, such as ties of common descent; the European Union's main link is the respect which the citizens of Europe expect of it."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Bösch on his report, to which the Commission accords a favourable response."
"A number of the requests contained in this have already been put into effect."
"For example, candidates are already allowed to take the examination questions away with them, the general evaluation criteria can be made known to those candidates who request them, the list of passes can be published in the Official Journal and the composition of the selection board may be published in the Official Journal (in the case of general public entrance examinations) or on the Commission' s web site (in the case of internal or restricted examinations)."
"The Commission endeavours to be as objective as possible, and I should like to make two comments on a couple of questions which have arisen in the debate."
"Firstly, the corrections to the examinations set by the Commission are always made anonymously."
"No one knows who the candidates are, since they are identified by secret codes rather than by their names."
"Secondly, and where languages are concerned, the examinations take place, and are marked in, the national languages, and the tests are not converted from one language to another before they are marked."
"The aim, therefore, is to have the maximum amount of precautions and guarantees to ensure that the examinations take place in the form which is fairest and most acceptable to everyone."
"Certainly, the point which created most interest today in the debate on Mr Bösch' s report concerned what happens regarding candidates' access to their marked examination scripts."
"President Prodi has already made due reference to this subject."
"I can now confirm something which has already appeared in the White Paper on reform of the Commission, specifically in action 29 which is about improving transparency in a way which benefits candidates and in which it is stated that 'Finally, pursuant to the European Ombudsman' s recommendation, the Commission will allow candidates access to their corrected tests in all competitions launched after July 2002' ."
"Why July 2002, some of you are asking."
"Well, precisely because of this same concern with transparency and knowledge of the procedures that you have expressed and also because a number of administrative steps will first have to be taken if there is to be access to corrected examination scripts. What form is this correcting of examination papers to take?"
"Who is qualified to carry it out? How and to whom is this type of procedure to be presented?"
"The Commission' s commitment regarding this matter is absolute and we hope that, as soon as these measures have been implemented, they will be applied generally."
"Finally, the Commission can obviously make a commitment on its own behalf."
"With regard to other institutions, it is they themselves who will decide whether the procedures proposed in this report or in the requests by the Ombudsman are adopted."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"That was a very satisfactory finish to a very satisfactory debate."
"Mr President, this is not a question - clearly the matter does not fall within Commissioner Solbes' remit - but I take note of the statement that the examination scripts will be available as of July 2002."
"Some months ago now, President Prodi declared that this option would be available for all competitions as of July 2000."
"What does this mean?"
"That the famous reform has been postponed for two years?"
"No, Mr Turco, it means one or other of the following: either I made a mistake in reading out the text - obviously I was talking about 2000 - or else the interpreters made a mistake in translating it for me."
"Obviously, I was talking about July 2000."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"In his speech Mr Deva drew attention to the fact that in this House we are not very good at interrogating."
"This was very obvious last night during Council Question Time."
"The session actually finished early and yet Council questions have, it seems to me, become nothing other than an exercise in patronising evasion."
"The impossibility of having more than one supplementary for a Member adds to this."
"There is no sense of interrogation of the Council at all."
"I should like to suggest that the Bureau at some time look into the question of whether a Member who limits a first supplementary to under half a minute is allowed a second question."
"That is out of place at the close of this debate but maybe you would like to write to the Vice-President responsible for reforms to see if that can be incorporated in one way or another."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.12 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, the French version of the Minutes for yesterday' s sitting state, on page 14, that we were to come back this morning to my request to postpone the voting on the Villiers report."
"I think the time has now come to do so."
"I proposed that we vote on the Villiers report in Brussels in November, because there are a number of rather sensitive amendments that I should not like to see voted in by random majorities."
"That is something we shall discuss presently."
"For the moment our business is to adopt the Minutes."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"VOTE"
"Once again, Mr President, yesterday I requested that the vote on Mrs Villiers' report be postponed."
"It is a very important report which deserves better than to be discussed in an almost empty Chamber."
"I do regret the fact that some Members see fit to avoid turning up to the Friday sitting in Strasbourg, but since it does happen, if we go ahead and vote today, the outcome is likely to be based on the will of a random majority, which does no credit to this House either."
"The procedure requires us to hear the opinion of the Members of the House on this proposal."
"We shall hear one speaker for the motion and one against."
"Mr President, I would like to speak in favour of Mr Goebbels' proposal."
"I leave this matter to the House."
"It is for you to decide whether you would like to postpone or not."
"Fridays in Strasbourg are a difficult issue for us, but today because of the sensitivity of the report - it raises issues about the general procedure of the House and our general relationship with the Commission - I personally think it would be better if the groups had an opportunity to vote when there were more Members present."
"I am sorry that there are not more Members present this morning."
"I would not ask this if I did not think that this was an important report which requires the attendance of more Members because we are taking important decisions."
"I know that Fridays are a sensitive issue, so I leave it to the House."
"But I personally would appeal to you to vote to postpone the vote on this report."
"Now that we have heard from the rapporteur, we shall have one speaker in support of the motion, and one against."
"Mr President, I came into politics in the hope of persuading people by argument and occasionally winning votes."
"One way to win a vote is to turn up when your opponents do not."
"If they are prevented by some unavoidable catastrophe that is a breach of democracy, but if they do not bother coming, they do not deserve the vote."
"It is not the House that disenfranchises these voters, it is the Members who are not here."
"Mr President, this is an issue of principle."
"Nor did Mrs Villiers agree this with our group."
"I nonetheless agree with Mrs Villiers that this is an important report."
"But, important though it is, it can still be voted upon on a Friday morning."
"There is now just one more Friday sitting to come, namely in December."
"I was against doing away with the Friday sittings."
"However, that is something people have to sort out for themselves."
"As long as we are in fact here in Strasbourg on Fridays, though, it is a full working day."
"(Applause)"
"I would ask the whole of the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, as well as Mrs Villiers, to vote against postponement to the November II part-session."
"That has not been agreed with my group."
"Nor is it in order."
"I would therefore ask that we vote here and now."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Poettering, we had already had one speaker against the motion and I had no way of knowing, when I gave you the floor, what your position was going to be."
"Is there no other speaker in favour of this motion to postpone the vote?"
"If not, we shall proceed to vote on the proposal."
"(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0293/2000) by Mrs Almeida Garrett, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the modification of Parliament' s decision of 9 March 1994 on the regulations governing performance of the Ombudsman' s duties"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0280/2000) by Mr Bösch, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the special report from the European Ombudsman to the European Parliament following the own-initiative inquiry into the secrecy which forms part of the Commission' s recruitment procedures (C5-0082/2000 - 2000/2048(COS))"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTES- Villiers Report (A5-0282/2000)"
"Mr President, I am afraid that I arrived too late to vote, and so I do not feel that I have the right to give an explanation of vote."
"Mr Fatuzzo, your scrupulous respect for the procedure of the House does you great credit."
". (IT) I voted for the Villiers report on the own funds of banks, for it is imperative for Directive 89/299/EEC, which regulated the matter a good 11 years ago, to be updated and supplemented."
"I endorse the criteria of greater prudence adopted, but other aspects of the matter must also be taken into consideration, particularly the solvency ratio, which is a weighting factor according to the type of counter-party used to estimate the credit risk associated with a bank's assets."
"In Italy, this is currently fixed at 8% - 7% for banking groups - of the weighted risk assets, for both cash and off-balance-sheet items."
"What is totally unacceptable is for the supervisory authority - the Banca d'Italia - to have the power to establish a higher minimum requirement under certain conditions."
"You do not change the rules during the game but before it starts."
"I therefore agree that there should be a higher weighting coefficient - 10% for example - but it must be totally fixed in all cases and all circumstances."
"Therefore, Article 53 (d) of Legislative Decree No 385/93, which deals with precisely this point, must be revoked, as all the Members States' laws which provide for changes a posteriori must be revoked."
"- (DE) In assessing the Directive on the own funds of banks, a number of conflicting interests have to be carefully weighed against each other."
"Those in favour of the directive can legitimately demand that their interests be protected, and mediation is required if a fair regulations are to be devised."
"It is, in the first place, savers who could profit from harmonised EU-wide regulation because their investments would be protected against losses in accordance with identical criteria."
"On the other side of the argument are the SMEs, which fear that regulation would make it difficult for them to raise credit because they would not be able to compete with the guarantees which large companies are able to provide."
"As a result, there might be job losses in SMEs."
"A second conflict of interests arises from the fact that, on the one hand, a fairly long transitional period is required in order to provide as many banks as possible, especially smaller institutions, with the opportunity to implement the necessary new regulations in their internal operations."
"On the other hand, a delay in implementing the regulations favours American banks, which profit from the current set of regulations and are able to undercut European banks in Europe."
"We must not allow our companies to be disadvantaged in this way, but without playing large European companies, powerful as they are, off against smaller ones, to the detriment of the latter."
"We support the demand for a solution to be found to the conflict between the United States and the EU, produced by the discriminatory Gramm-Leach-Bliley legislation."
"All in all, it may be said that the demand for European harmonisation is legitimate and that the latter would bring benefits to all sides in terms of security and fairness. However, no one side ought, in the process, to be afforded an advantage at the expense of the others."
"Provisional establishment of the European Police College (EPC)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0316/2000) Mr Posselt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Portuguese Republic with a view to adopting a Council Decision on the provisional establishment of the European Police College (EPC)."
"Mr President, we have spoken today about the importance and unimportance of reports."
"I believe this is an important report, and I am therefore proud and happy that it is to be debated and voted upon on a Friday, for Friday is a working day like any other."
"I am of the view that, as a European Parliament, we can also be proud of the fact that we have got the idea of a European Police College under way."
"As you know, the idea came about in 1995 at a professional convention in Deggendorf in Lower Bavaria and was unanimously adopted in 1998 by this Parliament in the context of a report on internal security and eastward enlargement."
"At the time, we were concerned with the important matter, which we are finding ever more pressing, of not only having to get the applicant countries ready economically for accession but also of having to ensure, above all, that the framework conditions in terms of democracy, constitutionality and administration were right."
"On reading the latest progress reports, we note that there has been a considerable improvement in the way in which the legislation has been transposed. However, the way in which the legislation is applied in the applicant countries is still problematic because it is huge task, after decades of dictatorship, to construct new police forces, new systems of justice and new public prosecution authorities."
"In the report we produced at that time, we said that, in those countries which had found their way to democracy through their own efforts, we wanted, after decades of police States, to see the training of police who did not only genuinely accept the standards of European democracy but were also prepared to act in partnership."
"That is how the idea of a European Police College for the Member States of the European Union and for the applicant countries arose."
"This idea of Parliament's was then adopted at the Tampere Summit, and I am very grateful to the Council for adopting this project, originated by Parliament, as its own."
"I am especially grateful to Commissioner Vitorino who has shown his vigorous commitment to a European Police College, something which also finds expression in the fact that the Portuguese government, which thinks along similar lines to himself, has thankfully seized this initiative."
"In accordance with the will of the Council and of that of this Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the European Police College is to become a reality as early as next year, more precisely as part of a network of national police training institutes with a joint remit, joint leadership and joint training programmes."
"However, we want this only to be a first step and we want an actual Police College to be set up within no more than two or three years."
"In this context, I should like to refer to a valuable comment by the French Presidency of the Council which said that we need a common, actually existing Police College of this kind in order to create a European culture of police training."
"Joint training of this kind is urgently needed when it comes to protecting external borders and combating cross-border crime and also when it comes to applying human rights standards in the European Union."
"It also has very wide support from police trade unions and professional associations."
"They know that, in the border area between the current EU and the applicant countries, such as in Eastern Bavaria, a great many towns have already asked for such a Police College."
"I am of the view, however, that it is still too early to make a decision on the matter."
"Naturally, that would be the best place for it to be located."
"It is now firstly a question, however, of actually creating this Police College, and all political forces are together helping to achieve this goal."
"I would thank the Bavarian and German ministers of the interior, as well as former Austrian Minister of the Interior Schlögel, who together made this possible back in Tampere."
"I believe this is a one-off opportunity to create a Europe in practical terms, namely a constitutional Europe that does not just exist in some documents or other but finds expression on an everyday basis. As the European Parliament, we can be proud that this is one of our own ideas and initiatives, which is to become a reality in just a few months' time."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Posselt, on the excellent work he has carried out on this initiative for the provisional creation of the European Police College."
"This is a cause to which he has demonstrated his ongoing and productive commitment."
"We have before us a very useful instrument which will allow us not only to optimise police cooperation between Member States but also to improve cooperation with candidate countries and with Norway and Iceland."
"This police cooperation is crucial if we are to achieve the very important objective of affording European citizens a high degree of security within the European area of freedom, security and justice."
"The intention of the Portuguese Presidency in presenting this initiative, following the Tampere conclusions and in order to meet the deadlines laid down in the 'scoreboard' , was to initiate the preliminary stage of the European Police College by creating a network of the national institutes already existent in each Member State in order to improve the training of senior police officers."
"In so doing, we are beginning to train the next generation of police officers to work and operate throughout Europe; in other words, we will be preparing them to implement Community law and joint and Community actions."
"This will be a kind of virtual police academy, whose task will be to improve mutual familiarity with the Member States' national police systems and structures, to increase familiarity with international instruments and to optimise cooperation and coordination between the College and the other European multinational police training institutes."
"We have no doubt that it will be easier to reach consensus at this first stage."
"The transition to the second stage, that is, the institutional and physical creation of the future European Police College, is bound to raise some problems."
"We know that there are still a number of Member States that support the creation of the College only as a permanent network of national institutes, but we feel that the majority will accept this proposal as a temporary stage that will make it possible to create a tangible institution within a maximum of three years."
"This is also the proposal that the Commission supports, which has been so vigorously advocated by Commissioner Vitorino."
"This is also the position advocated by the rapporteur, and it is shared by the European People' s Party."
"The rapporteur goes even further, proposing that the deadline should be brought forward to two years; as soon as the proposed objectives can be achieved, it would certainly be in the common interest to be able to relax the deadlines in order to give substance to the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for being present here today for the debate on two, in my view, important reports from the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"As regards the report by Mr Posselt, who has done some sterling work, it is a fact that judicial and police cooperation is new territory for the European Union and that every proposal that comes up for discussion marks progress."
"The Tampere conclusions clearly expressed the need to set up a European Police College."
"I believe that the amendments adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs have enriched the proposal put forward by the Portuguese Presidency."
"For example, we believe that police training should not be confined to cross-border police cooperation and to combating crime, but should cover other areas of policy, such as human rights, the provision of services to citizens, the use of new technologies, non-repressive law enforcement, crime prevention methods, respect for the rule of law, and knowledge of the political and socio-economic developments in the European Union."
"In all these areas, the police college can play an important role by promoting more effective practices and up-to-date methods, either in the form of a network coordinating national training establishments, or as an actual college with a permanent seat."
"Naturally priority should be given to the countries with which the European Union is conducting accession negotiations. The enlargement of the European Union, which will extend the space in which citizens are free to move, should be accompanied by supplementary measures ensuring safety and peaceful co-existence among the Member States."
"The candidate countries must not delay their full integration in the third pillar of justice and home affairs. To this end, they must establish specific frameworks for cooperation between the European Police College and the police forces in their own countries."
"I would like to stress that the European Parliament has an exclusively advisory role in all this."
"But the establishment of new European infrastructures will necessarily impact on the lives of its citizens, especially in relation to matters of policing."
"That is why I would like to call on the Council, which I believe is absent today, to carefully study the amendments we have tabled and to pay serious attention to the opinion of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like the previous speakers, I hope that this initiative will not be seen as the umpteenth European organisation, but that people will take this initiative seriously and, as a consequence, will give it enough of a chance."
"I just have a few reservations with regard to the name."
"The term 'police academy' makes me think of a humorous American TV series about the police."
"What is more, I find the word 'academy' is not assertive enough when it comes to police operations."
"That is just a minor detail, of course."
"I think that it is more important to confine ourselves to the essentials."
"Social conditions in most Member States of the European Union are now such that there is indeed a great need for cross-border cooperation between the various police forces."
"Cross-border cooperation can only lead to results if a number of conditions are met, if the greatest care is taken over appropriate, goal-directed programmes for ongoing training, if attention is paid to training regarding the Member States' response to crisis situations in third countries and if exchanges and secondments are made possible in a professional way, with the emphasis on the professional aspect."
"Special attention must also be paid to training at European level with regard to crime prevention, maintenance of public order and efficient border control."
"On the other hand, a European Police College needs to become the forum for gaining an understanding of the various national police systems and defending the knowledge they have."
"In short, I hope that there will be no delay in giving concrete expression to this initiative which, to my mind and also in my Group's opinion, answers the need to bring about a European training structure."
"Mr President, if there is one thing I have learnt about constituency problems since I was elected to the House, it is how very variable throughout Europe is the interpretation of Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to brief detention before trial and the right to a speedy trial, the right to be released pending trial if the trial cannot proceed speedily."
"These rights are very differently interpreted in different parts of the Union."
"I come from a country in which the maximum period of detention allowed by law is 110 days."
"After 110 days of detention a person, if not tried, must be released and never tried for that offence again."
"From what I see, conditions in French and Portuguese jails are very different."
"People can be kept for enormously long periods of time awaiting trial."
"We do not really have a common culture in Europe on these important points."
"This connects exactly to our culture of policing."
"Do we have a culture of policing in which the idea is to detain people as briefly as necessary, find the evidence as quickly and expeditiously as possible and get trials moving forward, or do we have a system where people do it as it suits them best?"
"If we could develop a common culture of policing in Europe, and if it were based on best practice, then that would be a fine thing."
"But, as I have said in another debate this week, the danger is that we develop a kind of general casualness, we have moved to the lowest common denominator, not the highest common factor."
"Let us make sure that if we have a police college it is, as Mr Posselt's report stresses, grounded in the need to develop and enhance respect for human and civil rights in our police culture."
"Police efficiency is not just to do with grabbing guys and putting them inside."
"It is to do with finding the people who actually commit crimes and proving the case against them in a civilised way, with a proper connection between prosecution services and police services."
"If we can get a police college for the whole of Europe to do that or begin to develop this kind of common culture that would be a very good thing."
"The majority of those who have spoken so far seem to think that it is vital to have a single permanent seat for the college."
"I see the need for a permanent seat for its administration but I want Members of the House to think seriously about whether, in the interest of a common police culture in Europe, it would be better to take everybody to one place or to have courses which move year-by-year or subject-by-subject to different police colleges and academies in different parts of the Union."
"That way, people begin to appreciate differences of local assumption, differences of local approach."
"We hope that over time our police forces will genuinely learn from each other and learn best practice from each other, not worst practice."
"If that could be done we would have a police academy of which we, as Europeans, might be proud."
"I hope that will be the result of this excellent proposal and this excellent report."
"Mr President, in itself there is nothing to object to in the basic idea of creating a European Police College, whether it exists in virtual reality or is established with a permanent seat somewhere."
"The questions arise, however, of what this College is for and of what tasks and objectives it has."
"To take just one point, Mr Posselt writes of 'providing training sessions for senior national police officers on the basis of common standards'."
"That is when things already begin to get difficult."
"What are these common standards?"
"As you know, Mr Posselt, police duties in the Federal Republic of Germany are a matter for the individual Länder, which are absolutely sovereign in this area."
"Now, compare the various Länder' s laws on police duties."
"You will see that, in Brandenburg (unlike in Berlin), de-escalation is the supreme precept when it comes to deploying police and that, under Brandenburg law, any police who are to be deployed are obliged to be identified by name so that anyone who might be attacked in a demonstration can read the name of the policeman concerned and know who it was."
"In other words, if you want common standards, you have to start by defining these. Otherwise, you end up with training that may be completely different in form from area to area."
"A College along these lines is not really needed just for the purpose of exchanging different types of experience."
"You speak about establishing public order."
"All right, that is accepted."
"Again, the only question is, with what resources?"
"In the Federal Republic of Germany, even public order is defined completely differently in the various Länder' s laws relating to police duties."
"What do you understand to mean by public order?"
"You write in your report about border control services."
"I ask you!"
"We make a perfectly clear distinction between duties relating to the protection of Federal borders and the duties of the police. (In other States, it is different.)"
"If you write in those terms, then before what you say can be approved, it must first be clear what common activities are planned and according to what standards one is going to proceed."
"As long as such matters have not been clarified, I have to say to you in all honesty that I myself cannot consent to the basic idea."
"Mr President, this is a film which we have already seen once and which we did not enjoy."
"Yet another interim but not so short-term decision, another little present to Parliament from the Council."
"Just as Europol grew out of the ""Drugs"" unit, so the seed of judicial cooperation will produce Eurojust and maybe a European prosecution service."
"We can therefore safely say that a lightweight and currently practically non-existent structure such as the European Police College will give rise to yet another bureaucratic structure, almost as if it were in the genetic code of the European Union to entwine policies in red tape."
"It is clear, blindingly obvious and even banal to state that it is necessary to fight organised crime operating at transnational level with transnational policies, just as it goes without saying that national police forces need to be trained in order to be better equipped to tackle the cultural, legal and linguistic crime issues raised by both European integration and the integration of criminal organisations."
"Nevertheless, we do not feel that this makes it necessary to create a new structure."
"The underlying reasons for establishing a police college - reasons which we endorse - could have been better and more effectively achieved by encouraging existing national academies to develop training courses, exchanges, MA courses and specialisations to fill the gap which does, in effect, exist."
"Having said this, the fact remains that Mr Posselt's work is, in our opinion, excellent."
"On the other hand, we fail to understand the position of the Socialist Members."
"Mrs Karamanou has just stated that she welcomes the fact that Parliament will have an advisory role, and yet, only the other day, the Group of the Party of European Socialists voted against a motion on the grounds that the Europol Management Board was to include Members of Parliament with the right to vote."
"However, Mr Posselt's work has resulted in provision at last being made for police training to include human rights and the right of defence, and the proposal is also important and appropriate at the moment to create a virtual police college which would take advantage of the potential offered by the Internet."
"In general, instead of taking advantage of the new economy to develop a new policy of employment structures and organisation, the European Union is still trying to work and organise itself according to last century's criteria."
"We will vote for the amendments but against the legislative resolution."
"Mr President, according to the Council decision on the establishment of the European police college, the aim of the EPC is to help train senior law enforcement officers of the Member States."
"I note that the rapporteur wants to change ""law enforcement officers"" to ""police"", which is probably a good idea."
"But what also caught my eye is that this training is aimed at supporting and developing a European approach in the field of crime-fighting and protecting internal security."
"The rapporteur wishes to see added crime prevention, provision of services, innovation and border surveillance and also wants internal security modified to include maintaining law and order."
"The problem I have with these statements is that I am not quite sure what the European approach to maintaining law and order, etc, actually involves."
"It is not specified in either the Council decision or the rapporteur's report."
"All I can say, from a strictly British perspective, is that if this means that continental practices are to become de rigeur throughout Europe, our own police force will be taking an unhealthy interest in armoured cars, water cannon, tear-gas launchers and dinky little pistols which they can swing from their already over-laden belts."
"This apart, it is something of a surprise to find that there is even such a thing as a European approach to crime fighting."
"I am absolutely certain that it will come as a rude shock to most of the British population that internal security is an area where there is any room for involvement of the European Union."
"It will probably come as an even greater shock for them to learn that the European Parliament wants the European police college to be responsible for training police forces and border control forces - that is to say customs and excise - in order to prepare them for the use of Community law and the implementation of common and Community measures."
"There it is: Community law and common and Community measures."
"The cat is out of the bag."
"Clear as day we can see the ambition of the EU naked in tooth and claw; a common approach - the European approach - to fighting crime and internal security; one people, one law and one police force."
"I am sure that the European Union will be far more subtle than this."
"Our police force will retain their uniforms, right down to the comforting woolly pullies that they have taken to wearing. The ranks will be the same and the local badges will be untouched."
"From all the outward signs the facade will be unchanged but, under the expert tutelage of the European college, they will be working to a different agenda: a European agenda, applying Community law and Community measures."
"That is such a far cry from the Common Market which the United Kingdom joined in 1973."
"No-one in the UK would ever have believed a soothsayer from that period who warned that it would all end up in Dixon of Dock Green whistling ""Ode to Joy"" and working out how to apply the European approach to policing down at the nick."
"But here we are in Strasbourg in a near-deserted Chamber hearing that which is almost unbelievable."
"Our own Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, his Foreign Secretary, Mr Cook and other British ministers may deny that a superstate is on its way, but when I hear proposals for our own police forces to be trained in a European approach to crime fighting and internal security, it is obvious that the writing is on the wall."
"As you can probably gather, I will not be supporting this report."
"Mr President, listening to the last speaker, I have not heard mention of the common market in almost 20 years in this House."
"If he reads the records of some of the representatives from his own Member State, the United Kingdom, in those days they were extreme left-wing socialists who forecast everything which seems to scare him with the same hysterical sort of attitude to European Union."
"They forecast all the things which seem to frighten him today."
"Coming from a different part of the political spectrum, it is very interesting to hear him repeat, with the same hysteria, the same concerns."
"Their capital in those days was Moscow or Budapest."
"Those were the ideals that they proposed to us and that was the sort of state that they worked for."
"However, I am glad to say that attitudes in the Labour party in Britain have changed."
"I want to thank Mr Posselt for his report."
"The work we do on a Friday morning in Parliament has the same legitimacy as the work we do on a Monday or any other day."
"Indeed it was commented that on Wednesday evening when the Commissioner spoke about BSE, somebody drew attention to the fact that there were only 17 people in the House."
"There are a lot more people here this morning and I will regret the passing of Friday when we can carry on a real debate and respond to each other and take the time to listen to each other."
"Parliament and democracy in Europe will be the poorer for the shortening of the Strasbourg week."
"Having said that, I welcome this proposal."
"Parliament can be proud that the proposal to set up this academy originated here, and we are grateful to the Portuguese presidency for taking it up and the Commission and Council for their support."
"It is a good idea and in the European Union where people have freedom of movement, freedom of trade and the right of establishment, where travellers from Scotland can go to Sicily or Greece, it is only logical to expect to develop a common system of maintaining the rule of law."
"That common approach is not there at the moment."
"I come from a state where the police developed out of a chaotic situation - a civil war."
"But the people at that time established, very wisely, an unarmed police force that is very socially engaged with the communities in which they live and work."
"You might call them a soft police force but they did succeed in healing the wounds of a civil war and in bringing credibility to the idea of law and order."
"When I come to continental Europe I am a bit surprised at the way police distance themselves and adopt what appears to be a harder attitude."
"I will welcome a levelling-out of standards in some Member States in the European Union."
"All of us have experienced abuses in our own countries."
"I hope that this academy will help us to have a better understanding of the whole system."
"Mr President, there are powerful criminals who think that there are no laws which apply to them and who take advantage of everyone."
"Ever since border controls within the European Union disappeared, they also no longer take any notice of state boundaries."
"Cross-border crime requires a cross-border approach."
"Because everyone agrees about that, closer cooperation between the police from the different Member States and their regions has already been worked on for years."
"Three days ago, following publication of the Marinho, Karamanou and Roure reports, I pointed to the dangers attached to this."
"An enlarged and centralised police force, disconnected from its surroundings, will look for its own priorities."
"The idea of a European Police College is based on the assumption that there is agreement on the tasks and modus operandi of the police."
"We see that the police in one country react totally differently to the same situation than the police in another country."
"In the Netherlands, the police are trained in the de-escalation of conflicts and in repressive tolerance whereby the existence of subcultures and ethnic minorities, the organisation of political protest and the use of churches as ports of refuge for illegal immigrants are seen as normal social phenomena."
"I am under the impression that, in some other countries, violence is still used as a method of winning prestige, on behalf of the government, in combating everything that can cause unrest."
"This week, the contribution made by President De Gaulle to establishing peace in Algeria was held up by Mr Posselt as a model for the role which Mr Kostunica will have to play in order to solve the Kosovo problem."
"He also cited the situation in which Hitler could claim that he could exterminate the Jews without being punished because, after all, nobody remembered the mass murder of the Armenians any more."
"At such moments, I can agree with Mr Posselt to a very large extent."
"On the other hand, we shall probably remain permanently in disagreement about the vision for the police."
"I would prefer a small-scale, trained and organised police force, constantly driven by signals from the society within which it must function."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of the European Police College is, in the Commission' s opinion, a dossier of major importance for the European Union, both in terms of cooperation in the field of Justice and Home Affairs and with the prospect of enlargement of the Union."
"From the first discussions on this dossier, which were held at European level at the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission has given a commitment to the Member States to pursue a course of action designed to develop what we might call a European police culture, grounded in the highest standards of duty, respect for the rights and freedoms of our citizens and efficiency in the fight against crime."
"The Commission welcomes the rapid progress made both by the Portuguese Presidency, which launched this initiative, and by the French Presidency, which intends to adopt it by the end of the year."
"I therefore feel that the efforts made by us all will have made it possible to effectively create the European Police College just one year after the decision taken by the Tampere European Council."
"I should also like to congratulate and thank the European Parliament' s Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and particularly its rapporteur, Mr Posselt, not only for his personal commitment but also for the excellent study that he has produced and for the way in which he has pushed for the creation of the European Police College."
"With regard to the future of the College, the Commission is - as I am sure you will be aware - of the opinion that Conclusion No 47 of the Tampere European Council laid down, extremely clearly, that the network-style functioning of the College, which is already causing it also to be called a 'virtual' Academy, will be only the first stage."
"Like the European Parliament, the Commission feels that it would be desirable for a formula to be adopted within a practical and clearly defined timescale, ensuring greater continuity of training action or even its development beyond the senior police officers."
"I also wish to make it clear, however, that what we are talking about here is not the creation of a European police force."
"We are talking about the need to exchange experience and information, to exchange best practices in crime fighting in order to make respect for citizens' rights and the fight against transnational crime more effective."
"Above all, I wish to emphasise that, as someone who has always advocated the idea of community policing, which is the method employed in the United Kingdom, I would welcome the fact that this British idea is finding ever more support in a range of countries in so-called ""continental Europe"" ."
"Whoever believes that the solutions that they advocate are good should not have anything to fear from exposure to other people' s solutions."
"The Commission feels that the transition from a virtual police academy or police staff college to a police academy as an institution is not only justified from the point of view of the operational ability of the current Member States' police forces. It is also justified from the point of view of being able, as early as possible, to systematically include the police forces of the candidate countries in a training strategy."
"I consider this to be an extremely important priority, not only for the candidate countries but also to ensure that the guarantees that we have to provide for our citizens that enlargement will be accompanied by safeguards for the security of Member States."
"I should like to assure Parliament that the Commission is willing to continue to cooperate, both with regard to creating the Academy and to ensuring its smooth operation."
"I have noted Mr Posselt' s proposal that, in 2003, the Commission could draw up a report on the College' s future, on the basis of a study produced by its management board."
"The Commission is prepared to undertake this task if that is what is decided."
"Nevertheless, I do not think that this is the idea that Council currently has in mind."
"The Council wishes the Police College to develop primarily with an intergovernmental approach."
"Our priority is to see actions in the field of training launched as quickly as possible."
"The fact that the Commission is not playing a central role in this process, however, does not mean that we will not be paying close attention to the process, doing all that we can to ensure that it is a success, and I am convinced that this project will help to improve security in the area of freedom, security and justice, since freedom and justice can only exist in an environment of genuine security."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTES"
"Mr President, in connection with the European Police College, I would point out that what is particularly important is to combat crime in the cities."
"As MEPs, we ourselves are very often concerned by crime."
"I hope that, in this area, the College will provide a starting point for the future."
"The establishment of the European Police College is one more step towards the creation of a police state at a European level, which the ruling class believes is necessary to protect its interests from the demands of ordinary people."
"Combating crime is simply a pretext."
"The establishment of the European Police College is in keeping with the decision taken by the Feira Council to create a mobile 'expeditionary' force of repression with police, judicial and correctional powers, which the European Union will use for 'non-military crisis management' anywhere on the planet."
"It is especially important to stress that the European Police College, which is expected to start its operations on 1 January 2001, is not simply a network of the national training institutes of the Member States of the European Union; it also involves the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Indeed, for greater effectiveness its permanent seat will be close to the border between the current European Union and the applicant countries."
"For these reasons, the Members of the European Parliament from the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report."
". (FR) Following on from the special Council meeting in Tampere, the Portuguese Presidency tabled an initiative in June this year with a view to adopting a Council Decision on establishing a European Police College."
"We find the objectives of the proposal are excellent: to establish training programmes for senior officials and staff in the police forces of Member States, but also applicant countries, in all crime-fighting areas necessitating cross-border cooperation."
"We also think the method adopted for this initiative is perfectly appropriate: we are not going to set up a new European structure liable to be rather divorced from reality at the national level, but rather to create a College in the form of a network made up of the existing national training institutes for senior police officers."
"Each national unit would accommodate one section of the European Police College."
"In this way, the College would not be based in any one place, but would be present everywhere."
"Its governing board would be made up of all the directors of the national institutes, who would therefore have the benefit of full knowledge of the facts when determining their requirements."
"This arrangement would guarantee the College' s remaining permanently close to grass-roots developments, avoiding any divergence between the approach of the college and that of the national technical experts to actual problems."
"Moreover, it would be flexible in its organisation, offering great potential for development, with the possibility of training programmes being held at the best qualified national institute for each aspect."
"This is a good illustration of what we are starting to call 'Network Europe' , a Europe which puts nations in contact with each other directly, without the need to maintain pointless superstructures."
"Unfortunately, this instrument, which we find perfectly satisfactory, does not seem to appeal greatly to the European Parliament."
"The amendments tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are pushing in the opposite direction, emphasising that this is a temporary structure, that the time period for revision must be short, and that a permanent headquarters must be found for the organisation."
"At this rate, there is a great danger that, in a few years' time, we will find ourselves with a new costly superstructure that thinks itself superior to the national services, that does not cooperate well with them and ends up not being efficient enough."
"According to what I have been told, this is the route that Europol is going to go down if we do not soon take steps to change its course."
"In our opinion, the most effective way of working, for the European Police College, as for most of the other areas of cooperation, especially in the police, justice and security sector, is to establish networks between the existing national services."
"- (SV) I have voted against the report on the provisional establishment of the European Police College."
"In the EU, there is an obvious risk of believing, in area after area, that cooperation is advanced simply through establishing new institutions and authorities."
"I also object to the fact that the text of recital 7 in the report goes above and beyond the Portuguese Republic's text in demanding one special seat for the Police College instead of cooperation on a rota basis."
"The fact that police powers are proposed in a number of recitals under the directive, together with the fact that common curricula are proposed, I see as moves towards centralisation, with the risk of bad practice getting the better of good practice."
"Rights of access to children"
"The next item is the report (A5-0311/2000) by Mrs Banotti, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Council Regulation on the mutual enforcement of judgements on rights of access to children (9735/2000 - C5-0397/2000 - 2000/0818(CNS))."
"Mr President, for over six years I have had the honour of being the special mediator for the European Parliament for transnationally abducted children."
"This role was first developed by President Plumb, following a request from many women in France whose children had been abducted and with whom they were no longer in contact. They were seeking Parliament's help."
"Since then, many other people have also sought the help of the European Parliament when their children have been abducted."
"I have worked on these issues for over six years and, very much thanks to the help and resources of the European Parliament, have had several significant successes in recovering children who have been abducted."
"Most of the cases of child abduction are actually handled very efficiently and appropriately by the central authorities in all Member States."
"Unfortunately, I generally find myself dealing with the more complex cases."
"At the heart of this regulation, which has been essentially rushed through during the French presidency, is the question of access to children by non-custodial parents."
"It has already been dubbed ""the Brussels 3"" issue, not so much a directive as a regulation."
"As such, it has the limitations of the Brussels 2 Convention, but also some of its strengths."
"It refers exclusively to children of couples who have married."
"It refers to children under the age of 16."
"It is also a directive whose scope has been described as both modest and pragmatic - and indeed it is a modest little regulation."
"The precise scope of it would cover parents, living in a different Member State from where the guardianship judgment was made, who were looking for visiting rights."
"It would allow the child to be brought to another Member State for a limited period in order for the visiting right to be exercised."
"Crucial to its operation would be the principle that a judgment made on visiting rights in one Member State is recognised throughout the EU."
"An exception to this principle would be if the guardian parent proves that, due to new circumstances, the visit would endanger the physical and moral health of the child."
"Undoubtedly, this regulation will work in tandem with the Hague Convention on the transnational abduction of children."
"It does not seek to impose on other Member States the existing law of one Member State; it is simply an attempt at mutual enforcement of these custody orders."
"There are constitutional concerns in some Member States, notably Germany and Austria."
"There is concern that the applicant parent can apply for access to the child, with only eight days for the other parent to respond to the request."
"Undoubtedly, many of our courts are very slow and ponderous, and there is great difficulty in getting them to act quickly on these issues."
"There is also concern about the forcible return of a child."
"My belief is that the existence of good law, applicable in all Member States, has had a significant effect in reducing the number of abductions of children."
"Hopefully, this is what this regulation will ensure between Member States."
"Unfortunately, it does not apply outside the European Union, and there are fears that it will cut across the Hague Convention."
"But the Council of Ministers will discuss this, and I recommend its acceptance to the House."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Banotti on both her excellent report and the efforts she has made over recent years in the cause of defending and guaranteeing the fundamental rights of children, specifically in her capacity as European Parliament mediator on issues concerning the international abduction of children, a task in which she has invested her widely-acknowledged qualities and sensitivity."
"The French initiative warrants a favourable welcome."
"It is part of the gradual development of judicial cooperation in civil matters and its communitisation."
"It is a proposal for a regulation that seeks to make exercising rights of access and accommodation for the children of separated parents easier, in an attempt to prevent children becoming a kind of hostage in the dispute between parents who are resident in different Member States."
"In these cases, situations unfortunately often occur that correspond to the cycle of love, hate and the desire for revenge of one or both of the parents."
"Hence the need for speed in order to protect the well-being of the children and, sometimes, their very safety."
"In a Europe in which its citizens are able to move around freely, regardless of their State of origin, one can easily understand the ease with which family ties are established between people of different nationalities or who are resident in different countries."
"It is also understandable that lawsuits arise, specifically divorces and the regulation of parental power, which could lead to problems with regard to the exercise of rights of access when the child lives in another country, as in cases of abduction, particularly when the child is not returned by the parent who holds rights of access within the specified time."
"This regulation establishes the principle of mutual recognition of judgments for rights of access to children without any intermediary steps and limits the possibilities for seeking the suspension of the enforcement of such judgments."
"In this way, the regulation responds to the need for a direct application of uniform rules on such important issues as the regulation of parental power and the exercise of visiting rights."
"We are thereby improving Community spirit and European citizenship."
"It is nevertheless a matter for regret that the scope of this regulation is limited, since it does not cover the families of unmarried couples, in which there are children born outside of marriage, whose rights will not, as a result, be recognised and enforced under Community law."
"Now, this is a very common situation in our states."
"According to the latest statistics produced by Eurostat, in 1998, 26% of all births in the Union took place outside marriage and these numbers are continuing to increase."
"It is therefore crucial that this loophole must be plugged for reasons of fairness, of realism given the way society is changing and for the sake of equal rights and obligations for all of the European Union' s citizens."
"I wish to say in conclusion that I support the amendment proposed by the rapporteur in Article 1, in which it must be specified that the period of access should not be less than one day."
"In particular, we must take account of the fact that situations sometimes occur in which the parent comes from the other side of the Union, travelling thousands of kilometres, and so it is pointless to do this for a visit limited to one hour."
"This is ridiculous."
"Maintaining relations with both parents is an essential part of the child's upbringing and the development of his or her personality."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to congratulate both the French Republic on its initiative to adopt a regulation to guarantee the right of personal contact between parents and their children and our rapporteur, Mrs Banotti, whose expertise added considerable value to the French proposal."
"A Europe without borders has most certainly contributed to an increase in the number of marriages between couples with different nationalities from both the E.U. and third countries."
"But when such marriages break down, there are often problems of ensuring personal contact between children and one of the parents, especially when the children reside in another Member State. And, as previous speakers have already pointed out, there has also been an increase in the number of cases of abduction with the child not being returned by one of the parents."
"That is why this regulation, which seeks to simplify the enforcement of rights of the parents with the aim of ensuring that children are able to maintain regular contact with both parents, is of major significance."
"The regulation which has been put forward is by no means perfect as it is linked to the Brussels II Regulation, which does not cover children whose parents are living apart and children of unmarried parents."
"Mr Coelho gave some very pertinent statistics and, personally, I think it is an unacceptable anachronism that, in the Europe of the twenty-first century, we legislate simply with regard to conventionally legitimate children and institutionalised human relations and that we significantly limit the scope of a regulation which is good in all other respects."
"I believe that there is a need for an immediate review of all regulations based on standards which have been overtaken by life and by contemporary reality."
"It is also necessary to take the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union more seriously into account when hammering out regulations and to give more serious consideration to the repeatedly expressed views and positions of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, my group wishes to join in the support for this initiative and for Mrs Banotti's report and indeed to join in the tributes to Mrs Banotti for the enormously valuable work she does as our mediator for transnationally abducted children."
"There is no doubt that split families are among the most harrowing things we hear of in our working life: mothers or fathers worried about access to children across national boundaries."
"Whatever we can do to alleviate these situations, we ought to do and this regulation brought forward on a French initiative is the way forward."
"I agree with Mrs Karamanou and others that it is a great pity, given the way we live now, that it only covers the children of people who happen to be, or have been, married to each other."
"That is a task for the future."
"Meantime, we welcome this measure and we will vote heartily for it."
"Mr President, these days divorce is no longer the exception."
"Often, couples go their separate ways in a civilised manner."
"They find it unpleasant to continue sharing each other's lives, but they do not start hating their ex-partner."
"Unfortunately, others separate on the basis of accumulated hatred."
"Parents who separate on that basis are a disaster for their children who become victims of that insoluble conflict."
"One parent wants the absolute power of decision over the children in order to exclude the other parent forever."
"Everyone is familiar with the awful situation in which the parent to whom custody of the child is awarded, often the mother, tries to make contact with the other parent impossible."
"We also recognise the equally terrible situation in which the other parent, often the father, abducts the child and makes him or her untraceable."
"Children remember that sort of occurrence for their whole lives."
"My mother lived through such a separation and abduction 85 years ago, and she still talks about it."
"Mrs Banotti has tried to make creative use of all the possibilities for securing effective arrangements for parental access on a cross-border basis too."
"She is trying to preclude all situations in which parents can misuse the existence of different rules of law in the Member States of the European Union in order to delay or prevent effective arrangements for parental access."
"A part of her solution involves drastically curtailing the right to call in a judge in order to overturn a foreign court order."
"That regulation will only work if both parents are nationals of an EU country or are resident within the European Union and if their relationship was confirmed by a legal marriage."
"Only a part of the problem will be solved, but a precedent will be created."
"If we also start applying something similar to other situations, we are undertaking in the future to have centralised unitary legislation such as does not even exist between the 50 States of the United States."
"That is why I see drawbacks. But I have many more objections to tackling legal weaknesses and setting precedents in ways that leave social problems permanently unsolved."
"Because we support the goal that has been set, we are voting for the proposed measures."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to congratulate Mrs Banotti on her excellent report, which is part of thorough, ongoing work on protecting and guaranteeing children' s rights."
"As the House knows, the Commission and the Council have the firm intention of adopting a programme of mutual recognition of judgments in civil matters by the end of the year."
"Priority was specifically given in this programme to family disputes, as laid down by the Tampere European Council."
"The French government' s initiative is the first practical step towards this. I should like to emphasise that, although this report and this subject are being discussed on a Friday morning, I hope that the media, which so often says that European debates have nothing to do with the everyday lives of our citizens, understands that, on this occasion, with this subject, we are addressing an issue that affects not only the life but also the hearts of Europe' s citizens."
"In May, we adopted a regulation incorporating the Brussels II Convention into Community law. This regulation simplifies and clarifies rules on defining the competent court and the relevant law for regulating divorces, separations and the allocation of parental control."
"This French initiative therefore refers to the scope of the Brussels II Regulation and is, if I may put it this way, a revolutionary initiative. I say this because, for the first time, it enshrines the abolition of the exequatur for the automatic recognition of a judgment by a court in a Member State by the legal system of another Member State."
"While it is true, however, that it is a great step forward from this point of view, I also share the opinion of Mrs Banotti and other honourable Members that it is deplorable that the scope of this regulation should be limited to the protection of children of marriages that are recognised as such by the law."
"This fact is bound by the scope of the Brussels II legislation itself."
"What I therefore wish to tell Parliament is that, in the action programme on the mutual recognition of judgments in civil matters - which we hope will be adopted by the end of this year - the Commission proposes that the first and utmost priority should be given to extending the scope of the Brussels II regulation and, consequently, of this regulation on rights of access, covering both the children of married couples and those of unmarried couples without discrimination."
"With regard to the content of the document - as you know, this is not a Commission initiative - I should simply like to make three observations."
"The first is that we are working together with the Council in order to improve the text, specifically with regard to its most complex issue, which is the delicate balance between the need to guarantee that the child will be returned immediately after the visit, and also the need to safeguard the possibility of guaranteeing protection of the child whenever this should prove necessary."
"We are addressing a tragic issue here, that of the abduction or improper withholding of children, which is, unfortunately, much more common than we might think."
"It is difficult to find this balance, but we are convinced that it will be possible, with the help of your amendments and with the climate of dialogue that exists with the Council, to reach a solution that is both technically flawless and, above all, workable."
"With regard to the amendments, I wish to emphasise that the Commission has some difficulties with Amendment No 1, tabled by Mrs Banotti, because this is not merely a procedural amendment, but an amendment that takes us into the field of the harmonisation of substantive family law, establishing a lower limit of one day for the exercising of rights of access."
"I am sure that the intention behind this amendment is valid, but it could have harmful effects if we consider that courts will only grant rights of access when they feel that this must be for a whole day."
"There are solutions in which the courts grant rights of access for a period of less than a day for reasons to do with the protection of the child itself."
"I feel that we should lay down an indicative criterion but not a legal obligation, trusting judges who are called on to apply the law to be reasonable enough to guarantee that the rights of access they grant are effective."
"I should also like to say that although this is not the subject of a direct amendment by Mrs Banotti, the Commission has difficulties with the amendment to Article 17 of the regulation proposed by the French Government. We have difficulties with this because we feel that this article places too much emphasis on the purely intergovernmental origins of judicial cooperation."
"Therefore, the functioning of the committee that Article 17 is challenging should not be purely intergovernmental. The Commission should play a more active role, as it does with regard to the European judicial network in civil matters, an issue which has, in fact, been submitted for the opinion of the European Parliament."
"I shall conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by saying that I am convinced that, with the adoption of this regulation that has a limited range but which is of symbolic value and important practical application, I am convinced, I repeat, that we are taking an initial, important step towards bringing the European Union closer to the citizens, particularly those citizens who, because of the circumstances of their lives, have had the misfortune to experience the tragedy of separation or divorce, which is always a tragedy, but which should certainly not have repercussions for every child' s right to happiness."
"Mr President, I do not doubt for one minute Commissioner Vitorino's commitment to this issue."
"The point about the one day clearly refers to people who often travel right across the world to see a child."
"There is a problem in a situation like that, if they are only allowed twenty minutes access to the child."
"I think if there is a fear of abduction this can be handled by having supervised visitation."
"I feel very strongly that we have to in some way ensure that the rights of these parents, of whom there are quite a lot, are respected."
"Could I ask for clarification on your point about Article 17."
"Are you referring in that situation to the involvement of the Secretariat of The Hague Convention in the monitoring of this legislation?"
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your kind remarks."
"Mr President, in an explanation of vote earlier this week, I said that ""Mother Europe"" was taking care of us."
"Now Mother Europe has a name: Mrs Mary Banotti."
"I did not give an explanation of vote on the previous report, Mr Posselt's report, because, with all the will in the world, I did not dream of Mr Posselt last night but of Mrs Banotti, and I was enjoying it so much that I slept deeply, so deeply that I arrived late this morning."
"Effectively, in my opinion, with this document tabled by Mrs Banotti we are doing the very best that is possible for our children and grandchildren."
"Specific nature of sport"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the special position of sport."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission' s position on the relationship between the legal system, Community policies and sport is laid out in the report on safeguarding existing sporting structures and maintaining the social function of sport within the Community, that the Commission presented at the Helsinki European Council in December 1999."
"The Commission feels that the Treaty establishing the European Community that is currently in force enables account to be taken of the specific nature of sport in general and of its social function in particular."
"The European Parliament' s statements on this matter and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, confirm the validity of the approach adopted by the Commission."
"It is nevertheless true that the enormous dynamic of the Single Market and the increasing commercialisation of sporting activities have caused a number of legal conflicts in this field."
"Certain sports organisations claim that these conflicts can only be resolved by the inclusion of a reference to sport in the Treaty."
"The Commission does not fully share this view."
"With regard to the proposals submitted by the major federations for certain sports, which are in support of a protocol that would exempt them from complying with some of the Treaty' s basic rules, specifically those relating to free movement and to competition, it must be emphasised that this kind of exemption would, if we accept this definition of it, clearly be out of step with all of the objectives we are seeking to achieve."
"Furthermore, there are serious doubts as to whether such an exemption could even be effectively put into practice."
"Sport these days - and this needs to be said - is closely bound up with other economic sectors, such as the audiovisual sector or the sector of the promotion and sale of sporting products, for example."
"What is more, such an exemption would, at worst, not even allow Community actions for the promotion of sport."
"Other equally important sports organisations, however, such as the national Olympic committees, for example, or national sports federations, have specifically insisted on the need to develop Community actions for the promotion of sport."
"In any event, since the adoption of its opinion on the content of the current Intergovernmental Conference, the Commission has advocated that the Conference should focus on addressing institutional issues, which will enable it to take the process of enlargement forwards."
"This is why the Commission did not include in its opinion any request for new rules on Community competence, for example in the field of sport."
"In order to further highlight the specific nature of sport and even to provide guidance for the Community institutions on how to deal with sports-related issues, at the behest of the French Presidency, a draft declaration for the Nice European Council is now being prepared which would complement the conclusions of the Santa Maria da Feira European Council on this subject."
"The Commission hopes that such a declaration appended to the Nice Treaty will make it possible to take the work that has been started with sports bodies further, enabling them to adapt to the new economic climate but at the same time preserving the fundamental nature of their activities."
"As this Parliament stressed in the Mennea report on the report for the Helsinki Council, this would be carried out in full respect of the Community' s legislative framework."
"It is in this spirit, Mr President, that the Commission will continue the intense dialogue that it has maintained over the last few months with the sports movement as a whole."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that the Commission has a difficult task in ensuring that the rules of the single market and competition policy operate fairly and properly across the continent and all sectors of the economy."
"I recognise their commitment and determination to do that and, of course, that sport and especially football are big business and cannot expect to be exempt from the normal rules of business."
"I am far from convinced that the football transfer system should be at the top of the Commission's hit list at the present time."
"It would be very prudent for the Commission to allow plenty of time for this, to allow it to go into extra time, not just so that we get a result but that we get a good result, a result that would be good for the single market and good for football."
"I know that FIFA have played for time already and has waited far too long before coming up with any response to the Commission's formal statement issued back in 1998."
"In many respects they have only themselves to blame for the present situation."
"However, let us not forget that football is of crucial interest to millions of our citizens."
"As a famous English footballer, Jackie Charlton, said, it is not just a matter of life and death; it is more important than that."
"The EU must not shrug its shoulders and say ""tant pis"" if banning the transfer system does irreparable harm to football."
"Many small clubs depend on the revenue stream that comes from transfer fees."
"The transfer fee is not just a wealth distributor, it is a wealth retainer."
"If transfers go, then what is to stop the upward spiral of footballers' wages?"
"The manufacturers of Alfa Romeos may do very well, but that money will be lost to football."
"I certainly agree with the Commission that there is no need to have a mention of sport in the Treaty."
"What we need is an intelligent and flexible way of interpreting the present rules."
"I urge the Commission to negotiate positively with the national and international football authorities."
"I suggest that the Commission give much higher priority to other abuses of the single market for instance, the parallel import of designer goods."
"I would like to see much more effective moves to create a single market for newspapers and journals across Europe."
"The car industry too is still full of obstacles to trade."
"I suggest to the Commission it puts those at the top of its list and does not allow football to become an own goal for the European Union."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to send my best regards to Commissioner Viviane Reding and thank her for the initiative she has shown in the field of sport."
"I am also really very glad that Commissioner Vitorino delivered this speech on the special features of sport."
"Although, unfortunately, sport still does not have a legal basis in the European Union, it has many special features that must be taken into account in the work of the Union."
"This is the direction it has been going in since Amsterdam."
"Sport affects all the citizens of Europe, in one way or another."
"It has been estimated that a hundred million people take an active interest in it in the European Union."
"Sport has many important social, cultural and, besides, very significant economic dimensions."
"It is a very positive sign that the Union' s sports ministers would like a statement made at the Nice Summit that would act as an extension to the Helsinki report that came out a little under a year ago."
"As the purpose is to determine those ways in which matters of sport can be taken into account in community legislation, we may speak of gradual progress made in this important area."
"The agenda before us is totally acceptable."
"Special attention must be paid to the system of player transfers and the protection of young sportsmen and women, the role of national sports federations, club ownership, television rights, sport' s civic work and ethical principles."
"As we shape the EU' s policy on sports, we have to take account of sport' s different structures."
"For that reason, I hope that non-governmental sporting organisations will continue to be heard after the Olympics meeting in 1999."
"At the same time we have to remember that, although many questions that require us to take a stand are connected with the professional and commercial aspects of sport, sport and exercise have a wider significance than this with regard to individuals and society."
"We have to pay attention, for example, to young people' s opportunities to take up exercise as well as issues of gender equality."
"The European Parliament has often expressed its concern with regard to drugs and called for more effective action to counter their use."
"It is gratifying, therefore, that the Community' s extent of involvement in WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) and in its financing is now being clarified."
"This issue was discussed by Coreper on Wednesday."
"It is only natural that the member of the Commission responsible for sports should represent the Union in WADA in the future."
"Mr President, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Commission already has competence in the area of sport, especially regarding the implementation of legislation on competitions."
"However, the Commission has been grossly ineffective in this matter."
"F1 events and, in particular, Mr Ecclestone' s work to preserve the monopoly in the field, have been looked into for years now, but no results have been forthcoming."
"This is a matter of the most obvious monopoly, that of television rights, which a certain contract has ensured will continue for a hundred years."
"Instead of the Commission adopting a position on this, many Commission members are mannequins for Mr Ecclestone and the motor race teams and thus contribute to establishing and upholding this monopoly."
"I wish, before the Commission is granted new powers in this area, it would use those it already has."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is happening in sport in the European Union, in particular in professional sport and, more specifically, in football, is the consequence of having a law without a policy, of having a law that no one really had any choice about."
"In other words, to put it plainly, it is the consequence of an attack on democracy, however hard we try to avoid seeing it in this light."
"Most of the problems that we have experienced and that have leapt into the centre of the debate, particularly following the Bosman ruling, even when they are neither directly nor indirectly connected to the content or the nature of that case, result from the frequent and sometimes glaring contradiction between on the one hand, specific types of sporting bodies and their deeply ingrained practices, and on the other, certain rules contained in the Treaties, specifically competition rules or other principles of the internal market, particularly the free movement of workers and rules of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality."
"Many of these rules are amongst the oldest in the Treaties, from the Treaty of Rome onwards, despite the amendments that they have undergone."
"We all know, however, that when they were originally defined, or even when amendments were added at a later date, no one, but no one, not even those drafting them or those who took the decisions, thought for a moment that a current legal framework would hang this truly imperial weight around the neck of the sporting world."
"I was talking about the economy and just the economy, in the strictest sense of the word."
"Not throughout society, because in all sectors we can see windows of economic opportunity."
"This is what I mean when I talk about a law without a policy."
"A law which was drawn up without participation, this absurd law that nobody really wanted to be like this but which has been inexcusably foisted onto everyone."
"This is why it is crucial that the Treaties recognise the specific nature of sport."
"Otherwise, no problem will find a satisfactory solution. Otherwise, we will continue to stand by helplessly in this situation in which it seems that the European Union and lucre are working hand in hand to put an end to sport, to distort the profound nature of sporting competition itself, to sabotage the social roots of clubs and the national fabric of its traditional organisation."
"Otherwise, sport will continue to be regularly trampled upon with inexplicable legal violence by the corrosive and destructive effects of rules that were not designed for this purpose and about which in truth no one really had any choice or could vote on to any degree."
"We are not seeking to meddle with fundamental rules or basic principles of Community law in the Treaties."
"What we want is to be able to construct in a politically free and carefully considered way a balance which is appropriate to the specific needs of a sector which, although it is of primarily cultural value and enormous social relevance, also has other, economic, facets."
"We need to be able to protect the sporting authenticity of sport itself and its social function from the exclusive control of the laws of the market."
"I repeat: we need to protect sport, not to abandon it."
"Why should we allow the basic fabric of training within the rich tapestry of sports clubs and associations to be abused?"
"Why are we unable or unwilling to allow safeguards for a minimum of national identity in the professional teams that represent clubs?"
"In sport, even in professional sport, the competition that really counts is the sporting competition itself, not just the unbridled economic competition of its agents."
"Furthermore, in European sport, there is not, nor should there be a true single market."
"What we have are fifteen national markets which are all different and which mirror the competitive situations in each country. This is even more true if we look at the specific case of the United Kingdom, which, together with other, equally European countries which happen to be outside the European Union, makes up the basic pool for long-established European competitions."
"Now, however, what is happening is completely the opposite."
"The growing inequality in wealth lays down the law and increasingly decides who wins all the trophies. The corruption of the authenticity of long-standing tradition has cemented the tendency and the pressures of the power of money, aided kindly by a poorly understood Community legal framework, to destroy everything that is of real cultural value and impose a single market of closed leagues and a money-obsessed spirit."
"I shall end with a reminder of one of the conclusions of the resolution that we voted for in September following the Mennea report: ""The European Parliament invites the Intergovernmental Conference to include an explicit reference to sport in Article 151 of the Treaty, so that the European Union will, in its actions, acknowledge the cultural, economic and social phenomenon that sport represents"" ."
"Perhaps we are still in time."
"I appeal to the forthcoming IGC not to be another wasted opportunity for sport."
"In particular, I urge the French Government not to reject at Nice the words and guarantees that President Chirac gave us here in July."
"That concludes this item."
"UK decision to impose a levy on non-British hauliers"
"The next item is a Commission statement on the decision by the British Government to levy a tax on non-British hauliers."
"Mr President, the Commission is aware of the package of measures in the road transport sector that the UK Government announced on 8 November in response to the recent oil price increases."
"One of the plans announced is the introduction of some form of road user charge such as a vignette payable by all road hauliers, British and non-British alike, for their use of the road network in the UK."
"Provided that the details of its implementation respect the relevant rules, such a measure seems to be in line with current Community law which aims at the elimination of distortion of competition through the establishment of fair mechanisms for charging infrastructure costs to hauliers and at harmonisation of levy systems within the European Union."
"In fact, the EU directive governing this field, which was adopted unanimously in 1993, laid down the conditions under which Member States could, if they wanted, apply user charges or motorway tolls."
"Accordingly, six Member States, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden introduced a common user charge system often called the euro-vignette while Austria continued to apply its own user charge system and France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece maintained their already existing motorway toll system."
"This means that by 1995 12 out of the 15 Member States had adjusted their levy systems with more emphasis on direct charging and less on taxes."
"The Commission considers that such adjustments go in the right direction towards the establishment of fairer charging systems which also give an incentive for a more rational and efficient use of road networks."
"The measures announced by the UK signal such a readjustment of its charging system."
"However, the whole package of measures announced also includes other elements such as a reduction in the fuel taxes, similar to measures recently announced by other Member States."
"All these measures are presently the subject of an examination by the Commission responsible under the EU Treaty for ensuring the consistency and coordination of national activities within the common transport policy."
"The Commission is therefore expecting to receive shortly a reply to its request for detailed information on the measures planned by the UK government."
"The Commission will then have to investigate, as it does in the case of all other Member States, whether or not such measures are likely to distort intra-Community competition."
"Depending on the outcome of this analysis, the Commission will decide on the next course of action in fulfilling its role of assisting Member States in taking the measures which are right for them and while respecting the rights of others."
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his explanation and for the fact that he came in to talk on this subject this morning."
"What he said is news to me because my understanding was that the proposal was a special tax on all foreign vehicles, which we assumed was all non-UK vehicles using the roads of the United Kingdom."
"I see this as a political gesture rather than as a political or fiscal measure."
"My understanding is that costs in the UK, taking into account the new proposals, without this particular charge are on a par with the rest of the European Union and on a similar level to French transport costs."
"Even if the Commission says that a country may introduce that charge and put the same charge on its own vehicles, I still regard it as a distortion of the single market because presumably British hauliers will apply for their tax disc and every charge will be included in the single payment that they will make."
"Other users of British roads will be required to pay a special tax at the border on entry into the United Kingdom."
"No matter what the Commission thinks, this is a distortion of the single market and a distortion of free trade."
"This proposal is particularly hard and vexatious for Ireland."
"Ireland, is obviously a very small but open market, yet most of what we buy comes from the United Kingdom."
"We buy GBP 11,000 million worth of goods from Britain annually as against only GBP 7,000 million from the rest of the European Union."
"That shows the extent to which Irish industry and commerce favour the British market, although with the current strength of the pound sterling, this situation will not be maintained if the value of the currency does not change."
"At the moment every Irish citizen buys EUR 5,000 of goods from Britain."
"I believe that this measure is certainly contrary to free trade even with the improvement that has been mentioned by the Commission."
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his statement and the facts that he confirmed."
"It may be advantageous at this moment just to say what has actually been proposed by the UK government and also what they are proposing, bearing in mind the crisis in Britain and indeed throughout the whole of the European Union with regard to the road haulage industry."
"It must be said at the outset that this is not just a specific British problem."
"The proposal was put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a pre-budget statement made six months before the full budget statement made in the spring of 2001."
"It contained a number of proposals, not just specifically this one on the vignette, which will effect the haulage industry."
"I can assure my Irish colleagues that the vignette proposal is being made in full cognisance of the euro-vignette directive and is likely to be along similar lines to those already in place, as Commissioner Vitorino explained, in many of the present Member States of the European Union."
"It is worth pointing out that at the moment lorries from the United Kingdom are faced with vignette or toll charges on roads in other EU Member States but so far such levies have not been charged within the United Kingdom."
"I am sure that the United Kingdom government will be responding to the Commission's request in discussions with the Commission as well as the haulage industry to explore ways in which the vignette scheme can operate within the present euro-vignette directive."
"The details of our scheme have yet to be put in place."
"I understand Mr McCartin's concerns, but it seems to me that a lot of what is being said about the UK system is based not on fact but on rumour and things that are being said in the industry rather than things that have been proposed by the UK government."
"I know that the UK government want to consult with hauliers and I also know that the UK government recognises the specific position of Ireland and I am sure that it will be talking to its counterparts in Dublin as well as in Belfast."
"What we need to get clear today is that the UK is proposing what it is doing in full recognition that it must consult the European Union and in full recognition that there is EU legislation in place that it must abide by."
"It also recognises that if it charges the euro-vignette system then it will also have to charge similar amounts to its own UK hauliers."
"It recognises that whatever scheme it brings in must be non-discriminatory."
"In conclusion, we are being premature in the European Parliament in holding this debate, but I welcome the fact and the statement from Commissioner Vitorino which clearly indicates that the UK government has the right to introduce a euro-vignette system provided it keeps within the rules and regulations already in place."
"I believe that is what the UK government wishes."
"Mr President, with great respect I have to disagree with Mr Simpson."
"I do not take this debate as premature at all."
"When an important proposal of this kind comes forward we, in this House, should have the chance to think about it and discuss it as early as possible, not necessarily for the last time."
"Like him, however, I was very grateful to the Commissioner for the extremely clear statement of the conditions in which charges of this kind would be lawful under Community law and of the real possibility that what we are facing here is not just a dodge to get out of an awkward corner, but a proposal that will fulfil Community law."
"Again, I thought that what Mr Simpson said was extremely helpful in reassuring us about the probable intentions of the UK government."
"I would also like to respond to Mr McCartin's remarks."
"British trade is important to Ireland but it is true the other way round as well."
"For example, the economy of south west Scotland around Stranraer and Loch Ryan is heavily dependent on the traffic which comes across the north channel, the shortest crossing between the UK and Ireland."
"Our people depend very heavily on that trade."
"I would like to say that it would be disgraceful if we were to introduce a vignette which is supposed to support the infrastructure but do not then use it to improve the infrastructure."
"The condition of the road leading from south west Scotland into the main motorway network, the A75, is disgraceful at the moment."
"This might give us an opportunity at last to see a real and sustained improvement of the transport facilities which connect our two economies."
"I very much hope that will be one result of this."
"Mr President, taxes and tolls are obviously sensitive matters, and I can confirm this specifically on behalf of Austria where we are always having this discussion and where, of course, good traffic solutions are constantly being sought."
"The Commission has already submitted an excellent Green Paper concerning fair prices on the roads, and an important principle of this Green Paper is that there should be no cross-subsidising of road hauliers and that, above all, the money collected from particular roads should be used to solve the problems on these same roads."
"The Commission has also quite clearly ascertained that the greatest problem on the roads at present is accidents."
"Safe and well constructed roads are an important and basic prerequisite for preventing accidents."
"At present in Europe, we have approximately 50 000 deaths on the road each year."
"Very many people die not least because of poor and badly signposted roads with poor visibility on which people drive with a bad mental attitude, and it costs our social systems a very great deal of money to deal with the resulting damage to people' s well-being."
"Precautionary measures are therefore required in this area."
"We should see to it that people are safe on the roads and, in the interests of the environment in particular, we must ensure that congestion is prevented."
"Not only is a lot of time lost and high costs incurred through congestion, but it is quite a major problem for the environment in particular, and I therefore believe that, if the British government is actually investing money in solving the problems, then we all have something to gain, particularly all European citizens."
"Mr President, may I first of all raise the issue of why this subject is on the agenda?"
"I was in this House on Monday night when the agenda was agreed by this body."
"The item was not agreed for the agenda."
"Later on, when one of our colleagues, Mrs Doyle, raised the issue, all of a sudden the President decided that this issue should go on to the agenda."
"That is not a democratic and fair way of drawing up this House's agenda."
"This House draws up the agenda, not the President at the whim of one Member."
"I also notice that Mrs Doyle is not here today to take part in this."
"That said, I will go on to talk about the subject in question."
"It is time we had a debate on the subject."
"I listened to Mr McCartin earlier and it is evident he has got the wrong end of the stick."
"This is not discriminating against every other driver or road haulier in Europe to the benefit of British drivers."
"This applies to all road hauliers, whether they come from the UK or any other country."
"That should be made quite clear."
"Also, the details are yet to be fully worked out but I was quite heartened to hear the statement from the Commissioner about how it is going to be proposed and developed."
"I am sure the British government will be in discussion with the Commission in applying this vignette."
"I should also like to pick up on a point raised by Mr MacCormick."
"He talked about the trade between Ireland and Scotland, the south west of Scotland, coming over to Stranraer and Loch Ryan."
"He said that he hoped the money raised by this vignette would go towards improving the infrastructure around the south west of Scotland."
"I know the south west of Scotland is part of my area and yes, the infrastructure there is not the best, it can be improved."
"But can I point out to Mr MacCormick that this vignette is for the whole of the UK."
"It is to improve the road structure throughout the whole of the UK."
"We cannot take one small area of the UK and say that is where it is going."
"It is for the whole of the UK."
"That is a point we should be making quite clearly."
"On the first point you made, Mr Miller, this proposal was put to the House by the President and it was the House which agreed to the change to today's agenda."
"Mr President, like a number of Members in the chamber this morning I come from rip-off Britain."
"We are more or less the only oil producers in the European Union and yet we face the highest petrol prices, the highest diesel prices of any country in Europe - GBP 1.20 a litre for diesel is paid in the United Kingdom."
"Vehicle excise duties are eight times the French level in the UK, so one should not be too surprised that in Britain there is a great deal of concern."
"As a British driver, when I go on French motorways I must pay French tolls."
"I might say that by the time I have arrived at Calais, having driven from Strasbourg, I feel I own the French motorway system, so expensive are those tolls."
"I drove in Austria in the summer and paid the Austrian vignette which seemed to me to be perfectly fair and reasonable and a much more agreeable price than one pays on French motorways."
"My objection to this proposal is not that it is unfair."
"At long last the British government has come up with a reasonable solution."
"We in my party proposed it two years ago."
"The present British government has allowed the situation to get out of hand and it is rather late in the day for them to come up with this proposal which will probably take another two years to come into effect."
"If they do bring it into effect, we want to see them really pass the benefits on to the British road-users."
"Mr President, now we have vignettes dotted all over Europe and tolls in some other countries, would you agree with me that the euro-vignette system is not a very good single market system."
"The local haulier in Denmark or in the UK will get his full money's worth 365 days a year, but the foreign haulier from another Member State entering that country - maybe for one or two days or ten days or even 100 days - will not."
"He is paying over the odds for his vignette unless there is some special dispensation on a per diem basis."
"Would it not be better now that we have arrived at this stage to think of maybe having a mutual recognition system, so that a vignette in one country is recognised in other countries, giving a real euro-vignette system works?"
"The Commission should consider coming forward with proposals in order to provide for a common system throughout Europe."
"I would like to turn now to my friend Mr McCartin."
"I agree that Irish trucks have a special case."
"They are compelled by geography to pass through the UK just as British trucks are compelled to pass through the Netherlands, Belgium and France to get around the European Union."
"The best thing the UK could do to help the Irish and to help the Scottish is to improve the very inferior British motorway system on which we depend to get to our markets."
"Yes, the Stranraer-Carlisle road is an absolute disgrace."
"But it is also difficult getting round Birmingham, getting around London, getting to the Channel Tunnel and to the channel ports."
"The best thing the British could do with this extra money is to improve our system in the hope of improving UK-Irish friendship and relations."
"That concludes this item."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.05 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 17 November 2000."
"Statement by the President"
"Many Members of the House wanted us to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of Mr Gaetano Martino' s birth."
"It is my great honour today to pay tribute to the memory of this great European, whose name is inextricably linked to the Messina Conference which, in 1955, paved the way for the European Community."
"Mr Gaetano Martino was an illustrious doctor and politician."
"He was a credit to the European Parliament as a Member for ten years, and was twice elected President of Parliament in the 1960s."
"His presidency of Parliament crowned a long political career which led him to hold high office firstly in the Italian National Parliament and then within the Italian Government, where he was, in turn, Minister for National Education and Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"As a Minister and as a Member of the European Parliament, he fought a particularly bold campaign in favour of the European University Institute in Florence."
"Indeed, he considered Europe' s shared foundations to be both cultural and spiritual."
"From the very outset, the construction of Europe proved to be a difficult road, strewn with obstacles, which Mr Gaetano Martino, however, with the support of his deep-seated humanist culture and his unwavering faith in Europe, successfully negotiated."
"This is illustrated by the fact that, on 1 June 1955, i.e. less than a year after the failure of the ambitious plan for a European Defence Community, he started to weave the fabric of unification anew by proposing the Messina Conference which became, as we all know, the wellspring for the 1957 Treaties of Rome."
"So the European engine, which had just about stalled, suddenly came to life and the common market became a reality."
"We have decided to publish Gaetano Martino' s collected speeches in a single volume. They are truly edifying for young people who did not live through the difficult post-war period."
"In 1958, speaking from the chair in Strasbourg, he made the following declaration, ""For the first time in the history of this continent which has been marked by wars more than by peace we are witnesses to the general unification of the economy."
"The future is thereby assured, and the prospect is taking shape of a great Community embracing people of different languages, customs and beliefs, with this Parliament as one of the institutional bodies."""
"Ladies and gentlemen, a few days away from the European Council in Nice, I can only express the wish that the legacy of Gaetano Martino and the Messina spirit continue to be a source of inspiration for us all, especially all those who are responsible for the future destiny of this continent."
"Ladies and gentlemen, like all of you, I am sure, I would have liked to have been able to open this part-session without having to announce further news of the latest victims of ETA terrorism."
"Unfortunately, our democracies have been sent a new message of violence in the form of the particularly heinous murder of Ernest Lluch."
"On 22 November, the very day of the 25th anniversary of the coronation of King Juan Carlos, which paved the way to democracy in Spain, one of the key figures in this democracy has, in turn, paid with his life for his belief in freedom, tolerance and respect for the rights of others."
"He was Health Minister for your country in your government, Mr Barón Crespo."
"In the 1960s, you fought together, Mr Colom i Naval, for democracy in Spain."
"Known as a key player in the Spanish transition to democracy and for his contribution to Catalonia' s autonomous status, loved for his warmth, respected for his qualities as a politician and a great academic, Ernest Lluch was targeted by his murderers purely because of his dedication to the rule of law."
"I should like to express my deepest sympathy to his family and friends and to all those in Spain who believe in the strength of democracy."
"Approximately a million Spanish citizens, of all political persuasions, have stood up to protest against this despicable murder."
"The European Parliament has a duty to let them know that we stand with them, and so I propose, once again, that we observe a minute' s silence to express our solidarity and deep feeling."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of the sitting of Friday, 17 November have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"There are none."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"We shall deal with procedural motions after the debate on the Nice Summit, as you have requested."
"You are aware that we have a very full agenda and I have therefore taken this decision by virtue of the powers accorded me under the Rules of Procedure in order to ensure the smooth running of parliamentary business."
"So please keep them safe until then."
"Madam President, I must protest against this decision, on the grounds that procedural motions can be made for very important, very serious reasons."
"This is not an appropriate way of proceeding."
"Last time you put this item off until after the agenda was established."
"That was bad enough. Now, you might as well put it off until after the explanations of votes."
"You are perfectly entitled to do so pursuant to Rule 18, but it must not be thought that procedural motions have nothing to do with the specific, topical issues which the Members wish to raise at the beginning of a sitting, and it is important that Parliament should hear them."
"Let me register my protest against this decision."
"This has been noted, Mr Dell' Alba."
"Agenda"
"Madam President, I totally support this proposal since I was one of those who asked for this item to be entered."
"On many occasions Parliament has expressed itself in favour of a firm stand on the Kyoto commitments."
"I therefore feel that the European delegation at the Conference in The Hague was right to adopt this hard line. Now, however, we must, as a matter of urgency, work on a new draft declaration."
"I therefore think that we must proceed in the way you have suggested, until there is a resolution followed by a vote at our December part-session in Strasbourg."
"(Parliament gave its assent to the proposal)"
"Welcome"
"It is my very great pleasure to welcome to the official gallery, a delegation from the Russian Duma and the Federation Council, led by the Duma Vice-Presidents - Mr Vladimir Lukin and Mrs Irina Khakamada, and the Federation Council Vice-President, Mr Vladimir Varnavskyi."
"This delegation has come to Brussels to meet its counterparts in the European Parliament on the occasion of the third meeting of the Delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee."
"I hope that your debates and discussions will prove fruitful, and I wish you a most pleasant stay in Belgium. Welcome to the European Parliament."
"The Hague Conference on Climate Change"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the Conference on Climate Change in The Hague. I shall immediately give the floor to Mrs Wallström to speak on behalf of the Commission."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for inviting me to share with you my impressions of the sixth conference of the parties, the so-called COP6, to the United Nations framework convention on climate change, that took place the past two weeks in The Hague."
"After intensive negotiations, both at technical and ministerial level, on the basis of draft decisions with approximately 500 square brackets, it was not possible to reach a comprehensive agreement on key political issues."
"The European Union negotiating position concentrated on safeguarding the environmental integrity of the Kyoto protocol in the areas of land-use change and forestry, the ""sinks"" issue, the relation between the Kyoto mechanism and domestic action, known as ""supplementarity"" , and compliance."
"This meant that in the negotiations with other parties, trade-offs between these issues had to be explored."
"With good technical progress on the rules for the Kyoto mechanisms and the development of a compliance system, final negotiations focused mainly on trade-offs between ""supplementarity"" and ""sinks"" ."
"However, there was not enough time to fully evaluate last minute compromise proposals on the use of ""sinks"" in terms of their impact on the different countries inside and outside the European Union."
"Nevertheless, there was sufficient evidence that the environmental integrity would be seriously compromised."
"Therefore, the European Union decided not to accept these proposals."
"In order not to let the mandate of the Buenos Aires plan of action, that ran until the so-called COP6 conference, expire without any concrete result or follow-up, parties have decided to suspend COP6 and resume the conference in May 2001."
"COP6 was not all negative - far from it."
"We made some good progress."
"For example, a set of proposals responding to developing countries' needs and concerns was drawn up, including new funding and new institutions, but also a more focused approach on climate change within the global environment facility - the so-called GEF."
"Also progress was made at the technical level on other issues, such as policies and measures to reduce emissions, capacity building, technology transfer, emissions trading, joint implementation and compliance."
"All efforts should be made to finalise these decisions at the resumed session in May."
"Another positive outcome of COP6 is that it helped to obtain a better understanding of other parties' positions."
"This knowledge is extremely useful and should be built on further in the coming months."
"Mr Pronk was a very dedicated president of COP6."
"The proposal he made at the end of the second week outlines a package and constitutes one of the bases for further discussion and negotiation in the coming months."
"However, insufficient time was left to finalise the negotiations on the basis of his document; too much precious negotiating time was lost on ministerial statements and the repetition of well-known positions."
"Consequently, there was not enough time to analyse all the impacts of the different proposals relating to sinks that were made in the final hours."
"This is an issue that remains the subject of significant uncertainty."
"We all knew that, in order to get an agreement with the United States and its allies of the ""umbrella group"" , the European Union would have to make concessions."
"In the end, however, the concessions obtained from other parties on ""supplementarity"" , compliance and the Kyoto mechanisms were insufficient to compensate for the weakening of emission-reduction targets, that would have been the result if the proposal on ""sinks"" had been accepted."
"Where do we go from here?"
"As a priority, evaluation and preparation of further discussions should take place within the European Union."
"With a view to preparing this next session, the EU should not reopen discussions on all issues, but focus on key priorities, notably ""sinks"" mechanisms, ""supplementarity"" and a strong compliance regime."
"A smooth transition from the French to the Swedish Presidency has to be ensured and close contact should also be kept with Mr Pronk."
"The EU must review its positions on the key issues and, where appropriate, make new proposals."
"The Commission is fully committed to developing a strong common EU line together with the incoming presidency."
"In addition to further coordination within the European Union, contacts with other parties should be intensified."
"An absolute pre-condition for an agreement on ""sinks"" at the next session is to have one common set of data, instead of every party doing its own calculation."
"The EU will deepen its relations with all major groups and will also contact the new US administration as soon as possible."
"Finally, as the rules and modalities for the functioning of the Kyoto protocol have not been adopted, ratification of the protocol will have to be postponed until after the next session and the meeting of COP6."
"However, the internal preparation for ratification through the European climate change programme and the development of a European Union emissions trading scheme will continue."
"Thank you for your attention and I am willing to answer any questions you might have."
"Madam President, I am sorry that the Commissioner obviously had a very frustrating time at The Hague, but I congratulate her on remaining optimistic."
"The European Parliament delegation to the talks was equally disappointed at the outcome, although we were not surprised."
"Certainly we could have foreseen, as she could, the problem that arose over ""sinks"" ."
"Those who read the French and British press will realise that there is quite a lot of attention on what seems to have been the breakdown in the relationship between Mrs Voynet, the French minister, and Mr Prescott, the British minister."
"They were, in a sense, an accident waiting to happen - like the Titanic and the iceberg."
"Mr Prescott is now holed below the water line and we do not know how long he will remain afloat."
"One of the things we feel, at least I feel in a personal capacity, is the trouble is that a Green minister has absolutely no room to negotiate on Green issues."
"Madam Voynet was bound not to give way to the American point of view."
"You would not expect any less of her, would you?"
"My question to the Commissioner is: Does she feel that there is any flexibility likely to arise in the European Union position on ""sinks"" ; secondly, when does she forecast that the talks are likely to resume; and thirdly, was Mr Prescott' s statement to the House of Commons actually true?"
"He said in the House of Commons that the agreement which he had laboriously brokered with all the skills of a Sherman tank would have prevented developed countries from gaining credits from the clean development mechanism for planting forests in developing countries, which sounds rather good."
"This was felt by many countries, particularly the green groups, to be a huge loophole."
"The agreement would have placed a ceiling on the use of forest sinks by the United States, Japan and Canada, a ceiling which Europe had been asking for, and strengthen the scientific requirements applied to the domestic sinks."
"Given the - surprise - glowing report by Mr Prescott on the deal which he had himself brokered, why was it that not only Madam Voynet but, I believe, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, most of the other environment ministers in Europe all rejected that?"
"It seems from Mr Prescott' s report to his own Parliament that he was making them an offer they could not refuse?"
"In conclusion I regret that this has happened, but I hope that we will in the end share Mrs Wallström' s optimism and get the kind of agreement on climate change which we need."
"Madam President, first of all, I should like to say to the Commission that it has done its job well."
"It is my wish that the European Union will continue to speak with one voice at the forthcoming international gatherings, and I consider it utterly futile to spend our time now apportioning blame to individual ministers."
"That will get us nowhere."
"We know that the failure of this conference is not the end of what has been a very lengthy and highly complex process; the process will continue."
"However, we must ask ourselves where improvements can be made."
"The first point, which I also frame as a question to the Commission, is whether this method we have chosen here, with conferences at which representatives of 180 nations have to agree on a joint document, does not ask too much of us, especially when time is pressing towards the end and the differences between the main parties have not yet been settled."
"Is it not time that this issue was dealt with by the U.S. and European Heads of State and Government at the G7 summits?"
"Secondly, this does not mean that I aim to give us such an easy time."
"When we point the finger at the Americans, we must not forget that a number of fingers are pointed back at us."
"It is not as if we Europeans had all done our homework."
"CO2 emissions are on the increase here too; we know that, and we have discussed it often enough."
"The question is whether we actually need a global convention before we can start to reduce our own emissions."
"May I remind the Commission of its communication on emissions trading and on the conference in The Hague, in which it spoke of being able, in certain circumstances, to present a draft directive in which the quotas agreed by the environment ministers in 1998 would be prescribed and in which sanctions would be laid down for quota violations."
"My question is this: are you willing to do that, to present such an instrument, even though we have not completed the Kyoto process?"
"Is there actually anything to stop us introducing emissions trading in the European Union in the year 2005, now that a number of countries have already made a start on emissions trading within their national borders?"
"My final comment is that I find it right and proper that you have remained firm on the issue of ""sinks"" , primarily because it is extremely difficult to measure ""sinks"" accurately."
"We were supposed to bring home measurable results, by which I mean physically measurable results, but that aim has not been compatible with the Americans' position."
"Madam President, these negotiations were always going to be hard but Commission officials believed that a deal would be done at the end of the day because political leaders across the world simply had too much to lose by returning home empty-handed."
"It is a matter of huge disappointment that agreement was not reached and I very much regret that the end of the convention was marred by a dispute between Britain' s Deputy Prime Minister and the French Presidency over the compromise proposals he put forward."
"The fact that after Mr Prescott' s rather noisy departure, the Americans tabled new proposals, which came closer to the EU position, demonstrates that the French Presidency was right to hold firm."
"We were getting closer, but sadly time ran out."
"The fear is that the momentum has been lost and the American negotiators will change and we start afresh in May."
"The disagreement within Europe is all the more regrettable because my overriding impression of the convention was of a European Union negotiating as a closely-knit team, from a position which crossed party lines and united Member States behind shared principles, a shared outlook and a shared sense of anger at the refusal of the Americans to face up to their responsibilities as the world' s largest emitters of greenhouse gases."
"From all we have heard, we must assume that the US Senate will not ratify the Kyoto protocol, however hard we compromise."
"Therefore, we must give greater priority to bringing in and gaining the support of nations elsewhere, to getting emissions trading up and running, and to taking real action to reduce global warming gases in this Union."
"Let us hope we get agreement in May; in the meantime let Europe take the lead."
"The USA remains of great importance."
"Money talks in American politics more than it does within our Union."
"US industry and the oil companies are telling their politicians that they must reject the Kyoto protocol, whatever the American public say."
"My question to the Commissioner is this: How can we persuade American industry that it is in their commercial interests to support the protocol, so that they pull purse strings and pull the American politicians into line?"
"How do we drag them kicking and screaming into the 21st century with all its problems?"
"Madam President, the conference on the world climate may have broken down but substantial progress was made nonetheless."
"Nuclear energy has no chance of making a comeback."
"The developing countries said: if you northern countries are going to stop using nuclear energy then we do not want it either, not even if it is subsidised."
"Progress was also made in the field of enforcement."
"The developing countries are to receive USD 1 billion after 2005."
"If the clean development mechanism starts working then they will receive between USD 5 billion and USD 25 billion in addition, annually."
"President Pronk acquitted himself well as far as the developing countries are concerned but his compromise was lacking in terms of environmental issues."
"The forests proved to be the major stumbling block this time round."
"Three years ago, in Kyoto, the United States wanted to use Russia as a means of getting round having to take any measures in their own country."
"Now the Clinton administration wanted the cheapest measures, i.e. to allow forests to grow."
"Of course forests eat up CO2 but once they are fully grown this no longer happens."
"Besides, forests burn down, which is happening increasingly often."
"The solution must be found in energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy."
"The negotiators working on behalf of the European Union certainly wanted to leave quite a lot of leeway for forests, but no more than 20% of all measures to be adopted."
"Prescott' s deal, whereby the United States would be allowed to emit 1/3 via forests, 1/3 via hot air and 1/3 via CDM, was a poor and unacceptable deal."
"Fortunately, 14 of the 15 Ministers for the Environment were of the same mind on this issue."
"But we must press on, and equality must be incorporated in Bonn, in May 2001."
"Every citizen of the world has an equal right to CO2-emission, i.e. the Americans do not have the right to emit 200 times as much as the Africans."
"Only if equality is incorporated will the developing countries start to participate in the fight against climate change after 2012."
"In order to stabilise the climate on the basis of equality, the United States will have to cut back on their emissions by 90% and the European Union will have to cut back by 80%."
"China will then have to stabilise its emissions, and then India will be allowed to double its emissions."
"There needs to be a breakthrough in May next year, without the United States if need be."
"The Kyoto Protocol can, and must, be ratified, even without the United States."
"I hope we will come to see the wisdom of this."
"Madam President, industry and transport cause the earth' s atmosphere to warm up artificially."
"If this global warming continues, then part of the territory of the EU Member States will become sea or desert."
"We will need to drastically alter our economy if we are to keep the world and Europe habitable on a permanent basis."
"Parliament has recently pronounced itself in favour of a number of steps that will take us in the right direction."
"The European position during the climate conference, which ended - and evidently broke down - in The Hague last Saturday, was characterised by two sharply conflicting views."
"One view is that we should stick closely to the 1997 agreements in order to reduce emissions by a generous 5%, as compared with 1990."
"It is felt that we should now honour the Kyoto commitments already entered into, and that a willingness to compromise with America represents a betrayal of Europe' s commitment."
"The other view is that the Kyoto obligations have never been feasible because there is too much opposition from America, Japan, and Australia, and the only way to reach an international agreement now, would be to reduce their commitments to take action."
"Creative accountancy would enable us to give the impression that they have already fulfilled a substantial number of their obligations."
"The European Union made an error of judgement where the second view is concerned, because the green Environment Ministers of France and Germany were not prepared to forget Kyoto."
"We will still need to find a compromise of this kind at the follow-up conference due to take place in May 2001, in Bonn."
"My group favours the first view."
"It is important for Europe to stick with a position taken up previously, even though it means that the United States will not be in a position to subscribe to an agreement of this kind for the period of the Bush administration."
"Taking the long-term view, it is important that we convince the American public of the dangers of the do-nothing option, rather than agreeing a compromise with our opponents."
"The United States produce the largest amount of pollution per capita."
"As yet, American public opinion has not given a great deal of credence to the notion that the deserts will expand and there will be an increase in hurricanes."
"They have a high standard of living over there and the price of petroleum products is low."
"The people feel that any actual changes will be to the detriment of industry and consumers."
"It is therefore unlikely that an international agreement would now be able to gain approval from the US Congress."
"Finally, the Third World is only in the very early stages of industrialisation."
"Poverty has forced these countries to sell their CO2 emission rights to rich countries, which want to use them to reduce their own obligations."
"At the end of the day, these countries will not give up their rights to progress."
"The emission of greenhouse gases will increase dramatically as a result."
"That is why we need to keep these realities in mind in the follow-up to the climate conference."
"A compromise cannot mean forgetting what was agreed in Kyoto."
"Madam President, I am extremely disappointed, like the vast majority of the House and the previous speakers, that the UN world climate change summit was not a success in The Hague."
"It is regrettable that the participants did not reach an agreement on how best to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the future."
"The Kyoto accord of three years ago set out a timetable for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions."
"This Kyoto protocol must not be watered down under any circumstances."
"In fact, the opposite is the case."
"The industrialised world in particular may have to set even stricter limits for the reduction of greenhouse gases in the future, if we are to ensure that the impact of global warming is to be arrested and ultimately controlled."
"The challenge facing us in the issue of climate change is clearly one of the greatest challenges in the 21st century, if we are all to have a planet to live on in the future."
"If we do not address this issue in a structured and streamlined manner, then global warming will increase, with serious side-effects for land, marine and aerial environments, not to mention human life."
"It has already been said that the next meeting to discuss the issue of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will take place in Bonn, which will coincide with a publication by the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change."
"This panel is made up of some 3,000 scientists from all around the world who will give their assessment as to what measures are needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"The Environment Committee of this Parliament has been at the forefront in addressing the issue of climate change in the past."
"We are walking closely with the Commissioner for the environment, Mrs Wallström, on a number of EU regulations and directives, which will help control greenhouse gases in the European Union."
"The European Union must take a lead in this matter."
"The Environment Committee and Parliament have set a good example in the past as to how we should collectively address the issue of greenhouse gas reductions in the future."
"We must continue with vigour and determination in the future on this issue."
"Future generations will pay a price for our inactivity in this very important subject."
"I compliment Commissioner Wallström on her efforts in The Hague and wish her more success."
"Madam President, we too were very disappointed that the Conference on Climate Change in The Hague broke down."
"Any discussion as to where the blame lies leads all too easily to the United States being singled out for criticism."
"As I see it, the fact that no agreement was reached was ultimately down to the intransigence of the European Union."
"The discussion in The Hague focused mainly on the question as to what exactly can be taken into account as regards the reductions agreed in Kyoto."
"In October we were able, during the discussion of the proposal concerning trade in emissions, to opt for efficient and effective ways of reducing emissions."
"Unfortunately, Parliament failed to make a clear choice at the time."
"As far as the 50% is concerned, I feel I must point out that this objective should never be the be all and end all."
"If we could reach an agreement with the United States which allows them to work towards a lower realisation percentage in their own country, this would always be preferable to having no agreement at all."
"The same applies to the partial inclusion of the CO2 sinks, such as the additional planting of forests."
"Although I do not have a good word to say about the US stance, one thing I do know is that the United States were prepared to achieve an acceptable compromise at the end of the conference."
"The intransigence of the European Union, led by the French Minister for the Environment, Mrs Voynet, stood in the way of a potential agreement."
"Some people value the European Union' s stance because they stuck to their guns."
"In reality, the chances of reaching agreement in the future are slimmer, which means that an effective strategy for tackling the climate problem is an even more remote prospect."
"Madam President, I share the honourable Members' intense disappointment at the outcome of the Conference in The Hague, which is effectively an outright failure."
"I should not, however, like to enter into personal squabbles, and I think we should refrain from that sort of completely negative discussion."
"I should like to congratulate the Commission, and Mrs Wallström, on keeping to the commitments it had always made towards reducing emissions, including among others greenhouse gas emissions."
"Without doubt, it was better to have no agreement at all than a poor one and it is true that, in this instance, the American proposal was a third-rate proposal, and one which was completely unacceptable to Europe."
"In any case, an agreement can only be accepted and acceptable if there is a balance between North and South, between developing countries and industrialised countries."
"I am already extremely concerned about resorting to the right to pollute. In my opinion, this can only hinder the economic development of countries that are already extremely underdeveloped."
"The United States' position, resorting to the idea of forests being carbon sinks, is unacceptable, for, then, no one would make any effort."
"We must reject these American diktats."
"This situation highlights the limitation of a Europe which, with its rotation of presidencies, does not have a strong political image to present to the United States and does not speak with a single voice."
"It also clearly highlights, once again, the desperate need to reform the European institutions and the way they operate."
"When will we have a President of the European Union that is strong and capable alone of representing Europe with regard to our partners?"
"Let us conclude, however, on a hopeful note."
"The Conference in The Hague is to be resumed, as you have informed us, Commissioner, next spring in Bonn."
"You may count on our support, Commissioner, so we might be able to stand up to the United States and take up the gauntlet."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us not beat about the bush, the climate conference in The Hague was a flop, which is disappointing because it is becoming increasingly apparent that climate change is happening much faster than anticipated."
"Therefore the world needs a powerful political signal."
"Kyoto must not remain an empty promise."
"The failure of the climate conference sends out the wrong signal to the public."
"Many people will start thinking that the climate problems are not all that bad if those involved in the international politics of it are content not to do anything."
"This would also undermine the level of support for sustainable energy and energy efficiency."
"Climate change has a huge impact on the developing countries."
"Countries such as India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Thailand have to contend with floods that affect millions of people."
"We set great store by the 'polluter pays' principle, but hitherto, it has been the third world countries themselves that have been saddled with the bill and adapting to climate change."
"This is unacceptable to my mind."
"Commissioner, the statements on the failure of the climate conference were lacking in credibility."
"The negotiators declared afterwards that an agreement had been within reach."
"They said there was no shortage of political will, the parties moved closer to each other' s positions, and demonstrated increased understanding of each other' s cultures."
"Unfortunately though, they ran out of time."
"I do not find that very credible."
"Behind all the fine words lurks political impotence."
"The European Union is going to have to carefully assess its own role."
"It is not enough to blame the United States or to complain about the lack of flexibility shown by others."
"We have repeatedly said ourselves that no agreement is better than a bad agreement, but that does not mean that we should make our own political wish list the yardstick of a sound agreement."
"The climate conference will resume in the spring."
"So now we must look to the future."
"Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the cooperation we have enjoyed."
"Finally, I would like to put three questions to you. Firstly, how would you yourself assess the European Union' s stance, and what practical lessons would you draw from the failure of the conference?"
"Secondly, how do you intend to proceed in the coming months?"
"Will you enter into debate with the United States over the forest problem and the scientific issues and lack of clarity that are still at large in this respect?"
"Thirdly, which aspects do you think the EU should make more concessions on?"
"Personally, I feel we could probably moderate our demands somewhat on the point of supplementarity."
"Your opinion on this would be much appreciated, and I thank you for your attention."
"Madam President, thank you, Commissioner Wallström, for your intervention."
"I think the EU successfully kept its act together, apart perhaps from in the last critical hours."
"Clearly, however, there are many losers following a conference of this kind."
"I think that we, as politicians, have lost out because we have sent a very bad signal to a great many committed people by failing to reach an agreement."
"Secondly, I think that the section of commerce and industry which looks seriously at this problem and which would like to have some ground rules has also lost out."
"Therefore, it is, of course, incredibly important for there to be another conference soon."
"I think the EU was right not to give way on carbon sinks."
"This is not just because of the difficulties of verification and measurement but also because more and more researchers maintain - whether rightly or wrongly, I do not know - that today' s carbon sinks may well be tomorrow' s carbon sources."
"Or, to put it another way: forests stop being carbon sinks and become carbon sources."
"If that is the case, then it would obviously be extremely risky to add this to the equation at the present stage, when it is still so difficult to come up with definitions."
"I should prefer to say, Commissioner, that, in the ongoing dialogue with the Americans, it would be better to be more generous when it comes to emissions trading in general than to introduce something which is extremely difficult to substantiate on the basis purely of research."
"I was a part of the parliamentary delegation."
"We had a meeting with a number of American Members of Congress."
"I was quite alarmed at the arrogance and ignorance shown by the Americans."
"I got the feeling that they do not want to ratify the Kyoto protocol under any circumstances."
"One conclusion I came to is that we need more in the way of transatlantic dialogue on these issues - not only dialogue between governments and the Commission but also, and especially, between Members of Congress."
"That is perhaps something which we in the European Parliament can help bring about."
"Finally, a question: even if a conference in May were not to succeed, is the Commissioner prepared to go further, to be in the vanguard, take the lead and recommend ratification by the EU?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as Chairman of the European Parliament delegation to COP­VI, I wish to begin by expressing my pleasure at the excellent relationship that has developed between the Commission and Parliament over this last week."
"If there is one area in which there has been no lack of unity, it is in this relationship."
"I am bound to regret the fact, however, that the will of some ministers of the 15 Member States has been directed more towards racing to attend press conferences than creating a genuine spirit of unity that will guarantee a global policy on climate change."
"Madam President, we knew that this COP­VI would be of particularly great importance: it represented abandoning the stage of discussion in which we had been stuck since 1992 and moving on towards action."
"Since we were not able to reach an agreement, we failed in our objective of moving on towards action."
"To put it frankly, if we have to make an assessment of what took place, we could say that out of the three parties participating in the Conference, only one tried to reach an agreement and tried to achieve a global policy on climate change, and that was the European Union."
"The United States - but let us also state quite clearly that it was the entire ""umbrella group"" - concocted a whole series of excuses for not reaching any type of agreement at COP­VI, in The Hague."
"By May, by Bonn, the European Union must take action on two fronts: firstly through diplomacy, since the scenario that the United States will ratify the agreement is the least likely, and so diplomatic action must be developed with the other members of the umbrella group."
"Secondly, we must act within the Union in order to guarantee our credibility."
"Only if we have this credibility will the European Union be able to lead the debate and the action at COP­VI ""B"" in Bonn."
"Madam President, thank you for your support and a special thanks to the European Parliamentary delegation who were there in The Hague."
"I actually remember meeting Mrs Corbey, who was there the whole time, going to a session at 5.30 one morning."
"You were all very supportive during the session and I thank you for that."
"We sometimes discuss the climate change issue as if its effects will only be felt in the long term by our children and grandchildren."
"However, climate change has already happened, it is already there."
"The ice caps are measurably melting."
"Small island states in the Pacific are slowly disappearing because of the rise in sea level."
"We see the effects in our everyday lives."
"Even though the experts are very careful not to say that any particular storm or extreme weather condition is due to climate change, we will see more extreme weather as climate change continues."
"So it is also for us."
"Of course it is an issue for coming generations, but it is a fact, especially for people living in poor countries, as has also been said."
"What can we do now?"
"Now is not the time to apportion blame or to point fingers."
"Now is the time to decide that we cannot fail once more."
"Failing to achieve an agreement at the next COP6 meeting is not an option."
"I am quite optimistic because I felt we came so close and that all the ministers there understand that a five per cent reduction as in the Kyoto Protocol is only a small part of the commitment we will have to make for the future."
"This is only the start."
"Maybe we should not be too worried about taking a little more time, a few months more, to decide on the rules and the framework, the legal framework, that must be put in place in order to operate the huge economic market that will be created."
"Of course we need some clear operational rules to regulate an emissions trading market worth twelve billion dollars."
"We had too much left on the table for these negotiations and we will have to try to sort that out."
"We will have to make our own assessment of what happened, and prepare the documents to make contacts with different parties, and of course with the ""umbrella group"" ."
"It is very much up to the American administration to tell us with whom we should speak."
"We will also have to continue our contacts with developing countries."
"That is how we can take this issue forward constructively."
"Now let me just answer the questions on whether we were flexible."
"Sometimes these negotiations are extremely chaotic, and I think that you can always go home and look back saying that we made this mistake or that mistake."
"However, for the environment ministers present at The Hague, and you know we have also set the tone here, the main objectives were to defend the credibility and integrity of the Kyoto Protocol."
"So we would not allow any creative accounting on, for example, certain issues."
"The Americans presented us with a proposal that would have reduced their commitment by between 70 and 90 per cent."
"We simply could not accept that."
"Should we lower our ambitions when we know we need to do more?"
"At the same time, we made concessions."
"We opened up discussions on what we had earlier said were big loopholes, or potentially of big loopholes."
"We were very constructive and we negotiated until the last minute of these talks in The Hague."
"We will continue to be willing to make concessions, but I think we were flexible while at the same time defending our main objectives, and we should continue to do that."
"We now know what kind of questions we will have on the table for this last part."
"I am hopeful, I really think that the awareness is there."
"All ministers know that they cannot escape this huge task of combating climate change; this was also clear from the meeting in The Hague."
"We will do everything to be able to turn this into an agreement and actually be able to sign it."
"Of course the follow up of the next COP6 or the continuation of COP6 will be to ratify an agreement inside the Union."
"We can start emissions trading earlier."
"We can take a lot of measures, which the Commission will propose."
"As soon as we get the chance, as soon as the legal framework is in place, we will move."
"I again thank you for this debate."
"I have taken note of everything that has been said, we will of course follow up and be willing to come back whenever Parliament asks us to."
"Many thanks both to the Commissioner and to the Members of the House."
"The debate is closed."
"Preparation of Nice European Council and trade policy"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the preparation of the Nice European Council from 7 to 9 December 2000, including trade policy."
"We are pleased to welcome Mr Hubert Védrine."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have the floor."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am here to tell the House about the Presidency' s preparations for the Nice European Council."
"There are some very important items on the agenda but even so they far from reflect all the work that has been done and all the results that have already been obtained during the last six months."
"The European Council will, naturally, only be asked to deal with issues which cannot be dealt with at any other level, primarily institutional reform, and to provide the general political guidelines and impetus."
"The President of the Republic himself is coming here on 12 December to present a report on the Presidency."
"The major issue facing the members of the European Council at Nice will clearly be the reform of the institutions and the finalisation of what we all hope will become the Treaty of Nice."
"Before the European Council, Pierre Moscovici and I will still be holding a Ministerial Conclave, next Sunday, to which I have invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, as well as a session of the IGC, on Monday at the General Affairs Council."
"We will then get a more precise picture of how the negotiations are progressing in their final phase, on the eve of Nice."
"I hope we will have a full exchange of views with the President of Parliament at that time."
"So today I will just be bringing you up to date on the main issues under discussion."
"Real progress on qualified majority and enhanced cooperation was made at the informal European Council of Biarritz."
"There was also a beneficial clarification of the issues around the Commission and the weighting of votes, allowing each Member State to get a better idea of the objectives and difficulties of the others."
"Pierre Moscovici reported to you on that on 24 October."
"We have been building on that foundation over the last few weeks taking all the points of view into account with a view to arriving at a compromise, but keeping our sights set on an ambitious agreement at Nice."
"We sometimes hear the Presidency accused of lacking ambition; there are no grounds for saying that today."
