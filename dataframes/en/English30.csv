"I can agree with practically everything that has been said in this debate."
"Moving forward on the human rights agenda is basically no different from any other activity in international politics."
"This has to be understood."
"What can be done in a given situation in a given case is part of the broader political progress or lack of progress made at any given time."
"The reality is that we do not have a separate entity in international society in which we can discuss human rights only on their own merit."
"Politics never goes away."
"It is always part of this discussion, especially when we talk about it internationally."
"For that reason we have to equip ourselves with something one might call robust pragmatism in order to be strong enough to stay on course and pragmatic enough to know whether or not we can make headway in a given case."
"As for Zimbabwe, I can inform Parliament that we are now positioning the first electoral observers."
"We already have people in Harare who are being groomed to act as electoral observers."
"We will thus have ten to fifteen people who will form the long-term team of observers."
"I am also pleased to inform Parliament that Mr Pierre Schori will head the observation team for Europe during the election in Zimbabwe."
"We should not take it for granted that we will be able to carry out effective electoral observation."
"We are giving priority to positioning ourselves so that we can do this as well as possible and with as broad a representation as possible from Europe in our team as a whole."
"But the main priority is to actually do our work and not be marginalised by some tactical or political manoeuvre."
"Without this observation work the basis for us to give a final judgment will not be satisfactory."
"Nothing about Zimbabwe is easy."
"I am not in a position to express optimism or pessimism, but so far we are doing our utmost to ensure that we will be there with an effective team to observe the elections next month."
"I have received six motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure:"
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Relations between the EP and national parliaments"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0023/2002) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on relations between the European Parliament and the national parliaments in European integration (2001/2023(INI))"
"Mr President, the forthcoming Convention will only fulfil its mandate if it provides convincing responses on a key point: how to guarantee the democratic legitimacy of the process of European integration."
"This is the starting point for the report which has been adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and is now before the plenary."
"We are, of course, all aware that the Convention has to redefine the Union' s missions, its role on the world stage, in global development and in working for peace, its growth and cohesion policies and its policy of security in freedom and justice."
"However, it would be a mistake to dismiss all the rest as pure institutional technicalities, as abstract exercises in institutional engineering of no interest whatsoever to the citizens."
"One reason why the European cause has lost the citizens' support is because the difficulty of influencing or even understanding the Union' s decisions makes them feel removed from too many of them."
"To regain support, it is vital to make it absolutely clear who is taking the decisions in the Union, how the decisions can be made transparent and comprehensible and how they can be monitored, and by which institutions the citizens can be effectively represented in Europe."
"All these points are questions precisely of democracy, indeed they are questions which are crucial to democracy."
"The role of the parliamentary institution with regard to these issues is vital, although not decisive in itself."
"We must therefore take a firm decision to strengthen the role of the parliamentary institution in the Union' s structure, to further parliamentarise the Union, supplementing the progress achieved during the 90s."
"Parliamentarisation must occur in two areas: the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"Both contribute equally to the democratic legitimisation of the European Union as a Union of citizens and peoples rather than just States."
"To spell it out, if, as the European Parliament, we have been guilty of a certain exclusivism, we must change our attitude."
"We need to eliminate any mutual mistrust between the European Parliament and national parliaments; we need to understand the concerns of national parliaments and propose appropriate solutions."
"The report I am presenting to you sets forth three paths for action: Firstly, national parliaments should have greater guidance and supervisory powers over their respective governments and should be able to exercise these powers effectively."
"Secondly, there needs to be increasingly close, systematic cooperation between the European Parliament and national parliaments, including through interparliamentary agreements signed by the respective leaders."
"This is an innovative idea whose development I entrust chiefly to the initiative of the President of the European Parliament."
"Thirdly, both national and European Members of Parliament should be endowed with a constituent power, to be shared with the governments and the Commission - as in the Convention, which is about to start work - to work on revising the Treaties with a view, we can now say, to producing a genuine European Constitution."
"These are the appropriate solutions to pursue, not those which would lead to confusion of the roles of the European Parliament and national parliaments and add to the unwieldiness of the Union' s institutional structure and decision-making mechanisms."
"In particular, as a House of Lords report has regretfully shown, a second Chamber made up of members of national parliaments 'would be an unreal solution to some real problems' ."
"It is my firm hope that the spirit of this report will be properly interpreted and welcomed and that, with your support, the Convention will have the benefit of our contribution."
"Mr President, as Mr Napolitano pointed out, the issue of relations between national parliaments and the European Parliament is one of the key issues on the agenda of the Convention that is about to begin its work. Hence the timeliness of the debate on this report tabled by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which includes the opinion of the Committee on External Affairs for which I had the honour of drafting its opinion."
"In my personal view, Mr Napolitano' s report has many merits, and on this I congratulate him, but it also advocates some options that can be criticised from a political point of view."
"In the capacity in which I am speaking today, however, I must limit myself to listing the objectives pursued in the opinion delivered by my Committee, which have been partially echoed in the motions for resolutions we are now discussing, specifically in Nos 13, 14 and 15."
"With regard to external policy and common security, including defence, which, as is well known, remains essentially in the intergovernmental sphere, listing the issues is relatively simple: on the one hand, the European Parliament currently performs its supervisory role by means of the right to be informed and the right to be consulted conferred on it by Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union and by means of its budgetary powers to approve operational expenditure on civilian crisis management and on associated administrative tasks; on the other, national parliaments do not enjoy genuine participation in the drafting of such policy, although they do have decisive powers over the military expenditure of their respective countries, which then have a major influence on the operational resources made available to the CFSP."
"The provisions of Title V of the Treaty on European Union require the Member States to observe the principles of coordination and mutual solidarity when defining and implementing the CFSP, so this democratic and parliamentary deficit must be corrected."
"Because of its significance and importance, I would highlight the proposal for a Parliamentary Conference on the CFSP to be held on a regular basis, to be convened jointly by the parliament of the Member State holding the presidency and by the European Parliament, in which Members of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments would participate, with the specific intention of improving the essential exchange of information in this field."
"Within the current institutional framework, this conference would enable the various Parliaments to undertake their work more effectively in accordance with their respective competences."
"What is more, however, with this proposal we are also giving form to the principle that both the European Parliament and the national parliaments represent the peoples of the European Union, since both are directly elected by the citizens and both provide full guarantees of the exercise of democracy."
"Mr President, I should like to say, as draftsperson of an opinion, what a very great pleasure it has been to work alongside such a distinguished parliamentarian as Mr Napolitano, the author of this excellent report."
"There are few differences between the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and his report."
"In particular we want to endorse firmly the point in his conclusion that the so-called second chamber of the European legislature would be an unworkable third chamber and we are very glad that the suggestion has been so carefully refuted from inside one of the countries from which it emerged, namely the United Kingdom."
"On the report itself, the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs were largely adopted by the rapporteur in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"Our paragraph 1, dealing with collaboration among the parliaments of the Union, is well covered in his paragraph 10; our paragraph 2, on the importance of participation of representatives of the European Parliament and national parliaments in the future Convention, has been adopted by Mr Napolitano."
"This is very important because it speaks of the need for vigorous debate in the Convention to see whether we can produce a consensus."
"Some rumours emanating from the direction of Mr Giscard d'Estaing suggest that his idea is that there need not be a debate because all will be clear from the presidency."
"If that is so, we must disabuse him of that notion."
"This has to be a Convention that will debate."
"In paragraph 4, that reappears as paragraph 12 in the Napolitano report."
"Finally, the one point of difference between the Committee on Legal Affairs and Mr Napolitano was whether there ought to be articulate and express mention of the role of regional parliaments with legislative power in this report."
"I think strongly there ought to be."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs voted for it clearly and my own group has tabled some amendments."
"Mr Napolitano said to me privately that he thinks this could be taken up on a different occasion through the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"If he were able to make an assurance to that effect tomorrow, it might be possible for us to reconsider things."
"I shall speak to him privately about that."
"It would be good if we could go forward with maximum agreement."
"I ask, in the mean time, that Parliament concentrate on this paragraph 3 and the parallel amendments tabled by myself and colleagues."
"Mr President, as colleagues know, today across Europe there is popular discontent with regard to Europe's apparent disconnection from ordinary life."
"The European political process is widely seen as an elite preoccupation of little or no relevance to many outside the political classes."
"Quite rightly concern about this crosses national boundaries and the ideological divide."
"It is a wish to try to remedy this discontent that lies behind Mr Napolitano's report, which we in the PPE-DE Group support."
"There have been a number of responses to this unhappy and unacceptable state of affairs, one of which included the suggestion of establishing a second European parliamentary chamber comprising national parliamentarians."
"The conclusions of this report, as the rapporteur has already mentioned, echo a recently published report from the House of Lords in my own country."
"They recognise the important role of national parliaments, but reject the argument for a further second chamber."
"Rather than further encumbering the European political process, this report recognises that it is for the European Parliament in its sphere, and national parliaments in theirs, in accordance with their own national traditions, to scrutinise their own governments' conduct of European business and activities in the Council of Ministers."
"Consensus has rightly emerged that an important component of the way to reconnect Europe with national political life, and through that with European citizens, is through an alliance between the European Parliament and national parliaments and national politics, which at present seem to give insufficient weight to thorough and comprehensive scrutiny of European matters."
"In this report Mr Napolitano, as befits the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and rapporteur, has most skilfully woven together an approach to improving relations between the European Parliament and national parliaments and to strengthening cooperation between them."
"The pedantic constitutional purist from any one Member State might cavil at some of the detail, but this report provides a template for action which cannot be carried out by any single parliament."
"Changes must take place in a wider framework of change and democratic openness on all sides."
"If political and democratic openness and acceptability matter - and no political group in this House believes in them more than we in the PPE-DE Group do - the Napolitano report represents an important starting point."
"But we must not complacently rest on our laurels now."
"This report represents words; we must now see action."
"Change, in line with the thrust of the report's conclusions and catalysed by the Laeken Convention as the rapporteur himself pointed out, is needed to start to remedy these democratic deficiencies in the European political system which, if left unattended, could be so damaging."
"Mr President, Commissioner, judging by the results of the latest Eurobarometer, the people of Europe have more trust in their police force than in their parliaments."
"This is an alarming sign, which should compel the people' s elected representatives to work together to eliminate the reasons for this."
"The legitimacy of democratic regimes is at stake."
"It is up to the MPs of each Member State to reduce the democratic deficits that are appearing at national level, and which also exist at this level."
"In the report before us today, MEPs are being called on to examine how the role played by the national parliaments in European integration could be strengthened."
"Not to the detriment of the role of the European Parliament, but to complement it."
"Mr Napolitano, the rapporteur, is proposing a number of specific measures which have been approved by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and which could, in my view, easily receive the unanimous approval of the Convention."
"Mr Napolitano quite rightly calls for the powers of the national parliament vis-à-vis their respective governments to be strengthened, prior to decisions being taken in the Council."
"In some of our Member States, the procedure of influencing decisions is well organised."
"In other States, it does not even exist in embryonic form."
"To put it simply, the national parliaments let their government get on with things and complain afterwards."
"The rapporteur, quite rightly, also rules out the idea of a second or even a third legislative chamber."
"A new institution such as this falls at the stumbling block posed by the question 'why set up a new institution?'"
"If we 'institutionalise' the Convention with the participation of the national parliaments, this is another way of exerting a much-needed influence at the preparatory stage of the extensive reforms."
"It is clear that the method advocated by the European Parliament must henceforth be used to reform the Treaty and it could even go beyond constitutional matters."
"For example, why not call a convention to prepare the next European Union multi-annual financial programme?"
"If this financial envelope must incorporate a new specific resource in the form of a European tax, I think it is essential that the representatives of the national parliaments deliberate it from the outset."
"Mr President, the essential message of this splendid report, which the Liberal Group strongly supports, the central message really is that national parliaments could, and should, contribute more to the political system of the European Union."
"But they ought to focus on what they do best and not tread upon the prerogatives of the European Parliament."
"What national parliaments must improve on doing is to scrutinise and check the executive power of the Council."
"What they do worst is to second-guess the legislative powers of the European Parliament."
"That is why we firmly reject the British proposals to insert a third legislative chamber composed of national MPs, whose function would be ""to police subsidiarity""."
"Such a national cuckoo inside the federal nest would shatter the codecision procedure, which is the key formula in the Union's own march towards becoming a mature post-national parliamentary democracy."
"Such a chamber would be stuffed with dutiful poodles of the Council, making a mockery of parliamentary involvement in European affairs at the national level."
"I trust the British government will listen to the debate on this question in the Convention and then withdraw its dangerous and obscurantist proposal."
"Mr President, we Greens especially welcome the report."
"It is an excellent report, explaining without ambiguity the national parliaments' tasks and role in the area of legitimising and monitoring national governments' legislative activities in the Council, in intergovernmental cooperation, where this monitoring function is not at all adequate, but also in the involvement of the national parliaments in the development of a European constitution, summed up in the word 'Convention' ."
"It is interesting to note, in this context, how this issue keeps appearing on the agenda, for there is no conflict between Parliament and national parliaments, nor is their task unclear."
"It occurs to me that this conflict is always engendered when the Council and the national governments want to resist Parliament's claim that it should become a fully-developed legislature."
"It is then that the impression is conveyed that parliamentary democracy at European level would be to the detriment of the national parliaments."
"It is a false argument, but a systematic one and a deception in the true sense of the word."
"This discord between the parliaments is intended to maintain the Council's position of power."
"Parliamentarianism in Europe is, however, indivisible."
"The commitment to parliamentary democracy is made at the European level."
"Parliament should therefore give a serious but wary reception to certain announcements made in advance by the Convention's president-designate, who has for weeks, via the press rather than by direct contact, and without yet being confirmed in office by the Convention, been giving voice to ideas about this constituent assembly which bear little relation to what Parliament demands or to the development of European democracy and parliamentarianism."
"I strongly appeal to this House to play its part in making the Convention a working, parliamentary and public convention and not, as it has been to date, a legitimising façade for the Council."
"Mr President, the role of the national parliaments is admittedly laid down in the Treaties, but the democratic deficit, which is essentially a failure to monitor the relevant national government, has got greater as European integration has moved forward."
"Deficient monitoring facilities and the governments' failure to supply appropriate briefings often make it impossible for the national parliaments to perform their function."
"This development must be brought to a halt, and the authority of national parliaments to keep tabs on their governments must be reinforced."
"That is why I particularly support the statements in item 1 of the report."
"Improved cooperation between the national parliaments and our own is indeed necessary, especially in areas such as policy on the EU, which are founded on collaboration between one State and another."
"There is one statement in the report which I, as a member of the Constitutional Convention, would like to emphatically underline, and that is item 17."
"Proposals such as that made by the German Foreign Minister get no support from me."
"The problem is the preponderance of the executive."
"We need the European Union to be made, in a far-reaching way, more democratic and parliamentary, we need definite constitutional reinforcement of the existing parliaments, but we do not need another chamber."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I and my delegation feel that it was a wise decision to entrust the drafting of this report to Mr Napolitano. In the concern at the imbalance between the powers conferred on the executive institutions and the scope afforded to the parliaments as a whole, he has found a key factor on which to base his report."
"In effect, Mr President, the European Parliament has been expressing its concern for years. Mr Napolitano' s report proposes an initial, effective solution which is perfectly in line and in harmony with the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The second key element of the report concerns the matter I had occasion to highlight months ago to the Italian Ambassador himself, even before anyone else, for it is primarily an Italian issue: the incompatibility between holding the office of Member of the European Parliament, on the one hand, and that of member of a national parliament, regional councillor or - I would add sotto voce, calling on Mr Napolitano to take note of the fact - mayor of a big city, on the other."
"Moreover, if the European Parliament is to regain its political role, there will have to be an increase not only in the quality of the debates but also in MEPs' attendance in Brussels and Strasbourg."
"The third element which I have to mention is the report' s wise, categorical refusal of a Chamber composed of representatives of national parliaments, thus avoiding making the decision-making process more unwieldy and, most importantly, preserving the distinction between the competences of national and European parliaments."
"Our goal is therefore an institutional agreement, and we hope that President Cox will respond to Mr Napolitano' s call to initiate it."
"We are moving towards a process of strengthening the institutional role of the parliaments, which are elected to play a political and governing role, rejecting any decidedly antiquated element of concentration of executive power in the hands of institutions which are not at all legitimised by the people' s vote."
"I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Napolitano for his excellent, brilliant work."
"Mr President, Commissioner, since the outset, Europe - well, what we call Europe in actual fact means the quasi-State, which passes legislation in Brussels and occasionally in Strasbourg, which hands down justice in Luxembourg and which produces currency in Frankfurt - is desperately seeking some legitimacy, a lack of which means its existence is in question."
"The best evidence of this lack of legitimacy is that the people of Europe, when they are consulted, send this Europe back to the drawing board, as the people of Denmark and Ireland forcefully, and on successive occasions, did not long ago."
"The report by Chairman Napolitano, whom I would like thank, seeks the answer to this existential question that we occasionally deliberate (and that we could term 'democratic remorse' ) in a sort of hybrid parliamentarisation, a risky experiment where the national parliaments and the European Parliament bargain between them in a sort of democratic no man' s land that is both vague and opaque."
"Mr President, Commissioner, legitimacy can only be conferred by the people themselves, when they are directly consulted, and cannot descend in the manner of the Holy Spirit out of such a distinguished Areopagus as our future Convention and, even more so, its praesidium, the most recent embodiment of what used to be called out-and-out despotism."
"European integration must involve the people and not the institutions."
"If it fails to do so, what we are continuing to call Europe will remain an increasingly foreign abstraction to Europeans, as the latest Eurobarometer has just demonstrated in a compelling manner."
"Mr President, the Napolitano report on relations between the European Parliament and the national parliaments is based on the fair observation that there is a serious imbalance in the European Union between the executive bodies that have extensive jurisdiction and a parliamentary power that is still too weak."
"The report concludes, again quite rightly, that there is a risk of a growing democratic deficit."
"What can we do, therefore, to correct this deficit?"
"Although Mr Napolitano has shown some openness in relation to the traditional positions of the European Parliament, I do not think that his report has yet reached the correct balance in its demands for the extension of the powers of the House, and that it confines the national parliaments to an indirect and, in most cases, illusory role, by placing everything under the vague term of 'parliamentarisation' ."
"In our view, this lack of balance is a result of an omission."
"The report does not mention that the European Parliament is merely an assembly with implementing powers and that the national parliaments alone have full sovereignty."
"On a more serious note, it does not mention that this legal inequality is increased two-fold by unequal political legitimacy in the eyes of the citizens."
"We cannot undertake any worthwhile reforms in the European Union if we hide from such huge realities."
"That is why I added a minority opinion to the Napolitano report in order to explain that there will not be any true democratisation of the Union unless we reassess the value of the national parliaments, and unless they acquire direct power in the European decision-making process."
"I described how this could be done in a report submitted to the Intergroup SOS Democracy, which will be assessed at the next Convention."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Napolitano on his report, which has been deservedly praised today, and to which my group has not tabled radical amendments, just a few for the sake of fine tuning."
"This report starts by making it very clear that the European Parliament and the national parliaments, in their own contexts, fully represent the peoples of the European Union who are, Mr Berthu, sovereign peoples, as stated, amongst other things, in their constitutions for more than a century."
"In this regard, I would like to thank Mr Napolitano for accepting my amendment, with which I wanted to highlight this extreme situation, which is almost always invoked by those who want to strengthen a particular institution at the expense of others."
"At the end of the day, this approach is, frankly, ridiculous."
"European citizens need a European Parliament, in the same way that they need their national parliaments, and the relationship between these should not be based on rivalry but on cooperation."
"The report not only reaffirms the need for this cooperation, but also, in my opinion, very realistically calls for it to be organised through an interparliamentary agreement in order to make better use of resources."
"It deals with improving the exchange of information and avoiding overlapping between various activities for cooperation."
"It also recognises the competences of the national parliaments, not only with regard to the governments of the Member States, but in the application of Community Law."
"It shows that these powers are much greater than those which are often known or spoken about."
"If the national parliaments do not want to exercise these powers, that is their own business."
"Mr President, the national parliaments and the European Parliament have to cooperate, not compete with one other."
"Mr Napolitano' s report, as we would say in Spain, 'gets things straight' ."
"From the point of view of cordiality and solidarity with the national parliaments it makes things very clear and lends support to deep, solid and substantial cooperation."
"Let us support it with our vote."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the fact that the European institutions are democratic does not just strengthen our Europe of principles; with the prospect of enlargement, it is the sine qua non for its very existence."
"If the gap between the institutions and our citizens gets any wider, the time will come, sooner rather than later, when they turn their backs on us."
"The role of the national parliaments is predicated on the philosophy that the European Union is a union of states and a union of nations."
"As a union of nations, it expresses itself through the European Parliament and, as a union of states, it expresses itself through the national executives, which in turn rely on the trust placed in them by their national parliaments."
"A strong European Parliament and strong national parliaments."
"The involvement of the national parliaments in the decisions taken by the Council of Ministers must be visible, subject to control and sanctioned by the national parliaments."
"It is the national parliaments which will keep their citizens in touch with developments in the European Union and make them feel that they are European citizens."
"What all this means is that we urgently need national constitutional reforms, as Giorgio Napolitano explains in his exceptional report, so that the Member States' European policy can be constantly baptised in the waters of the national parliaments."
"This in turn means that we need new mechanisms for information to flow from the Union to the national parliaments and to ensure that, institutionally, they are up to scratch."
"The high profile of the national parliaments at the Convention convened to prepare the next round of Treaty reforms is, I think, of historic importance."
"And even if the proposals made by the Convention will not be legally binding on the next Intergovernmental Conference, its democratic credentials will be such that they will be hard to ignore."
"However, what we do not need is for the national parliaments to be represented in a new European institution which gets bogged down in what is, whichever way you look at it, a lot of European red tape."
"Upgrading the role of the national parliaments in giving credence to European decisions will strengthen the procedure in question; at the same time, however, it honours the role of the nation states as the legal and cultural expression of their people in this exciting unifying structure."
"Once again, my warmest thanks to Giorgio Napolitano for his excellent report."
"Mr President, I too should like to add to the list of congratulations issued to the chairman of the committee, who is therefore also the rapporteur for this report."
"A good report has been drawn up, providing a sound basis partly for continued dialogue with the national parliaments but also for an influential role for the committee in cooperating with the Convention. That is because there will be a real need for everyone of first-rate ability, whether they be in the European Parliament' s delegation to the Convention or on the committee."
"These are, of course, years in which we are, in actual fact, involved in an incredibly exciting project aimed at developing an international democracy that is also supported by the people for, despite our having been cooperating for 50 years, we have of course to acknowledge, firstly, that we are only at the development phase and, secondly, that we still do not have full support and understanding for the project."
"This is, of course, something that we have experienced many times in Denmark, where it has been difficult to obtain people' s acceptance of new treaties, and it has now also been experienced in Ireland. I believe that the referendums are merely symptomatic of what is happening in Europe as a whole, and that is what we must take seriously."
"We should not perhaps attach too much importance to what has happened in those two countries."
"It is up to the national authorities to be serious in their response, but I believe we must acknowledge that what is at issue here is more than just isolated Danish/Irish scepticism."
"There is nothing strange about the fact that acceptance is difficult to obtain, for we have been accustomed to using the national parliaments as the basis for our democracy, and now we suddenly have to demonstrate that there is nothing to stop our having both the national democracies and an international democracy and, above all, that they can operate in tandem."
"That is what the challenge is and, in a certain sense, I think we can tell ourselves that we have perhaps been ahead of our time."
"If we did not have the EU that we know today, we should have had to prepare something as a response to the global challenge."
"In reality, it might have been simpler if we had started from scratch, but I now think we must proceed on the basis we already have."
"It is true, Mr President, that involving the national parliaments in the European structure does not imply new institutions, it implies increasing their powers of control and information vis-à-vis their own people."
"As you know, honourable members, there is to be a Convention, the involvement of the national parliaments in which is of historic importance."
"But that is not enough."
"They need clear guidelines on the issues which the Convention will address and which are tantamount to drafting a European constitution."
"In-depth debates are needed, either in plenary or in special parliamentary committees, so that delegates come here to state not just their own personal opinions but the more general line of thinking of their parliaments."
"This is something I have yet to see in the parliaments of the Member States of the European Union, in Greece at least."
"If those responsible for national parliamentary work are not interested in organising this sort of debate, I fear that our debate here will be of limited interest."
"Mr President, among the four Post-Nice topics, I consider the role of the national parliaments particularly important because it can prepare a way into the hearts of Europe's citizens."
"When important speeches are made to this House - even when they are made to better-attended sittings than this one - I often regret the fact that they do not evoke the interest they deserve on the part of the public, and that we tend to be talking to each other."
"What matters, though, is that we should evoke this interest, and, moreover, give the EU democratic legitimacy."
"We will only succeed in this, though, if we can get the public to understand that what is happening in Europe is not just any old thing, but that their future is affected, in real terms, by whether those to whom they have given a mandate can share in decisions about the future and whether their national parliaments can resist it when the EU oversteps the bounds of its competence."
"This report could play an essential part in bringing this about."
"Let me congratulate the rapporteur and, therefore, express my support for him."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the democratic deficit in Europe is being presented as the main problem."
"It is an unfortunate fact that the competences ceded by the national parliaments to Europe have not all as yet arrived at the European Parliament, the only European institution to be legitimised by elections."
"Responsibility for this must be borne by all the Member States that have to date refused to pass on these competences to the co-legislator, Parliament, in the form of codecision in the legislative sphere."
"The governments have thus gained for themselves at European level legislative and executive powers that would have been inconceivable in their national legal system."
"That is the real scandal of the democratic deficit in Europe."
"Are we then to commend the Heads of State and Government for, at the Nice Summit, setting out relations between the European Parliament and the national parliaments as being one of the four topics for the forthcoming Convention and the new Intergovernmental Conference?"
"That would be to put off the governments' lack of capacity and willingness for yet another day."
"This is the fundamental misunderstanding that Mr Berthu has described in his minority opinion."
"Parliament must indeed seek to stand shoulder to shoulder with the national parliaments in order together to compel the governments to act in a democratic way."
"Parliament's two great groups are very much as one in this demand, and I am grateful to our group's Mr Gil Robles for his contribution to the Napolitano report, and to our rapporteur for his Amendment No 21."
"These show the right way ahead into the future."
"That which is feasible and appropriate must be done at every level."
"The national parliaments can and must monitor their national governments better and more effectively than before."
"We wish to encourage them to do so, both as regards the governments' conduct when European legislation is drafted in Council and in terms of the financial management and monitoring of funds granted by the EU."
"The European Parliament must monitor legislation at European level and play a part in shaping it."
"In conclusion, I can only say that we are grateful for the report and hope that it will also be taken seriously by the Convention."
"Mr President, the Napolitano Report does indeed take us one important step towards greater clarity in this debate on the role of the parliaments in the EU, and thus also a step towards greater democracy in it."
"Our objective is, in my judgement, the creation of a parliamentary democracy in the European Union."
"Only then will these issues of legitimisation, transparency and monitoring be able to be satisfactorily resolved."
"'Parliamentarising' the EU means reinforcing all elected assemblies in their relations with their executives at both national and European level."
"Intellectual and political clarity is needed for the debate on their respective roles."
"Some in this House have got all this a bit mixed up together."
"We need to separate the levels at which the national parliaments and the European Parliament will have their roles to play."
"The parliaments have a joint role in the introduction of a constitution, which is a primary role of parliaments rather than of governments."
"Because of this too, we are glad that we have the Convention, and can rejoice that over two-thirds of the Convention's members will be coming from the parliaments."
"For secondary legislation and for the enactment of laws, on the other hand, we have the institutions - the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers."
"I also say that we do not need a third chamber, something that would bring no added value and would only make the decision-making arrangements as a whole more complicated."
"That popular trust is at all likely to be increased by such ideas is something I simply doubt."
"What is important is the strengthening of the national parliaments in their dealings with their national governments."
"Much can be done in this area and there is much still to do, so I believe we should come to an agreement and work together."
"I thank Mr Napolitano for bringing clarity with his report and also for achieving, in the hearings we have had here, greater understanding between the parliaments."
"Congratulations on this report, which I hope will be adopted by a large majority!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Napolitano on his report."
"The issue of relations between the national Parliaments and the European Parliament is one of the central issues of the European debate and will be one of the key aspects of the work of the Convention and it is absolutely crucial that, apart from any delays that might occur and the normal diversity of opinions, this House addresses the issue calmly and intelligently."
"There is no point in sweeping the difficulties arising from the construction of a democratic Europe under the carpet, especially at an historic moment when, even at national level, it is crucial to reinvent and strengthen representative democracy."
"At this stage on the path we have been following together for many years and which we wish to continue to follow with equal commitment on many others, we have an obligation to understand, not to shirk and to claim a special responsibility that comes from the fact that we, the members of the national and European parliaments, are the representatives elected directly by the citizens."
"It is, therefore, crucial that we move towards the national Parliaments and the European Parliament having greater participation and control, both in drafting legislative decisions and in establishing the political guidelines of the European Union."
"As this report clearly acknowledges, none of these parliamentary institutions has exclusive rights to represent Europe' s citizens."
"And hence the need for greater cooperation from the institutions, in an organised and if possible involved way, whilst due respect is given to their autonomy and their specific responsibilities."
"In order to achieve this, we do not need to complicate the decision-making process, to impose competences or to continue to foster suspicion."
"We are simply asking each of the institutions to play their own role better and better."
"We also hope to see greater involvement by the national Parliaments in the political and legislative process of the European Union, and we are, therefore, committed to helping establish conditions for the effective national monitoring of each government in their capacity as a Member of the Council of the Union."
"To conclude, the assessment and the ways forward indicated in this report offer good prospects for the joint work that we will be undertaking in the Convention being able to make this new Europe more democratic, easier to understand and closer to all European citizens."
"Mr President, our new President, Pat Cox, has called on us to show understanding for each other in debate if possible."
"I will try to do so even though I only have one and a half minutes."
"Mr Voggenhuber spoke about how the issue of the national parliaments was brought into play again and again, and I think one must add in the factor that there is of course understandable jealousy and frustration in the national parliaments, which leads to those who come to us joining in an artificial protest."
"A clear delimitation of competences would help there."
"The Convention is also urged to ensure that the parliamentarians are not played off against each other, but that in what is done they should follow the lead we have consistently given."
"To Mr Abitbol, who is constantly lamenting the democratic deficit in the EU, I would like to say that there the argument is being turned around precisely the wrong way."
"The fact that we have this democratic deficit does not mean that we have to bring the national aspect more into play, but that we need all the things we are demanding in this House, such as more democratic institutions, or else we will come to utterly false conclusions and hand Europe's citizens over to precisely those things that the European democracies and the people who care about diversity do not want, that is, being ruled unilaterally by powers subject to no control, in this instance economic forces."
"My final point is that that it is remarkable that the chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has not entered any objection to item 17 of the report."
"That shows that there is something we agree on."
"But the amendments tabled by the Greens, which one feels are about regional institutions as much as national parliaments, merit your consideration and, in my view, your vote as well."
"Mr President, Mr Napolitano has written a sound report on one of the most sensitive themes of the forthcoming Convention, namely the relationship between the European Parliament and national parliaments."
"This topic is sensitive because national parliaments increasingly have the impression that competences are being taken away from them and given to the European Parliament. And if we are being honest, that is true to a certain extent."
"Since the transfer of a number of tasks of the Member States to the European Union, especially in the last ten to twenty years, and since the introduction of the codecision procedure - in other words since co-legislative powers were granted to Parliament - competences have indeed been transferred."
"However, this does not mean that national parliaments no longer have any important tasks to fulfil."
"Paragraph 1 of the resolution is explicit on this score."
"National parliaments must guide their Ministers in the Council."
"In addition, they must check up on their Ministers when they leave the Council, they must ensure that the European directives and regulations are implemented correctly, and they must also ensure that European programmes are executed correctly, both in terms of content and in terms of finance."
"If this is not done properly - as we see it is not in my country in the European Social Fund, inter alia - the European Commission will be claiming back hundreds of millions of guilders."
"In that case, national parliaments have not carried out their work properly either."
"In my opinion, the distribution of the competences between national parliaments and the European Parliament should not become the most important point of discussion in the Convention."
"As Mrs Schleicher has already indicated, particular attention must be paid to the points on which national parliaments have lost competences which have not been passed on to the European Parliament."
"After all, that is where the democratic loophole is, and this is where we should mainly focus our activities in the Convention."
"We must check this very carefully, and we must ensure once again that these competences are returned either to national parliaments or to the European Parliament."
"Indeed, this translates, in my view, into the parliamentarisation and democratisation of the European Union, rather than to a situation in which matters which really belong with the parliaments are left to the Council."
"Mr President, Mr Napolitano has hit the nail on the head on this issue."
"Competence in the legislative and budgetary fields, and in the area of national control, belongs to national parliaments."
"In the supranational context, these competences can only be exercised by a supranational parliament, whatever structure the Convention or the next Intergovernmental Conference may give to this body."
"Mr Napolitano has emphasised the importance of maintaining this difference in powers, and most importantly has underlined the real danger of certain powers bypassing the competence of the national parliaments, in the field of foreign affairs and within the third pillar, for example, which should not be entrusted to a supranational Parliament."
"There is another, much more subtle, way of eroding parliamentary power, which we are now considering, the so-called open method of coordination that is commitology, which is used, for example, in the Lamfalussy report, with few opportunities for parliamentary control, self-regulation or co-regulation."
"I believe that this is an issue that the Napolitano report has also highlighted and to which we should give our full attention."
"Mr President, I would like to start by saying that I join in the congratulations that have been offered to Mr Napolitano on his magnificent report."
"It is clear that we need to give the EU a constitution, that we need to put an end to the current democratic deficit, and that we need to set up a division of powers that has its own characteristics, and that this, naturally, will result in the parliamentarisation of the Union, increasing the competences of the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"But in what fields?"
"The competences of the European Parliament, logically, in the field of control and legislation on Community affairs, and the national parliaments in the field of control of their own governments."
"This control is certainly absent in many Member States and this is a hindrance to the participation of the national parliaments in active control and in the proposal of European issues in each State."
"But there is also another issue: in the debate on the Convention on the future of Europe, I believe that the role of the autonomous communities with legislative powers should also be discussed, in order to produce a coherent and constructive definition of their role within the Union, with the aim, amongst other things, of bringing the process of European integration closer to its citizens and increasing its efficiency."
"This is also what I believe the role of the national parliaments with legislative powers within the Union should be."
"Mr President, I have taken the floor not just to thank all the Members for the support they have expressed, for their suggestions, such as Mrs Maij-Weggen' s suggestion, on the issues which need further analysis and for their well-structured, stimulating expression of reservations."
"I have taken the floor principally to confirm what Mr MacCormick said, that is to make public an undertaking which I had mentioned in private."
"I am fully aware - and I beg Mr MacCormick and the other Members who have signed the amendments to believe me - of the importance of the issue of regional parliaments with legislative powers."
"However, I do not feel that it is appropriate to address this issue now in the context of a report which is expressly dedicated to the roles of national parliaments and Member States."
"In any case, as Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs as well as your rapporteur, I hereby undertake to ensure that this issue is addressed specifically in an appropriate manner."
"Moreover, I would not wish the importance of this issue to be masked by a rejection in Parliament of the amendments tabled."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we have just discussed indicates that cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament has reached a new level."
"I would even go as far to say that a new frame of mind has taken hold."
"Mr Napolitano, I would like to thank you and congratulate you on behalf of the Commission."
"The question of national parliaments, of the role that they must play, that they can be asked to play, in the future architecture of the Union, is related to the question of subsidiarity."
"It is also related to the question of shared legitimacy which goes hand in hand with shared sovereignty."
"In this respect, through the question of national parliaments and through the delimitation of competences on which your fellow Member, Mr Lamassoure, is working, it is essentially the problem of subsidiarity which is raised and this will be one of the key issues for the Convention to deal with via the constitutional process that will be launched in a few days' time."
"It is therefore from this very useful perspective, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that we now have the extremely high quality findings of the European Parliament, which are telling us why and how we must take better account of the national parliaments."
"Why must we do this?"
"Perhaps because the European Union has not taken proper account of this question, from both its national and regional angles, nor has it taken this question seriously enough in the past."
"I say this with the benefit of hindsight and with the benefit of my experience, given that I have been a member of a national parliament for some 22 years."
"I can testify, as several of you can too, I am sure, to feeling a sense of helplessness as a national politician, when faced with so many texts from Brussels, which are merely to be implemented rather than discussed."
"Due to this feeling of fait accompli, the frustration of national politicians - a word that one of you used - is not only directed at the Commission, but also at the Council and the European Parliament."
"Parliament' s desire, as you stressed, Mr Napolitano, to embark upon a new stage in its relations with the national parliaments, is demonstrated by what I would call significant and courageous action."
"This action has been apparent, for some time already, through the active role that the House plays within COSAC, in the many formal and informal contacts between MEPs and national politicians - I can testify to this during the preparation of the Treaty of Nice - and in increased administrative cooperation."
"The Commission is naturally in favour of this new phase, because it is aware of the contribution that the national parliaments can make to the Union' s integration."
"The further we move forward with integration - and we hope that it does progress, in the sensitive areas of national sovereignty, and particularly the second and third pillars - the more pressing the question of the legitimacy of the whole system will be."
"From an objective point of view, there is, for example, a shared interest in having better control of what happens under the third pillar, which is of so much interest to the citizens, and this control could be strengthened by the communitarisation that both the Commission and Parliament desire."
"I therefore think that the approach of the Union institutions must respect two broad principles."
"First of all, it must not bring their legitimacies into conflict, as universal suffrage runs through European integration in several ways; in a direct way for this House and in an indirect way for the Council and the European Council."
"I think that this is one of our assets."
"Then, it must take into account the division of powers which is specific to each State, as well as the prerogatives and the requirements of each individual country' s national parliament."
"You are reflecting on how to better involve the national parliaments."
"The imminent launch of the Convention, which most of you have mentioned, is in itself an initial response to the desires expressed by the national parliaments."
"As I said, the Convention is a result of the effort made by both Parliament and the Commission and the will expressed by the 23rd COSAC meeting in Versailles in October 2000."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, although no one is questioning the importance or the nature of the contribution of the national parliaments, there is - at least, not yet - no consensus on the form that this could take."
"The recent report by Mr Chevalier and Mr Mahou, which was presented to the Laeken European Council, states this quite clearly."
"We now know that we may have two options: either indirectly, by improving the prerogatives of each national parliament in each of the Member States, or directly, by introducing new procedures to enable the national parliaments to intervene more directly in the European decision-making process."
"It is clear that we must underline and strengthen the national and indirect option and it is also obvious that this is the majority' s preferred option."
"The Commission does not have to judge the value of each institutional system."
"On the other hand, it can state its interest in favour of disseminating all the good practices - and we are well aware that some practices in some Member States are better than in others - in terms of information and consultation."
"The Commission can state whether it is willing to examine amending the protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam, in order to take into account these good practices."
"The European option is more direct and certainly the more difficult to take, because, at the moment, the national parliaments themselves do not agree on specific issues."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, we will have to consider the more direct European option when we discuss, for example, the clarification of legislative tasks of the Council, or when we assess the experiments which have already been carried out collectively as part of the work with the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"For its part, and like the House, the Commission does not support the idea of a new chamber, which would, in reality, be a third chamber."
"The European decision-making process is already sufficiently complicated, not to mention, of course, the risks of institutional conflicts that might arise between the third chamber and this House, with which the Commission has, for many years, shared and defended a certain vision and ambition for the Community model."
"To sum up, and as you put it so well, Mr Napolitano, the Convention, which has not yet begun, will deal, in particular, with this key question, which is the subject of your report."
"Some subjects may therefore be raised immediately and, although I do not imagine that we will issue a specific opinion on subjects as closely related to the institutional autonomy of each Member State, Mr Vitorino and myself, who will represent the Commission at the Convention, would like to say that we are ready and willing to provide our ideas and our support to this in-depth examination."
"This may well be what we will do, for example, as regards the role of the constituent power of the national parliaments or even their role in interpreting the subsidiarity principle."
"Ladies and gentlemen, almost all of you have mentioned the Convention, which will take up a great deal of our attention as of 28 February. Be that as it may, I repeat, one of the key issues that will determine the success of the Convention, to bring it up to the highest possible level of ambition, will be our common ability to convince, to lead, to work openly with the national parliaments and from this perspective, Mr Napolitano, I believe that your report is not only courageous but that it will also be very useful."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at noon."
"Management of regional policy and the Structural Funds"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0006/2002) by Mr Pohjamo, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the management of regional policy and Structural Funds (2001/2066 (INI)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank everyone for their active involvement in preparing this report."
"The subject gave rise to some lively debate in committee and there were some good amendments to the report."
"The representatives of the Commission also brought their input to the discussion."
"I am delighted that the committee was in full agreement with the main aims of my report."
"In my opinion, the Union' s economic, social and territorial cohesion is an aim that is as essential as the single market or monetary union."
"The forthcoming enlargement is a major challenge, and it will also bring pressure for reform in the administration of regional policy and the Structural Funds."
"The purpose of this report is to analyse the problems of practical implementation and put forward proposals on how the operation of the Structural Funds might be improved within the framework of the existing rules and what facts should be taken into account in preparing the next reform."
"The report brings a practical viewpoint to the debate on regional policy kindled by the Commission."
"In order to obtain background information for my report, I sent a bulky questionnaire to a number of regions in each Member State."
"Replies have come in from almost every Member State, and, as a result, I learnt of the practical experience gained, directly from the regions and people who had implemented programmes."
"Now I wish to focus on the report' s most important conclusions."
"The first is the increase in effectiveness and results."
"In the practical implementation of the Structural Funds one should be aiming at effective and result-oriented use of appropriations, execution of projects according to timetable, and optimum project quality."
"In the regions, the administration of the Structural Funds is often felt to have become more difficult, and bureaucracy seems to have increased."
"The regions feel the financing provisions are complicated, partly unclear and open to interpretation, although the aim has certainly been otherwise."
"Funding should be channelled as directly as possible to the regions, which should be allowed to differentiate themselves from one another in order to be able to make effective use of the aid from the Structural Funds."
"With cooperation from the regions, Member States and the Union, administration should be improved so that the right actions target the right regions at the right time in terms of getting results."
"Management and its follow-up must be flexible and proportionate to the size of the programmes or projects."
"The n+2 rule for financing must be kept in force."
"The key aim of the report is the simplification and clarification of practices and administration, and increased results."
"The Court of Auditors has also criticised the complicated practices associated with the Structural Funds and called for simplification and better results, and this has also been the Commission' s aim, although there is still much to be done regarding this both by the Commission and the Member States."
"The second conclusion of the report was that programmes should not take so long to get started."
"The new programming period has got off the ground very slowly, with programmes taking as much as two years to be approved."
"The Member States have not been able to forward their documents on time, and the Commission was slow to process documents."
"Simplification and clarification will also help to avoid delays."
"As a possible remedy, the report suggests separating the periods covered by Objective Programmes and Community initiatives so that their preparation is not scheduled for the same time."
"In this way there would be more preparation time for both the Commission and the regions and the sort of delays that are occurring at present would not arise as we move into the next programming period."
"The third important conclusion of the report is that the principle of additionality should be applied."
"The Union' s regional policy has weakened the situation where EU funding replaces national funding: the regions have even seen more national money withdrawn from them that they have received from the Union."
"The Commission should review and clarify the rules for compliance with additionality so that this principle would also apply at programme and regional level."
"The fourth conclusion of the report is more effective evaluation and monitoring of the Structural Funds."
"Monitoring should be more concerned with results: what has been achieved with funding and how."
"Parliament should have open and transparent channels for obtaining information and arranging follow-up."
"The Commission should produce the necessary background information and reports in a clear form so that the committee and Parliament can use them effectively."
"When I was drafting the recommendations for voting, I supported the amendments that reinforced the conclusions of the report."
"My colleagues also tabled amendments regarding the content, which in themselves were worthy of support, but fell outside the scope of this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, this European Parliament own-initiative report now under our consideration is completely right."
"It makes perfect sense for the European Parliament to study, discuss and propose ways of improving the practical implementation and the management of the Structural Funds with a view to achieving greater efficiency."
"Despite the fact that the reform of the Structural Funds culminated in the 1999 Berlin Summit, which made substantial improvements to the way in which it is run, the experience of the last two-and-a-half years tells us that there is room for further improvements."
"The importance of the objectives of the policy of economic and social cohesion, of which the Structural Funds are a fundamental instrument, forces us to make continual efforts to improve. And we are all obliged to make this effort: the European institutions, specifically the Commission, but also the Member States and the beneficiary regions."
"What we really need is a continuation of the work to simplify and to minimise the bureaucracy of the functioning of the Structural Funds, which makes it necessary to improve management methods in areas such as the funding, monitoring, following-up and implementation of the programmes we support."
"By the same token, the Member States and the regions must be more selective in their choices of projects to support and ensure that appropriations are put to the best use and, for this reason, the 'performance reserve' -type mechanisms must be improved in order to encourage and reward the regions that have made the best use of the Structural Funds."
"Furthermore, national economic policies must never neglect the objectives of economic and social cohesion at domestic level, and I would want them to be coherent and not contradict these objectives."
"The same applies to the other Community policies, specifically the common agricultural policy, competition policy and State aid, which could be of enormous value, because of the importance of the legal and financial instruments that underpin them and if they were better directed towards other plans for cohesion."
"Let us focus, lastly, on the need for greater decentralisation, or a more effective implementation of the principle of subsidiarity in the context of the European Union' s policy for economic and social cohesion."
"Obviously, there is still scope in this field to give the Member States and the regions more responsibility."
"The principles of decentralisation and subsidiarity must be taken as far as possible."
"We must, however, be careful."
"Let us not confuse, where the Structural Funds are concerned, the implementation of the principle of subsidiarity with a hypothetical and absurd renationalisation of the European Union' s economic and social cohesion policy."
"The principle of subsidiarity must never be used as an instrument with which to attempt to drain the financial resources of the European Union' s economic and social cohesion policy."
"What this principle requires instead is an effective policy, at European level, of economic and social cohesion, and it also calls for an improvement in the resources allocated to this genuine pillar of European integration, in light of the challenge posed by enlargement and by the drastic increase in the consequent regional asymmetries."
"Let us not forget that countries such as the United States of America allocate more resources to redistribution policies than the European Union."
"Mr President, to sum up, I say 'yes' to greater decentralisation of the management of the Structural Funds; but 'yes' also to maintaining and improving the essential functions of the European Union' s economic and social cohesion policy, which are the redistribution of resources and the promotion of development in its least-favoured regions."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Pohjamo on his work and his initiative, for I believe that we are not dealing with a joint report here."
"This is an own-initiative report by Parliament in which we are attempting to introduce new ideas that will improve the management of the Structural Funds at a crucial time for both the European Union as a whole and for the future of this Fund."
"This report has arisen from the obvious need to improve the management of regional policy, as a whole, and that of the Structural Funds, which needs to be managed in a more flexible way. It also responds to the widespread sense of unease in the European Parliament."
"The room for manoeuvre and involvement of this Parliament when the Commission presents its reports is practically zero."
"Therefore, we believe that it is time to give both the Funds, on the one hand, and Parliament on the other, a greater political role to play."
"It is time to ensure that the delays which currently afflict the management of these important Funds are not ignored; it is time to correct them and to add new features."
"We need to differentiate between the budgetary efficiency of the Funds and their real effectiveness."
"Flexibility is, without a doubt, a factor that will increase the real impact of the Structural Funds on society and on the greater cohesion that we are all looking for."
"We need to introduce new measures for the assessment of these Funds and more socioeconomic parameters, good practices, greater visibility and, of course, better monitoring of the principle of additionality."
"We believe that initiatives such as this, which will hopefully be approved in tomorrow' s vote, will bring new ideas that will improve the management of the Structural Funds and regional policy as a whole."
"This will ensure that we arrive at the new Agenda 2006 with a major element of added value for everyone."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the own-initiative report by Mr Pohjamo, whom I would like to congratulate on his clear approach, once again highlights the objectives that must be met by regional policy and Structural Funds."
"They are the result, no more, no less, of the observation of failures in previous programmes."
"How can we therefore fail to agree with a number of proposals, which are declarations of intent that seek to make the programming system more efficient?"
"I would, however, like to highlight some priorities which appear important, particularly on the ground, when I visit my citizens."
"I hear the first comment time and time again, which concerns the limitation of small projects."
"General simplification is, of course, a laudable objective, but it must not automatically lead to large projects being favoured; only the good projects and those which are useful in terms of development and that are economically viable should be favoured."
"The second comment relates to the political will to increase the involvement of Member States and their local and regional authorities in monitoring, but also, prior to this, in drawing up programmes, because we must bear in mind and remember that the most appropriate level from which to properly judge a project is the level that is closest to the person responsible for its initiation."
"Lastly, every aspect of this subject, whether it be the definition of programmes in the regions, the way they are monitored or developed, or, above all, the way various assessments are completed, reminds me - and I hope that you will forgive me for using this expression - of a labyrinth."
"We must ensure that excessive collaboration and a surfeit of technocratic barriers do not put the projects at risk and do not result, as in France, in the funds being only partially used."
"I cannot conclude without giving my thoughts on paragraph 12 of the report."
"It is curious, to say the least, to see the Commission being asked to interfere in the legal and administrative affairs of the Member States."
"In answer to whether to be more or less regionalised, this is their problem."
"To sum up, it is all the more difficult to allow Europe, on the pretext of regionalisation, to once again assume a right that belongs to it because it results in the Member States being stripped of their substance."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the report before us clearly shows that, now as ever, the management of structural policy is deficient in various respects and, above all, that there is much room for improvement in it."
"I have been carefully reading these reports for years, and the catalogue of defects is always basically the same."
"Admittedly, an attempt was made to simplify regional policy under Agenda 2000, yet I still have criticisms of four key areas: first, a lack of efficiency; secondly, high administrative expenditure; thirdly, high liability to fraud and fourthly, a lack of evaluation."
"I am committed to the fundamental European concept of solidarity."
"It is also in the interests of the prosperous States to bring the poorer ones up to the Community level."
"Despite that belief, I call for a far-reaching reform of the EU's regional policy, without critical examination of which the future of the enlarged EU, especially as regards its post-2006 financial arrangements, will be uncertain."
"Do not misunderstand me: enlargement will cost a fair bit and people have to be told that."
"How sensible is it, though, in reality, for the Commission, for example, on the one hand, to propose cuts in the CAP to the candidates for enlargement and, on the other hand, to make available more extensive structural aid by way of compensation?"
"These Structural Funds can only be used to their fullest extent if the applicant countries take on board the fact that their budgets are going to incur new debts."
"Has the Commission really thought this through?"
"As it is now time for Question Time, we will suspend the debate."
"It will resume at 9 p.m."
"Question Time (Council)"
"Question No 1 by (H-0950/01):"
"Subject: Inhuman conditions in Egyptian prisons Since 1989, Costas Kastanias has been serving a life sentence with hard labour in maximum security prisons in Egypt in connection with the case of the motor boat, the 'Thanasis'."
"He is the sole survivor after the other two Greeks convicted and imprisoned in the same case died under the harsh and inhuman conditions in Egyptian prisons."
"The last person involved in the case to die, Tasos Kontoyannis, did so under controversial circumstances."
"Questions concerning this case have already been put to the Council in the past."
"There is intense public concern about this case in Greece owing to the inhuman conditions in Egyptian prisons ( 3 by 4 metre cells housing 20 people) and the fact that Costas Kastanias' health has been irreparably damaged. Will the Council therefore say whether it will exert its influence to enable Mr Kastanias to serve the remainder of his sentence in Greek prisons?"
"I am also very pleased to be able, on behalf of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, to participate in Question Time in the European Parliament, and furthermore in a parliament which has such a dignified President."
"With regard to Mr Alavanos' oral question, I would like to state that the Council has not had the opportunity to study the matter to which the honourable Member refers."
"This is an issue which essentially falls within the competence of the Member States, and which Greece is dealing with directly with the Egyptian authorities."
"There also appears to be a bilateral agreement between Egypt and Greece on the exchange of prisoners, which aims to enable prisoners to complete their sentence in their country of origin."
"The Council knows that conditions in Egyptian prisons can be harsh."
"Spain also knows this to be true, for its own part and as a Member State of the European Union, because it also has problems with Spanish prisoners in Egyptian prisons."
"Although financial cooperation under the Association Agreement between the EU and Egypt does not directly deal with the issue of the situation in prisons, these two instruments can serve to promote awareness of the conditions in detention centres and the treatment of prisoners. Other Member States have in fact used it to this end."
"The Association Agreement, which was signed on 25 June 2001 in Luxembourg, and which has still not entered into force because some of the ratification instruments have yet to be put in place, establishes respect for human rights as one of its essential features."
"The protection of detained or imprisoned persons features in the international human rights instruments and the National Indicative Programme for Egypt for 2000 to 2004, which comprises a financial package worth EUR 351 million and also provides support for the development of civil society, education and for increasing social protection and the rights of the most disadvantaged and marginalised groups in Egyptian society."
"I believe that, in effect, the Council should use the instruments provided by this Association Agreement to put pressure on Egypt, to become more involved with the fate of EU prisoners in Egyptian prisons, but, naturally, we cannot rely on an instrument that will allow this to take place when it is not ratified and when the ratification instruments are not even in place."
"Therefore, I think that it is a good time to call upon Member States to ensure that this and other Mediterranean agreements that are awaiting ratification are ratified as soon as possible."
"I thank the Minister for his reply."
"My question is an SÏS."
"This is literally the chronicle of a death foretold."
"Three men were imprisoned in 1989."
"Two have died, the most recent from tonsillitis in October 2001."
"Twenty prisoners are kept in cells measuring 3 by 4 metres."
"I call on the Minister, on behalf of this prisoner suffering a living death and on behalf of any Spaniards or other Community citizens, to intervene politically with the Egyptian authorities so that they can serve out their sentences in prisons in the Member States of the European Union."
"Otherwise, Minister, if they get buried in bureaucracy or under the numerous other demands on our attention, we shall end up as accomplices."
"It is a matter for the Greek Government, but the Greek Government does not have the necessary clout, whereas the European Union has a much greater chance of succeeding."
"I have taken good note of the request made once again by Mr Alavanos and I would like to tell him that this matter will be referred to the Council to see if the Presidency-in-Office of the Council of the European Union can take immediate action in Cairo, taking into account the state of health of the prisoner Kostas Kastanias, to whom Mr Alavanos was referring."
"Question No 2 by (H-0952/01):"
"Subject: Binding nature of Article 19(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in any agreement between the EU and the USA on extradition According to media reports, Spain (which is to take over the Council Presidency on 1 January 2002) has proposed a comprehensive EU-USA pact on extradition."
"The author of this question takes the view that the essential cooperation between the EU and the USA in the fight against terrorism must be based scrupulously on observation of the basic principles and values of a constitutional state."
"For the EU Member States, these values include abolition of the death penalty."
"For this reason the author of this question - in line with the main human rights organisations - considers that any future agreement between the EU and the USA must observe the spirit and the letter of Article 19 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, since the death penalty remains in force in the USA and, furthermore, military tribunals are to be set up."
"Does the Council undertake to regard Article 19(2) of the Charter of Fundamental rights as fully binding in any agreement with the USA on extradition?"
"The Council would remind honourable Members that in item 2 of the conclusions of the Action Plan from the extraordinary European Council of 21 September, the European Council calls for the implementation, as soon as possible, of all the international agreements in force in the fight against terrorism, that is to say, all those produced by the United Nations, the OECD and other international organisations."
"The European Union supports the Indian proposal for drawing up, within the United Nations, a general convention against international terrorism, which should enhance the impact of the measures taken over the last 25 years under the auspices of the UN."
"Within the context of its own programme, the Presidency considered it vitally important to create a common area in which the fight against any form of crime, and its more serious forms in particular, such as terrorism, the trafficking in human beings, drug trafficking and money laundering, is undertaken with criteria for regulation and by means of common activities in which all Member States should participate."
"In this context, the Presidency proposes that objectives as important as the European arrest warrant and the abolition of formal extradition procedures should be defined."
"The Presidency also thinks that strengthening relations between the European Union and the United States is highly important and a matter of priority, specifically within the framework of judicial cooperation in criminal matters within the fight against terrorism."
"The Council would like to take this opportunity to state that the question of the status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must be resolved within the framework of the debate on the future of the Union."
"The European Council, at its meeting in Laeken on 14 and 15 December 2001, entrusted a Convention with the task of responding to any issues that might arise during this debate, especially with regard to whether the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be integrated into the basic Treaty and to the issue of the European Community' s signing up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"Without prejudging the answer to this question, the Council would like, all the same, to remind you that Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union states that ""the Union will respect fundamental freedoms in compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed in Rome on 4 November 1950"" ."
"However, Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as deduced from the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, allows it to be established that no-one can be removed, expelled or extradited to a State in which they could be subject to the death penalty, to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your answer, but, with all due respect, I would like to ask you the question once again."
"We are all aware that the necessary cooperation between democracies, and therefore between the European Union and the United States, in the fight against terrorism, is taking place, but this cannot act as an obstacle to the European Union' s vigorously defending the application of its inherent values: in this case, its defence of the abolition of the death penalty."
"Regrettably, in the United States, as we all know, the death penalty is still in force."
"We are also aware that the Convention will deal with the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the future European Constitution, but the Charter was also proclaimed by the Nice European Council and I believe that a proclamation is politically binding on those who proclaim it."
"In these terms, Mr President-in-Office, and taking up the reference you made to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, I ask you: will the European Union extradite any person accused of serious crimes, including terrorism, if there is a possibility that they would be condemned to death or executed in the United States?"
"Mr Carnero González was present in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy when I said, quite clearly and unambiguously, and I am honoured to be able to repeat this here today, that the European Union will never - I repeat - never, allow any European citizen to be extradited, under any kind of agreement with the United States, whilst there is no guarantee of two things - not one, but two - that the death penalty would never be applied, and that they would never be judged by one of these military tribunals that have recently been set up since 11 September."
"I said this in Committee and I am repeating it today in Plenary."
"And certainly, with regard to the abolition of the death penalty, we also said, in a debate that took place right here in Parliament very recently on the position of the European Union in the Human Rights Commission, that one of the main standpoints of the Delegation from the European Union and its Member States in the Human Rights Commission is precisely to fight for the abolition of the death penalty in every country in the world, regardless of religion, culture, etc."
"As the author is not present, Question No 3 lapses."
"Question No 4 by (H-0958/01):"
"Subject: Revision of the common position on Cuba At its meeting in Brussels on 6 and 7 December 2001 the ACP Council of Ministers adopted a resolution which reads as follows: 'The ACP Council of Ministers...2."
"Calls on the European Union to translate this spirit [the entente which emerged during the recent (30 November) visit by the Community troika, as acknowledged in the first paragraph of the resolution] into a substantive revision of its common position on Cuba so as to treat Cuba in a fair and impartial manner; 3. Expresses the firm expectation that such revision of the EU' s common position will lead to Cuba' s accession to the ACP-EC Cotonou Agreement without any special or inequitable conditions whatsoever;...' ."
"What action is the Council of the European Union going to take in response to the ACP countries' repeated request for the common position on Cuba to be revised and for Cuba to be allowed to accede to the Cotonou Agreement on the same terms as the other ACP countries?"
"Has the Council already replied (or is it intending to reply) in any way to this request from the ACP Council of Ministers?"
"The European Parliament is well aware of the dialogue between the European Union and Cuba, which was interrupted by the Cuban authorities when they cancelled the meeting with the EU troika that was scheduled for April 2000."
"The dialogue resumed on 1 and 2 December 2001 with the visit of the troika to Havana."
"The resumption of dialogue is the result of a great deal of hard work by the Presidency, and on which the Council fully informed this House, in its November and December part-sessions in particular."
"The Council also had the opportunity to broach this subject at the meeting of the Joint ACP-EU Assembly in Brussels between 29 October and 1 November 2001."
"On that occasion, the Council stated, amongst other things, that it had never vetoed the inclusion of Cuba in the Cotonou Agreement, but that it was Cuba itself that had withdrawn its request to join in May 2000."
"The Council announced that it was ready to look into the matter once Cuba had officially put forward its application in accordance with the provisions laid down in the agreement."
"On 10 and 11 December, the General Affairs Council carried out its tenth evaluation of the EU Common Position on Cuba and considered that it would continue to be valid, and was the basis for European Union policy on Cuba."
"The Council also considered it essential to pursue the dialogue that had been started in order to achieve tangible results, particularly with regard to future cooperation based on the respect for the democratic principles of human rights, fundamental freedoms and the Rule of Law."
"In this regard, the Council stated that it was waiting for significant signs from the Cuban Government that it was meeting the objectives of the common position."
"The Council also reiterated that EU objectives with regard to Cuba would still consist of promoting the transition to democratic pluralism and the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, sustainable economic recovery and an improvement in the standard of living of the Cuban people."
"After a detailed study and various exchanges of information, the Council also noted serious shortcomings in the recognition and implementation of civil and political liberties, as well as the Cuban authorities' refusal to consider the possibility of introducing reforms that would result in a political system based on these values."
"In spite of this, the Council also noted some positive signs, such as greater religious freedom and the non-application of the death penalty for the last two years, which takes us back to the previous question, concerning EU policy matters."
"Where it is not possible to abolish the death penalty, we need to at least reach at a situation in which it is not applied, as well as a considerable reduction in the number of political prisoners and an increase in the number of ratifications of United Nations Human Rights instruments."
"These are the positive signs."
"The Council was also pleased with the Cuban Government' s decision to agree to sign up to all United Nations Conventions against terrorism, adopted at the sitting of 4 October."
"The Council also noted the importance that the European Union attaches to Cuba' s acceptance of the principles included in the United Nations Pact on Civil and Political Liberties and also of the agreement on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and expresses its wish for Cuba to sign both Pacts as soon as possible."
"Finally, I think it is important to point out that in the context of the tenth evaluation of the EU Common Position on Cuba, the German delegation made a statement in which it approves the Council' s conclusions, but calls on the Commission to produce a framework for cooperation that will be effective in the short term."
"The Council intends to evaluate its common position on Cuba within the next six months in light of developments during this period."
"We would like to once again express our friendship and personal respect for the President-in-Office of the Council, but I have to say that we think it was a mistake to ratify the common position."
"We believe that the common position is a negative thing, that everybody in Cuba, from the authorities to the opposition and the church perceives it to be negative, and that practically all the ambassadors from EU States in Havana consider it to be ineffectual and even counterproductive."
"I certainly believe that this ratification of the common position has acted as a major stumbling block for the reopened process of dialogue that we, like you, wanted and looked upon with a great deal of hope."
"My question is this: How will the Council respond to the repeated requests from the ACP countries for Cuba to be treated like all of the other countries and for it to be offered a guaranteed place as a signatory to the Cotonou agreement?"
"This is the question, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, with no disrespect, that we will be asking once again in Cape Town, in the Joint Assembly, in the presence of all the speakers from ACP countries, who have unanimously asked on numerous occasions for Cuba to be included as a member of their community."
"Thank you and, once again, welcome, Mr de Miguel."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Martínez, my dear friend, when I am asked this question in Cape Town, I shall give the same answer I am going to give you now."
"The EU' s position on this issue has always been positive."
"As I told you, Mr Martínez, during the negotiations on the Cotonou agreement now in force, which were held in February 2000, if my memory serves me correctly, there was already a formal proposal by the ACP committee for Cuba to join when the new Convention was signed, with the total agreement of the Council of the European Union."
"To the surprise of the Council and the ACP countries, the Cuban delegate - at the time the Minister for Industry - disappeared from the meeting, and there was no way this matter could be formalised because Cuba was not present to give its consent."
"When Cuba is ready to take on not only the benefits but also the obligations inherent to the Cotonou Convention, I guarantee that the Presidency of the Union and the Council will agree to it unreservedly."
"There will be no lack of opportunity for this to happen."
"You mentioned the Joint Assembly, and I am talking about the ministerial meeting that is planned under the Spanish Presidency, between the ACP countries and the Ministers of the Council of the European Union, which will take place in Santo Domingo."
"This could be as good an occasion as any."
"We are always willing to give a positive response, if and when Cuba can commit itself to accepting not only the benefits, but also the obligations inherent to the Cotonou Agreement."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Miguel Ángel Martínez and myself, who have both been in politics since 1977, have discussed these matters a great deal and I would like to make one or two comments."
"Firstly, what Cuba wants - as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Pérez Roque, stated to the parliamentary delegation - is for the European Union to guarantee that if Cuba applies for entry into the ACP there will be no opposition on their part."
"Before they make their request to join they want a formal guarantee it will not be opposed."
"Secondly, Mr Martínez and myself have different perceptions of Cuba."
"I met members of the opposition, dissidents, who literally told me that those who are not part of the regime simply do not exist."
"Secondly, there was an amicable debate on the ambassadors' assessments - at least in the meeting I attended - but I would like to know how the opinion of all the governments, with the slight reservation of Germany, can be contrary to the opinion which, according to Mr Martínez, was expressed by the ambassadors: these are keen to establish unconditional dialogue, whilst the governments are keen to uphold the common position and have been since as far back as December."
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council if he agrees with me in his assessment that the Cuban government has a long way to go before it can fulfil the obligations of the democratic clause, both for an Association Agreement and to establish other links with the European Union, and I would like him to expand on the subject of economic freedom, fundamental rights - which was previously called formal democracy, that we now all share - and above all political pluralism, which are the prerequisites of the common position."
"Mr de Miguel, I am afraid I shall ask you not to give the detailed examination of this issue that Mr Garcia is asking for, but to answer this question with the brevity we are used to in this House."
"As briefly as possible, I would like to tell Mr García-Margallo that I basically agree with the line he has adopted."
"I told him previously in my answer that the European Union takes a positive view of Cuba' s joining, as and when Cuba is ready to accept the obligations laid down in the Cotonou agreement, and to build a relationship with the European Union with certain conditions, as everybody is aware."
"Question No 5 by (H-0959/01):"
"Subject: Spanish Presidency and the subhuman situation of women in Afghanistan What action is to be taken by the Spanish Presidency in order to improve the subhuman situation of women in Afghanistan?"
"Mr President, the Spanish Presidency is going to continue with the current Union policy, which is aimed at systematically improving the human rights situation in Afghanistan, particularly in relation to Afghan women."
"In its sitting of 10 December, the Council expressed its support for the Petersberg Agreement, which defined the provisional agreements applicable in Afghanistan and repeated its promise to play an important role in the international effort to contribute to the reconstruction of the Afghan society and economy."
"On that occasion, the Ministers also stressed the particular need to promote the role of women within Afghan society."
"During the ministerial conference on the reconstruction of Afghanistan which took place recently in Tokyo - on 20 and 22 January - the Presidency of the European Commission, in its capacity as co-presidents of the Union in the steering group for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, set out the Union' s position to the other international donors and the provisional Afghan authority."
"The Union' s delegation stated, amongst other things, that the European Union' s assistance would be conditional upon all the Afghan groups unreservedly applying the spirit and the letter of the Petersburg Agreement, the objective of which is the creation of a broad-based, multi-ethnic, fully-representative government committed to acting in favour of sex equality and improving the situation of women."
"Also in Tokyo, the European Union stressed the importance of Afghanistan taking on the work of emergency aid, rehabilitation and development, and that people of all regions, ethnic groups, and in particular women should participate in it."
"The Council will continue to closely monitor compliance with these criteria over the coming months and years."
"In this regard, the Council wishes to point out that the European Union' s special representative in Afghanistan, Ambassador Kleiber, has begun his work in Kabul, assisted by a special representative of the Presidency, Ambassador López Nadal."
"The Council will take special care to ensure that women may participate, and participate fully, in building the country' s future."
"In this same context, the Council would also cite the reply given to oral question H-0897/2001."
"Over recent years, Taliban fundamentalism has hit women, and today its effects are still ruining the lives of Afghan women."
"Men are still armed and this poses an obvious threat."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the day before yesterday a seven-year-old girl was sold into marriage in order for her family to deal with hunger and meet their needs."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has given me a very committed answer, which we already knew."
"To expand on it, and without returning to past questions, would the Spanish Presidency be prepared to adopt any measures to ensure that seven-year-old girls do not continue to be sold into marriage?"
"Would you at least be willing to communicate the urgent need to adopt measures to prevent this horror?"
". (ES) Mr President, I would like to reply to Mrs Izquierdo Rojo by saying that the Union' s policy with regard to Afghanistan on this issue is absolutely indivisible and applies to all possible violations of human rights and of women' s rights in particular."
"The case she mentions is but one more on the list of horrors and suffering experienced by many human beings in Afghanistan, children and adults, men and women."
"And the Union' s policy on all these issues has therefore been, and will always be, the same."
"I can guarantee that we will implement and try to strengthen our political action in Afghanistan and any aid will be conditional upon the safeguarding of these rights, which includes preventing the selling of children into marriage."
"Mr President, I would like to underline, in my capacity as a member of the Committee on Budgets, that Europe is meant not just to be a payer, but also, and in particular, a player."
"I believe, in particular, that social conditions in Afghanistan are anything but satisfactory."
"What matters is that women should be integrated into working life. To do that, you of course need businesses, above all small and medium-sized enterprises and family firms."
"Do you believe it might be possible for us, by means of our payments, to stimulate such things as the setting-up of businesses?"
". (ES) What we are trying to create is an integral development plan in Afghanistan, which we have just begun to do."
"We now have the financial means, which, by the way, are very considerable, since the contribution of the European Union has been, as you know, very significant, the most significant of the contributions of the international community."
"But other members of the international community have also contributed."
"We now have the sum we need to carry out the necessary development plans and naturally the development of small and medium-sized businesses is, in everybody' s view, one of the fundamental elements of the development of Afghanistan, where, in the short term, we cannot expect to see significant investments in large industries and large projects and, therefore, we are going to begin to create all these programmes in conjunction with the Commission."
"We are naturally very aware that women play a very important role in small and medium-sized businesses and this is going to revitalise the role of women within Afghanistan."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, during the Taliban presence in Afghanistan, and before that, the situation of women has been horrendous."
"They have been marginalized, humiliated and persecuted."
"Furthermore, it has been instilled into their beliefs and their way of thinking that this was a normal situation, which makes change difficult."
"We clearly cannot accept the sale of girls, the continuing marginalisation and the lack of recognition of women' s human rights."
"Parliament therefore believes that the Spanish Presidency of the Union could do something more, create some special support programme for these women who have suffered particular marginalisation, because the current situation in Afghanistan cannot in reality be compared with the reconstruction of other war-torn countries."
"Could you expand on the answer which the President-in-Office of the Council has given us on this situation?"
". (ES) I would like to remind you that the responsibility for creating development programmes aimed at making the necessary investments with the money acquired at the Tokyo Summit falls to the European Commission, which has to create all these programmes, which not only relate to the development of small and medium-sized businesses, but above all to education."
"The total exclusion of women from the Afghan education system is well known; by depriving them of education they have been completely denied access to all the assets of society."
"Commissioner Patten and the corresponding Directorate-General of the Commission are creating all these programmes, one of the fundamental objectives of which is - I repeat - recovering the role of women within Afghan society."
"I am not currently in a position to give you any details but naturally I will communicate the concern expressed here in the European Parliament to the Commission, so that the funds may be dedicated in particular to programmes aimed directly at recovering the role of Afghan women in society."
"Question No 6 by (H-0963/01):"
"Subject: Presence of regional governments at Council meetings The federal, regional or decentralised structure in a number of Member States has led them to include representatives of those regions or Länder in their delegations for meetings of the Council of Ministers, as provided for by the Treaty of European Union since the Maastricht reform ten years ago."
"Regional representatives have sometimes led the Member State delegation and, during the Belgian Presidency, have even chaired Council meetings dealing with matters falling within the competence of their regions."
"However, in the case of other Member States such as Spain, which also have regions or autonomous communities with wide legislative powers, the central government prevents the regions or autonomous communities from taking part in their delegations for the various Council meetings, even when competence rests exclusively with the regions rather than the central government."
"How does the Council view this state of affairs?"
"Which Member States with a federal or autonomous political structure similar to Spain's include representatives of their nationalities and regions in their delegations?"
"Which Member States do not do so?"
"Will the Spanish Presidency boost the participation of those regions or autonomous communities in the wake of the recognition given to the regions at the Laeken summit?"
"The Council would remind the honourable Member that Article 203 of the Treaty establishing the European Community lays down that the Council will consist of a representative of each Member State, of Ministerial rank, empowered to make commitments on behalf of that Member State."
"In accordance with this provision, it is the exclusive competence of each State to decide how it is to be represented in the meetings of the Council and who is going to be included in its delegation."
"This decision will inevitably depend on national constitutional agreements which differ between one Member State and another, because each Member State has its own Constitution and its own territorial organisation."
"Consequently, the Council cannot comment on decisions taken individually by a Member State in relation to representation."
"Mr President, nothing could be more true than what the representative of the Council has just pointed out: each Member State clearly has the power to decide the composition of its delegation at each Council meeting."
"Nevertheless, I believe that when, in these Council meetings, the national delegation does not include representatives of the regional governments which have exclusive competence, it creates distancing between the Community and the citizens, on the one hand, and its representatives on the other."
"Some people will call it distancing, others of us call it democratic deficit, especially when some communities do have that opportunity to be represented in the regions and others do not."
"In certain Member States, such as mine, the regions, the Autonomous Communities, are as much States as the central governments, as laid down in the Constitution."
"The President of my region, Galicia, is strongly in favour of this regional participation."
"Nevertheless, it is stated that it is the national government which is represented in relation to external policy, and I would ask: does the Council believe that internal Community policy decisions, in areas such as fishing, agricultural policy and consumer policy, fall within external or international policy or do you believe that they are internal Community issues?"
"Mrs Miguélez Ramos, I cannot agree with your assertion that the regions are as much States as the States of the Union, because the latter are the only members of the Union and the only ones that have the right to participate in the Council of Ministers."
"The regions may have their competences within a context of decentralisation and the concession of competences by the State to territorial regions."
"That concession of competences varies from one State to another and, furthermore, they vary greatly in many countries."
"Even in the case of countries which have made significant concessions of competences, such as Germany, Austria or Spain, the systems are completely different."
"You cannot compare the German federal system with the Spanish system of Autonomous Communities."
"Therefore, the representation of the State essentially takes place by means of internal cooperation and each State can, within this context, represent the interests of the territorial regions of its territory in the way that best suits the general interests of the whole country."
"Community policies are not external policy matters, but Community policy matters, but I would remind you that according to Community policy, the representatives in the Council are the Member States of the European Union and it falls to them to defend the positions which affect all of those countries according to their constitutional system."
"We therefore work on the principle that each State applies its constitution as it stands and that in no way means that the quality of the representation of the interests of the territorial communities depends on any particular system."
"I am grateful for the Council' s reply since it demonstrates that the Council cannot violate the principle of institutional autonomy by which we are governed."
"Secondly, I would like to point out that Spain has been a Member of the European Union since 1986 and since then this institutional framework has been respected."
"And also throughout the period of Socialist government."
"Thirdly, I will say that there are no homogenous positions in relation to this debate, even in the academic field, in the views that the different Autonomous Communities advocate."
"Therefore, I would like to ask you whether you think that it would be more fruitful to improve the role of the Committee of the Regions in the Union' s work."
"I have already said that the essential thing is to strengthen the system of internal cooperation."
"Furthermore, I have not referred exclusively to the country I represent, but to all of the Union' s countries."
"I do not believe that the interests of the Autonomous Communities are sufficiently incorporated into the definition of the policies that the States put to the Council."
"This is essentially done through dialogue, via the established institutional channels."
"I believe that this must be the objective of all the governments of the Union: to have increasingly intense internal cooperation with the territorial communities, above all with those with legislative powers."
"President-in-Office, I represent one of Europe's most ancient and longest surviving kingdoms - Scotland - which is a largely autonomous part of the United Kingdom, to which it belongs."
"Indeed, Scottish ministers sometimes attend and even represent the United Kingdom at Council meetings."
"However, my question refers to the Convention which is being set up to look at the future of Europe, at which no Scottish minister or Member of the Scottish Parliament will be present."
"Do you feel that it would be appropriate for regional assemblies, parliaments and governments to be represented at this very important Convention that is going to decide the future shape of the Europe, of which Scotland and your regions in Spain are very much a part?"
"Mr Purvis, the European Convention is about to get under way."
"It will include representatives from the governments, from national parliaments, from the European Parliament and from the Commission."
"Representatives from the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee are also invited."
"Nothing is preventing any country from including within their parliamentary or governmental delegation people who are particularly concerned with the problems of the regions."
"Therefore each country is free to include who it likes in the Convention."
"Neither the Presidency nor the Council intend to dictate the debate within the Convention."
"The debate will be open and free."
"All issues relating to the regions may be dealt with within the Convention and the latter will make what it feels are the appropriate recommendations to the Intergovernmental Conference on the importance of the role of the regions in the Union' s decision-making process."
"The Intergovernmental Conference will decide on this issue at the appropriate time."
"You know that only supplementary questions may be asked."
"Points of order have been raised and I am going to allow them, but I would ask you not to abuse points of order."
"Mr President, I believe it would have been more appropriate if you had given me the floor first, since in other similar debates, when there have been questions from Members which are similar to each other, you, sitting as President, have combined them all."
"I have Question No 13 which is practically identical to No 6, and I would have liked you, as on other occasions, to have combined questions so that we do not have to debate the same issue twice."
"I do not know if there is still time for you to allow me to put Question No 13."
"I am going to tell you as carefully as possible how the Rules of Procedure work."
"I have never combined questions because that is done by the Presidency of Parliament."
"I am simply presiding over the sitting and I do not have that competence."
"It is something that is decided in advance."
"Otherwise I would very gladly have done so."
"We are going to wait until Question No 13 arrives - I am going to make an effort - so that you, even though it may be a reiteration, can ask it."
"They are important questions."
"Mr President, on a point of order: Mr Purvis has covered much of what I was going to say."
"It is interesting to hear the points of view of Mr Purvis and other colleagues on the issue of Scotland's representation on this Constitutional Convention when the Conservative Party and the Nationalist Party could not even get it together to be part of the Scottish Constitutional Convention which set up and made room for the Scottish Parliament."
"I would like to ask the Minister whether there is a list available to the public and to colleagues here, showing how regional governments are represented in the various Council meetings."
"Mr Purvis touched upon the fact that Scottish ministers attend Council meetings in accordance with their areas of expertise and the areas they are involved with."
"I wondered how other regional governments work in this connection and whether such a list would be available to colleagues."
"In my capacity as President for this sitting and guardian of the Rules of Procedure, I am not going to allow more than the permitted two questions, because that would set a dreadful precedent and deprive the other Members, who have Questions Nos 13 or 14, of being able to speak."
"Put questions in writing, raise your hand at the beginning, quickly and with the reflexes of a parliamentarian, or use the corridor when the President-in-Office of the Council leaves."
"I am requesting the floor for a point of order, if you will allow me, although I have no intention of taking up any debating time."
"I simply wanted to say that, without going into the pros or cons of the system for listing questions and putting them in order, I believe that my question and the question from Mr Ortuondo are very different, despite what he said a moment ago, although I admit that they involve the same issue."
"I agree, Mrs Miguélez, but, as I have said, there is a body for establishing whether questions coincide, and this is predetermined under the authority of the President of this House, not myself, since I am merely in the chair for this sitting."
"Question No 7 by (H-0966/01):"
"Subject: Unacceptable decision to refuse to issue visas to members of FARC-EP At the Laeken Council it was decided that the EU Member States would refuse to issue visas to representatives of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-EP)."
"This decision is a serious new violation of international law and democratic freedoms, since it is directed against a large popular movement in Colombia which has considerable support not only inside the country but also abroad, including in many EU Member States, because of its long-standing struggle for a political settlement to the conflict in Colombia, democratic agricultural reform, democratic and trade-union freedoms and an end to the death squads' reign of terror."
"In view of the fact that the representatives of FARC-EP are participating alongside official Colombian Government representatives in the peace process, which enjoys the support of the EU, can the Council say whether this decision has anything to do with the recent 'law to combat terrorism' and whether it intends to reconsider this antidemocratic decision and to back the process to achieve peace based on a political solution in Colombia?"
"The decision referred to by the Member who asked the question was not taken at the European Council in Laeken, which did not deal with the situation in Colombia, but appears in the declaration of the Presidency, on behalf of the European Union, in relation to the peace process in Colombia of 7 December."
"In it, the European Union indicates that, until further orders, the Member States of the Union will not issue new visas or residency permits to representatives of armed groups, not only of FARC, but all armed groups, without prejudice to the continuation of the efforts of the Member States of the Union which are participating in the dialogue between the Colombian parties."
"The European Union has also expressed its support for the efforts of the Member States of the Union which, on the request of the Colombian Government and the parties in conflict, are taking part in the talks which the President, Andrés Pastrana, has entered into with the ELN and FARC in order to reach a negotiated solution to the conflict."
"This decision has nothing to do with the framework decision on the fight against terrorism which you refer to, but is a part of the strong condemnation from the whole international community of the practices of armed groups, which carry out activities such as kidnaps, extortion and other types of crime which are violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law, and endanger the peace process which is not yet secured in that country."
"The European Union insists that its position in relation to the armed groups in Colombia will be studied and reviewed in accordance with respect for human rights, international humanitarian law and diplomatic immunity."
"The European Union unreservedly supports the efforts to encourage all the parties involved to respect human rights and international humanitarian law, and calls on all of them to condemn the violations of them."
"It also asks the armed groups to free all hostages, foreigners and Colombians, and to immediately renounce these practices."
"The European Union has also urged FARC to return to the negotiating table in order, amongst other things, to deal with the issues agreed in San Francisco de la Sombra in October 2001."
"It is pleased at the resumption of the dialogue between the government and the ELN, and hopes that these two movements will show signs of their determination to seek concrete results aimed at a lasting and peaceful solution to the conflict."
"In its declaration, the European Union also insists that the Colombian Government continues and intensifies its efforts to disarm the paramilitaries and bring the people responsible for the crimes perpetrated, whoever they may be, fully to justice, so that they may pursue - both at a local and regional level, and respecting biodiversity and the environment - the efforts already started to combat illegal crops, the production and trafficking of drugs and that, independently of the peace process, a programme of decisive socio-economic reforms be created and applied urgently."
"As this Parliament knows, the peace process in Colombia is at an uncertain stage."
"The European Union is still actively supporting the peace process and the laudable efforts of President Pastrana and considers that there is no alternative to a negotiated solution to the internal conflict."
"The European Union will make an effort to apply the autonomous commitments adopted within the framework of the European support programme for the peace process in Colombia, provided that security problems do not prevent it."
"Mr President, I should like to say the following to the President-in-Office of the Council: as you know, negotiations are continuing in Colombia."
"However, the solution clearly lies in disarming the paramilitary groups, the so-called 'death squads' , which are still operating with impunity in Colombia."
"The solution also lies in guaranteeing the freedoms and the democratic rights of all citizens, in combating poverty, in moving ahead with agricultural reform and lastly, in guaranteeing the social rights of the Colombian people"
"Now that FARC is sitting at the negotiating table with the Colombian Government, why does it appear that the countries of the European Union are not making an effort to ensure that these negotiations are successfully concluded and provide members of FARC with the necessary visas so that they can, as they must, maintain contact with countries involved in the peace process, and we know that some countries in the European Union are interested in seeing a positive outcome to this peace process."
"This, then, is my question to you, Mr President-in-Office."
"I believe that in my reply I gave a full explanation of the Council' s position and our firm position on not issuing visas to FARC, since we do not believe that they are used for making contacts relating to peace, but for other activities."
"I share the Council' s view that FARC-EP can justifiably be criticised, especially for murders and kidnappings of Indian leaders."
"At the same time, it is absolutely clear that it is the paramilitaries who, aided by Colombia' s military, are responsible for most, by far, of the violence in Colombia."
"If those responsible for the violence are to be deported, it would have made just as much sense to have expelled Colombia' s ambassador."
"Nor must we forget that those on the legal Left in Colombia are systematically executed if they appear in public."
"My practical question to the Council is as follows: did the United States exert pressure and demand that FARC representatives' visas be withdrawn before the EU decided to do this?"
"I also said in my first intervention that the Council is deeply concerned about the activities of the paramilitaries and is putting all the necessary pressure on the Colombian Government so that there is no cooperation of any type on the part of Colombian armed forces with these groups and in order to prevent the general belief that the paramilitaries are in some way acting in connivance with the government, which is not true at all, at least not with the government of Mr Pastrana."
"I therefore agree with what the honourable Member said."
"We do not agree with the activities of the paramilitaries and of course we are putting every necessary pressure on the central government to ensure that it does not in any way aid or collaborate in the activities of these groups."
"I am afraid that the Council did not understand my specific question."
"Perhaps there was an interpreting problem."
"My question was as to whether the United States put any pressure on the EU to withdraw the FARC representative' s visa."
"No, Mr President."
"Question No 8 by (H-0967/01):"
"Subject: Arrests of demonstrators and police brutality during demonstrations on 14 and 15 December During the unprecedentedly large-scale demonstrations in Brussels on the occasion of the European Council Summit at Laeken, on 14 and 15 December, the police violently and provocatively charged peaceful demonstrators and even mere bystanders."
"Undercover secret police officers dressed as demonstrators mounted particularly brutal attacks."
"They beat demonstrators and bystanders savagely, apprehended dozens of citizens without any justification, tied them up and kept them lying on the ground for an hour - even those who were injured and bleeding - and humiliated women by stripping them in front of male police officers posing as interpreters."
"They rode roughshod over fundamental rights which the people had struggled for decades to win."
"The Belgian Presidency and the media tried to cover up the events exposed by legal teams (teams of lawyers working to defend the demonstrators' rights) and by victims of the attacks themselves."
"Is the Council aware of these incidents and, if so, how does it view them?"
"Article 33 of the European Union Treaty clearly stresses that individual measures adopted by police authorities are the sole competence of the relevant Member States."
"Therefore, the Council is not in a position to comment on the issues mentioned by the Member who has asked the question."
"The fact that demonstrations take place at the same time as a sitting of the European Council is completely irrelevant in this case."
"I realise that it was hard to tell when the Belgian Government was acting in its capacity of President of the European Union and when it was simply acting as a Member State, but I would like to know what really happened and why all these measures were adopted despite being condemned by various speakers as breaching the rights of citizens who were demonstrating peacefully in Belgium during the last summit."
"I have already said that I am not in a position to reply to that question, but what I am certainly not prepared to do is agree with the statement by Mrs Figueiredo that the demonstrations were peaceful."
"I was there and I saw it, and many of the demonstrations which took place in Brussels were in no way peaceful."
"There was extremely clear damage in the city and if that is Mrs Figueiredo' s idea of a peaceful demonstration, neither I nor the Presidency-in-Office of the Council agree with her."
"There is no possibility of a reply, Mrs Figuereido."
"I know that you have differing opinions, that has been made very clear, but there is no possibility of a reply since that would lead us into a debate and this is Question Time."
"Mr President, I was, of course, referring to all the peaceful demonstrations and not to the other kind and it is on these that I would like to have an answer, precisely because they were peaceful."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has stated that it is not within his competence to reply to this question and I respect that."
"You have made your clarification and we take note of it."
"Question No 9 by (H-0968/01):"
"Subject: Dismantling of Islamic terrorist group Laskar Jihad in Indonesia Parliament's resolution on Papua (Irian Jaya) and Sulawesi in Indonesia adopted on 13 December 2001 points out that 'the fighters of the Islamic terror group Laskar Jihad, after leaving behind a trail of blood and destruction on the Moluccan islands from 1999 onwards, have now become active on Sulawesi'."
"The result of this situation is that 300 000 of the Moluccas' population of 10 million are now refugees, most of whom are Christians."
"On the island of Sulawesi, the largest Christian town of Tentana, with a population of 50 000, has been besieged by Laskar Jihad fighters."
"Jafar Umar Talib, the leader of Laskar Jihad who was trained in religious warfare in Pakistan, claims that he has 10 000 fighters under his command."
"Afghans and other foreigners form part of the Muslim militia against the Christians."
"What progress has the EU made through the Council on the resolution's appeal to the Indonesian authorities 'to dismantle the Laskar Jihad terror organisation, which is for the most part responsible for the cruelties of the past years in the Moluccas, and to bring the perpetrators to justice'?"
"Has there been collaboration with the USA and what action has the Council taken to secure an end to terrorist violence against the Christians of the Moluccas and Sulawesi?"
". (ES) Mr President, the Council is deeply concerned about the sectarian violence in Indonesia, regardless of the religious or ethnic origin of the victims."
"The Council has expressed this concern to the Indonesian Government and the Union' s other partners, as well as the United States, on several occasions."
"The Council has urged the government to prevent more members of Laskar Jihad from reaching Malaca and central Sulawesi and ensure that those who are already there leave those areas."
"There is still work to do and the Council will continue to take advantage of the cooperation and frank dialogue it has established with the Indonesian Government on these issues to work for an improvement in the situation."
"I wish to thank the Spanish Presidency for its answer."
"I also want to take the opportunity sincerely to welcome Spain to the European Parliament as the country holding the presidency of the European Union for the first half of this year."
"I nonetheless want to ask a number of follow-up questions."
"Does the Council believe that the Indonesian authorities have taken the necessary, adequate measures for dismantling the Islamic terrorist group, Laskar Jihad?"
"Is it the Council' s view that Laskar Jihad is continuing with its terrorist activities, or is any form of de-escalation now to be seen, with the prospect of a cessation of this violence against innocent people, mainly Christians in the Moluccas?"
"Last of all, I wonder if the Council considers there to have been close cooperation between the United States and the European Union in combating this Muslim terrorist group."
". (ES) Unfortunately, Mr Sacrédeus, the measures taken are never sufficient to beat the terrorist threat."
"Naturally, the Laskar Jihad organisation can be classed as an organisation of this type."
"Therefore, I do not believe that the threat has been contained and nor do I believe that the Indonesian Government, however many measures it has taken, is able to deal with the threat to Indonesia posed by this very large organisation."
"You ask me whether the European Union and the United States should cooperate."
"I believe that this cooperation is at the heart of all the political declarations made since 11 September."
"The European Union and the United States now have a common front in the fight against terrorist threats in any part of the world where they may take place and we are holding dialogue with the United States precisely in order to help Indonesia to contain the threat posed by this terrorist organisation."
"Question No 10, by Guido Podestà, which has been taken over by Mrs Sartori."
"Question No 10 by (H-0969/01):"
"Subject: The situation of women in Nigeria - the case of Safia Husaini Tungar Tudu The case of a thirty-year-old Nigerian woman, who was married at the age of 12 and has four children, the last of whom was conceived as the result of rape, for which she has been sentenced to death by stoning, arouses serious concerns regarding the situation of women in many African countries, including Nigeria."
"According to Sharia law a married or divorced woman is guilty of adultery if she has sexual intercourse with another man, even if, as in this case, she is the victim of rape."
"The political and military power established under undemocratic regimes entails control over the private lives of those subject to it."
"This control extends to the birth of children and hence women are more exposed to punitive and often inhumane laws."
"Can the Council say what new steps it intends to take to ensure the abolition of practices which violate fundamental human rights?"
"Can it also say what steps it intends to take to promote a process of democratisation and secularisation in countries such as Nigeria, where the interpretation given to religious law (which in fact distorts the true meaning of the religion concerned) adversely affects the rights of women in particular?"
"What action will the Council take as soon as possible to ensure protection for the life and dignity of the Nigerian woman referred to above?"
"Mr President, the Member States of the European Union and the European Commission have decisively supported, in a coordinated fashion, the international efforts in favour of Mrs Safia Husaini."
"The European Union has studied the possibility of taking formal action in the event that the Islamic Court of Appeal, the Sokoto Sharia, confirms the sentence."
"The European Union has already expressed its concern at sentences passed in accordance with Islamic criminal law, the Sharia, during the 57th sitting of the UN Human Rights Commission in 2001."
"The Member States of the Union and the European Commission - in coordination - have decisively supported international efforts in favour of Safia Husaini, in accordance with the meeting organised by the European Union' s Heads of Mission in Abuja on 23 January."
"The Spanish Presidency proposed to the Member States that we make a representation to the Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister, in order to express the European Union' s new position in the field of the application of the death penalty."
"This representation was formally approved by the Council of Ministers of the Union, which took place last Monday, and has been carried out by the Presidency of the Council of the Union to the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria."
"With regard to the broader issue of respect for fundamental rights and specifically women' s rights in Nigeria and the rest of Africa, the Council is determined to pursue the policy which it has long been implementing in this field and, in particular, by means of the following instruments: the Cotonou Agreement, Article 9(2) which lays down the parties' obligations, their international commitments, in relation to the respect for human rights, and reaffirms the equality between men and women, the Cairo declaration and action plan approved at the Africa-Europe Summit held in Cairo in April 2000, which insists on respect for human rights, the Common Position relating to human rights, democratic principles, the Rule of Law and good government in Africa 98/350/PESC and Council Regulation (EC) 965/99, which establishes the requirements for the application of Community development cooperation actions which contribute to achieving the general objective of development and consolidating democracy under the Rule of Law, as well as respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms and specifically Common Position 01/373/PESC on Nigeria, which expressly mentions the respect for human rights."
"Thank you, Mr President, for your comprehensive response to our question."
"The events of recent days compel us, however, to call for a further Council initiative, for, as you will know, not only has another woman, in addition to Safiya Yakubu Hussaini, been sentenced to death by stoning - Aishatu Abubakar, whom the same court in the same region of Nigeria condemned to a similar sentence on similar grounds a few weeks ago - but the news has arrived today that, in the Sudan, a young 18-year old Christian woman named Abok Alfa Akok, who does not speak Arabic, has also been sentenced to stoning by what is, in this case, a civil, not a religious court, without being permitted a defence and without being given a linguistic translation either."
"Well then, I believe that the undertakings assumed by the Council are important but that, alongside them, there should also be constant protection in individual cases."
"I therefore place in your hands these two new cases as well as that of Safiya."
"I fully agree with you that the Council must continuously monitor all these humanitarian cases which affect individuals and countries with which the European Union has a preferential relationship by means of the Cotonou Agreements, in this case Sudan and Nigeria."
"I take very good note of both cases which, naturally, I am unaware of. But I will do what I can to obtain all the necessary information through the services of the Commission and through our own diplomatic services."
"I assure you that the Presidency of the Council of the European Union will make the Member States aware of these facts, we will take the necessary measures and we will take immediate diplomatic action to protect the rights of the two poor women you have mentioned."
"President-in-Office, the justice minister of Afghanistan recently announced that the new interim government would maintain the Sharia law sanctions of stoning women to death for adultery and of limb amputation for theft."
"The latter penalty was even supported by Prime Minister Karzai in a statement made at a press interview in America."
"The EU has just pledged EUR 1.5bn in aid to Afghanistan over five years at the Tokyo Conference."
"Should this not be made conditional on the disapplication of internationally unacceptable, cruel and unusual punishments such as those I have just referred to?"
"In fact, our aid to Afghanistan, for the development of the country, and the payment of the significant sums you have mentioned, which were laid down at the Tokyo Summit, are conditional from the outset, according to the Council' s declarations, upon respect for human rights in Afghanistan and in particular the application of equal treatment between men and women."
"I believe that in the case you have mentioned, the European Union must state that, although we respect the traditions and the religion of Afghanistan, we also demand that human rights be respected in that country."
"And the execution of Islamic sentences is not compatible with our notion of respect for human rights."
"Nevertheless, I would like to remind you that it is common practice in all Islamic countries to apply the Sharia, the Islamic law."
"Afghanistan is not the only country where these violations are committed."
"We have already heard what happens in some African countries."
"It would take a very long time to list all the cases of application of Islamic sentences in other countries of the Middle East which there are genuine violations of human rights and in particular the rights of women."
"I believe that the European Union must be a pioneer in terms of defending these rights, but we must take the necessary precautions not to offend religious feelings since, as you know, there is currently a debate about the clash between the Islamic and Christian civilisations and we need to apply the necessary prudence."
"However, the case you mention must be taken into account and I will certainly raise it in the Council and the Commission so that it may be monitored and we will try to prevent this sentence being carried out."
"Question No 11 by (H-0971/01):"
"Subject: Turkish ban on the foundation and operation of parties with the word 'communist' in their name Human and democratic rights are systematically and persistently violated in Turkey, a country which is a candidate for membership of the EU."
"One such instance is the ban on the foundation and operation of parties with the word 'communist' in their name based on the antiquated provisions of Article 96 of the Law on political parties, which dates from 1920."
"The Socialist Power Party of Turkey was founded in 1993 and operates legally."
"It has fought vigorously for democratic rights and takes part in elections."
"At its last congress, it decided to change its name to the Communist Party of Turkey but, because of the abovementioned undemocratic law, it is in danger of being banned."
"At the moment, the Turkish Parliament is in fact debating amending the law on political parties, which may provide an opportunity to abolish the undemocratic ban."
"What is the Council's view of the ban under Turkish law on the foundation and operation of communist parties?"
"Does it consider that Turkey can become a member of the EU without first having lifted the ban?"
"Will it raise the question of amending this undemocratic and reactionary law with the regime in Ankara so that the Communist Party can engage freely in political activity?"
"In fact, Turkey is drawing up a draft amendment of the law on political parties."
"However, the truth is that we do not know the exact content of this draft law because it has yet to be submitted to the Turkish Government."
"We therefore only have references."
"The Council is not aware, even from these references, that the activities of the Turkish Communist Party are being hindered nor that there is any threat to ban it on the basis of an obsolete provision of the former law on political parties."
"In terms of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey more generally, the Laeken European Council concluded that Turkey had made progress towards complying with the criteria set for accession, particular by recently amending its Constitution, and that there was therefore now more possibility of opening accession negotiations with that country."
"Turkey is being encouraged to make more progress towards compliance with the accession criteria - the famous Copenhagen criteria - particularly in relation to human rights."
"The Council is closely monitoring the efforts for institutional political reform currently being made by Turkey and is especially focussing on whether those reforms will lead to real improvements in relation to human rights and fundamental freedoms in that country."
"As we all know, this situation is still highly unsatisfactory in many respects."
"The Council will be sure to question Turkey in the event that the intended amendment of the law on political parties in any way threatens democratic freedoms."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am astounded that the Council knows far less about this than the Turkish press."
"For example, it is a known fact that the relevant committee of the Turkish National Assembly has submitted a bill on parties in which no changes have been made as regards the ban on the word 'communist' ."
"I also find it hard to understand why the Council does not know that members of the Communist Party of Turkey are being prosecuted, given that 150 members have been arrested and their offices have been raided, all from the day it opened for business."
"But apart from all that, there were one or two quite specific points in my question, to which I have not received a reply."
"Does the Council consider that Turkey can be a candidate country, or rather can it become a member of the European Union without first having lifted the ban?"
"I did not receive a reply to this specific question."
". (ES) I think I have made it clear, Mr President, that the Copenhagen criteria are absolutely fundamental before we can think about starting any type of negotiation on any hypothetical future Turkish membership of the Union."
"I think I have made that clear. I am sure that the Member who asked the question is perfectly aware of the Copenhagen criteria and I therefore believe that this statement by the Council makes it absolutely clear that our view is that no type of negotiation can begin with Turkey until the Copenhagen criteria have been fully respected."
"Question No 12 by (H-0001/02):"
"Subject: European Council support for a United Nations Convention on Disability Has the European Council discussed support for the proposed United Nations Convention on Disability, and which Member States are expected to vote in support?"
"Will the President-in-Office arrange for this issue to be tabled for further discussion at the High Level Group on Disability?"
"And will he use the Office of the Presidency to promote support in third countries outside of the EU?"
"Mr President, the European Council did not debate the issue mentioned by Mr Howitt."
"The Commission has taken no initiative in this area in relation to the Council."
"I would also like to remind Mr Howitt that the high level group on disability does not belong to the Council but to the Commission, and it would therefore be both more practical and more appropriate for the Commission to provide information on its debates."
"In it contacts with third countries, the Presidency will raise all the issues it considers important and appropriate to deal with."
"Mr President, I do not think that is the most helpful answer a Member of the European Parliament has ever been given in this Chamber so perhaps I can ask the President-in-Office whether he could give me a little more encouragement."
"Is he aware, for example, of the request from 37 million disabled people in Europe and many outside our borders that the United Nations should enforce better rights for disabled people?"
"Is he aware that next year is going to be the European Year of Disabled People, and is he taking an interest in that?"
"Is he aware that since 1996 we have had a rights approach to disability that would suggest that we should support such a Convention?"
"In his answer he has given no evidence whatsoever that he is aware of those facts."
"Given that he has admitted to this Chamber today that he and his colleagues have not even discussed this issue, at the very least will he respond to the request from this Parliament that he should table such a discussion?"
"If the members of the high level group on disabilities convened by the Commission are all members of the Council, it is within his power to do that if he wishes."
"Perhaps he will now answer the point."
"I feel I have given you a clear answer to your question, Mr Howitt."
"This does not in any way mean that the Council has no concern for disabled people."
"But you asked me whether the European Council has discussed this issue and I have told you that it has not."
"I have simply said that it has not discussed it, which does not mean that it is not going to discuss it or that it has no desire to, but simply that it has not yet done so because it has not had the opportunity so far."
"This does not mean that the Council is unaware of the problems of disabled people or the coming events and international meetings on the disabled in which Member States and the European Union itself will have to adopt a position."
"I have suggested that you address this question to the Commission, which, since it leads the high level group on the disabled, will be in a better position than me to give you a concrete answer."
"As we all know in this House, disability rights feature prominently within the Spanish system."
"Indeed, in many areas of disability rights Spanish law is a model that other Member States could usefully follow with regard to integration, access and equal treatment."
"Following on from that, could I urge firstly the President-in-Office to use his good offices and his benign influence on his colleagues within the Council to ensure that there is a strong European Union voice and presence at the United Nations Convention on Disability?"
"Secondly will the Spanish presidency guarantee that it will put equal access and equal rights for all disabled people in the European Union at the top of the agenda?"
"Thirdly and finally, in preparing for 2003 as the International Year of the Disabled, will it also give extra support to the Special Olympics, which will take place within the European Union in 2003?"
"I simply want to reply to the honourable Member that I have taken good note of his suggestions to the Presidency and that we will always be prepared to contribute to the European Union taking on an increasingly active role in relation to disabled people and, in particular, in relation to the United Nations Convention on disability."
"Question No 13 by (H-0005/02):"
"Subject: Appearances before the European Parliament and involvement in its business on the part of Spanish ministers during the Spanish Presidency The year 2002 has just begun and Spain has taken over the rotating EU Presidency."
"The previous incumbent was Belgium and during its six-month term of office not only the country' s Prime Minister and other government ministers, but also the government leaders and ministers of the various Belgian regions, appeared before the European Parliament and chaired some of its meetings."
"Since it is laid down in the Spanish Constitution that the Kingdom of Spain is a state comprising autonomous communities which have exclusive powers that in certain cases are similar to and even greater than those of Belgium' s regions, would the Spanish Presidency say why no plans have been made for representatives of any of Spain' s autonomous communities to appear before the European Parliament and to take part in its proceedings?"
"The Council would remind Mr Ortuondo that Article 203 of the Treaty establishing the European Union lays down that ""The Council shall consist of a representative of each Member State at ministerial level, authorised to commit the government of that Member State"" ."
"Apart from this provision, it falls to each Member State to decide the composition of its representation and, therefore, it falls to the Presidency to establish, in its capacity as such, how it will be represented in its appearances and parliamentary acts."
"This decision will inevitably depend partly on national constitutional provisions, which differ from one Member State to another."
"It therefore follows that the Council cannot make any comment on the decisions taken by the Presidency in relation to its representation, and in particular, to the contacts it maintains with the European Parliament."
"I would firstly like to thank you for your answer to the previous question on this same subject."
"As you will have realised, the reply just given by the President-in-Office of the Council is the same as the one he gave to Question No 6."
"I would like to point out that Article 203 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities speaks of 'ministerial rank' and, both in the meetings of the Councils of Ministers and during the Presidency, there is quite naturally participation by representatives of the Belgian regions or autonomous communities, or whatever you want to call them, and also - as the MEP who spoke about this said earlier - the region or nation of Scotland, the German Länder or the Austrian States and other such examples within the Community."
"In this regard, I would like to ask whether you consider the Spanish Government' s action in this respect to be appropriate."
"When talking about, for example, economic and financial affairs, or a plan for budgetary stability, it reaches agreements with the other governments of the Union, but when the same is to be raised on the level of the Spanish State, you impose it by law, instead of seeking agreement and consensus with the Communities which have exclusive competence in these areas."
"I can only reply be repeating my previous answer on this issue."
"It falls to each State to organise its representation in the Councils of Ministers and in Parliament in accordance with their own internal laws and constitutions."
"Mr Ortuondo gives some correct examples and some less correct ones, because it is true that there may have been some Belgian representation or, in some cases, some representation from a German Land, but I do not remember ever seeing Scottish Ministers in any Council."
"Perhaps he is confusing the Scottish Secretary, who is a Minister of the Central British Government, with a representative of the Scottish Government."
"That is a great mistake."
"There should not be any confusion on this issue and I would like to make it perfectly clear that it is the governments which decide on their representation and there is therefore nothing more to say on this issue."
"With regard to Mr Ortuondo' s question, there are two aspects which I would like to mention."
"The first is the invoking of the constitutional foundations of a State, which are constantly being called into question by Mr Ortuondo' s party, demonstrating its irresponsible and destabilising attitude."
"The second is the curious analogy we have heard about other States of the Union, Belgium for example, when it is well known, except amongst those displaying ignorance or bad faith, that the territorial organisation of the Belgian State obeys a very complex and unique system, involving the interlinking of cultural and linguistic communities with political communities, and a system of compatibilities between federal responsibilities and regional responsibilities which is completely different to the situation of the Autonomous Communities in Spain."
"In this context, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to know whether you agree with the view that this rich diversity in the territorial organisation of the States making up the Union is something which stimulates, enriches and strengthens European democracy, which prevents homogenising reductionism - despite what Mr Ortuondo seems to think - and that, of course, it must be fully respected by the Community institutions."
"Mr President, I have nothing to add to what I have already said."
"I believe that the diversity of the Union is guaranteed by the respect for the constitutional systems of each country, and each country organises its presence in Councils, and during its presidency, and in other institutions, in accordance with its internal laws and constitutional provisions."
"Mr Vidal-Quadras said that the party I represent, and I myself, want to subvert the Spanish Constitution."
"The positions we advocate have nothing to do with subversion."
"According to the Spanish Constitution, the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country, to which I belong, has certain exclusive competences in certain areas. On tax issues, for example."
"Decisions are habitually made in the Council of Ministers of the European Union on fiscal issues while the interested parties are not represented there to defend themselves, as is the case with our Autonomous Community of the Basque Country and the Autonomous Community of Navarre."
"We do not feel represented by the Madrid government because we have frequent differences on the issue of sovereignty; a sovereignty which has not been granted us as a result of the generosity of the Madrid government, but which originates from the historic rights of the Basque people."
"I would ask Members not to enter into debates on situations relating to their respective countries, but rather to put questions to the Council."
"On the other hand, all opinions have the right to be expressed in this House as long as they end with a question, as has been the case with Mr Vidal-Quadras and other Members."
"All I ask is that the Rules of Procedure be respected; otherwise, the danger is that, during the Presidency of a particular country, questions will focus on problems and debates specific to that country."
"As the author is not present, Question No 14 lapses."
"Question No 15 by (H-0010/02):"
"Subject: Biological and toxin weapons On 15 November 2001, Parliament adopted a resolution (B5-0708/2001) on negotiations within the framework of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention following the recent anthrax attacks."
"At the fifth review conference of the Convention held in Geneva last November, the US delegation was the only one of the 144 countries represented which refused to recognise the legal commitments ensuing from the Convention. Will the Council, therefore, say what steps it will take in response to Parliament's resolution to secure multilateral disarmament and the non-proliferation of biological and toxin weapons by way of a legally binding protocol?"
"Do not worry, Mr President, I am pleased to answer this question."
"As Mr Papayannakis no doubt knows, the European Union has been playing an active role in the negotiations with the ad hoc group of States which are parties to the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons and in the 5th review conference, held in Geneva from 19 November to 7 December 2001."
"This activity was based on the common positions adopted in 1996, 1998 and 1999 and on the conclusions of the Council of 11 June 2001."
"The European Union therefore regrets that, after six years of negotiations on the basis of a unanimously agreed mandate, the 5th review conference of the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons has not managed to adopt either a final declaration or a document with concrete measures to strengthen that Convention."
"To strengthen the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons is still one of the Council' s priorities in the field of health."
"In accordance with the conclusions of 10 December 2001, on the repercussions of the terrorist threat on the European Union' s non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control policies, the Union intends to actively promote the global and effective application of multilateral instruments in the field of non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control."
"With regard to the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons, the European Union confirms that the mandate of the ad hoc group of States which are parties to the Convention is still valid."
"The Union has decided to continue its work towards a successful conclusion of a 5th review conference of the Convention, newly convened for November of this year."
"Thank you for your reply, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and for your statements as to what the Council and the Union intend to do about these terrible weapons."
"However, the problem which we are up against, Mr President-in-Office, is this: the United States wants out of the agreement because it is legally binding."
"You say that we shall keep trying to achieve something more specific in the future."
"My question is this: what talks are you holding with the United States, what can you do to make them change their mind and what information do you have on the matter?"
"Because everything else depends on this."
"I do not question your good intentions, what I do question is the analysis of the situation which the President-in-Office's statement appears to contain."
"In fact, we have one particular hope: that in November 2002 we may have an agreement at this 5th review conference of the Convention."
"But that agreement will not naturally be complete if the United States does not participate, and this issue is therefore one of the issues included in the current dialogue with the United States, with a view to the preparation of the summit between the European Union and the United States which is expected to take place before the end of the Presidency - certainly in June, if not in April, since the date is yet to be decided."
"Our argument with the United States is that, not only would the non-participation of the United States in this 5th review conference of the Convention and its new agreement damage the credibility of the whole international effort, but that to have a clear position on the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons is also one of the agreed actions which can be carried out jointly by the European Union and the United States in order to implement measures to combat the terrorist threat."
"Because it is well know that these biological and toxin weapons may be used for criminal purposes by international terrorist organisations."
"Therefore, the more committed the whole of international society is to this issue, and the United States in particular, - since it is one of the top producers of biological and toxin weapons - the better."
"I believe that this is being included in the dialogue we are holding with the United States in the Senior Level Group and in the agreements we want to reach with the United States at the summit between the United States and the European Union, which is going to take place during this six-month period."
"As the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 16 to 37 will be replied to in writing, apart from Question No 36 which deals with an issue which is on the agenda."
"That concludes Questions to the Council."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 7.15 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Management of regional policy and the Structural Funds (continued)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A5-0006/2002) by Mr Pohjamo, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the management of regional policy and the Structural Funds (2001/2066 (INI))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this own-initiative report is concerned with analysing problems in the use actually made of the Structural Funds and with submitting proposals as to how their management and effectiveness could be improved, not least with a view to the next pending revision of post-2006 regional policy."
"The rapporteur has succeeded both in highlighting the improvements achieved in the wake of the 2000 reform of the Structural Funds and also in drawing our attention to difficulties in their application, especially the problems in connection with the delayed implementation of the programme."
"It is these to which I wish to give particular attention."
"Although it was an essential objective of the pre-2000 reform of the Structural Funds to avoid repetition of mistakes from the beginning of the 1994 planning period, but rather to get fully involved in the first year, this has only partly succeeded."
"Negotiations on the programme still took up too much time."
"The guidelines set out by the Commission were not always understood in the regions."
"Negotiations were often delayed through the pace at which the Commission worked and through slow response times, which were sometimes contingent on new requirements imposed by the Commission. It is reported from the regions that these in turn were seen there as merely petty."
"On the other hand, the Member States were not always prompt in sending in the programme documents and the additional items of information that had been requested."
"All these things, Mr President, are facts - facts of which I had warned when I was the rapporteur presenting an own-initiative report in the same terms, appealing urgently for the start of a new planning period not to again be delayed as it had been in 1994."
"Let us then now draw the right and necessary conclusions for 2006, or else reports of that sort will in fact be nothing more than wastepaper."
"There should be no gaps occurring between programming periods."
"That is why I support the rapporteur's proposal that we should also examine whether in future there should not also be separation and limitation of the periods for which project-oriented programmes and Community initiatives run."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Mr Pohjamo' s resolution included some amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and some tabled by Mr Fava and myself."
"I would like to draw your attention to two amendments which I feel to be important: the amendment on the principle of additionality and the amendment clarifying the concept of cross-border region."
"Additionality is essential so that Structural Funds appropriations supplement national funds rather than replacing them."
"I would add that Parliament cannot and must not be a spectator in the management of structural expenditure."
"In this respect, I would put forward two guidelines: firstly, the reform and modernisation of the public administration; and secondly, the establishment of development banks consistent with PEP and SPD parameters."
"I will end by calling upon Commissioner Barnier to take note of the fact that there needs to be some flexibility in the application of automatic decommitment in that the process must recognise those who are working successfully in the same Member State."
"It is right that the idle should not be allowed to get away with it, but it is also right that those who benefit should be the best, the most far-sighted and the most modern."
"Mr President, Parliament must make an assessment of the quality of projects according to the results achieved a priority, and the Commission must ensure that Parliament is in a position genuinely to carry out careful monitoring."
"In this sense, the proposed informal working group will be useful."
"Sometimes, however, the Commission does not respond within the time allowed and certain States are guilty of this too, particularly in the negotiation phases."
"It is therefore appropriate to pause and take stock of the situation in order to enable the Commission to provide responses more quickly, to achieve uniformity of provisions on the different funds as quickly as possible, to ensure that we progress along the road of streamlining bureaucracy - making increasing numbers of regions and local communities accountable and providing them with consultancy services - and to speed up the automatic decommitment mechanisms so as to allow swift reallocation of funds and the drawing up of an annual detailed, specific report which will make it possible to proceed with full knowledge of the facts from evaluation to programming."
"Moreover, a bridge programme should be envisaged allowing certain States, including Italy, to make use of the unused funds from the 1994-99 programming period, similarly to what happened at the end of the 1993 programming period."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Structural Funds were designed to support the effort that the Member States put into their regional development policy and thus to strengthen the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the European Union."
"It must be noted that the aid provided by the Structural Funds to the most disadvantaged regions is absolutely vital and that the contribution of these funds has become essential in enabling certain regions, which are lagging behind in development, to catch up, particularly the outermost regions, which I know well."
"The start of the new 2000-2006 programming period has once again shown us the problems in the practical implementation of the Structural Funds, with the Member States regretting the time taken by the Commission to approve the general programme guidelines and the Commission criticising the time taken by the Member States to submit their programming plans and the additional information requested."
"It is essential that the next programme negotiations are kept within strictly limited, precise and binding time limits, so that the Member States and the Commission respect the rules laid down."
"The time that elapsed between setting up the programmes is, without doubt, one of the reasons that explains why the initial figures on their execution are so disappointing, but this is, of course, not the only explanation."
"Following Agenda 2000, the processing of the funds was decentralised and each Member State gained overall responsibility for implementing, monitoring and ensuring the efficiency of the structural interventions on its territory."
"As for France, I wish to formally appeal to the prefects of the regions that are eligible for Objectives 1 and 2 to make every effort to mobilise and encourage those responsible for the projects and to give them all the necessary technical support to enable them to carry out the programmes more successfully."
"Unfortunately, it is often difficult to involve businesses in Community programmes, since the management of the projects appears complicated and the procedures appear slow."
"This is an aspect that the national authorities must focus on, without fail, in order to enhance the attraction of Structural Funds in the private sector."
"Lastly, to conclude with a firm proposal, I think that one of the ways to simplify and lighten the administrative burden would, in fact, be to introduce a single regional development fund in 2007."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are debating the own-initiative report on the management of regional policy and the Structural Funds presented by Mr Pohjamo, whom I would like to thank for his good work."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled five amendments because we want to highlight some of the aspects relating to the issue we are dealing with."
"Firstly, while we agree that cooperation with other agents - other than State and regional governments, that is to say, with local communities, NGOs, private bodies, etc. is beneficial in terms of achieving the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union, we do not believe that that cooperation has been satisfactorily respected in all the Member States, but that it has been applied in an unequal fashion."
"We therefore affectionately urge the Commission to try to ensure that socio-economic and environmental cooperation be applied equally in all regions receiving Community Funds and to ensure that the programming of projects is subject to consultation with the parliaments and governments of the constitutional regions which have legislative powers."
"We also demand the creation of clear indicators intended to assess the application of this cooperation principle."
"Furthermore, within the framework of the guidelines for the intermediate evaluation of September 2002, we want the Commission to define indicators for the efficient allocation of the reserve which, as well as financial management, take account of other aspects of management, such as cooperation, additionality and the quality of expenditure."
"At the same time, we ask that, in the event that unspent resources are reallocated, the appropriations which are not used be directed towards the least-favoured regions which are most active and innovative, as well as measures in favour of sustainable development."
"Finally, in support of the rapporteur' s idea - with regard to including the quality aspect in the annual monitoring of programmes subsidised by the Commission - we propose an assessment of their contribution to the implementation of the Union' s strategies relating to sustainable development and employment."
"We hope that our amendments will receive the majority support of Parliament, since they will serve to improve our Community economic and social objectives."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Mr Pohjamo for his excellent report, for the interest he always shows, as do the other members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and its new chairman, Mr Caveri, and as did the previous chairman, Mr Hatzidakis, for their collective efforts to make the management of regional policy and Structural Funds more straightforward and more efficient."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is very important for the Commission to receive both encouragement and constructive criticism."
"I have been listening very closely and with great interest to each of the speakers and, if I may, I would like to write to some of you within the next few days in order to clarify a number of points."
"Mr Pohjamo, the Commission supports your comments regarding the financial execution, particularly the very severe and very strict n+2 rule that is to be applied, as well as your remarks on monitoring and control and also on the quality of the programmes and projects."
"Like you, we have seen that there are some difficulties in the management of funds."
"In the few minutes that I have, I would like to make three comments to clarify or explain the work of the European Commission."
"My first comment concerns the new rules for the 2000-2006 period, which were laid down for a new working method and which also defined new responsibilities for those involved in the management of Structural Funds."
"Each of the persons involved needed time to prepare and get up to speed."
"In the case of our Directorate-General, these changes came about at the same time as the internal reorganisation of the whole institution."
"I am not looking for excuses;"
"I simply want to give an explanation."
"These new regulations were also drawn up from much stricter requirements regarding the quality of programmes."
"I am thinking, for example, of the provisions governing the ex-ante appraisal."
"In this area too, the various players needed time to understand and grasp these new requirements."
"There are also areas where this change required a choice to be made between several objectives."
"I shall give an example that you yourself, Mr Pohjamo, mentioned."
"You quite rightly pointed out that the negotiations on the programme documents took an average of eight to twelve months to complete, instead of the five months scheduled by the legislator."
"The truth, and I want to be honest about this, as I always am before this House, is that a five-month deadline to draft a document that is intended to cover a seven-year period was not realistic, when you understand the tough challenges involved and the amounts involved in the Structural Funds."
"A choice had to be made between completing the job rapidly, sometimes even in a hurry, and quality."
"The Commission, I must say, and I think that you will acknowledge this, decided to put the quality of the programme documents before all else."
"Given the excessive number of months taken to complete the programming - and I repeat, Mr Pohjamo, that I took careful note of your comment, and I may come back to this point later when we discuss the report by Mr Musotto - I decided, in future, to propose that the Commission anticipate, as far as possible, the presentation of its proposals on the new regional policy, namely, the new agenda beginning in 2007, so that we can begin programming and implementing projects at the very beginning of the agenda, rather than two years later, because I share your sentiment."
"Second, within the limits of the room for manoeuvre that these texts allow, the Commission is already committed to responding to certain problems that you have raised, Mr Pohjamo."
"I would firstly like to reiterate our desire to approach the management of Structural Funds in a transparent manner, and the communication that the Commission adopted on 5 July on the results of the programming of funds for Objective 1 between 2000-2006 is evidence of this."
"The Commission has also recently simplified the procedures for handling programming complements, which was an area of criticism."
"I heard many regional chairmen and ministers voice this criticism."
"I also decided to set up, in order to study all the areas where we could simplify matters, a working group between my office and the Directorate-General on regional policy, so that we could make specific progress with simplification."
"Remember that the commissioner speaking to you, ladies and gentlemen, is speaking to you using a wealth of experience and hindsight that I have gained, and cannot forget, from being chairman of a local authority in his own country."
"Therefore, I understand very well this need to reduce bureaucracy and excessive complications."
"The only boundary that I have, to tell the truth, and which I will not exceed, is that I must supply accounts, accurate accounts, sometimes very detailed accounts on several thousand euro, both to the budgetary control authority - in other words, the European Parliament - and to the Court of Auditors."
"It is my personal responsibility, that of the Commission, to provide fair accounts when they are requested."
"As regards the sensitive question of natural or ecological disasters, which you mentioned in your report, Mr Pohjamo, I wish to point out that changes can be made to the programmes, as we have done in the past, with the Italian, Portuguese and Greek programmes, for example, when there were earthquakes between 1997 and 1999, or, more recently, in France, because of the hurricane."
"That does not, of course, take into account the freedom that the national and regional authorities have within the programmes adopted by the Commission to finance projects that they believe to be most applicable and, if necessary, to re-deploy or re-programme appropriations."
"My third comment is that I naturally want to reiterate that everyone, myself in particular, must comply with the regulations that the legislator wanted in order to supervise the management of the Structural Funds."
"It is in the light of this reminder that I must examine certain proposals that you have put forward, Mr Pohjamo."
"Therefore, your proposals on imposing penalties for infringing the additionality principle or for cutting short a programming period are to be taken into account in the current debate on the future of the cohesion policy."
"I took note of these proposals and the comments for use in the debate and I will take them into account."
"But beware of proposals that could involve modifying the legislative framework, or even amending the Treaty itself, such as the idea of creating a single regional development fund."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whilst respecting the competences and the responsibilities of our respective institutions, I would like to reaffirm to you that the Commission is at your disposal and is willing to loyally fulfil its duty to keep Parliament informed."
"It will do this by regularly reporting back on the use of the Structural Funds, including by objective, as I have started to do for Objective 1 and as I will do for Objective 2; by systematically informing the House of our work by means of reports, including reports which provide assessments, and by coming before the committees on a regular basis, such as the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"In fact, I shall be doing this in a few days' time."
"I think that together this forms a solid basis for a genuinely transparent, sincere and ongoing dialogue between our institutions."
"Lastly, I would like to confirm the links that I am establishing between the report by Mr Pohjamo and the next report, and that all these comments on improving the management of Structural Funds will be very useful to me, to us, in drawing up the Commission guidelines on the future regional policy."
"I believe that better management of appropriations, provided in a timely fashion, for useful projects in each of our regions, that the proper use of Structural Funds during this period, will be evidence and an argument for pursuing, or even stepping up all our actions by revamping regional policy in the next agenda."
"That is why, Mr Pohjamo, I would like to express my sincere thanks to you for the time that you have taken, for your initiative in drawing up this report on the current management of Structural Funds."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Economic and social cohesion"
"The next item is the report (A5-0007/2002) by Mr Musotto, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the second report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on economic and social cohesion (COM(2001) 24 - C5-0527/2001 - 2001/2207(COS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it must be pointed out that this report is being tabled before Parliament at a particularly important historical and political moment in European integration, namely just before the start of the Convention which is to lay the foundations of the new Europe, a Convention of which Commissioner Barnier is an important member."
"We are therefore especially glad that he can be here today."
"It must be said from the outset that cohesion policy is a major success story in terms of Community integration. Indeed, it is, has been in the past, and will continue to be, one of the cornerstones of that process."
"Consistently with the Commission' s second report, we have noted that between 1988 and 1998 per capita GDP in Objective 1 regions rose from 63% to 70% of the Community average - and this is a great success - moreover, the benefits of cohesion have not been limited to direct recipients of related funding but have also extended to countries which are net contributors in terms of exported goods and services."
"Of course, the process has not yet reached its conclusion."
"Much still remains to be done and there are difficulties to address and overcome, including, in particular, the scourge of unemployment, which, I am sad to say, is affecting many regions where the unemployment rate has not dropped at all."
"We need infrastructural investments in order to eliminate the marginalisation caused by geographical location and the remoteness of the islands and the most outlying regions; accessibility is a determining factor in terms of the competitiveness of an area and it needs to be improved, although without incurring excessive environmental costs."
"In future, cohesion policy must be recast, first and foremost to cater for the changed circumstances which enlargement will bring for all of us, but it is also vital that the future regional policy should be based on the results of Commission documents, particularly the most recent document issued a few days ago, known as the periodic report."
"I am afraid to say that the gap between rich and poor will grow as, after enlargement, one sixth of the Community population will have an income of barely 40% of the Community average."
"Preaccession instruments such as ISPA and the Sapard programme have been set up to assist the candidate countries, to enable them to prepare for the new situation of which they will have to become a part; these have been essential tools for the transition from candidate countries to Member States."
"However, we need to promote a genuine regional development policy. In this regard, I feel that the European spatial development perspective can serve as an important technical source of major integration and development."
"There are two key objectives to pursue: solidarity towards the new Member States and avoiding penalising, indeed protecting, those currently benefiting from cohesion policies."
"A major effort therefore needs to be made in terms of solidarity - especially political solidarity ensuring that all the peoples are involved and are provided with the requisite information - in economic and financial policy."
"The 'statistical convergence' must not be mistaken for 'real convergence' by the current beneficiaries, who will certainly not automatically become richer simply as a result of the accession of poorer regions."
"We need administrative methods which will improve efficiency; we need to streamline, clarify and facilitate the demarcation between the role of the Commission and that of the regional and national levels; it will be necessary to simplify procedures increasingly and we need greater subsidiarity and more decentralisation."
"It will also be essential to rationalise the support instruments by reducing the number and size of funds and better coordinating Community policies and cohesion policies."
"Regions which continue to lag behind in terms of development, measured in terms of unemployment and other criteria in addition to per capita income, must be maintained under Objective 1."
"Lastly - and this is a point of contention which prompted wide debate - the allocation of financial resources must be increased or, at least, revised and brought up to a sufficient level: the threshold of 0.45% is an absolute minimum below which it is impossible to go."
"We hope that Parliament and the Commission will both call for a increase in the budget dedicated to the future resources of cohesion policy."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. (DE) Mr President, the Commission's report and Mr Musotto's are laudable, the one for its analytical description of the situation and the other for its supplementary proposals, although the observations of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs were taken into account only to a somewhat modest extent."
"Further to them, though, I would like to elaborate, from my Committee's point of view, another issue which has almost been pushed into obscurity."
"Commissioner, we have learned essential lessons from the difficulties we have had in raising poorer regions or suffering former industrialised zones to the level within the European Union; they should spur us on to improve things and should serve as a benchmark for the process of enlargement."
"It is above all the poorer industrial zones in the future Member States whose need for massive restructuring measures causes me great concern."
"I refer above all to coal and steel regions; the steel industries in these countries are absolutely incapable of competing with our own, and the collieries are a potential problem."
"I do not want to go at this juncture into what will happen if we are unable to give our new friends sufficient aid."
"I will only observe that, as the ECSC's expiry is imminent, we no longer have a suitable instrument in this field."
"I reiterate that now because the ECSC continued to be of excellent service to us in recent years, no cofinancing is needed and the system of financing could in any case have been adapted."
"We also have to make solidarity payments to the applicant countries."
"I reiterate that now because the new States will not have adequate access to financing."
"I have touched on this issue now because the Commission played a considerable part in changing this instrument without envisaging the difficulties in the process of enlargement or even giving them some thought."
"Do something about this problem, Commissioner!"
"The problem is not a small one."
"We do not have enough instruments suited to the processes of adaptation while enlargement is going on."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when considering the report we are now discussing, on the future of cohesion after enlargement, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities unanimously approved the following fundamental principles:"
"firstly: cohesion policy, as defined in the Treaties, is a crucial pillar for the future of European integration and must not, therefore, be renationalised;"
"secondly: the active promotion of a policy of equality between men and women is a prerequisite for achieving real economic and social cohesion;"
"thirdly: the fact that disparities between the richest and poorest regions are predicted to double following the planned enlargement to a further ten countries and a significant fall in per capita income makes it crucial that the sum currently spent by the Union on cohesion polices is at least 0.45% of GDP, and for the sake of coherence, this amount must be increased."
"I should also like to draw your attention to the objective laid down at the Lisbon Summit of achieving, in the European Union, in 2010, a 60% rate of female employment, because this increase in women working is essential not only in order to increase the European GDP, but also to finance the future of social security and to bring about an increase in tax revenues."
"I therefore ask the Commission to consider gender equality as an integral part of the Community polices that contribute to economic and social cohesion; to include the aspect of gender and equal treatment between men and women in cohesion policies and assess, on the basis of precise indicators and quantified objectives, the contribution that economic and social cohesion makes to achieving the Community strategy for equal treatment and opportunities between men and women."
"Mr President, I must congratulate Mr Ìusotto on his report, which is a job extremely well done."
"We must look, first, at what conclusions we can draw on the basis of progress so far and, secondly, at the challenges facing us."
"As regards what conclusions we can draw from the policies applied so far, what we can say is that we have clearly made progress, but that this progress has varied from one Member State to another."
"In some Member States there have been very positive results and a great deal of progress, while in others such as my own, unfortunately, the results have not been as positive as they might have been."
"This means that governments need to get the message, especially in the light of the new regulation now being applied, which is more decentralised than the previous regulation, and do what they can to bring about the results which other countries have achieved."
"Secondly, the question of enlargement is now a factor, bringing with it even greater demands."
"Because numerous poor countries are joining, this will, as we all know, artificially inflate the income of numerous regions in comparison with the Community average."
"Because of the statistics, numerous regions will cease to be covered unless they take measures during a programming period."
"Consequently, 0.45% of the Community GDP earmarked for the Structural Funds must be the lower limit."
"We cannot drop any lower and have reliable policies."
"Many of my fellow Members disagree with this view and they do, of course, have every reason to put forward their arguments."
"But what we have to ask ourselves, especially those of us who really believe in the European Union and its prospects, is just how much money we are spending from the Member States' GDP in order to achieve the ambitious objectives set by the European Union."
"Is it because we are spending so much money that we object every time the Community budget increases?"
"At some point we must realise that ambitious objectives cannot be achieved without the necessary funding."
"Mr President, I wish to start by thanking the rapporteur for the work he has done, which has enabled us to make out a good basis for the years to come."
"I would also like - and I think this might be permitted me - to say a word in praise of our own group, whose discussions, which were highly intensive and also sometimes rigorously conducted, produced uniform outcomes, something I consider to be very important in this area."
"I want to deal with those essentials that are of significance to us."
"The first point I wish to make, Commissioner, is that we join with you in rejecting the renationalisation of regional policy."
"That is for us of primary importance."
"Efforts are being made in certain Member States to reclaim this policy for the national level."
"We here are quite united in repudiating this."
"Cohesion policy makes clear European solidarity, which we do not want to lose, but rather to emphasise in the future."
"On this we, Parliament and Commission, stand shoulder to shoulder."
"My second point is that we seek greater coherence - between regional policy on the one hand and, in particular, the common agricultural policy on the other."
"We could perhaps engage in a dialogue, even with Commissioner Fischler, on how we might manage this, without which our goals for rural areas, and the agricultural policy's goals for rural areas, will not always be found in the same direction, and this is something we must work on."
"It is also beyond dispute that going below the 0.45% level imperils the cohesion objectives, so we just have to become more efficient, as has also been made abundantly clear by Mr Pohjamo's report, which we were discussing earlier."
"Now to my final point. We need to achieve a balance between the candidate countries and the regions we have supported to date."
"I think it is not at issue that we must make enormous efforts for the candidate countries, that there must also be a cohesion instrument to help them, and this was also mentioned in the interim report you presented last week."
"We must also, though, give thought to the need to continue to bring the regions we used to support up to the EU average."
"If we manage this balancing act, I believe we will gain Europe greater acceptance."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish, on behalf of my group, to congratulate Mr Musotto on his report, which calls attention to some pertinent matters."
"The measures to achieve economic balance have been insufficient: they have been heading in the right direction, but they have been insufficient."
"Regional and social differences in terms of prosperity have even increased in the present Member States."
"In future we must pay attention to strengthening rural vitality and diversity in regions which are unfavourable in terms of geographical location and natural conditions."
"Additional costs resulting from difficult conditions, for example in island regions and mountain areas, must be compensated for with combined efforts and precisely defined regional policy measures."
"Furthermore, the sharp disparities in unemployment rates and structural problems must be taken seriously in planning regional structural policy."
"The commitment of SMEs and skills and know-how to projects is an important priority."
"Aid action under the Structural Funds must also be better coordinated with national employment targets."
"GNP alone is inadequate as a criterion in determining eligible areas."
"We have to equally consider permanent problems associated with climatic and geographical conditions."
"For example, extremely sparsely populated areas, long journey times, and cold and hot climates mean additional costs, which will also be there after enlargement."
"An effective cohesion policy requires that sufficient financing is safeguarded."
"There are actually rather different views in my group regarding how that can be addressed."
"Whatever the case, it is important to have improved coordination between the various forms of aid granted out of the funds available."
"The enlargement of the Union requires a reinforced cohesion policy."
"Enlargement must not go ahead at the expense of the worse-off regions, but through joint efforts."
"It is important to ensure that all the Union' s resources are spent effectively, and that includes the most remote regions."
"We have to ensure together that the whole area of the Union is included in the single market and derives benefit from it."
"For that reason, cooperation with the peripheral areas is more important than ever."
"Mr President, my first point is that this is where one normally praises the rapporteur. I cannot, unfortunately, do that on this occasion, as the rapporteur did not succeed in developing a discussion in the committee that would lead to a common position by Parliament on the Commission's proposals, nor, indeed, did he make the effort to do so."
"I see this as a great pity, as a core report and a core position on the part of Parliament are just what is needed."
"The Greens, by contrast, have a clear position."
"They reject all attempts to protect vested rights and the exceptions to them."
"Solidarity between regions must remain the supreme imperative, whilst there must not be such a thing as first and second-class Europe."
"In consequence, the Structural Funds must primarily benefit the poorest regions, which just happen to be in the East."
"That means that a phasing-out is at the same time an important instrument, and it also cushions the present regions in receipt of support."
"Option 2 highlights the problems and offers a solution, and hence it is Option 2 that enjoys our full support."
"At the same time though - and this is my next point - our group objects to the Commission's tactic of involving the candidate countries in the management of the Structural Funds at too late a stage and then making a saving at the end of the day."
"Last week' s proposal strikes me as scandalous."
"It economises on the cohesion policy rather than introducing it earlier, in the pre-accession process."
"That is why we urge that a start be made now, with the candidate countries, on phasing-in, on setting up the payment agencies, on training in the management of Structural Funds, in order to make decentralised structural policy, rather than centralised project-based policy, the objective of the Structural Funds."
"Future coalition policy must be characterised by sustainable development and participation by local actors, and we must make a start on this now."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unlike Mrs Schroedter, I regard the final result of the Committee's vote on Mr Musotto's report as a success."
"The report demonstrates, firstly, a balanced assessment of the disparities within the European Union, which continue to be marked, secondly, the challenge thrown down by enlargement, and thirdly, the need for improvements in the area of the EU's structural and cohesion policies."
"I would very much like to highlight four fundamental points."
"The first is that there must be no renationalisation of Structural Fund policy."
"I can save myself the effort of justifying this, as Mr Duin has already done that for me."
"Secondly, a polycentric model of space would be a sensible approach to counteracting the disparity between the centre and the periphery."
"Thirdly, there is a need for improved coordination among the Structural Funds as well as of structural policy with the other Community policy areas, especially the common agricultural policy and fiscal and economic policy."
"Fourthly, consistent application of the bottom-up and partnership principles at every stage - planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation would not only promote closeness to the citizens, but also the subsidiarity principle."
"What is imperative, quite apart from the need to continue with aid for the underdeveloped regions of the present Member States, is that the soon-to-be Member States of the European Union must enjoy our full solidarity with them, which means the involvement of these countries, with equal rights, in EU structural policy, without allowing the present Member States to fall by the wayside."
"Serious shortfalls in development make it, in my view, already perfectly clear that even 0.45% of Europe's GDP will not be sufficient to do this."
"Provision of support and transnational cooperation in the border regions will be of great significance as enlargement takes its course."
"Justice has not, in my judgement, been adequately done to this in the report."
"The course for the Structural Funds, with their criteria and indicators for support, must be set in such a way that economic and social cohesion is also reflected in falling unemployment figures."
"My own country, the Federal Republic of Germany, is setting a bad example in this respect, for unemployment in the 'Objective 1' regions is rising dramatically."
"We have a rate of over 20%, but this figure is, fortunately, not as high in the more developed regions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Title XVII of the Treaty establishing the European Community, particularly Article 158 thereof, includes among the Union' s political priorities the promotion of the Community' s 'overall harmonious development' , aiming at 'reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions, including rural areas' ."
"Personally, I feel that it is necessary to continue to pursue this objective with a coherent, continuing, sustainable policy."
"The second report on EU cohesion presented by Commissioner Barnier depicts a situation which has improved but which has certainly not been resolved."
"It is clear that the progress made has not been uniform and that severe regional disparities remain which - as rightly pointed out by the rapporteur - are increasing rather than diminishing."
"With regard to the objectives, I fully support the position of my fellow member, Mr Musotto."
"The criterion for deciding which regions are eligible for receiving aid lays down the threshold of 75% of average Community per capita GDP."
"My personal feeling is that, as of 2006, it would certainly be more appropriate to use the unemployment rate as a measure, for the entry of poorer regions which are in greater need of aid will certainly not raise the level of the regions currently under Objective 1."
"Mr President, the forthcoming enlargement of the Union gives this debate on economic and social cohesion a special dynamic."
"Indeed, it is evident that when the candidate countries join, the current system will prove to entail too heavy a financial burden."
"This forces us to make choices."
"The Commission has already indicated a few options, but we must give this matter some more thought."
"We believe that, in some cases, a policy in support of economic and social cohesion that also supplements national policy is useful and desirable."
"The Structural Funds have a special and relatively broad task in this respect."
"The Cohesion Fund, on the other hand, pertains to one particular aspect of economic cohesion, namely participation in EMU."
"In our view, this should also be at the heart of cohesion policy: helping Member States meet the convergence criteria, both before and after enlargement, without drawing a distinction between old and new."
"The reports of the Commission have also proven that the current system works."
"The Cohesion Fund is intended to provide economic stimuli on the basis of transparent, clearly defined criteria."
"As far as we are concerned, this is how things will remain, because otherwise we run the risk of losing our way in a structure of soft criteria, and the European and Monetary Union cannot survive on soft criteria."
"That is why I have tabled a number of amendments to which an honest but plain approach is central."
"I hope that fellow MEPs will give this matter serious thought."
"Mr President, the Committee on Industry considers this report to be quite positive. It feels that the indicators in euros paint a more reliable picture than the current measurement and eligibility criteria and also considers that the unemployment indicators are important because in some regions, only 44% of people of working age are in employment, although disparities in production are also significant."
"The Committee on Industry also takes the view that the concentration of the Union' s economy in a triangle which is twice or four times as productive as the outlying regions is one of the problems accentuating these disparities and making it difficult to correct them, and is of the opinion that future programming must make a qualitative assessment of the various indicators."
"With regard to enlargement, we must allow greater flexibility in the way funds are used, in line with the specific characteristics of each State."
"The Committee on Industry supports an increase in the Union' s financial effort for cohesion policy, specifically by making competition tougher and by adjusting the budgets of Community policies. It takes the view that any policy that is given greater financial resources than cohesion policy could neutralise it and that the most developed countries grant production aid that almost equals the Community budget."
"The lack of tough competition favours neither cohesion nor integration and is one reason for ongoing criticism within the WTO."
"The Committee on Industry urges the Commission to guarantee the creation of a European energy and communications market that respects universal service, prioritises energy efficiency and research, energy saving and the use of renewable energies."
"The Committee considers it essential to complete infrastructures in the fields of accessibility and transport in order to reduce the effects on the competitiveness of the current outlying regions, without which the efforts for cohesion that we have already made will suffer."
"The Committee wishes to draw attention to the effects on the price and the taxation of energy in the outermost and overseas regions. It recommends that endogenous energies should be developed as well as clean and safe technologies for the use of coal, nuclear energy and hydrocarbons."
"Mr President, Commissioner, congratulations first to Mr Musotto on a fine report, and I say this against the backdrop of the harsh criticism by the Greens, whose attitude I do not share."
"I would like, in my contribution to this discussion, to focus on the future of regional policy."
"Reference has already been made several times this evening to the reconciliation of two fundamental needs with each other, which must be possible, with a high degree of solidarity towards the new Member States on the one hand, but also, on the other, solidarity with those regions that are at present lagging behind or undergoing economic transition."
"To put it another way, even if it is generally acknowledged that the regions in all the applicant countries must be supported as a matter of priority, the 'Objective 1' regions of the present fifteen Member States, which will, in the course of enlargement, lose their eligibility for support only because of their relatively high standard of living in an enlarged EU, that is, only by dint of the cosmetic use of statistics, should not overnight be excluded from any opportunity to be supported."
"Commissioner, it will be necessary over the coming months to discuss how to guarantee equal treatment of these regions, which have yet to complete the process of economic convergence, with the areas being embraced by enlargement."
"Political and economic considerations mean that future cohesion policy must not concentrate exclusively on regions whose development is lagging furthest behind, but it must also take into account the advantages and disadvantages in urban areas, in areas undergoing socio-economic change, in regions with permanent natural disadvantages and also the cross-border dimension."
"The financial means this policy needs must of course be made available."
"The present threshold of 0.45% of Community GDP must therefore not fall any lower - that too was mentioned several times this evening - in order that cohesion policy may not be jeopardised."
"At the present time, we have in any case not yet exhausted the possibilities open to us."
"Everything else must be tested by reference to the new financial framework and in the light of the results of enlargement."
"I therefore think it inappropriate to be already, as a precaution, articulating demands for the replenishment of funds."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in discussing Mr Musotto's report, we obviously want to express our concerns about the future of political cohesion in the Union, given that, if the gap between the rich and the poor is to narrow and they are to feel that they belong to the same European body, they need to converge economically and socially."
"Of course, our starting point is fundamentally contradictory."
"We want much greater enlargement, but without providing the corresponding funds and we invent lower and lower cohesion targets along the lines of ""if the mountain won't come to Mohammed, then let' s take Mohammed to the mountain""."
"Be that as it may, we face a very tricky problem and we are required to resolve it in less than optimum circumstances, while keeping up the fight to improve those circumstances."
"Obviously, we do not want a twin-track Europe, as previous speakers have stressed, but we want a multi-track Europe even less."
"So our objective must be to help the new regions where they need help, but without abandoning the old regions which also need help, when they need help."
"So I think we need to state that 0.45% is inadequate and that the Cohesion Fund and other Community initiatives need to keep functioning as they have done so far, given that they have proven to be extremely efficient."
"And of course we must take a very careful look at the future of political cohesion, in conjunction with the policy of sustainable development and agricultural policy. It is our duty here to avoid stop-gap, hasty solutions which might prove to be the undoing of our farmers, whom we need for the countryside, for the environment, for our very existence."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European regional policy includes a differential element, which is dictated by geography and which defines the outermost regions."
"They are distant, isolated, fragmented and are highly dependent on the outside, and they have been experiencing inconsistent development since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which allowed the application of specific measures to correct their backwardness."
"Over recent days, the authorities of these regions have been meeting in the Canary Islands to analyse, together with the representatives of the European Commission and the three States involved, the situation of these special regions in relation to social and economic cohesion."
"I am sure that, as well as asking for special treatment, they will have requested some of the measures which Mr Musotto is asking for today in his report - and I congratulate him also - in which he stresses the need to differentiate between statistical convergence and real convergence, as well as the suitability of using alternative indicators to per capita income, such as unemployment, the lack of infrastructures, the lack of transport and energy, double insularity, the training of human resources and the levels of ozone in the outermost regions."
"In this way, I am sure that their economic and social development will not be restricted and Europe will have clearly demonstrated its solidarity with its people."
"Mr President, the Musotto report is a good report."
"The overall thrust is quite correct."
"The purpose of Cohesion Funds is to counteract the natural centrifugal forces of a large single economic and monetary unit, which is what the European Union and the euro zone are, by helping the less advantaged regions come up to the level of the more prosperous ones."
"This is the point: if the less advantaged remain less advantaged, the Cohesion Funds will have failed in their purpose."
"But that is why, contrary to what Mr Mussotto and the Committee on Regional Policy demand, we should stick to the 75% of average Community GNP as a graduation point."
"Having reached that level the pump will have been adequately primed and the graduating region, with a suitable transitional process, should be well able to continue up the escalator to 100% and higher."
"Surely it is only reasonable that at that point these Cohesion Fund resources should be reallocated to those regions which lie further behind."
"That is why I will vote against recitals O and R of Mr Musotto's report."
"There must also be financial discipline."
"An open-ended honey pot is not conducive to encouraging self-help and self-reliance."
"This is why I cannot countenance leaving open-ended the possibility of an even higher percentage of European Union GDP being committed to cohesion policies."
"0.45% should be quite adequate and will make us hone our priorities and procedures, even in the context of enlargement."
"So the second half of paragraph 57, or any compromise of similar effect which leaves the amount be made available open-ended, is not acceptable."
"Given these small but significant changes I will be very pleased to support Mr Musotto's report as an important contribution to the future well-being of all parts of our European Union."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the many Members who have helped to enhance this resolution with over 50 amendments."
"I would also like to make three brief suggestions to the Commission, for - like many other Members - I am convinced that cohesion is not a financial obligation but, first and foremost, a resource, and that if we do not have a Europe of equal opportunities we will never have Europe."
"That said, I will turn to the first two suggestions, which, moreover, have already been put forward this evening."
"I feel that it would be appropriate to reflect on the parameters, for the gross domestic product may well be in danger of becoming inadequate as an indicator of the real state of well-being or distress of our countries."
"We therefore need to assess other factors as well such as the rate of unemployment, the quality of infrastructure and the cost of labour."
"My second suggestion is this: since I feel that politics should always prevail over arithmetic, I would call upon Parliament and the Commission not to concentrate on the effects of enlargement as portrayed by statistics, although I do believe deeply in enlargement."
"Indeed, we will strive to ensure that no government can see it as a handicap, for it will certainly be a great political asset for Europe."
"That said, we would like to avoid certain regions unexpectedly finding themselves in a state of wealth for purely statistical reasons."
"Politics must continue to take precedence over arithmetic in this sense."
"Here is my third suggestion: we should reinvigorate the strategic profile of our cohesion policy, learning to invest in non-material resources such as training, knowledge and information."
"We feel that this is the road to take if integration is to have any practical meaning."
"Mr President, last week this debate was dominated by some unfortunate news for cohesion."
"In committee we saw the discharge of the 2000 budget, with an execution of 56% of objective 1, 4.5% of objective 2 and 0% of Community initiatives."
"We are not talking about the cohesion funds."
"The Commissioner, as he told us, wrote a letter to the Presidents of the various countries, reminding them of the 'n+2' rule, that is, that funds may disappear after two years of not being executed."
"That is by way of a precaution, amongst other things, and I think it is correct."
"The Commission proposed 0.14% of the budget to solve the problems of enlargement."
"In any event, I am very pleased with the report by Mr Musotto, in which he makes an enormously positive assessment of regional policy and cohesion policy."
"It is a successful policy which is going to ensure that soon there will be almost no Objective 1 regions amongst the Europe of the 15."
"The messages of Mr Musotto' s project are clear: procedures must be taken seriously."
"I am pleased that the Commissioner has maintained what Parliament proposed: that the programming period be brought forward two years to the next financial perspectives."
"He also sends a message relating to the quality of investments and participation, and the implementation of the partnership, which has not yet happened."
"But the star has been enlargement: enlargement itself, the effect of enlargement on the other regions that currently receive aid and the absence of a reply to the four questions, Commissioner."
"An apparent absence of a reply, since you can give us a satisfactory reply through good work, which is easy if done with common sense and if we believe in cohesion."
"Mr President, I will end by saying to the Commissioner that Parliament trusts that the Commission will obtain that response which we all need."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Musotto on his excellent work."
"It is difficult to not repeat points which have already been made by other speakers at this stage in the debate."
"I will be brief."
"One: cohesion policy has proved to be a policy that works, and the report confirms this."
"It may not work as well as we would expect or like it to, but it is a policy that yields results."
"What is more, in many regions, for many of our fellow citizens, it is sometimes the only practical, positive, friendly aspect of the European Union that they see."
"This is an asset which increases the spirit of European citizenship and overall cohesion."
"My second point is a fact: we can try to postpone it, ignore it or put off dealing with the issue, but it is still a fact."
"In practical terms, enlargement will upset the balance and distort the statistics on which we have built this cohesion policy, for we have based it on what is certainly a statistic, the number of inhabitants and the average income disparity which will be created."
"I feel rather hesitant about advancing proposals on this issue, Commissioner, but I would invite the Commission to be less reticent."
"Starting to think about the way cohesion policy will have to change in the face of enlargement does not mean placing a question mark over the entire policy of enlargement."
"My suggestion is that this debate could, perhaps, focus on three factors: resources, as has been said, for it is unthinkable that resources should remain at their current level; the tools, for I feel, for example, that, while the Structural Funds are a tool which is suitable for a cohesion policy which differs greatly from region to region, it may be that the Cohesion Fund, which is less selective, should be rethought, at least in terms of the way its funds are allocated; coordination of the policies."
"In many cases, where there are no additional resources, coordinated policies could be of benefit such as, for example, tax discounts, which it is still not possible to apply to some regions because of a rigid Commission policy on State aid."
"Mr President, I also want to address a rigid Commission policy."
"As a result of a recent competition policy decision, over EUR 1 billion of much-needed UK regional regeneration investment in poor urban areas and derelict sites has been cut by 75%."
"Following the conclusions of the Belgian informal meeting in October, the Commission must now undertake a review of the operation of state aids and regional regeneration policy."
"Can the Commissioner please state what follow-up action has been taken?"
"Can it also reassure us that competition policy will not continue to undermine the legitimate efforts of regional and cohesion policies?"
"Secondly, unlike my Conservative colleague, Mr Purvis, I do not believe that we should take a rigid view of the reform of funding post-2006 at this stage."
"Poorer regions such as Merseyside in my region, and in the rest of the EU 15, may continue to need Objective 1 funding, but more importantly than that, today a delegation of trade unionists from Manchester came to Strasbourg to fight to save 650 jobs threatened due to industrial restructuring."
"Last year 9 500 jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector in the region alone."
"Can the Commissioner therefore tonight give his support for the continuation of a strong role for European assistance post-2006 for our urban and industrial restructuring regions as well as our poorest regions?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since it is impossible, in two minutes, to discuss the countless issues concerning cohesion, which have, furthermore, been dealt with very thoroughly in the report we are now considering by Mr Musotto, whom I should like to congratulate on the excellent work he has undertaken, I should just like to express a few ideas on the implications of enlargement for the European Union' s economic and social cohesion policy."
"The first idea is that if we want to have a viable European Union which has good prospects for the future, we will inevitably have to improve economic and social cohesion policy."
"Eastern Europe must feel the same level of European solidarity experienced by countries such as Portugal, Spain, Greece and Ireland following their accession to the European Union."
"Improving cohesion policy is necessary, however, not only to counter the huge regional imbalances that will result from the entry of scores of least-favoured regions in the current candidate countries, but also to continue to deal with the backwardness that still exists in the current Europe of fifteen countries, particularly in the outermost regions."
"This is all the more important because eastwards enlargement will probably accentuate the lack of economic and social cohesion in the current Europe of Fifteen, in other words, regional asymmetries could increase within the current European Union as a result of the dynamics created by the enlargement process, particularly in the relationship between the outermost regions and the centre of Europe. In other words, countries such as Portugal could become further consigned to the edges of Europe and the current centre and could become even stronger because it will then be the centre of a Europe which is economically integrated from its western almost to its eastern borders."
"By this I wish to state that following 2006, we will need a cohesion policy which does not only look eastwards, but which also considers the still existing cohesion deficit in the current Europe of Fifteen and the new problems it will face as a result of enlargement."
"The reading of the second cohesion report demonstrates that the Commission is aware of this problem. We feel sure that the third report will provide appropriate and fair solutions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, with its membership increasing from 15 to 25 countries, Europe is at a turning point and must face up to the challenge of its size."
"History commands us and we have commitments to do this."
"The fact remains, nonetheless, that there will be numerous question marks, when we realise that a Europe with 25 Member States will have 30% more inhabitants, 30% more territory, but only 10% more wealth."
"Along with enlargement, Europe is therefore in need of greater solidarity."
"But how are we going to manage to show more solidarity with the same amount of money?"
"It is impossible."
"There is no use in continuing to bury our heads in the sand."
"Europe must decide to provide the necessary resources for the radical transformation that will bring about enlargement and must reformulate the criteria for granting structural aid so that the poorest populations are not adversely affected."
"We must therefore pay particular attention to the outermost regions, which are amongst the ten poorest regions of today' s Union."
"In this respect, I welcome the recent proposal by the Spanish Presidency to set up a permanent forum specifically for these regions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Europe has chosen cohesion, and therefore solidarity, the price of which is the coherence of our common project."
"Mr President, Commissioner, one of the recitals of this report states that extremely large regional differences constitute both a political and economic threat to the EU."
"That is quite correct."
"We must hold an enlarged Europe together."
"I want very briefly to emphasise a number of points."
"Enlargement is very important for the whole of Europe, and it is not the poorest regions which should pay for enlargement."
"There must therefore be sufficient budget resources for the whole of this process."
"At the same time, we must use the money in the most effective way, which is why the EU' s agricultural policy should be reformed and coordinated with regional policy so that it promotes rural development, that is to say promotes differentiated economic life in agricultural areas too."
"Each Member State must also have its own policy of solidarity and cohesion, and all growth policies must effectively favour justice for the regions."
"That applies especially in the fields of education, research, employment and transport."
"Finally, I wish to say that future cohesion policy must pay attention to regions with pronounced, permanent geographical disadvantages, for example long distances and a sparse population."
"The whole of the EU has an interest in its being possible to be resident, and earn one' s living, throughout the EU."
"As the last speaker I have two points to make and one question for the Commissioner this evening."
"The first point is about making sure that the poorest regions of Europe do not pay the price of enlargement."
"I disagree with what Mr Purvis said."
"Areas such as South Yorkshire and Merseyside in the United Kingdom must continue to benefit if they need it, and if they are shown to need it."
"The second point is to retain some kind of aid for areas undergoing industrial restructuring."
"My question is about competition policy as well, and about coherence between competition policy and cohesion policy."
"I am getting a lot of complaints about the way competition policy is being applied, particularly, recently, about voluntary and community sectoral organisations being treated in the same way as private sector organisations and being told that for projects they cannot receive more than 50% in total in public sector intervention."
"I want to know whether it is Commission policy to treat the voluntary and community sector the same as the private sector."
"Does that apply to other public sector organisations?"
"It is an extremely important point because if this is the Commission policy, a number of projects which are going ahead in some our most deprived regions will simply cease to go ahead."
"It is not what the Commission worked for many years."
"Regional policy pushed to put these projects in the hands of the voluntary sector and now they seem to be disadvantaged."
"I would like to know what the Commissioner's position is."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you can imagine, I am deeply committed to the regional and cohesion policy, not only because I have the honour of directing this policy on behalf of the Commission and in conjunction with my colleagues, Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou, but also for another, more political reason, which is that I believe, as several of you have said, that the cohesion policy, which has grown in importance over a 15-year period, symbolises a certain concept of the European Union."
"It is the proof that the European Union is not merely a supermarket where we quite simply rely on the laws of supply and demand and on fiscal transfers in order to ensure solidarity or to avoid a two, three or four-speed development."
"It is the proof that we have agreed that we should share our financial resources and redistribute them in a regulated manner, and also to work with greater coherence."
"This policy is the proof that the European Union is not merely a supermarket; that it will, one day, I hope, be a political power and that it must remain a community that stands together."
"This is the profession of faith that I wanted to give to you at the beginning of my answer."
"In this spirit, I feel that Mr Musotto' s report is an extremely worthwhile and useful contribution, as you have all said, to the debate on the future of the cohesion policy that I unveiled to you in January 2001."
"And since I am speaking about a concept of Europe, I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the debate on cohesion, which I launched a year ago and which I will be seeing through to completion, in a genuine and decentralised manner, with the Member States - you can count on me to do this - the debate will be part of the other wide-ranging debate on the future of Europe."
"Depending on how the Heads of State and Government respond to the question of cohesion, depending on whether we maintain, or even extend, the cohesion policy, whether we scale it down or take it apart, we will somehow answer this broad question - one of the subjects to be tackled by the Convention, which we will also be attending - on the future of Europe."
"What do we want to do together?"
"I think that this contribution, Mr Musotto, is also important because it brings together the points of view of five parliamentary committees after an in-depth discussion has been held."
"And then, finally, you will adopt this report in a few days and only after the Commission has published the first interim report on cohesion, which I released last week."
"I will also be coming to present this interim report to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on 20 February, as I pledged to do."
"For all these reasons, I am pleased - in spite of the criticisms or questions, which I feel are constructive - to note in your report, Mr Musotto, a genuine convergence between Parliament and the Commission, on four essential points at least."
"First of all, in the future, the main priority of the cohesion policy must be aid to regions that are lagging behind in their development, in other words, the poorest regions."
"On this point, there is agreement, including amongst the Ministers that I met in Namur during the Belgian Presidency, and you confirm this agreement, that the poor regions, which are lagging behind in their development, are located in the future Member States (and they make up almost all of the regions of the future Member States) or in the Member States of today' s Union."
"Therefore, our priority and focus is on the regions that are genuinely lagging behind in their development."
"The second point of convergence is that cohesion, as many of you pointed out, is not an aspect of one single policy, but of all Community policies, which must, as stipulated in the Treaty, contribute to the cohesion between European countries and regions."
"This applies to the CAP, which has not been effective, to transport - Mrs de Palacio is here and she could explain this better than myself - to energy, competition, research, employment and many other policies."
"Each of these policies, even more than before, must contribute to increasing economic and social cohesion, if only because of the question marks that enlargement will raise, which, as we note in our second interim report, will increase gaps and inequality."
"The third point is that we must strive to have more than a minimalist cohesion policy and reinvent a policy which applies to all the territories of the Union that are experiencing difficulties."
"In other words, I note our consensus on the idea that the future regional policy will, after 2006, take into account all European regions, to varying degrees, of course, depending on whether the region is lagging behind in its development or is in a more prosperous region."
"This policy should contribute to the integration of all regions in the Community and promote territorial cohesion."
"To do this, it must be more simple, more decentralised and, at the same time, more specific (this is one of the questions that I raised in the cohesion report), specific, for example, on the urban question - half of European citizens will live, already live, in towns; specific on the regions that are undergoing industrial restructuring that you mentioned; specific on the regions that have lasting or definitive natural handicaps, mountainous regions or islands; or even specific on thematic objectives, such as the information society."
"On this issue too, I await your ideas, but I have explained my outlook."
"The fourth point of convergence is that we need resources in order to meet all these challenges and, for the next cohesion policy, resources which meet the needs of a larger Europe."
"The current threshold of 0.45% of GDP, which I myself quoted last year in reference, is the absolute credible minimum below which, I feel, it is impossible to go without jeopardising the very essence of the cohesion policy."
"In my view, the fact that Parliament and the Commission are tonight giving a joint response to these four points is an important and worthwhile political element in the debate on the future of the cohesion policy."
"Not everyone, as yet, shares this ambitious vision. This applies to certain Member States, where some political leaders - whom I respect and to whom I listen - are talking of the deterioration of politics and one is talking of renationalisation."
"We therefore have to show, time and again - and I am thinking of Mr Izquierdo Collado' s earlier comments - the merits of the cohesion policy, we must aim to convince and to show that this policy has been worthwhile, that it has helped to bring about greater coherence, but that we still need more."
"I cannot prove this single-handedly."
"You can count on me to do this at Commission level, with the help of all my colleagues, but I will not be able to do this if the regions, the Member States and Members of Parliament do not contribute to this task."
"It is also natural for us, at this stage, not to have total agreement on all the subjects raised in Mr Musotto' s report."
"There are points that we must debate or discuss, such as the instruments of the future cohesion policy, the place occupied by Community initiatives, that of the Cohesion Fund or a possible single regional development Fund."
"All this will, of course, depend on the level of our ambition towards this policy."
"Another point of discussion is the choice of eligibility criteria."
"The Commission chose, and made this choice a long time ago, the criterion of GDP per capita and per region for determining which regions are lagging behind in their development."
"I think that this is a reliable, straightforward and transparent indicator that all the Member States accept, and it is so that we can maintain an objective approach and a certain impartiality that we are not, at this stage, proposing to add other criteria to the criterion of per capita GDP."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this does not mean, however, that the Commission will not listen to appeals by the regions which may be affected, either by enlargement or by the so-called 'statistical effect' that several of you have mentioned, by a mathematical decrease in the Community average of per capita GDP or the drop, also mathematical, of the eligibility threshold, which means that some regions that are still having serious problems (not only those in southern Europe, but also in East Germany, in England and elsewhere) are mechanically and artificially situated below this threshold, although they are still experiencing real difficulties."
"I will say once again that I am committed to proposing, at the appropriate time, a fair, Community-wide solution so that we can continue to assist the regions which are situated just below the new eligibility threshold."
"Furthermore, if we maintain a genuine cohesion policy, which does not only cover regions that are lagging behind in their development, we should be able to take into account other criteria and move, as some of you have pointed out, towards making greater qualitative investment in people, in training men and women and in the information society."
"I also note that, in the current programmes, - those that I approved and which have got off the ground - there are more programmes based directly on quality, rather than quantity, than in the previous period."
"Lastly, I am not forgetting and will not forget the particular attention that must be given (not only in accordance with Article 299 of the Treaty, but also because the real problems they face, and their unbearable levels of unemployment) to the seven outermost regions of the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that these brief clarifications may help to increase even further the degree of consensus between Parliament and the Commission, so that together we can preserve and promote the model of European society, the core of which is cohesion."
"One MEP touched upon the subject - and this will be my final point - of the appropriations that you were proposing to grant to the countries which will join the Union, most likely in 2004."
"I do not share the very harsh judgment that Mrs Schroeder expressed earlier and I do not think that it is fair."
"We proposed a phasing-in process."
"These countries already benefit from the Cohesion Fund, and they are experiencing (I regret that Mrs Schroeder is no longer in the Chamber to hear my response) great difficulty in using up the appropriations."
"And this is why I suggested, along with my colleagues, for this genuine reason, that we adopt a progressive approach to the cohesion policy."
"I am not trying to trick anyone or create an effect."
"I do not want to see money that has been earmarked by Europe for the candidate countries, which will join the EU in 2004, to stay in Brussels or be returned to Brussels."
"That is why we are being quite ambitious and going further than the proposals set out in the Berlin Agenda for the first year of membership and why we are proposing more money. But we want to avoid a situation where this money cannot be used by the countries that do not yet have the necessary administrative structures in place to manage these appropriations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall end here."
"Lastly, I confirm that the Commission is due to adopt the third cohesion report in December 2003 and that the report should set out the Commission guidelines for the next agenda."
"This should, therefore, be done earlier than usual, so that we can, as I said before, begin to turn the new programming period into a reality on the ground, as soon as the new Agenda begins in 2007, rather than two years after that."
"We still have a few months to stimulate and make a success of the political debate on cohesion policy. If we succeed in stimulating this debate (and I need you to help me to do this), a decision will be taken, at the appropriate time, by the Heads of State and Government, which will not only maintain cohesion as the heart of a specific model of European society, but will enable the Heads of State to commit, on a budgetary and financial level, to fulfilling the political and strategic choice that they made when they decided to undertake reunification of the European continent, through extensive enlargement that will take place very soon."
"We shall support the new Member States and I hope, personally speaking, that the Agenda, in 2007, will enable them to benefit, like all the other Member States, from every aspect of the cohesion policy."
"Speed limitation devices"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0012/2002) by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 92/6/EEC on the installation and use of speed limitation devices for certain categories of motor vehicles in the Community (COM(2001) 318 - C5-0267/2001 - 2001/0135(COD))."
"Mr President, this proposal for a directive seeks to extend speed restrictions, which already apply to some commercial vehicles, to other categories of passenger and goods vehicles, i.e. to lighter commercial vehicles than those to which the restrictions already apply."
"In other words, to category Ì2 and Ì3 passenger vehicles and category Í2 goods vehicles."
"The European Commission's proposal makes provision for speed limitation devices to restrict passenger vehicles to 100 kph and goods vehicles to 90 kph. And basically, I agree with the European Commission's proposal."
"A study carried out in Holland and brought to our attention by the European Commission demonstrates that it stands to reap profits in the order of EUR 40 million a year and benefits to society in the order of EUR 89 million a year from the transport sector alone."
"If we extrapolate these figures, we stand to gain something in the order of EUR 3 billion."
"But I do not want to dwell on this study because others may dispute it."
"I should like to dwell for a moment on common sense."
"And common sense tells us that, if we restrict speeds, we stand to gain, first from road safety, because there will be fewer accidents; secondly, we stand to gain in the environmental protection sector and, thirdly, we shall ensure there is fair competition between companies because we shall have the same limit everywhere, throughout Europe; at the same time, companies will not be able to force their drivers to drive very fast, putting human lives at risk for the sake of their profit margins."
"That is why the amendments which I have proposed do not differ in any great respect from the text of the European Commission's proposal."
"I should like to comment on two amendments accepted in committee."
"The first concerns the exemption, which we propose should be 5 years from when the directive enters into force for category Ì2 and Í2 vehicles weighing between 3.5 and 7.5 tonnes. What we are proposing here is that the directive should apply five years after it enters into force and, secondly, that the European Commission should submit a study eighteen months after the directive enters into force on so-called intelligent speed adaptation systems so that we can see if we can use these systems to differentiate speeds depending on the circumstances and, of course, if we can have even lower speeds in urban areas."
"The European People's Party has tabled an amendment for category Í2, which includes vans, calling for the speed limit to be raised from 90 to 110 kph, because they are a different type of vehicle; they are lighter vehicles and I think that we can be more flexible here."
"Some fellow members voted against this and explained their reasons."
"They have ideological, political reasons and they do not think that the European Commission, or rather the European Union, should intervene here."
"I should like to thank them, I understand their reasons and, even though I disagree with them, I respect their position."
"But I should like to ask them, given that there are some amendments which make the European Commission's proposal more flexible and bring it closer to their own position, to examine these amendments constructively and, if they can, to vote for them, because it is my prediction that, their position notwithstanding, this directive will, at some point, become European law."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen - at least those of you who are still here - the PPE-DE group supports the entire content of Mr Hatzidakis' report."
"We take the view that we may well support the Commission's proposal in principle, but that we do want to bring about some changes on a few points."
"The traffic safety issue is, of course, decisive, and we need this regulation because traffic safety is not bound by national borders and heavy goods vehicles do, indeed, cross them."
"In principle, we also need speed limitation devices for smaller vehicles, as we have had good experience of speed limitation devices in heavy lorries."
"It is because these HGVs travel across borders everywhere that we need European regulations."
"However, Madam Vice-President, we have to introduce the regulations in a slightly refined form and with longer time limits, for we are dealing here with major economic burdens laid on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We should therefore be more generous in the transitional provisions, in order that the burden on the economy may not be allowed to be too great."
"Let me conclude by appealing to the Social Democrats and Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, who is herself a great expert on traffic safety."
"As our Amendment No 12 demands, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, we need different speeds for small and large lorries."
"So we are again asking you to support our Amendment No 12, so that we can permit a speed of 110 kph for smaller commercial vehicles."
"If we impose the same speed limit on all HGVs, we are pre-programming traffic jams into the motorway system."
"If we are to ensure traffic flow, we must make it possible for smaller vehicles to overtake."
"With that in mind, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, I ask you to support our amendment."
"We will then have a great piece of legislation!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, for the considerable openness and readiness to compromise that have characterised his work on this report."
"The transport of both goods and people on the roads is ever increasing."
"Movement on the roads is international and cross-border, and so too, therefore, must be the rules we lay down."
"A shining example is the legislation on speed limitation devices."
"When it came into force in 1994, it had met a certain amount of resistance both from the industry and from the drivers themselves, but this evaporated when the advantages became apparent."
"In a Europe in which more than 40 000 people lose their lives in road accidents, all kinds of methods must be tried in order to make the roads safer."
"Once speed limitation devices had been introduced, it was no longer possible to build speeding into systems under which the heaviest vehicles operated."
"This new proposal will lead to speed limitation devices also being used in lighter commercial vehicles and buses, and this will have further positive repercussions."
"Recently, there has been a marked increase in the frequency of accidents involving lighter commercial vehicles."
"Those of us in the Group of the Party of European Socialists support the amendments in favour of a longer transition period."
"One issue which, however, recurred in the debate on this directive, and which Mr Jarzembowski addressed, is that of whether there should be different speeds for different categories of vehicle."
"It was argued that identical speeds create congestion and bottlenecks on the roads."
"I do not believe that is the case."
"The fewer speed differences there are, the smoother the traffic flows, in actual fact."
"There are mathematical calculations to show this. It is enough to imagine a road on which vehicles are maintaining the same speed."
"In that case, the traffic flows more smoothly."
"That is why I demand that Amendment No 12 be rejected."
"Mr President, I am quite sure that we all accept the premise that an inappropriate speed by any vehicle can cause accidents."
"But more often than not accidents are attibutable to the manner in which the vehicle is being driven, or the carelessness of drivers failing to be vigilant, especially in bad weather for example."
"Accidents are also caused by drivers crawling along at a snail's pace on motorways and in some cases they could be avoided by having a minimum as well as a maximum speed limit."
"There has to be recognition that there is a world of difference between motorway and urban driving."
"Whilst clearly agreeing with the Commission and my colleagues, including Mr Hatzidakis, that we must do all we can to improve road safety across the European Union, I cannot agree that the way forward would be the introduction of this directive, which advocated a one-speed-fits-all approach."
"It is recognised that the United Kingdom has the best safety record in the EU."
"It is equally true to say that it was one of the first countries to fit speed limiters on coaches, for obvious reasons."
"In addition, this directive is also meant to improve the environment and congestion and again I would refute that claim."
"To extend this directive to those categories of vehicles included in the proposal, and to impose the upper speed limits as outlined, would be a mistake."
"It is bad enough struggling along motorways when two heavy goods lorries are running parallel because one decides to overtake on a hill and clearly cannot accelerate."
"If this directive comes into play I believe that congestion and environmental pollution will increase."
"Finally, the right way forward would be to seriously consider advances in technology, for example the proposed voluntary agreement on pedestrian protection."
"In addition, there is also the possibility of ISA and I would support a study by the Commission along those lines."
"Nevertheless, ultimately, it should be left to the discretion of the Member State to decide what would or would not be appropriate."
"With the exception of a couple of amendments, my delegation will be unable to support this report."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to thank Mr Hatzidakis for his sound preparation of this report."
"Traffic safety is rightly one of the core themes of the White Paper."
"The number of people who are killed each year in the European Union is still far too high."
"These fatal accidents are often caused by speeding."
"With a view to reducing the road accident toll, speed limitation devices for lorries are an effective instrument for improving road safety."
"Indeed, lower speeds lead to fewer road accidents and fewer victims."
"Furthermore, benefits can be expected in the fields of maintenance and of a cleaner environment."
"In order to ensure that speed limitation devices cannot be interfered with and in order to guarantee that they are maintained in proper working order, reliable inspection is needed."
"Annual compulsory inspection seems best suited for this purpose, in my opinion. But in that case, an adjustment to the European General Periodical Car Inspection Directive is necessary in order to bring about a level playing field."
"I should like to draw your attention to the issue of intelligent speed adapters, a very important point in my view."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commission, at the earliest possibility, to conduct a study into the possibilities which this system could offer."
"It could contribute to greater safety on the roads, less irritation and a greater sense of security on the part of drivers."
"In general, I should like to ask the Commission to give an extra boost to technology which should make intelligent road and traffic control systems possible."
"This is with a view to the expected growth in demand for transport, as a result of which the benefits of this directive in terms of road safety will be lost."
"The level of safety will go down once again, the build-up on roads will increase again and the beneficial impact which we are pursuing by means of this directive will be cancelled out."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, for his fantastic work on this directive, a report which fully supports the Commission' s proposal and which incorporates numerous amendments which improve the text of the proposal without changing its objective."
"The purpose of the proposal is to extend the scope of the obligatory installation and use of speed limiters to vehicles in lighter categories than those currently affected by these limitations."
"This measure represents the realisation of the priorities formulated in March 2000, within the framework of the Commission communication on road safety, which also received the explicit support of this Parliament."
"The proposal will contribute to an increase in road safety, the protection of the environment and the maintenance of conditions of equal and fair competition between all operators within the European Union."
"I would like to make some comments on the report we are dealing with here."
"There are several amendments which we can support: Amendments Nos 4, 6 and 7 can be accepted in their entirety;"
"Nos 5 and 10 are acceptable in principle, although the dates need to be altered, and the same is the case with Amendment No 6, which I referred to previously."
"The Commission would prefer the following timetable: two years for new vehicles, three years for international transport and four for national transport."
"I believe that this answers some of Mr Jarzembowski' s questions on the effects on small and medium-sized businesses, which are the most frequent users of this type of vehicle."
"There is an adaptation period and, if we bear in mind the rotation of this type of vehicle, the time of the entry into force of the directive, etc., we see that it is not so out of place."
"With regard to Amendment No 9, the Commission could accept a study in the context of road safety towards 2010, as long as it does not involve a separate report."
"In any event, the time limit of 18 months is excessively short to carry out such a study. We need two years as a minimum."
"In this regard, I would like to stress the great importance the Commission attaches to intelligent speed restriction systems and great attention will be paid to the study of this issue."
"The concepts behind Amendments Nos 8 and 11 are unacceptable to the Commission."
"The acceptance of greater maximum speeds for a limited period of time not only raises technical problems for which there is no solution, at least at the moment, but would also hinder the implementation of the measure."
"The Commission believes that, for the moment, there is no advantage in applying this directive to M1 and N1 vehicles."
"Furthermore, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 12, which Mr Jarzembowski advocated, amongst others, because the triple objective of the directive - road safety, environmental protection and competition under equal conditions - cannot be achieved unless all vehicles are bound by the same speed limit."
"Finally, we will carefully study Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3, which refer to the textual differences between linguistic versions, in relation to the definition of vehicles."
"I would once again like to congratulate the rapporteur and all the Members who have spoken in this debate."
"I hope that, through the application of this directive, road safety will improve, which is the intention, since the figure of 42 000 deaths per year is completely unacceptable to all of us."
"The debate on this report is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Excise duty on rum, liqueurs and eaux-de-vie"
"The next item is the report (A5-0001/2002) by Mr Marques, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposals for Council decisions:"
"1. authorising France to extend the application of a reduced rate of excise duty on 'traditional' rum produced in its overseas departments (COM(2001) 347 - C5-0401/2001 - 2001/0142(CNS))"
"2. 2. authorising Portugal to apply a reduced rate of excise duty in the autonomous region of Madeira on locally produced and consumed rum and liqueurs and in the autonomous region of the Azores on locally produced and consumed liqueurs and eaux-de-vie (COM(2001) 442 - C5-0422/2001 - 2001/0169(CNS))."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as a Member for one of the outermost regions, I welcomed the opportunity to draw up the report we are now discussing."
"I am pleased because the Commission' s proposals to reduce the special rate of excise duty on the consumption of certain alcoholic drinks produced in Madeira, the Azores and the French overseas departments are yet another measure giving form and substance to the principle of remoteness, enshrined in Article 299(2) of the Treaties."
"We should bear in mind that this legal basis, endorsed by the Treaty of Amsterdam, provides for the adoption of specific measures in various fields, especially that of tax legislation, in accordance with the very particular geographical, social, economic and cultural situations of these European regions."
"In short, the European Union can give these territories special treatment in line with their very specific situations, and the only limit on this special treatment should be the integrity and coherence of the Community legal system, including the internal market and common policies."
"Only by providing this specific treatment will we ensure that these regions can become involved in the dynamism unleashed by the internal market, by Economic and Monetary Union, by the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, and even by the phenomenon of globalisation."
"Only by providing this special treatment will we ensure that these regions can offer genuine equal opportunities for our citizens living in the outermost regions."
"The measures to reduce the special rate of excise duty on rum and liqueurs produced and consumed in Madeira, on eaux-de-vie produced and consumed in the Azores and on rum produced in the French overseas departments are crucial to offsetting production costs and thereby guaranteeing the survival of traditional activities of considerable economic, social, historic and cultural importance for these regions."
"One hundred and forty jobs are at stake in Madeira and the Azores and 40 000 in the French Overseas Departments."
"At stake are also elements related to the specific identity itself of these regions, particularly in the French Overseas Departments, where activities linked to the planting of sugar cane and to the production of sugar and rum are an important part of the economic and social history of these territories."
"All of these activities are, therefore, linked to the sugar cane, sugar and rum industries, which depend on this tax measure, in a context marked by the revision of the COM in sugar and by the dismantling of customs barriers for exports to the Community market of spirits from third countries."
"Indeed, without the tax measure now being proposed, how will rum production in the OD be able to remain viable, when production costs for rum are considerably higher there than in neighbouring Caribbean countries, when rum from the Caribbean is able to enter the Community market without duties in 2003?"
"We should bear in mind that Community rum producers pay between four and six times more for sugar cane and three times more for their work force."
"Here, costs arising from adapting rum production units to environmental standards, in order to comply with Community regulations, are increasing."
"I shall close by emphasising that, despite the permanent nature of the specific characteristics that justify the special treatment granted to the outermost regions by Article 299(2), these tax measures are not only limited in terms of time - they are valid for seven years - but are also limited in quantitative terms."
"They are, furthermore, subject to periodic evaluation, in order to assess whether the reasons which justify the granting of the tax derogation still exist."
"Before us, therefore, lies a well-drafted and balanced proposal by the Commission, to which we should all give our support."
"It responds, on the one hand, to the need for special treatment for the outermost regions and, on the other, safeguards the integrity of the Community' s internal market."
"This is also the type of measure that creates and promotes European citizenship in territories far from the centre of Europe such as the outermost regions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the cane-sugar rum sector provides almost 40 000 jobs in three of the four French overseas departments."
"By allowing producers in these departments to supply only the French market with a limited quantity of 'traditional' rum for a seven-year period, we are giving these businesses the means to fight against stiff competition from some third countries and, in doing so, we are protecting the future of thousands of jobs."
"However, I personally deplore the fact that, despite the request made by France, the Commission has not stated that it is in favour of a longer derogation period, which would have been a more appropriate way to reflect the economic logic of this matter as well as the letter and the spirit of the notorious Article 299(2) of the Treaty."
"Despite the fact that some progress has been made, the implementation of this article for now only partially meets the expectations that it raised."
"We must, however, take ambitious measures and do so quickly."
"The people are asking us to do this, and it is our political responsibility to respond."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, this debate concerns a specific issue, which is of limited reach and importance in the Azores, not wishing to make any comparison with the situation in the overseas territories or even in the autonomous region of Madeira, just two days after the Las Palmas summit of the Presidents of the Outermost Regions, which was attended by representatives of the Member States and the Commission."
"I should, therefore, like to welcome the conclusions of that summit and call on the Council and the Commission to take them into consideration."
"This year is of particular importance to the Azores where fisheries are concerned, since important initiatives such as the revision of the common fisheries policy, the revision of Poseima-Fisheries and the quotas policy for groundfish are to be approved."
"These are areas in which it is crucial to fully understand the realities of the Azores and to take account of their specific situation."
"The Commission proposals on quotas for fishing groundfish cause us the greatest concern from this point of view."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I am pleased to note that Mr Marques' s report fully supports the Commission' s proposals."
"According to these reports and the Commission' s proposals, these measures are essential in order to maintain the local production of rum, which is traditional in French overseas departments, and of rum, liqueurs and eaux-de-vie, which are traditional in Madeira and the Azores."
"These traditional activities are very important for the economy of these regions and it is essential to maintain them in order to ensure an economic, social and territorial balance for these regions of the European Union."
"I would like to say something relating to the legal basis of the proposals, since there has been controversy about it, which the rapporteur, Mr Marques, has mentioned."
"Both are based on the application of the second paragraph of Article 299 of the EC Treaty, which is precisely the one relating to the outermost regions."
"This provision allows the Council to adopt specific measures, which may repeal other fundamental provisions of the Treaty, laying down the conditions for its application in regions which - we must state this very clearly - have very different specific characteristics owing precisely to their condition as outermost regions."
"I would like to point out, ladies and gentlemen, that this provision was included in the Treaty of Amsterdam with the purpose of creating a common legal basis for actions in favour of these regions."
"These actions must allow for the complete integration of these regions into the Union, while recognising their own characteristics, such as their great distance from the continent, the dependence of their economy on a small number of products, many of them relating to traditional and small-scale activities."
"Therefore, the Commission considers that this second paragraph of Article 299 of the Treaty is the appropriate legal basis for these proposals and any others which may arise in the future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Galileo Joint Undertaking"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0005/2002) by Mr Glante, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of the Galileo Joint Undertaking (COM(2001) 336 - C5-0329/2001 - 2001/0136(CNS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies, gentlemen, and above all, you interpreters who are assembled here in such numbers for so few of us Members, it is always a pleasure to be able to discuss such an interesting and exciting topic at such a late hour."
"I hope that the lateness of the hour will not downgrade the project."
"I refer to the Galileo satellite navigation system, the first great project to be shaped jointly by the European institutions and the ESA."
"In technical, economic and political terms, it is eminently comparable with such projects as the Airbus and the GSM mobile telecommunications standard."
"This system will to some degree be in technological competition with the existing American GPS system, which is a good thing for European technology, but it will also be compatible with GPS - at least I hope it will, and that is something by which we set store - and be able to supplement it."
"I have been told that the United States is seriously concerned about developments in Europe."
"That cannot be a bad thing, and can mean only that we are on the right road and that we will make technological progress in Europe by the use of this system."
"It is certainly in competition, in technological terms, with the existing GPS, but there is also the possibility of their interacting."
"We are working towards the system being able to use the same receivers for GPS and Galileo signals."
"That will increase the utility of both systems."
"I would also like, at this point, to refer to the coordination between GPS, Galileo and EGNOS."
"Most discussions fail to do justice to this point, but I think it too is important."
"After 11 September and during the Afghanistan conflict, the United States had apprehensions about the security aspects of what is a civilian project, but these will be safeguarded."
"Both the civilian character and the public control of the Galileo project make disruption, interference and misuse impossible."
"A certain levy on receivers will mean that broad use will be free of charge."
"Broad use of GPS is free of charge, and so will Galileo be."
"More exact services of a higher order will have to be paid for in order to guarantee the refinancing of the running and development costs."
"The service will, however, be permanently available."
"This afternoon I had the pleasure of a conversation with the US Government's representative in Brussels, who again expressed his concern about the project's development."
"I was able to reassure him, but not in the sense that we would unreservedly submit ourselves to the GPS system."
"I made it clear to him that we are building our own system, that we are working towards cooperation, but that we will carry on with development and not let ourselves be led into some kind of technological dependency."
"I think that these informally expressed wishes and these remarks show that we are still on the right road."
"The Member States have delayed taking a decision for a long time, and I hope that they will enthusiastically endorse this project in March, despite certain problems that they have with the Price Waterhouse study - indeed, I get indications from various Member State governments that they will."
"I hope that we will get to that, and believe that it is high time we did."
"We are already a couple of months behind, but will be able to make up for them."
"I would like to again express my gratitude to the Commissioner for the conversation we had and also for providing these documents, which again explain what Galileo is about and can allay any suspicions or misgivings."
"Let us turn now to the report itself and to the proposal, which is not uncontroversial."
"I think there is, as there was in the past, overwhelming agreement that we want this project and that we want it to be a civilian one."
"As a result, though, of events last year and in recent months, we are also agreed that it needs to be available to some degree to our troops who are sent out to maintain the peace."
"That will be feasible, technically feasible, but it will also be politically desired and feasible."
"It is, though, to remain a civilian system, as it was before."
"There were great problems in discussions about how private enterprise was to be involved in this undertaking."
"The Commission proposal works on the assumption that private firms will be involved, including financially."
"Financial participation is - shall we say - a symbolic act."
"It would be enough to finance the development stage by means of public funds alone, but industry is to be involved."
"That is what I want too, but I have had no clear indication from industry that they are becoming amicably disposed towards the Commission proposal and getting on board the Joint Undertaking."
"My proposal that the development company should be established, coming into being in parallel with the Joint Undertaking but dovetailing closely with it, offers a compromise, a way out of the dilemma."
"Indications from the business world are variable - some are rejecting this proposal, while others have a very open mind about it."
"I have endeavoured simply to use this proposal to reduce to some extent the inhibitions that businesses have, and I hope that they will participate in the development company."
"In so far, I hope for broad support tomorrow."
"Unfortunately, I cannot support the European People's Party's proposals, which date back to the Commission proposal and thus, in my opinion, give industry another argument against joining in."
", draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you also, Mr Glante, for your efforts at producing this report in this form, and thank you for what you have said."
"Mr Radwan, in his capacity as your shadow rapporteur, will further enlarge on the PPE proposal that you feel unable to support."
"Having its own satellite navigation system has been one of Europe's concerns for many years now, but it exists only as an aspiration."
"No decision on it has as yet been reached."
"It is in connection with Galileo, of all things, that everything is weighed in the balance a thousand times over, every euro is examined closely, whereas in other areas the European purse-strings are much looser."
"What I reproach the Member States for is the way they delay and defer, hang back and hesitate, and that is what could stick in the minds of Europe's citizens."
"That is also what Europe's image threatens to become if we are not careful."
"I, however, want Europe to be modern, technologically on the ball, quite literally the worldwide Number One."
"This is where Europe can play its trump cards - economic strength, a talent for innovation, technological capacity and vision."
"I do not want to make apocalyptic predictions, but I am convinced that, without Galileo, Europe could completely lose its position in an important sector and will fall back so far that it will, at the end of the day, be quite impossible for it to catch up."
"If we do not manage to get Galileo started and at last open the doors to new technologies, if we do not manage to make the necessary funds available, then we will become a laughing-stock across the world, and in outer space as well."
"Why am I telling you this?"
"We need now, at last, a resounding 'yes' to Galileo and a competitive alternative to GPS!"
"The Council wanted industry involved in Galileo as early as possible."
"The Commission submitted a proposal which Parliament put to the acid test, and which received - and still receives - severe criticism from different sides, and I do think there were omissions on the Commission's side as well."
"Our Committees have identified a number of problem areas."
"Industry involvement in the Joint Undertaking - whether direct or via the development company - must not, though, be made so hard to reach that Galileo's failure becomes a possible result."
"Europe needs Galileo, or, as the Commission puts it in its information note, Galileo is indispensable to Europe."
"That is why I hope Parliament will speak with a clear voice and that there will be a large majority tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of an opinion on the Galileo proposal, I would like to focus essentially on two financial aspects of the Commission' s proposal, leaving the rapporteur and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism the task of discussing its merits."
"The Commission has presented a proposal for the setting-up of a Joint Undertaking to complete the development phase of Galileo; this would provide a single management structure with legal personality which would be flexible and capable of concluding the necessary contracts."
"The founding members would be the Commission and the European Space Agency, which would contribute a maximum of EUR 520 million and EUR 550 million respectively."
"The European Investment Bank and any private company providing a minimum sum of EUR 20 million could be further members."
"The cost of this phase is estimated at EUR 1.1 billion, to be split equally between the European Community and the European Space Agency, with an extra EUR 200 million coming from the private sector, pledged through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in March 2001 by representatives of the main industries concerned."
"The Community' s financial contribution will come from two budget lines: from B5-700 - Trans-European Networks - and from a token entry under the B6 Research chapter pending a final decision on the 6th Framework Programme."
"Out of the amount financed by the European Space Agency, EUR 50 million would be paid in cash and EUR 500 million in kind, as stated in the European Space Agency' s Statutes."
"I have tabled two amendments in my opinion: the first concerns the possible future participation of the candidate countries in the development phase of Galileo, as called for by Parliament in its resolution of 3 October 2001."
"I have called for instruments to be identified in the budget which will allow them to participate, not least in order to avoid further widening the existing gap."
"The second amendment concerns the role to be conferred on the Budgetary Authority; I therefore call upon the Commission to inform it on a regular basis on the implementation of the development phase of Galileo, and for the annual report on the activities of the Joint Undertaking to be sent to Parliament and the Council and not only to the Court of Auditors as proposed by the Commission."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank the rapporteur at the outset for his close cooperation."
"All of one mind, we are on track to make Galileo a reality."
"I would also like to start by thanking the Commissioner, who repeatedly and doggedly pleads, and indeed fights, for Galileo at Council level."
"Economically, technologically and politically, Galileo is a strategic project for the future."
"That has already been said several times."
"Here in Europe, we should remember how it was explained to us decades ago that we did not need the Airbus, we did not need a missile industry."
"They would do all that for us, and it would be for the best."
"Where would we be today if, for example, we had not developed the Airbus ourselves?"
"Now, though, I have two practical observations on Mr Glante's report."
"I consider it essential that industry should today already be actively involved in Galileo."
"There is no use in describing Galileo's importance in fine words; we need industry to make a clear commitment to Galileo."
"We must make a start right now on developing services to get products onto the markets of the future, products which would enable Galileo to be self-financing, which is what both sides of this House want: hence we need absolutely clear support for the Commission proposal to this end."
"We should, though, perhaps give thought to some reduction in the 'front-loading' ."
"I see Galileo's political dimension as a second important point."
"We want Europe to have a common foreign and security policy."
"We have the Rapid Reaction Force, and we want, in the future, to send our soldiers to troublespots."
"Here, too, we need to assume responsibility for our soldiers, which means that we have information systems of our own and are no longer dependent on third countries."
"What this means is that Galileo is, to some extent, necessary if we are to grow up in the way we approach external policy."
"Tomorrow should, therefore, see Parliament send a clear demand, for the sake of Europe's future, that the Council should decide in favour of Galileo!"
"Apart from that, we propose, as an alternative, that, if the Council proves to be Galileo's undoing, we might well have to have thoughts about the defence budgets, and I am very definitely of the opinion that it is our primary duty to ensure that Galileo remains a civilian product."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to express my regret that we have engaged in a battle over amendments after the enormous success of Mrs Langenhagen' s report."
"I think that divisive forces have also been at work in the European Parliament, but I am convinced, from what I have heard, that they will not succeed."
"I hope that, however we vote on the amendments, tomorrow' s vote will be an overall majority in favour of the Galileo report."
"The most important thing is that Parliament does not become divided, and that it continues to show its support for Mrs de Palacio and the Commission on this extremely important project."
"We cannot merely focus on accounting and notarial-oriented matters when discussing a subject of this importance, when the Americans are pouring millions of dollars into their aerospace and space industry."
"We are today facing the acid test."
"Either the European Union is capable of launching a space programme as modest as Galileo, forty years after the daring innovations of Airbus and Ariane, or - as some Members who are sitting on other benches have said - we show that we are incapable of doing this."
"If we have to show that we are incapable of this, I do not want Parliament to take any responsibility for this and I hope that the Commission and Parliament will, in future, display a united front when showing the Council what its responsibilities are."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance takes a positive overall view of the report by Mr Glante."
"It is not a question of deciding whether or not to approve the Galileo project."
"This has already been decided in the report by Mrs Langenhagen, as she herself has just pointed out, and I myself gave a favourable opinion on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"Our objective is now to decide how to manage the project' s development phase."
"We agree with the rapporteur' s proposal to create a Joint Undertaking whose shareholders would be the European Union and the ESA, an undertaking which would be dissolved once the development phase is completed."
"We also agree with his proposal to create, alongside that, a development company in which the private sector will participate."
"It will enable conflicts of interest to be avoided whilst drafting the specification and the tendering procedure during the deployment phase."
"The Undertaking will not therefore be judge and judged."
"We do not believe that the proposed monitoring committee will serve a useful purpose, since the Member States are already represented in the Joint Undertaking."
"However, we are in favour of setting up a committee with an ethical purpose, whose opinions will be consulted and which will ensure that Galileo is used properly and in accordance with the principles laid down by Parliament."
"Lastly, we do not agree with the amendments tabled by Mr Radwan, which reintroduce the concept of Galileo being used for military applications, even occasionally, on the pretext that this could be done for humanitarian ends."
"If this amendment received a favourable vote, we could not vote for the report thus amended."
"To sum up, if the use of Galileo for military applications is not reintroduced by any means whatsoever, we will vote in favour of the report by Mr Glante, in its current form, unless the monitoring committee concerned, which we recommended setting up in the first report, does not have an ethical purpose."
"Madam Commissioner: the PPE-DE broadly supports the Galileo project in principle."
"We recognise the case for a complementary and alternative satellite radio navigation system."
"We recognise the importance of maintaining European technological capability for space activity."
"We welcome the emphasis on a civil project intended ultimately to be commercially viable in a number of fields such as communications and Earth observation, as well as position - finding."
"The difficulty lies in determining how to fund a venture until it becomes self-financing, particularly in view of the large sums of upfront investments required."
"We want to see industry fully involved in the planning, specifications and preparatory stages to ensure a better chance of technical success."
"That is why we have reintroduced amendments to lower the entrance fee for business to be part of the Joint Undertaking."
"We see no particular merit in the proposal for a development company at this stage which duplicates the Joint Undertaking structures."
"We are mindful of the difficulties of funding such a large-value infrastructures project solely from the private sector, which is why we have put forward the amendment enabling some funding to come from defence budgets provided it is used only for peacekeeping purposes."
"This merely supports the comments made in Annex 1 of the Commission's own information note concerning strategic considerations."
"In closing I would say that it is a great pleasure to be here as the other half of ""les deux gilles ciel et espace"" club, with my colleague, Mr Savary."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Glante for the report he has presented."
"I would also like to thank Mr Savary and Mr Chichester, the whole of the Sky and Space team and all the MEPs who backed a document supporting the Galileo programme with a view to the European Council at Laeken."
"Unfortunately, we were not able to achieve it on that particular occasion, but we hope to do so next time."
"We must not be discouraged and we still have time, although not much, to try finally to move ahead with a project which seems to me absolutely crucial to Europe and which furthermore is going to be a measure of Europe' s real will to have a presence on the international stage."
"I will just focus on three aspects which have been referred to here in relation to the report."
"We all feel that the participation of the private sector is crucial."
"Our differences lie in how and from when, if I have understood correctly."
"I wish to say in this respect - as Mr Savary and Mrs Langenhagen have said - that, regardless of the result of the amendments relating to Mr Glante' s report, I hope that the report, in the form it takes after the amendments or without them, has the greatest possible support, regardless of my preferences for one formula or another."
"We believe that the private sector should be incorporated from the outset, not only because of the limited funds which it is going to provide during the development phase of 2002 to 2005, but because in the medium term it falls to that sector to contribute substantially during the following phase, not only in the implementation phase, but also in the operative phase."
"The substantial increase in the financial participation of the private sector is an essential condition if we are to achieve, within the framework of the future financial perspectives, the necessary public funding in the latter phases."
"The participation of the private sector should not be improvised, but rather it should be prepared from now, and that was expressed in the resolution of the Council of Ministers in April of last year."
"The Commission' s proposal, which is being presented today, simply puts this principle into practice."
"It is true that there is a suggestion, raised by Mr Glante, which replaces that direct participation with the creation of a Joint Undertaking, with the creation of a promotion company in parallel with the Joint Undertaking, which does not seem sufficient to us, as I have pointed out."
"We believe that participation must take place within the undertaking and furthermore that there is a clear will, not only in the space sector, but also in the applications sector, to go ahead with this phase, with this public or private participation."
"I would also like to say that, by participating in the capital of the Joint Undertaking, industry is now beginning to accept a minimal risk, and I think that is appropriate, because it must also participate in the final definitions of the architecture of the whole system."
"Some in the Council and in Parliament fear that conflicts of interest may arise."
"In my opinion, these days, national legislations provide formulae which prevent this type of conflict of interests."
"As I have said on previous occasions, we are giving aid and funding programmes, while there is a bank acting as financial adviser on the aid, while, linked to that bank, there is a non-governmental organisation, which carries out the programme and while, also related to that bank, there is a study group which is assessing the reality of the programme."
"And we say that all of that is correct and that there are sufficient barriers to guarantee that a conflict of interests is not possible."
"I believe that, in this case, there are even more concrete and clear ways, the famous Great wall of China, which would allow us to prevent this type of problem."
"Article 9 of the Statutes says that, in the proposal we are making, in the field of contracting, the executive committee must act totally independently from the management board in which the companies participating in the Joint Undertaking would be represented, that is to say that the executive committee acts independently of the companies which may participate in tenders."
"To prevent concerns, there are formulae which may offer greater guarantees."
"With regard to the role of the States of the Union, we fully agree with the approach taken in the report by Mr Glante, that is, the creation of a monitoring committee made up of representatives of the Member States, so that those States may closely and continuously monitor the activities of the Joint Undertaking."
"We have therefore proposed to the Council, and they have approved it, that in the Regulation, not in the statutes of the Joint Undertaking, but in the Regulation, a monitoring council should be established made up of representatives of the States."
"This council should meet before each meeting of the management board of the Joint Undertaking to offer its opinion on the positions the Commission intends to advocate in relation to the different points on the agenda."
"These operating rules seem to us to be the most appropriate for achieving our objective, since they maintain the operating autonomy of the undertaking while allowing the States to control the activities of the Commission, which represents the European Community on the management board of the Joint Undertaking."
"With regard to the military dimension, ladies and gentlemen, I will say that Galileo is a system designed for civil purposes, which will have to be managed by civilians and that, furthermore, that is one of its essential differences when compared to the GPS."
"Having said that, it is true that there is a service reserved for public administrations, which is intended for applications such as fire services and security, which at certain times can be used for other purposes, but at the moment the open GPS is being used for certain applications and for certain military uses."
"It is inevitable that they will carry equipment which is synchronised with Galileo."
"By this, ladies and gentlemen, I mean firstly that this type of system always has a double use."
"Secondly, as you know, there is a free access signal, which is totally free of charge, and another access signal, pre-paid, with services, codified, but which is also free."
"And a third signal is reserved for the public sector, but - I insist - is intended not for military uses but for civilian uses such as those I have indicated."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in relation to Galileo, all the elements for taking a decision are on the table in the Council of Ministers, and the funding for the whole of the development phase, without any State of the Union having to give a single euro more in order to implement the project."
"We must make it clear that the current financial perspectives cover the whole of the development phase of Galileo."
"No State should have to put in another additional euro."
"Galileo is essential to European industry, to technological capacity, to European space technology, but also for a series of other factors, such as autonomy, sovereignty and the capacity to offer an alternative service to GPS, which would strengthen the latter, since, as we have often said, Galileo will be and should always be, compatible with the GPS, both should be mutually strengthened, and, in the event of the failure of either of them, the other should serve as an alternative for all users."
"It only remains for us to see whether or not there is political will and I believe that this is one of those occasions which will demonstrate whether or not there is political will to move towards a Europe which counts in the world."
"The ball is in the Ministers' court and we hope that they decide that there is that will."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.35 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, with regard to yesterday' s vote on the Olsson report, Paragraph 1, second part, states that I abstained from the vote."
"I actually voted against. I would appreciate it if this were corrected."
"We take note of how you voted, which will be corrected."
"Due to an error, the proposals of the Conference of Presidents on the appointment of Members of Parliament to bureaux of delegations to joint parliamentary committees do not appear in yesterday' s Minutes and they will, therefore, be included in today' s."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, I wish, on the record, to thank France and Belgium for the guard on the buildings having now been markedly stepped up."
"Thank you, Mr Rübig. We take note of your observation."
"Mr President, at the last sitting, we were all horrified at the possibility that Safiya Husseini might be executed in Nigeria."
"I was going to ask for the floor, but Mr Corrie asked for it and I felt that he was representing me when he asked the President to intervene."
"There is currently a mobilisation in my country, because it appears that the execution has been brought forward to this Saturday."
"This horrifies us even more, because the case of this woman, like that of many others, is a display of savagery."
"It is horrendous that a woman is going to be executed for having had a daughter, which is her fifth child, whatever the circumstances of the child' s birth."
"We should make a final effort to prevent this execution which the authorities have brought forward to this Saturday in an attempt to avoid the international pressure on them not to carry out what I consider to be a murder."
"Mr President, I would ask you to make the appropriate representations."
"Mrs González, the whole House shares your feelings and, as far as our institution is able, we will take all possible measures to ensure that such an atrocity cannot be carried out."
"Mr President, I should like to make a comment on today' s agenda. It strikes me that today' s debates will finish around 5.30 p.m., while the votes will not start until 6.30 p.m."
"We have had this situation for a long time now."
"It means that for many of the Members, it is just too late to return home at the end of the debate, and they therefore have to stay on until tomorrow, or return home sooner."
"In my view, it is an excellent thing that we are here, even if we have to burn the midnight oil as far as I am concerned, if we have something to discuss."
"If that is not the case, then we should not be required to sit here drinking coffee for an hour."
"I would therefore ask you if you could perhaps put it to the President to see whether this problem can be solved in such a manner that Members need not at any rate stay on any longer than is necessary."
"Yes, Mr Maaten, but we have an agenda established."
"Within the bounds of this agenda, we will try to take your concerns into account as far as possible."
"Women's rights and equal opportunities in Mediterranean countries"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0022/2002) by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on EU policy towards Mediterranean countries in relation to the promotion of women's rights and equal opportunities in these countries (2001/2129(INI))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Euro-Mediterranean cooperation is a political vision and a vital project for the EU."
"But it is not just a sound method of promoting its economic interests; the main objective is to create an area of peace, security, stability and prosperity."
"The history of European unification teaches us that, unless there is prosperity for all, men and women alike, there can be no zone of peace and stability."
"At present, the role of women in this process of cooperation is marginal or focused on the economic sector, with negligible results as regards improving their standard of living, whereas our committee believes that such a political vision should consider women to be instrumental in promoting cohesion, peace and sustainable development."
"The aim of this own initiative report is to assess policy to date, to urge the European Union to implement all the necessary policies to promote the social, political and economic rights of women in the Mediterranean and to urge the partner countries to assume their responsibilities and rise to the challenges inherent in this objective by all possible means."
"Assessing the situation is no easy task, because there are considerable variations from one country to another."
"There is a lack of statistical data broken down by gender, an absence of studies by the European Commission and the national governments effectively evaluating the impact of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation on the promotion of women' s rights and a special regional Mediterranean programme has yet to be applied."
"Generally speaking, unemployment also affects women with a university education and illiteracy is on the increase."
"Early marriage and other entrenched customs mean that girls often drop out of school."
"There is evidence of entrepreneurship in the Maghreb, but the lack of financing and credit facilities tends to block women's initiatives."
"Violence, poverty and poor health among women are also commonplace, as is their absence from or under-representation in decision-making posts and, hence, their absence when Euro-Mediterranean cooperation is being negotiated and planned."
"Tradition and religious stereotypes affect legislation, the ratification of international agreements and the application of such agreements."
"Our committee calls for the effective implementation of what has already been laid down in the Barcelona Declaration regarding progress towards democracy and respect for human rights and for the gender dimension to be incorporated in the three pillars of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"It also calls for association agreements to incorporate an explicit provision on protection forwomen's' rights and also to provide for a policyfor monitoring suchprotection."
"We are delighted that the study and the first regional Mediterranean programme for women have already been decided and we call on the Commission to take a global political approach, rather than confining the programme to vocational training, and to provide all the tools needed so that the issue of sexual equality can be dealt with in the broadest possible context, as it is in the countries of the European Union which apply this principle."
"The European Commission and the Commissioner, who is present here, are experienced in drawing up and applying this sort of programme in the Member States and candidate countries and we believe that this experience will stand them in good stead when it comes to drawing up the regional Mediterranean programme."
"Similarly, our committee is in favour of supporting women's organisations in the partner countries and of networking them with women's organisations in the Member States of the European Union."
"We predict even greater potential for cooperation with women's organisations and social agencies in the candidate countries and the Balkans because the entire region is responding to the challenge of stability and peace by mobilising civic society."
"In addition, having noted that the European Investment Bank has no budget for financing and supporting women's activities, we are in favour of a study into the possibility of creating a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank for the Euro-Mediterranean zone because we feel that this will give women and women's organisations a chance to develop and obtain facilities and credit."
"We are also in favour of setting up a database and observatory to monitor this progress and the compilation of data used to assess and plan future policy."
"We also paid close attention to the problems of women immigrants from these countries in the European Union and we call for the red tape and other obstacles to legal immigration into the Member States of the European Union to be lifted, because we believe that they result in poverty, marginalisation and the exploitation of human and, more specifically, women's lives."
"These phenomena have been denounced repeatedly, both by our committee and by the European Parliament as a whole."
"This report is the result of excellent collaboration with the other political groups and I should like to thank my fellow Members for their amendments and for working with us and to ask you to endorse the report in its entirety."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as members of this Parliament' s Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, we are extremely concerned about the situation of women in the Mediterranean countries, which was so well described by Mrs Kratsa in her report."
"Widespread illiteracy - especially in certain countries, as the percentages she presents indicate - early school leaving, without achieving a level of study which prepares them for later life, and a lack of participation in the labour market - especially amongst young women - are factors which, together with poverty and marginalisation, above all affect women in the majority of cases."
"This is the case despite the cooperation agreements, which contain many clauses, but never make it very clear that the situation of women should be taken into account amongst the objectives, and that the promotion of women and their access to better levels of personal well-being and to the labour market must also be amongst those objectives, so that they can pursue their own professions."
"In these areas, health problems are one of the most serious situations they face, not only through a lack of healthcare, but also because of a lack of prevention."
"These problems affect the whole population in general, but particularly women."
"This is particularly surprising, given that we know the MEDA programme has had problems in this House, because not even half of what was intended has been implemented."
"The MEDA programme, which is aimed at cooperation programmes in the Mediterranean areas, in particular the Southern Mediterranean, would be a wonderful instrument for creating specific programmes for women, aimed at promoting the role of women and increasing the living standards of women, which would be an advantage to the whole population, since we all know how important women are in the least-developed societies and, in particular, in traditional societies, where women bear the greatest responsibility for the family which, furthermore, usually includes a large number of children."
"By means of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum of Women Members of Parliament we are well aware of the situation of these women, and we know what they expect from Parliament and the European Union."
"We therefore have the obligation to draw attention to these facts so that their needs may be met."
"Mr President, this is unfortunately the story of a so far unfulfilled commitment, which I will comment on later."
"I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa, for being so willing to incorporate all of those amendments and issues which we in the Socialist Group have wanted to raise in order to supplement this excellent report."
"In reality, the work in committee has been a complete collaboration between all the groups, and I hope that the House will reflect this in its vote this morning."
"We have managed to achieve compromises on almost all aspects of a problem which has become very serious, because it affects the great majority of women in the associated countries of the Mediterranean."
"It is true that there are slight differences between the various countries, but, in general, the situation of women in these countries is of great concern: illiteracy, early school leaving, unemployment, violence against women and health problems, originating from their reproductive health and the lack of adequate services for women."
"The report exhaustively describes all these situations."
"The European Union and the Member States must renew their commitment to the women of the Mediterranean countries."
"In very many cases, cooperation agreements do not fulfil the commitment to deal with the special situation suffered by these women."
"It is what we call ""the transverse introduction of the gender perspective"", because the situation suffered by women is not the same as the situation of men and therefore it is necessary to analyse what this situation is from the outset, in order to provide the tools necessary to resolve it."
"Unfortunately, the regional programme within the framework of the MEDAs has once again been delayed and therefore this report is going to see the light of day long before this regional programme is implemented."
"I hope that by then we can take up the fundamental ideas contained in this report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot continue to lament the situation suffered by women in many countries of the world, especially in this region which is so close to us, without taking action."
"It is an urgent issue and we must promote the necessary mechanisms in order to ensure that the lives of women in these countries really becomes better and easier."
"We must restate this commitment because there is no more time and we have to act."
"Mr President, there is of course a tendency for its only to be women who take part in the debate whenever we have issues concerning women on the agenda."
"I should therefore like to begin by saying that there are in fact two men from my group who have submitted to Parliament an appeal for equality that will also be forwarded to the President."
"This appeal, entitled 'Enough is enough' , calls upon all the groups to consider what real progress they have made with equality and actively to take initiatives to improve the situation."
"Next, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her brilliant report, which deals very well with an area in which some time needs to be devoted to the position of women, and I would pick up on a couple of individual points which I should like to emphasise."
"First of all, I think it is incredibly important that we should acquire statistics, and I would urge the Commission to look at how we can improve the statistical base, for any discussion about women, men and inequality is a non-starter if we do not have the necessary statistics."
"Whether there is to be a supervisory body or data bank, or whatever, is less important."
"What is crucial is that we obtain statistics."
"The second thing is that, in my view, it is entirely right - and this is also related specifically to this appeal - that the Commissioner should ensure that women participate when the association agreements are negotiated."
"We are well aware that we very often only have men around the negotiating table."
"When that is the case, women have already been reduced in status, and their position does not become a topic of central concern."
"The third thing I should like to highlight is the issue of programmes."
"It is crucially important to investigate what practical programmes we can offer to secure better education for women so that they themselves will also be in a position to do more to promote equality."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens and European Free Alliance congratulates Mrs Kratsa on her excellent report."
"I should also like to emphasise that we were pleased with the constructive manner, namely by cooperation between the groups, in which this report came about."
"We concur with the rapporteur' s view that Euro-Mediterranean cooperation is, politically speaking, of crucial importance for Europe."
"Not only is this cooperation a safe way of promoting Europe' s economic interests; its key objective is to establish an area of peace, security, stability and welfare."
"In order to accelerate this cooperation, a better understanding between the European peoples and the peoples of the partner countries is necessary, as well as an active mainstream society which is capable of taking part in this process."
"In all of this, women occupy a key position."
"They must be encouraged to acquire their own political identity and for this purpose, they must be given the opportunity, via education and awareness-raising, of making up for an unfair disadvantage that has built up over the centuries."
"Women must no longer solely be regarded as mothers, no matter how important their role in bringing up children may be."
"They must also be seen - provided they gain access to education - as fully-fledged partners in the labour market and in politics."
"With a view to enlargement, women from the South must conclude a solidarity pact with women of the North, and they need to support each other in their justified demands."
"In this respect, Europe should function as a driving force."
"Our Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, headed by an inspiring chairperson, Mrs Karamanou, has an important role to play in this."
"Mr President, I feel that this whole report - for which I thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou - lacks something, that there is a taboo throughout, that there is a word it avoids mentioning."
"I understand the sensitivity of the subject but, if we do not mention this word, we will not be able to address the root of the problem or cooperate with groups of women who are fighting in these countries for their freedom."
"The missing word is 'religion' , in other words Islam and the political abuse of Islam by the ruling power."
"The key obstacle to the emancipation or liberation of the women in these countries - as was the case for a long time in our own countries - is the equivalence of religion and politics, an equivalence which makes the provisions of the Sharia the sole legal basis for laws on the situation of women in those countries, and this is becoming increasingly the case."
"None of this is mentioned in the report, and I understand the difficulty, but I also fear that our reticence will not help the groups of women in those countries who, unaided, are courageously starting to raise the issue of separating religious and political authority."
"The most important laws on women are those making up what is known as civil law."
"Well then, all those laws which codify - and I repeat - codify discrimination against women are, albeit in different forms - directly applying the interpretation of the Koran."
"There are women there fighting for the separation of powers, there are women fighting for the Koran to be brought up to date."
"None of this features at all in the report, where the effects are listed but the cause is not addressed."
"I regret this, for I feel that we are lagging behind them."
"I would like to add my voice to those of my fellow Members in congratulating Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou on her report."
"Certainly, listening to Mrs Bonino, we cannot deny the truth of what she has said."
"The two minutes' speaking time restriction undoubtedly prevented her from going into more detail. This is an important issue which must certainly be dealt with using a different approach from the one adopted in the recent report, which focused on 'women and fundamentalism' ."
"If we take that approach, we will not be enabling either the women or ourselves to make any useful contribution to the growth - the cultural as well as economic growth - of these countries, and we will not be enabling these peoples as a whole to escape from a cultural and religious situation in which the human and civil rights of people in general and women in particular are being trampled underfoot."
"I therefore feel that the issue must be addressed from the perspective outlined by Mrs Bonino, for the matter has hitherto been little debated in Parliament."
"However, with regard to this report, as it stands, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and make two recommendations to the Commission and the Council."
"They are contained in the text before us but I would just like to emphasise them."
"The first is that the presence of women at all levels of social, economic, financial and political life in conditions of equality, not least as regards decision-making, is a prerequisite for democracy and therefore for peace and well-being."
"In everything the Union does to pursue these objectives, it must ensure that the programmes we have already implemented or are currently implementing are totally inflexible in terms of respect for the protection of rights, and that none of the work carried out by the Council towards partnerships and cooperation ever fails to take into consideration the need for these rights to be respected."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her sound analysis and for her excellent collaboration in the drafting of this report."
"I think we can refer back to the Beijing World Conference of Women, where, too, steps were taken towards women's empowerment and capacity building, and the MEDA programme actually provided us with the right instruments."
"I must say, though, that we lack the statistical data to carry out a more exact and more precise analysis."
"For example, the data is not in the report on the programme, and no yardstick has as yet been laid down against which progress can be measured."
"Why was it that MEDA I and II included not even one regional programme exclusively devoted to women?"
"Why is the democratic clause not applied with greater thoroughness where there is flagrant violation of women's rights, as with genital mutilation, for example?"
"The Valenciano Martínez-Orozco Report gives important pointers to that."
"Why is fundamentalism not addressed in greater detail?"
"I ask the women from the other groups, though, to pluck up the courage to introduce these issues into the Plenary rather than having their treatment obstructed in the Bureau."
"I ask myself why women are barred from education in many countries."
"It is a destructive tendency."
"Particularly in rural areas, up to 60% of women are excluded from education, even from being taught about reproductive health."
"Why, for example, do our Member States, when dealing with immigration and asylum, not show a very emphatic red card to the illegal trade in human beings?"
"In the Member State from which I come, for example, the recognition of gender-specific persecution or any persecution that is not carried out by the State as grounds for asylum is currently being made into an electoral issue, and the good starts we have made in our immigration law therefore end up being put out of the reach of women in the Mediterranean."
"I think this is an area where women like us need to work together even more. With this report, we are setting a good example."
"Not only do we need more women performing social functions here, we also need them in our partner countries, and I emphasise again that the European Union must focus its instruments of cooperation even more intensely on women, so that it is to the advantage of us all that we, with the help of the democracy programme, empower women and open up dialogue."
"First of all, I would like to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her excellent work."
"This report reminds us how important it is for the European Union to promote the role of women in economic and social life, both by means of Community policies and in the context of cooperation with third countries and the Mediterranean countries."
"I would simply like to add a few words on the current situation, which is impeccably described in this report."
"Although circumstances have improved for women in some Mediterranean countries, there is still a long way to go, in particular as regards access to education, vocational training and the labour market, but also in social matters, with regard to single and divorced women, single mothers and women in rural areas."
"The European Union should draw attention to any progress that is made and lend its support should the opportunity arise."
"The European Union must also ensure that the good intentions stated during discussions on partnership or association agreements are in fact followed by practical measures, with a view to increasing social cohesion."
"However, there is still much progress to be made."
"The promotion of gender equality in the Mediterranean countries is hindered by a number of obstacles such as the influence of cultural and religious traditions and the lack of social and legal structures."
"At a time when some of these countries are undergoing significant economic expansion, the integration of gender equality into all policies and, in particular, policies concerning access to training and the labour market, must be promoted, as women can only have access to positions of political, economic or social responsibility if specific measures are implemented with regard to training, backed up by appropriate social measures such as, for example, the establishment of childcare structures."
"The Spanish Presidency has reiterated its strong interest in developing programmes such as MEDA and in partnerships between these countries and the European Union."
"This is an ideal opportunity to encourage our current and future partners to promote women' s economic, social and civil rights in order to create an active society involving both men and women, which, I hope, will enable an area of peace, security and prosperity to be created in the medium term."
"Mr President, I wish to offer Mrs Kratsa my warmest congratulations, both on her initiative in drafting this report and on the report itself and the clear policy proposals contained in it."
"This report will be a huge help to the women of the Mediterranean who, despite some improvement in their situation over recent years, still suffer sexual discrimination and inequality."
"Illiteracy, poverty, domestic violence, inadequate medical care and little involvement in professional and political life are the main aspects of life for women on the southern shores of the Mediterranean basin."
"However, what is worse, and here I agree completely with Mrs Bonino, is that women are the main victims of religious and political fundamentalism, of ultra-conservatism and of autocratic regimes who hang on to their power by controlling the sexual conduct of women, their way of life, their reproductive functions and even their mode of dress."
"Without doubt, irrationalism and fanaticism are the main obstacles both to the emancipation of women and to social and economic progress in general in these countries."
"Obviously, the best defence against the powers of irrationalism and fanaticism is to strengthen the worldly aspects of the state and legal democratic order."
"We must send out a clear message."
"No political system, religious movement, tradition or custom can take precedence over respect for the fundamental freedoms of women, human rights and the Rule of Law."
"As long as these basic aspects of a democratic state are lacking in numerous countries around the Mediterranean, there will only ever be a faint glimmer of hope of any improvement in the position of women and the resolutions passed and conferences held within the context of the Barcelona process will be meaningless."
"That is why we are calling on the European Commission to use every means at its disposal, especially when negotiating association agreements, to include clear-cut clauses and commitments protecting women's rights and the principles of the Rule of Law and recognising them as the sine qua non to social development in the countries of the Mediterranean and the promotion of the Mediterranean basin as an area of peace and cooperation."
"Mr President, I wish to make four points in connection with this report."
"Firstly, I feel that the fact that this report has been produced is a very positive thing."
"I also thank the rapporteur for her efforts."
"Secondly, I take the view that Mrs Bonino's reflections are something we should all share."
"What is lacking in the report is precisely the principal cause underlying the facts of this situation, which was analysed in the report, in part unsparingly; the cause of it, though, is not there."
"Thirdly, it appears to me that we are, from the point of view of consistency, far too amicable, far too calm, far too balanced."
"Appeals are made, recommendations are made, requests are made, things are emphasised, but, in my view, far too little is demanded."
"I believe we must in future exert much more pressure on this issue."
"We must exert massive pressure on these countries and the societies in them, even with the suggestion of sanctions - and I do know that the word is not quite the right one."
"That means that we must convince them and give them to understand, that the failure to positively influence the placing of women on an equal footing in these countries will have consequences."
"Fourthly - and here I pick up on one of the Liberal Mrs Dybkjær's ideas - this is very much an issue for men too."
"I am a bit of a black swan here today, but I hope that those men who are not here today will, when the vote is taken, do the right thing and advance the policy of this report a few steps further - and I hope that they will also do so in future."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Kratsa and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities because not only is this a report of substance, it also puts the question of women's rights straight back on the Euro-Mediterranean agenda."
"The Barcelona process is basically a means for dialogue between the Community and the countries of the Mediterranean."
"Needless to say, this dialogue cannot simply be based either on the principles of the European Union or on the principles underpinning the regimes in these countries."
"It has to be based on international law, human rights conventions, the Beijing declaration, which these countries have signed - all the international texts and conventions which place women's rights at the heart of human rights, bringing us back to the question of the gender dimension of foreign policy."
"Because the Barcelona process is one of the ways used to develop the European Union's foreign policy."
"I should like to inform the House that the Commission has already taken an initiative to adopt a text of recommendations and principles in the hope that it will be accepted by the foreign ministers and will govern every contract and agreement between the European Union and third countries as regards women's rights and the gender dimension of foreign policy."
"The Commissioner responsible for foreign policy issues and I have already held initial talks."
"The first conference of international experts on the matter has been organised and will be held some time in April."
"Our aim is to have an established programme of recommendations and agreements in principle at political level by 2003."
"Of course, we shall be holding separate discussions on this with the Committee on Women's Rights, I imagine very soon, once we have the full programme and timetable, so that we can discuss a specific text with the parliamentary committee."
"The financial tools for the Barcelona process are ÌEDA I and ÌÅDA II."
"But, as you rightly said, we have no reason to be especially proud of the results of ÌEDA I as far as the social sector and women's issues and rights are concerned."
"The difficulties are caused, in large part, by our inability to close the gap between administrative systems and, in even larger part, by differences in principle."
"The objective of the ÌEDA IÉ programme is to create a free trade zone between Europe and the Mediterranean countries in the long term, by 2010 and, within it, to implement programmes which will help these countries develop economically, along with social and economic measures to support this economic development."
"And, at the heart of these measures, there must be measures for women and for involving women in education, the job market and social and economic life."
"It is the Commission's job, following the forum held during the Belgian presidency, to prepare a specific regional programme during 2002 containing measures on the job market, women's networks and easier access for women to financing by developing initiatives which also relate to training."
"This report will provide a great deal of input into the final programme which the Commission presents but, in closing, I must stress that I believe that any regional programme, irrespective of how much funding it has, if it is not applied within the framework of international agreements - I repeat this because the approach on the European side is often considered paternalistic - so I repeat that this programme will only succeed and bring in the results we all hope for if it is applied within the framework of international agreements, the Beijing declaration on respect for human rights and respect for women's rights."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Illiteracy and social exclusion"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0009/2002) by Mrs Hermange, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on illiteracy and social exclusion (2001/2340(INI))."
"Mr President, almost two years ago, we adopted the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The right to knowledge and, consequently, the right to know how to read, write and count are part of this Charter."
"Consequently, the opportunity to learn how to read and write should be available to all as a fundamental right, and parents, teachers and politicians should recognise their obligation to ensure that this opportunity is grasped by all, in particular because, when people cannot express themselves with words, they often do so with their fists, as they feel excluded from school, business or even their own family."
"This right to knowledge is not currently realised, however, as 10 to 20% of the population of the European Union, or as many as 30 % if we count the candidate countries, are considered to be illiterate: 45% in Portugal, 35% in Italy, 22% in Ireland and Great Britain, 15% in Germany and France and, to add the candidate countries: 42% in Slovenia and Poland, 33% in Hungary, 29% in Bulgaria and 20% in Lithuania."
"Illiteracy increases the divide between privileged members of society who are in a situation of relative security and those who are disadvantaged and marginalised, who do not have access to the labour market and consequently suffer financial insecurity, psychological isolation and social exclusion."
"From an economic perspective, we all know that illiteracy also affects our businesses and their modernisation: it leads to increases in costs relating to the accident rate, employers' contributions and time taken to complete work because of the need for additional supervision."
"However, although the European Commission and our institutions have produced a number of documents, there are still a number of obstacles: gaps due to a lack of reliable data, the lack of clarity of certain programmes proposed and policies which are still insufficiently integrated."
"This matter, which I consider to be serious, Commissioner, should also be addressed through integrated policies associating social, and cultural and educational objectives, and should be discussed at policy level to increase awareness of this phenomenon."
"It is with this in mind that I call on the Commission to submit to Parliament and the Council a Green Paper on Illiteracy, together with a timetable for achieving tangible objectives along the lines of the social agenda, precisely defining the measures to be taken at European level."
"In the same vein, I call on the Commission, in connection with the employment guidelines, to propose specific indicators and benchmarks relating to illiteracy, in close cooperation with the social players."
"I also ask the Commission to submit to Parliament, each year, a written report, incorporating statistical data, on progress towards the objectives of combating illiteracy and social exclusion."
"We should all be aware that this matter is a key issue for development and for harmony in our societies."
"We are not always aware of this, which is why I would also like us to be able to set up, not another observatory but, within the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, based at Thessaloniki, a sort of European illiteracy monitoring centre, as suggested by my group, specifically by submitting Amendment No 5."
"Lastly, I would like to say, with regard to the amendments tabled recently, in particular by the Group of the Greens, that I am in favour of Amendment No 4 and that I would have been in favour of Amendment No 2 had it been considered as an additional item."
"As for Amendment No 3, even though I am not against it in principle - the amendment requesting a Green Paper on illiteracy and mathematical illiteracy - I call for a vote against it because I think that, in the wording ""Green Paper on Illiteracy"" , the problem of mathematical illiteracy is obviously included."
"Lastly, I cannot accept Amendment No 1."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, those were the points I wanted to mention."
"Mr President, my compliments, in particular, to Mrs Hermange for her initiative in taking up one of the elements of the new strategy on combating social exclusion and poverty such as illiteracy, which I feel is a genuine barrier to the exercising of fundamental human rights, the rights of all citizens."
"The idea that functional illiteracy affects over 10% of the European Union' s population is horrifying, to say the least, in a developed society in which Europe is pursuing ambitious goals such as those set by the Lisbon Council: firstly, the need for every citizen to have the necessary skills to be able to live and work in the new information society; and secondly, to make Europe the most competitive, dynamic economy in the world."
"I feel that we must approach the debate on illiteracy, or rather the problem itself, with great vigour, taking this approach and with these goals before us."
"The resolution focuses on certain points which I would like to mention briefly: firstly, knowing how to read and write is a fundamental right which must be guaranteed to all people; secondly, combating illiteracy is essential because it secures and strengthens the freedom of the individual; thirdly, the task of combating this disturbing situation must be undertaken by society as a whole and by public authorities and administrations in particular; fourthly, 'returning' illiteracy, which particularly affects elderly people, especially those in danger of social exclusion - who, as they lose their self-sufficiency, are obliged to live in sheltered accommodation, leaving their family and socio-cultural environment behind them for good - is a scourge which must be combated."
"Therefore, governments should promote an incisive initiative through Community programmes, while it is up to you, Commissioner - and, as we know, you are very aware of the problem - to honour the undertaking to address this issue."
"Mr President, I would like to begin with a phrase from the rapporteur' s explanatory statement in which she clearly states that extreme poverty and social exclusion must be considered to be a violation of human rights and illiteracy an intolerable violation of those same rights."
"Furthermore, we must remember that, as she herself has said, between 10 and 20% of the European population is functionally illiterate."
"The situation of these people severely restricts their ability to find decent work and to integrate themselves into the society in which they live."
"They also have difficulties in reading some of the official documents which we regularly present."
"This situation really contributes to the fact that, in a prosperous continent such as Europe, between 18 and 20% of people live in poverty, if we consider that they are below 60% of the average in their country of origin."
"This is an intolerable situation."
"The rapporteur proposes a series of objectives which we agree with and which must be taken into account in future decisions."
"Firstly, a definition of the different forms of illiteracy - which we still do not have - with common criteria and mechanisms."
"Secondly, common action against the situation of functional illiteracy, with an open method of cooperation between the various countries."
"This fight against illiteracy must be incorporated into other Union policies and must be taken into account whenever we talk about education and training."
"There must be a timetable for specific achievements, and Parliament must take account of the progress made, as the rapporteur has said."
"The matter must be integrated into equal opportunities policy."
"We have just discussed another report which speaks about this and we are perfectly aware that illiteracy figures in all countries are always higher amongst women."
"And finally, there must be participation by social agents and the sectors involved."
"This participation is crucial."
"In previous programmes to combat poverty, as you will recall, there were concrete projects which spoke of the crucial importance of participation by all the sectors involved."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I must congratulate Mrs Hermange on her initiative on this report on illiteracy, since it is a problem which we do not normally pay much attention to, because we think we have achieved total literacy, since the majority of Member States of the European Union have made enormous efforts over recent years to achieve this objective and we thought we had done so."
"However, there are increasingly pockets of marginalisation in the cities, there is an immigrant population establishing itself in our cities and that means that the problem of illiteracy, and particularly functional illiteracy, is a really serious problem today, because it is always linked to poverty, to marginalisation and to social exclusion."
"As defenders of human rights - and this is one of the most fundamental rights, as has been pointed out here - we have an obligation to draw attention to this matter so that programmes are set up to resolve the problem."
"The worst affected are the young people who come from these sections of the population, who do not have employment opportunities, or in some cases find insecure jobs, without any opportunity to improve their working conditions."
"Since the Lisbon Summit, becoming the most competitive information society in the world has been one of our objectives."
"If the information society is fundamental to work in the future, these young people who can hardly find work under normal conditions, will not have any opportunity unless we integrate them into this information and knowledge society."
"It is therefore urgent to carry out programmes and actions by means of the Green Paper which the rapporteur is requesting, so that these sections of the population, which are increasing with the immigration of recent years, are offered a solution to this fundamental problem, so that they can access other systems of personal welfare."
"We always focus on health, housing and employment, but this is a fundamental problem and resolving it should be a priority."
"I once again congratulate the rapporteur on this wonderful initiative, which draws attention to a problem that is still facing us."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange, on her presentation of this report to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and on her extremely detailed work."
"We know that Europe is one of the most prosperous continents in the world but, despite that, a substantial number of our citizens live in conditions of extreme poverty and social marginalisation."
"One of the parameters for measuring these conditions, in addition to income, is, without a doubt, illiteracy, for illiteracy is a cause of exclusion and prevents access to human rights, as the rapporteur rightly said in her report."
"Illiteracy, understood to mean either a lack of basic education or 'returning' illiteracy, is causing an increasing divide between those who are privileged and enjoy relative security and those who are disadvantaged and marginalised, who do not have access to work, who are in danger of isolation and do not participate in social life."
"Illiteracy also represents an expense, a cost both for businesses and in social terms, as well as a cause of exclusion."
"It is an ongoing problem in Europe, although it is not thought of as a cost, but there are no reliable data available for analysis."
"Combating illiteracy and social marginalisation is now essentially the responsibility of the Member States, but at the Lisbon Summit - as has already been said - the Heads of State and Government set themselves the goal of making Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, etc, etc. Moreover, the European Social Agenda was adopted at Nice."
"Therefore, combating illiteracy and marginalisation must become one of the priorities of the Union and the Member States, with all the relevant policies applied in the context of a global, integrated strategy."
"We therefore firmly support the rapporteur' s calls for a Green Paper and an Action Plan. I will not go into their contents because they are already outlined in the report."
"However, we do call strongly upon the Commission to promote these texts: Parliament will support them and stand shoulder to shoulder with the Commission to ensure the Council endorses them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is scarcely credible that between 10% and 20% of people in the European Union are unable to understand printed matter and documents and make use of them."
"Even I will readily concede that I am not in a position to fill in my German tax return forms without expert help, let alone actually fill in an application form for a project promoted by Europe."
"It is, though, surely not this sort of documents to which this report refers."
"People who have difficulty with reading and writing are restricted in their ability to participate in the life of society, and, when it comes to earning a living, are relegated to work for which minimal qualifications are required and which is therefore badly paid."
"On economic, but above all on ethical and moral grounds, it is our duty to preserve people from this fate in this century of the information society and of lifelong learning."
"Parliament is therefore doing the right thing with this report by describing a problem which is often shamefacedly hushed up, and offering solutions to it."
"That has been done in this report as thoroughly as necessary and as briefly as possible, by the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange."
"European legislation, though, is limited in this task to measures of development and support, as general and vocational education falls within the remit of the Member States, and that is where it should stay."
"The Member States' sole duty is to make real the right to education which is now also enshrined in Article 14 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The work of the monitoring centre which the report calls for should be carried on in the already-existing Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) in Thessaloniki, using the resources available there."
"That makes sense in view of the costs involved and of the relevance to the functions Cedefop performs in any case, and so I ask you to support our Amendment No 5."
"I would also subscribe to and support a European Year devoted to books and to reading, in view of our young people's widespread mania for television."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this own-initiative report, which we should welcome, concerning the specific subject of illiteracy sheds light on two particular approaches recently implemented by the European Union in adopting the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights on the one hand and the action programme combating social exclusion on the other."
"As Marie-Thérèse Hermange, our rapporteur, reminded us, the right of each individual to know how to read, write and count is the practical basis that enables these individuals to exercise their rights as citizens."
"This right must be guaranteed by practical measures wherever the scourge of illiteracy is present; it is therefore enlightening to be reminded of the figures."
"In practical terms, I believe it must be possible to develop these actions in two directions."
"We need to make the connection between illiteracy and unemployment, on the one hand - for example there are the proposed actions targeting illiteracy in the workplace - in order to ensure the coherent implementation of the decisions made in Lisbon, and between illiteracy and social inclusion on the other."
"We should devise actions for social inclusion that are independent of the professional situation of the people concerned, and I am thinking of women in particular."
"I believe the case of migrant women must be considered in this respect."
"The report also calls for the creation of a monitoring centre, and I think it is realistic to plan this within an existing tool, Cedefop, since compatible indicators and benchmarks between Member States are the basis of any coherent Community policy."
"In conclusion, I believe that this report must be seen as a tool to facilitate the drawing-up of a measure involving local, national and Community levels, each with their own specific responsibilities."
"Today, the handling of these issues requires Community initiatives and the impetus to encourage the Member States to make decisions that are essential for their people."
"I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Hermange on this important document, which I support, and to wish Commissioner Diamantopoulou every success in her work."
"This is the first time I have had the pleasure of seeing her this year and I am sure she will be just as successful in her work in the second part of the legislature as she was during the first two and a half years."
"I feel that this document is extremely important, and it is crucial that Mrs Hermange has stressed that illiteracy does not just mean not knowing how to read and write, but not understanding discussions and being unable to move about in modern society, where it is not enough to know how to read and write but where a certain culture and savoir-faire are necessary for a person to have any status."
"In some States of the European Union, this form of illiteracy is as high as 30 to 35%."
"I would therefore stress the importance of resolving this issue."
"There is another Commission document on the issue, which has been referred to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport - on that famous subject 'lifelong learning' - but this is a question of learning not the languages of other States but our own."
"Well then, I am concerned by what happens as a result of this kind of illiteracy during elections."
"Voters who are illiterate in this way do not know what or whom they are voting for when they go to the ballots and they do not understand the programmes."
"This means that democracy is diminished."
"Pensioners, I must say, know exactly which way to vote when they go to the ballots, but we must be sure that everyone understands why and for whom they are voting."
"Mr President, as others have also said, this is an incredibly important report."
"The nightmare scenario for the future is that society will be divided into two groups: the initiated, who know everything and are plugged into the knowledge society, and those who have been left behind and will therefore be marginalised in society."
"Nor is there any doubt that this is a European issue, which is why I also sincerely support what the rapporteur has said about open coordination being the best method of achieving progress in this area."
"The only way is to make it genuinely very embarrassing for the Member States if they do not do something in this area, and for the status of their efforts to be made as public as possible."
"We must proceed with the proposal on lifelong learning as quickly as possible, and I naturally hope that the Commission will include the views adopted by Parliament today in the proposal on lifelong learning, for that is where they in fact belong. I also think that we must endeavour to get some new thinking into this area."
"We must bear in mind that, if adults are to learn about a subject, going back to school is not an option."
"Instead, they have to learn in some other way. They have to learn in the context of the labour market; they have to have time off work to be able to go to classes; and they have to learn through the process of schools and teaching coming out to the workplace."
"I believe it is very important to establish the connection between work and learning so that we can continue with lifelong learning."
"The last thing I want to say concerns an idea for the Commissioner that could perhaps be taken further and might also put pressure on the Member States to demonstrate that they are doing something in this area. It is the possibility of introducing 'knowledge accounts' for the individual Member States through which the latter would simply report each year on how much they had done in the area of lifelong learning to combat illiteracy and promote knowledge and education in general."
"'Knowledge accounts' are a good idea, Commissioner, which I hope you will consider."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wholeheartedly concur with the Lisbon objectives."
"I consider it a thoroughly positive thing that we live in a performance-oriented society, one which wants to become the most competitive, the most dynamic and also the most reliant on knowledge."
"That being so, it is of course quite deplorable that we see society actually disintegrating and that we have in our society a new grouping which is weak in social and educational terms."
"In view of this, I support the report and am of the opinion that there is a need to address these documents that have been mentioned several times today in the context of the Green Paper and that the amendment on the monitoring centre tabled by Mr Pronk and Mrs Stauner should be adopted."
"I wish to address a second aspect of this topic, the issue of to what extent it is possible to compensate for differences between the various Member States in education, training, schooling, and the current state of knowledge."
"The idea of States retaining their own competences in this area is, after all, pretty obsolete."
"This is where we should be reorienting ourselves and also accepting a degree of harmonisation, even if that were to lead to substantial restructuring in certain countries."
"It is not fair to tell the citizens of this EU of ours that there is freedom of movement and of establishment when differing school systems and recognition of training standards mean that there are significant differences, and therefore discrimination, when it comes to actually putting it into practice."
"We should, for this reason, be taking this report as an opportunity to take steps towards harmonisation in the cultural sphere."
"Mr President, today's report on illiteracy is a very important contribution to the wider issue at European level, i.e. our review of the basic skills of literacy and a working knowledge of arithmetic as prerequisites to social integration, as prerequisites to the European Union's achieving the Lisbon objective of a knowledge-based economy."
"We have, without doubt, entered a new stage, in which basic skills do not stop at reading and writing and now include IT skills, high-tech skills, entrepreneurship, foreign languages, interpersonal communication skills and social skills."
"All this can be summed up nowadays in four simple words: the need to learn."
"The Commission's policy in this sector will be expressed in a series of initiatives and programmes which are currently in the pipeline as a result of cooperation between the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"My first point is that the Lisbon Council in 2000 called for the Commission to draft a report on the specific future objectives of education and training systems."
"This report was presented in Stockholm and we are currently preparing a programme of work on the subject of the universal acquisition of basic skills, which will be presented in Barcelona. The acquisition of basic skills is one of the 13 basic objectives for the education and training systems of the European Union."
"This objective includes defining indicators to measure over a ten-year period the extent to which Member States ensure that all their citizens acquire a working knowledge of reading, writing and arithmetic."
"This is the first specific indicator which will reflect developments in this sector over a ten-year period."
"Secondly, I should like to remind the House of the communication which the Commission published in November 2001 on creating a European area of lifelong learning, which stresses that lifelong learning depends on acquiring basic skills."
"Thirdly, I should like to mention the forthcoming action plan on skills and mobility in the European Union which the Commission, by which I mean President Prodi and I, are due to announce next week, the aim of which is to achieve a real European job market based on mobility and a minimum level of common skills at European level."
"My fourth point concerns the Community strategy on combating social exclusion."
"As you know, the bottom line in the national actions plans of most countries is that there is a direct link between social exclusion and the acquisition of basic skills."
"And both the Equal programme and the Social Fund make provision for funding for individual programmes relating to access to basic skills, especially by groups subject to discrimination."
"And we must not forget that certain groups, such as people with disabilities and immigrants, must overcome even greater problems in order to acquire basic skills."
"My fifth point concerns cooperation at international level, in other words, our international strategy."
"The European Commission is working with the OECD, ÁSÅÌ and G8 to support direct action to get basic skills put on the corresponding agendas."
"Which brings me to the report and, more specifically, to the application of the open method of coordination. As I mentioned in relation to the strategy on exclusion, we can take it as given that the Council of education ministers will approve the open method of coordination on common objectives for education and training systems next week."
"As far as the Green Paper is concerned, I must express a certain reticence, mainly because numerous new policy initiatives have been started, important matters are in the pipeline in various Councils and we are now in a position to take action on illiteracy; it would perhaps mean additional delays if we were to proceed with the Green Paper, given that we now have most of the information we need from work carried out in previous years."
"Which brings me to the recommendation to Member States on reading and writing lessons and access to basic skills."
"I must stress here that we need to respect the principle of subsidiarity and take particular care in our approach to education, which is a strictly national matter."
"The open method of cooperation is an excellent tool, giving the Member States added value in the form of indicators and exchanges of best practices."
"On the question of a European illiteracy monitoring centre, I have taken note of the proposal by the Members of Parliament on the need to use existing institutions, such as Cedefop, and I would remind the House that there are already a number of programmes, such as the OECD Pisa programme, which provide some initial answers."
"Before creating new tools, we need to be sure that we are making efficient use of tools which already exist."
"Finally, as far as the proposal for an annual report on illiteracy to Parliament is concerned, we want to look at the most efficient way of informing Parliament and what use Parliament can make of reports on national action plans on social integration and reports via the open method of coordination, i.e. how existing means, reports which are drafted every year anyway, how this dimension can be used so that the information provided is exponential and more efficient."
"Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon today."
"Social policy agenda"
"The next item is the report (A5-0004/2002) by Mrs Hermange on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the scoreboard on implementing the social policy agenda (COM(2001)104 - C5-0536/2001 - 2001/2215(COS))."
"Mr President, it is unusual to speak twice in a row in the same day."
"I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for your comments and suggestions, which we will have to discuss."
"Commissioner, we have greatly criticised the Nice Summit, yet it has provided you with a valuable instrument: the Social Agenda, which was drawn up with the objective of making the European Union the world' s most competitive economy, as decided at the Lisbon Summit."
"As we all know that there is no openness between European, national and local partners, this agenda raises the issue of responsibility and attribution of powers of all those playing a part in its implementation."
"It is in its dual role of ensuring openness and acting as a social instrument that the Social Agenda is a key component of economic and social modernisation, as its implementation will, in the long term, be decisive for achieving the strategic objectives laid down by the Lisbon European Council."
"We are sure of this, even if it is not currently given much consideration."
"That, Commissioner, is why Parliament and its Committee on Employment and Social Affairs deeply regretted not having been able to consider the Social Agenda prior to the Stockholm European Council."
"We therefore ask that Parliament be involved in the implementation of the adjustment of the Social Agenda, as well as all the social partners, and we insist that, from now on, the scoreboard make clearer the various responsibilities of the parties involved."
"We also call on the Commission to supply information on how it proposes to act on a number of requests we have made: to define an appropriate legal basis for the development of civil dialogue; to provide a tax and legislative framework for the development of the social economy; to integrate the social dimension into competition policy; to submit a directive on social security cover for new forms of employment; to reinforce the action programme and instruments against poverty and social exclusion and submit a proposal to amend Directive 92/85/EC on introducing measures to help improve the health and safety of female workers; and to launch an initiative aimed at better guaranteeing the social quality of work."
"You will also understand, Commissioner, that we are calling on you to speed up a number of operations: in particular to submit a proposal for a review of the enterprise committee directive as soon as possible so that the legislative procedure can be concluded as intended, to submit to Parliament a memorandum on policy in the area of health and safety at work that could serve as a consultation document, to conduct in-depth examination and assessment of the impact of the Luxembourg process, and, lastly, to propose activities to mark the European year of the disabled."
"Commissioner, we are convinced that this scoreboard should not be confined to setting out actions implemented by the Commission but should eventually become a strategic instrument by means of which the agenda' s implementation can be supervised, and where need be adjusted."
"We are also convinced that partnerships should be strengthened in all the actions taken in this area."
"Commissioner, Nice has provided you with a valuable tool."
"You therefore have a valuable role to play in making social policy more transparent."
"Take this opportunity to transform this Europe of commodities into a people' s Europe, in the knowledge that Parliament will be right behind you."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Hermange on the extreme care and sensitivity with which she has drafted this report on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I agree with her that the table of results of the Social Agenda should include all planned activities and the division of responsibilities and should be submitted to the European Parliament within a reasonable period of time so that Parliament can study and give an opinion on it."
"The European Parliament has supported the Commission proposal on a cohesive policy framework for social development right from the start, although it did point out that the updated European standard which was the whole purpose of the Social Agenda should serve the values of solidarity and justice underlying the European structure better and more efficiently, given that these values are currently under attack."
"In order to promote these values, the European Parliament stresses in its resolution that we also need to promote the full participation of women in economic and social life."
"The European Parliament also stresses in its resolution that the gender dimension needs to be included in all sectors covered by the Social Agenda and monitored in regular reports."
"We need a proposal to amend the directive on the safety and health of pregnant and breastfeeding workers, i.e. directive 92/85."
"We need to highlight the fact that the social partners have a responsibility to put the principles of equal pay and equal opportunities into practice."
"We need to take an initiative to improve working hours and strike a better balance between work and home, we need a more substantial take on sexual equality in all pre-accession negotiations and we need to promote dialogue with women's organisations in candidate countries."
"As rapporteur for the Committee on Women's Rights for the Social Agenda, I should like to ask the Commission to tell the European Parliament how it intends to follow up these issues and if it intends to present a proposal for a directive on equal treatment in sectors other than the employment sector."
"Finally, the European Parliament has highlighted the need to make it easier for social agencies to take part and I should like to ask what initiatives you intend to take to increase the participation of women's organisations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should obviously, first and foremost, like to congratulate Mrs Hermange and thank her for her excellent cooperation."
"The result is there for everyone to see."
"This report is based on a very broad consensus, for not one single amendment has been tabled."
"However, I should also like to say that, with this report, the European Parliament actually falls between two stools."
"On the one hand, it is a fact that the scoreboard which we are discussing has actually been outdated for a long time."
"On the other hand, the new scoreboard has not yet been finally rubberstamped by the European Commission, despite the fact that, in Stockholm, we were assured that this scoreboard, together with the summary report for Barcelona, would be before us by no later than January."
"I should, at any rate, like to thank the Commissioner for the opportunity we have had, together with the coordinators, of obtaining current information about the Commission' s intentions, and of making our concerns known regarding the state of implementation of the Social Agenda."
"Commissioner, in my view, we should make this sound initiative an integral part of the procedure in order to guarantee Parliament' s involvement during the implementation of the Social Agenda."
"I should therefore like to afford this debate a little more topical value by seizing the opportunity urgently to call upon you, Commissioner, but especially - and I am stressing this - the entire board of Commissioners, to implement the ambitions of the Social Agenda and the pledges made during the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies down to the last detail and according to the time schedule."
"After all, Commissioner, there are quite a few reasons why we are concerned."
"It is, of course, the case that 2001 has produced some welcome results, but it is vital to keep this momentum going and, for this, we need a new and better scoreboard, which clearly indicates the responsibilities with the attendant expiry dates."
"I will give you a few reasons why we are concerned."
"First of all, the role of the social partners in relation to labour organisation and lifelong learning is crucial if the Social Agenda is to be implemented , and I hope that their contribution to Barcelona will be considerable."
"But where consultation fails, the legislator needs to step in, and this is currently the case with temporary agency work, in connection with which we have long been waiting impatiently for a Commission proposal."
"Secondly, following the successful completion of the directive on worker participation in the framework of the European Company and the directive on the information and consultation of workers, nothing now stands in the way of a review of the enterprise committee directive."
"This also applies to the action plan to improve health and safety which Mrs Hermange introduced a moment ago."
"According to the Social Agenda, the initiatives should have been before us at the end of 2001/beginning of 2002, but, Commissioner, there is no trace of these in the operational programme of the Commission. I am also picking up signals that there is quite a bit of resistance in the Commission."
"I should therefore like to say one thing in conclusion, Mr President."
"I should like you, Commissioner, to pass on these words to the College of Commissioners: pacta sunt servanda [Treaties should be respected]."
"This Parliament will never accept the Social Agenda being shelved, and I hope that you will be able to use the support of this Parliament in the College of Commissioners."
"Mr President, the ELDR Group would like most sincerely to congratulate Mrs Hermange on her report and on the unanimity that it achieved in committee."
"That said, it is only fair to give notice to the House that we may find ourselves less able to form part of a consensus when the Commission brings forward some of the proposals referred to in paragraph 14."
"In some cases it will depend on the form of the proposals, given our commitment to subsidiarity; in others, it will depend on their exact content."
"I would, for example, express my own concerns in both respects over the second indent of the paragraph and any proposals for providing a tax and legislative framework for the development of the social economy, the third sector."
"Many voluntary organisations have already expressed their worries to me that such a measure, unless we get it exactly right, could well prove more of a hindrance than a help to their activities."
"This is just one of the reasons why I would like to give wholehearted support to the first indent of paragraph 14."
"Knowing how much volunteers contribute to our well-being, I sometimes wonder just how much of a society we would have without their efforts."
"We urgently need a proper legal base for the civil dialogue."
"Without one, we will find it much more difficult to do what the President of Parliament urged us to do yesterday: involve EU citizens in the creation of a Europe fit for its future."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work."
"We are looking for a greater role as a parliament in ensuring that we can conclude agreements with regard to social inclusion, so as to best respond to the needs and demands of those people we represent."
"Parliament's role must be a constructive one."
"However, I have some concerns regarding the amount of legislation sought by this report and the move towards creating more bureaucracy and red tape, which could work to the detriment of the ideals underlying the social policy agenda."
"We must favour creating a proper business environment where employment can be created, and where proper and real jobs can be maintained within the European Union."
"Nowadays when we look around the world we can see how it is more common and easier for industry and business to relocate outside areas with high social costs and high taxation."
"We must work towards a more progressive system in which workers are entitled to keep as much of their earned income as possible and there is better provision of services in the social sphere in areas such as housing, health and education through the national exchequer."
"We may not achieve those with the proposals contained in this report. I am in favour of the report, but I have specific concerns."
"We must also look at the whole legislative process implied by what is being called for in this report."
"Although Parliament is seeking a greater role, more involvement in coordination and quicker action, with hindsight it is also looking for more legislation to be put in place."
"Legislative instruments are called for when negotiations are not concluded in relation to training, lifelong learning, organisation of work, adjustments, new forms of work, guidelines for negotiations by social partners and supplementary sickness insurance."
"However, the Commission has proposed something different."
"The Commission is taking a far more proactive and forward-looking approach in its proposals."
"We must support the call for research, which unfortunately was not highlighted within the committee report."
"There has to be a radical increase in employment participation."
"An emphasis must be put on better jobs."
"More must be done towards building a European labour market with more mobility included within it."
"Finally, we must play a greater and clearer role as regards the place within society of those with disabilities."
"These people represent 10 % of the population, yet they are excluded from so many walks of life."
"We have not yet achieved as much as we should have done for those people."
"Mr President, congratulations to Mrs Hermange on her report, and also to the Commission on its communication."
"It is a new instrument that is being developed."
"It is the first time that it is on the table, so it goes without saying that it will require fine-tuning in future."
"All criticism should therefore be seen in this light, and criticism is obviously always relative."
"I welcome this instrument, and would want to make two comments in this respect."
"First of all, we have developed a great deal of European legislation."
"One of the aspects to which the annex to the communication refers is the need for codification."
"This is absolutely vital, in my view, for the complexity of European legislation and the large quantity of European legislation are starting to play tricks on us."
"Needless to say, we can insist on more European legislation, and more European legislation is probably required in the social field."
"However, there should also come a time where we can catch our breaths and take stock, certainly in the light of enlargement."
"After all, all these new laws will also need to be transposed in the candidate countries."
"If I consider the social situation in the candidate countries, then this is certainly not straightforward."
"They are very poorly developed in the social field, and if we pass new laws, these will also apply to them."
"I therefore call for occasional reviews to be drawn up of the situation as it stands."
"Would it not be useful to consider the results of all the existing laws?"
"How do they operate in practice?"
"Also, should the results in practice not be included in the scoreboard so that we at any rate have an overview, not only of our wishes for improvement, but also of the reality in the field?"
"I call for including this too in the scoreboard."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first to congratulate Mrs Hermange and thank her for this fine report, which is every bit as good as its predecessor."
"We share her analysis and also the criticisms she has raised in the report."
"I wish also to thank you, Commissioner, for your ideas on the Barcelona Summit."
"Only this morning, I was telling a party of visitors from Bad Hersfeld how much commitment you demonstrate."
"Your agenda has enjoyed very strong support from Parliament, and especially from the group to which I belong, but we now expect definite proposals and initiatives, action plans and also - Mrs Smet - directives."
"This will not work in the complete absence of directives."
"Of course, we should make more use than hitherto of the new method of coordination, especially in discussions with the candidate countries."
"I see that as an excellent instrument for getting these countries involved right now and also giving them the opportunity to set out to us their current concerns and needs, and what they have achieved."
"Here too, I do not share Mrs Smet's opinion that these candidate countries lag behind on all these points."
"I think we urgently need a reform of the European Works Councils directive."
"If you have problems at the Commission, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, then just take the excellent report that Parliament produced last autumn."
"We must also shape social policy along precautionary lines, and not always leave it until, so to speak, the child has fallen down the well."
"The scandal surrounding lorry drivers in Luxembourg is only the tip of the iceberg."
"The head of Luxembourg's government has said that there is an urgent need for action on the part of the European Union, and perhaps we should take him at his word."
"The Spanish presidency is, unfortunately, rather hesitant, but, Commissioner, Parliament supports you with all the commitment it can muster."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the degree to which the European Union complies with the Social Policy Agenda is a major indication of its interest in resolving the countless social problems that still exist."
"We are still seeing not only major delays in this policy' s implementation, however, but also that concerns with social policies are not being reflected in other policies and in the Community budget and we are even seeing a reduction in funds in the fields of employment and social affairs, which is unacceptable."
"Even in the field of social inclusion, and despite the miles of paper that have already been used up on the subject and despite national inclusion plans and countless declarations of intent, there are still serious problems which could grow worse as a result of the slowdown in economic activity and the insistence on privatisations in fundamental sectors and in public services that are essential to a genuine policy of social inclusion, in addition to the fact that financial resources are still very thin on the ground."
"If the European Union' s leaders persist in this approach, there is a danger, as the report states, that the commitments given in the Agenda will not be fully met by 2005."
"This is why it is so important for the Commission to speed up its work and, above all, to change its policies, giving the utmost priority to the social aspect in areas such as quality employment with rights, the fight against poverty and social exclusion, the guarantee of access to fundamental rights, specifically for the more vulnerable social groups such as children, the elderly, immigrants and the disabled and the establishment of equal opportunities for men and women in all areas."
"Lastly, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Marie-Therèse Hermange and her colleagues in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for including in the report proposals that I tabled, specifically on asking the Commission to adopt initiatives and to present an action plan for the effective prevention of musculoskeletal injuries at work, to take initiatives to provide appropriate safeguards for workers' rights, and notably employment, in the event of the restructuring or relocation of undertakings and to take initiatives, and notably adopt an action plan, to put into practice equality of payment for men and women."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mrs Hermange on her excellent work but also express some dissatisfaction at the Commission' s communication."
"We do not, of course, want to ignore the various initiatives planned by the Commission regarding employment and certain social issues, nor do we want to disregard the negotiation initiatives undertaken by the social partners."
"The fact is that, although the agenda has a programme structure, endorsed since Nice by the Lisbon conclusions, in particular - and which, moreover I clearly support - this initial assessment of its implementation would seem somewhat inconclusive, removed from the original plan and goals set."
"Indeed, I wonder whether, in the meantime, a predefined model and predefined frameworks exist, within which the responsibilities laid down by the agenda for the many parties involved can be exercised; whether there is evidence of even embryonic good quality work and what its particular characteristics are; whether the job placement systems and systems providing information on opportunities are successfully fulfilling their role and whether school and training courses are starting to be rationalised."
"Moreover, it should be ascertained, at both Community and national level, whether industrial relations are moving steadily towards general development in terms of flexibility and security and whether local bodies and social forces are starting to cooperate responsibly in respect of national action plans and whether these plans are starting to be fully consistent with Union guidelines."
"It would also be appropriate to ascertain, in order to get an overall picture, whether the States have at least initiated an internal debate on their social rules, on cohesion within their national territories and on the integration of groups which are relatively or extremely marginalised because of age, disability, sex or profession."
"One last point concerns enlargement, on which the agenda focuses greatly, unlike this initial assessment, which merely refers to NGOs' activities, although that is not to say they are not important."
"To sum up, the point we are trying to make is that, although much of the issue is left to the principle of subsidiarity and the active responsibility of a number of parties to manage, the social protocol, although behind schedule, is an integral part of the Treaties, and social policy at last goes hand in hand with economic policy in the open method of coordination."
"It is, therefore, vital that the Commission take a more incisive, specific role, which must be shared by the European Parliament in a more substantial, ongoing fashion."
"Mr President, I have very great respect for the ambitious work which the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange, has put into the report on the scoreboard for implementation of the social policy agenda."
"However, I am at the same time concerned that the work has led to the request for a long list of legislative initiatives on the part of the Commission, relating for example to lifelong learning, organisation of work, the need to reconcile work and private life, working environment policy, supplementary sickness insurance and the hiring-out of staff."
"There are two main reasons why I believe that demands for legislative initiatives within these areas are the wrong road to go down."
"First of all, we Swedish Conservatives believe that these issues should not be dealt with at Community level."
"They are best dealt with at national level and, best of all of course, through negotiations at national level."
"Secondly, I believe that adding more and more pages of legislation to the thousands upon thousands of pages that the candidate countries are now already required to accept and incorporate into their own legislation would make it considerably more difficult to implement any enlargement of the EU."
"I therefore agree with what my colleague, Mrs Smet, said about its being important to pause and reflect and to review the legislation that already exists."
"We are not being given the opportunity to vote against individual points in the report."
"We Swedish Conservatives will not be able to support the report as a whole in the final vote, in spite of the fact that there is actually a lot in the report that we think is positive."
"Unfortunately, the initiatives are, as I said just now, to be taken at the wrong level."
"They should be taken at national level."
"Mr President, I should like to start by saying that this report will help enormously in improving how we use an important tool."
"As Mrs Smet said, it is vital that we understand that this is the first social policy tool we have had at European level, a tool achieved with a great deal of hard work and sensitive negotiation."
"The report and the amendments tabled by the honourable Members touch on three issues: content, time and procedure."
"As far as the content is concerned, I would remind the House that the Commission highlighted the need for a binding Social Agenda in the spring of 2000 and spent 6 months making important policy preparations in close collaboration with the French presidency and Parliament, in the person of Mrs Van Lancker, resulting in Nice in agreement between the leading countries, for the first time ever, on a long-term, five-year Social Agenda."
"The Commission was specifically instructed to implement this Social Agenda and it announces a programme every year so that the commitments made will be fulfilled by 2005."
"I should like to remind the House that I presented the results of the first year's implementation of the Agenda to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in October 2000."
"It was 100% efficient; there was a 100% correlation between commitments and implementation."
"In October 2001, I again presented a table of actions in 2001 to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and again there was a 100% correlation between commitments and results."
"The question is, does the Agenda remain constant or does it absorb new factors over the course of time?"
"The Commission is basically - or rather absolutely - committed to the Social Agenda as adopted in Nice on the basis of the Agenda agreed in 2000."
"In the meantime, we have promised to review it in 2003 and, of course, I agree with the report that Parliament will need to play an important part if we are to have the facility to adjust it."
"My second comment concerns time."
"First, the report on the Agenda and the Commission's summary report to the spring Council need to be submitted at the same time."
"This always creates problems, which we are trying to resolve."
"Secondly, our criticism is based on the results of the first year of the Agenda, as Mrs Hermange says in her report, so we must bear in mind that the report in question had to be submitted two months after the decision taken in Nice."
"This brings me to the procedure."
"I agree with the report on three points: first, that the Social Agenda and the table of results cannot simply be a statement of past action and should make a careful examination of broader achievements and look to the future."
"Secondly, it must refer back to the wider review of the factors involved and look forward to future expectations, these factors being, of course, the social partners, together with women's organisations and civic society organisations, as described by the honourable Members."
"The third point is that the stability and cohesiveness of the Agenda are not written in stone, i.e. we must intervene wherever there is an emergency or new elements create problems at social level with social repercussions."
"As was the case recently with the initiative on restructuring, to which the Member in question has already referred, where we had 350,000 redundancies in a year due to corporate restructuring in the European Union."
"We had no choice but to intervene, even though there was no commitment in the Agenda."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, I am positive that this report and the close collaboration with the committee in question will help to improve consistently the performance of the Social Agenda which, I would again remind the House, is a completely new tool and which close cooperation will help to make even better."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour and a pleasure to welcome to Parliament the President of the Republic of Bulgaria, Mr Georgi Parvanov, who has taken his seat in the official gallery."
"His delegation includes prominent members of the Bulgarian government, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Passy, and the Minister for Defence, Mr Svinarov, as well as members of the Bureau of the EU-Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee."
"Mr Parvanov took office less than three weeks ago, and we are delighted that one of his first actions should be to visit the European Parliament."
"We are aware of the endeavours made by Mr Parvanov and the Bulgarian government to overcome the country' s present social and economic difficulties and to prepare it for accession to the European Union."
"We support its desire to be part of the European family and we would stress that the European Parliament is rooting for Bulgaria and its citizens."
"Thank you, Mr President, for your visit."
"(Applause)"
"Vote"
"I wish to table an oral amendment to Amendments Nos 10 and 16, which are identical."
"This is to do with the original text's stipulation that the Joint Undertaking's registered office should be located somewhere where it would be exempted from taxation."
"For reasons of competitiveness, and other comparable reasons, this is of course not feasible."
"In consultation with the groups, the text should be replaced by:"
"... ""subject to the existing tax regimes and negotiations with the potential country of location""."
"(Parliament gave its assent to the tabling of the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, there is an omission in item 9 of the joint resolution."
"In the discussions between the various groups, the European Commission was given the task of reforming the CEMT permit system, but this role has been omitted from the text of the resolution."
"I therefore suggest tabling an oral amendment and adding the following words, which we agreed."
"The text would then be worded as follows: ""Calls on the Member States, in close collaboration with the Commission services, to initiate a qualitative and quantitative revision"" ."
"(The House gave its assent to the tabling of the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution on the situation in the Middle East"
"Regarding Amendment No 2"
"Mr President, I request that the first clause - ""calls on Israel to comply with"" - be replaced with the clause ""calls on the two sides to comply with international conventions"" , and that, after the words ""arrested and imprisoned"" , the words ""by Israel"" be inserted."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0100/2002) on measures to combat terrorism"
"Regarding Amendment No 8"
"I wanted to table an oral amendment both on behalf of my own Group of the Greens and European Free Alliance and on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"The intention is to add a few words which will then make it clear that the definition of terrorism, in the form that we adopted yesterday, will also apply to these measures."
"In other words, the amendment will not affect the entry into force but the interpretation of the definition of terrorism."
"The text reads: ""would like the implementation of these four measures and especially the common position on specific measures to combat terrorism to be subject to the interpretation of the definition, as laid down in the framework decision concerning the definition of terrorism that was laid down by the Council on 6 December 2001, particularly with regard to the guarantees described in the recitals and the relevant statements made by the Council"" ."
"I hope that this is acceptable to everyone."
"(The House gave its assent to the tabling of the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution on the financing of development aid"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution on the UNCHR in Geneva"
"Regarding paragraph 5"
"Mr President, paragraph 5, where it says ""to sign and ratify"" should read ""to ratify or accede to the Rome Statue"" because at this stage it is no longer possible to sign the Statute."
"So paragraph five should read as follows: ""Calls on the Member States to appeal to all UN members to ratify or accede to the Rome Statute setting up the International Criminal Court""."
"(The House gave its assent to the tabling of the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0023/2002) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on relations between the European Parliament and the national parliaments in European integration [2001/2023(INI)]"
"Before the vote"
"Mr President, I would like to inform the House that at the end of the debate yesterday afternoon, Mr Napolitano, in response to statements made during the debate by myself and others, made the following offer: he suggested that we ought to withdraw Amendments Nos 18 and 12 in order that he might, through the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, propose the bringing forward of a specific report on the issue of constitutional regions in the architecture of Europe."
"Many of us believe that is a very important question."
"Those who think it is important are divided at the moment between those who would wish to include it in this report and those who would wish to deal with it in another context."
"The best course - and my group agrees with this as I believe the Liberals do as well - will be for us to accept Mr Napolitano's generous proposition that this should be raised as a separate topic in its own right through the Constitutional Affairs Committee and that we should withdraw these amendments."
"I therefore propose that be done."
"Mr President, I would like to table a compromise oral amendment absorbing Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9 tabled by Mr Belder."
"My amendment replaces citations 2, 4 and 6 of the report with the following: 'Having regard to the recent statements by a number of Heads of State or Government on Europe' s future,' ."
"Mr President, Mr MacCormick has now withdrawn Amendments Nos 18 and 12, but Amendment No 10 deals with the same subject."
"Will the latter be withdrawn accordingly, or will it be kept?"
"First of all, I would like to know whether the House agrees to the oral amendment tabled by Mr Napolitano as rapporteur, to replace the three citations with the clause he has just read."
"Are there any objections?"
"Good."
"The amendment is adopted."
"Mr MacCormick has proposed to withdraw Amendments Nos 12 and 18."
"Mrs Van Lancker says that Amendment No 10 can also be withdrawn as it deals with the same point."
"I have also been informed that Amendment No 17 is on the same subject."
"On the basis of what I have been told, I therefore conclude that Amendments Nos 10, 12, 17 and 18 are to be withdrawn."
"Could you confirm that, Mr MacCormick?"
"Mr President, I am content with that, but they are on different points."
"The other two amendments make this observation: there are exactly 15 Member States in the Union at the moment and that is not disputed."
"Whether there are more nations is a different question."
"However, in a spirit of goodwill I withdraw these amendments as well."
"Mr President, on a point of order, at yesterday's vote on the Watson report on the European Arrest Warrant, there was confusion on the numbering of amendments."
"You will see from today's report that what was Amendment No 3 has been penned over as 4."
"Even in the Official Report it is not quite clear on some of the pages."
"Amendment No 3, which dealt with the legal concept of habeas corpus, had been circulated to us in the Irish delegation of the PPE-DE Group."
"We knew that the amendment would be defeated but nonetheless I and a number of my colleagues decided to vote for it because of our firm belief in the principle of habeas corpus and that it is a good one."
"We wish to indicate our vote that this legal remedy should have a place in European law."
"Looking at the record of yesterday's proceedings, Amendment No 3, which we received yesterday morning, became Amendment No 4 at the vote."
"Our decision to vote for the principle of habeas corpus was negated by this change in the numbering of the amendment."
"I wish it to be recorded here that our vote was intended to support the principle of habeas corpus."
"Of course, Mrs Doyle. Your statement will be included in the Minutes so that it is clear what you intended."
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"Resolution on the area of freedom, security and justice (B5-0099/2002)"
"Mr President, I offer this explanation of vote on behalf of the PPE-DE Group."
"The concern of the PPE-DE Group was that, as a result of the ambiguity of its wording, Amendment No 8 to the resolution on the European judicial area could be wrongly interpreted."
"This wording - particularly in certain language versions - could be interpreted as meaning that the entry into force of the four measures was being replaced by that of the framework decision on terrorism."
"Following Mrs Buitenweg' s clarification, we have voted in favour, because it is logical that the framework decision on terrorism should serve as an interpretative criterion for these four decisions."
"Hatzidakis report (A5-0012/2002)"
". (NL) For a long time, we used to aspire to ever faster road vehicles for the transport of both freight and passengers."
"Speed restriction was seen as a temporary and unwanted hitch in technology waiting to be perfected."
"Each deliberate attempt to return to any form of speed restriction was considered an infringement of the driver' s individual freedom or a barrier to favourable profit margins for hauliers."
"The rising death toll on the roads is forcing us to have second thoughts."
"Despite this, the prescribing of devices for an ever larger proportion of road transport is only part of the solution."
"If appliances are made compulsory but if the legal speed limit is not sufficiently restricted, then this looks more like a disguised form of subsidy for companies that can tap into a new market in this way."
"This is comparable to the covenant with the car industry, which produces headlights that are activated automatically when the car is switched on, whereupon the driver needs to switch them off again in order to meet national statutory provisions or safety requirements."
"Unfortunately, the rapporteur confines the proposal to company cars, extends transitional periods and, in part, increases the maximum speed of category N2 motorised vehicles to 110 km."
"Speed limitation devices only make sense if they are designed to make compliance with such a serious statutory speed restriction enforceable, and this is, sadly, still not the case."
"Marques report (A5-0001/2002)"
"Mr President, firstly, in my capacity as a member of the EU-Bulgaria joint interparliamentary delegation, I too would like to welcome the Bulgarian Prime Minister, Mr Georgi Parvanov, to the European Parliament."
"As regards the Marques report on rum in the French overseas territories and the Azores, how could I vote against the motion?"
"Last night, I dreamed I saw the pirate, Captain Morgan, who said to me: 'I have been appointed by the trade union of pirates to advise you to vote for this document, for otherwise we pirates will not be able to sing our usual refrain' - which I will read, not sing here - '15 men on a dead man' s chest and a bottle of rum' ."
"The bottle of rum is essential, and so I voted for the motion."
"(FR) Article 299(2) of the Treaty provides for the possibility of introducing special measures in order to ensure the survival of activities in the outermost regions where a climate of legal certainty is greatly needed if economic operators are to maintain their position and to grow."
"The production of rum has a major impact on the economy of the French overseas departments as 40 000 jobs are involved."
"The Council Decision of 1995, which is due to expire at the end of this year, authorises France to impose a reduced rate of excise duty within French metropolitan territory for ""traditional"" rum produced in the French overseas departments."
"The current review of the COM in the sugar sector and the dismantling of customs barriers in 2003 have led France to propose that these tax arrangements be maintained beyond 2002 on the grounds that the measures adopted at national and Community level would not in themselves be enough to allow FOD products to compete with products from other regions."
"In order to preserve this traditional agricultural activity, which generates jobs at every stage of cane-sugar-rum production, the current system sets a minimum level for imports from the FOD into France which is strictly limited and supervised in order to compete with the ever-increasing sales of rum from third countries, which are not subject to the same production specifications."
"In order to ensure the survival of the sector, rum producers in the FOD are obliged to use local raw materials, which guarantees quality, but which, for example, prevents Guadelupian rum from being produced using cane from Martinique as well as from third countries."
"Rum from the overseas departments is therefore obliged to participate in the FOD rural development policy, which increases restrictions and production costs and places it in a disadvantageous position on the market in relation to products from third countries."
"The dispensational tax system therefore merely aims to compensate for the obligation incumbent on FOD producers to participate in the survival of the cane-sugar-rum sector."

"Glante report (A5-0005/2002)"
"Let us talk about the Galileo project, Mr President."
"As you know better than me, Galileo Galilei, the great Italian scientist, used to study the sky with his telescope from the earth."
"Here, the opposite is happening: Galileo will study the earth from the heights of the satellites, which is where he will be sent into orbit."
"This coincidence is curious but it does not alter the fact that the Galileo project is very important, and so I voted for the motion."
". (EL) The purpose of the GALILEO programme is to design and build a satellite navigation system which allows users to determine their position on earth extremely accurately."
"Apart from the fact that it is much more accurate than the American Global Positioning System (GPS), which has been up and running for several years now, the main point about GALILEO is that, unlike the GPS, it is to come under political, rather than military control."
"It is also the first European space project and, if it can be successfully installed and commissioned, apart from helping to improve navigation, it will give a tremendous boost to space science and technology."
"The European Commission communication under examination does not relate to the GALILEO system per se but to the creation of a joint public/private undertaking to finance its development."
"Mr Glante's report proposes several important improvements to the Commission proposal."
"However, the European Parliament approved two amendments by a large majority, led mainly by the European People's Party, with the backing of the Party of European Socialists, which seek to militarise the system by making express reference to military use of the system for so-called ""peacekeeping operations""."
"If the Council and the Commission follow this line of thinking, it will completely negate the non-military purpose of the system and will, of course, be an addition to the European Union's arsenal in its interventions against the people."
"It is worth noting that the European Parliament approved a similar amendment in my report on the European Union's space policy on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy at the last part-session."
"This is no random coincidence; as we pointed out on that previous occasion, it demonstrates a clear intention to use space for military purposes."
"These developments prove that the global grass-roots movement needs to step up its fight against imperialist aggression and the militarisation of space."
"It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report."
"The MPF delegation firmly supports the Galileo project for the implementation of a European satellite radionavigation programme, a system that will work parallel to yet independently of the American GPS system whilst maintaining 'interoperability' , in other words, it will not work against this system and will permit the possibility for the two systems to work together."
"The Galileo project seems exemplary for three reasons."
"From a technical point of view, it will have numerous positive effects for all economic activities and will increase Europe' s general productivity at a time when this is very much needed."
"From an institutional point of view, it is clear that a project on which there is Europe-wide cooperation would be justified with regard to subsidiarity, and that the European Space Agency (ESA) could provide the appropriate instrument for this."
"Finally, from a political and strategic point of view, the Galileo project will grant Europe independence from the United States while the acceptance of the GPS monopoly, on the other hand, would imply a tangible dependence that would increase over time."
"In spite of these arguments, the final decision on the development of the Galileo project has been deferred from Council to Council, and the latest, held at Laeken, was no exception."
"It is already almost too late for a useful decision to be made."
"Apart from the technical discussions on the precise procedures for the involvement of private partners, the true reason for the delay lies in the United States' hesitation, which has influenced certain European countries."
"This brings us to the main issue: do Community procedures not slow the whole process down because they are too rigid and the partners are not all in agreement?"
"These structures are acting like a brake now on the project' s launch and they will act like a brake tomorrow and at each stage of development, especially if we want to add military or 'peacekeeping' operations."
"On this point, the European Parliament is frankly making a mistake in demanding an ever greater communitisation of the project, for example in estimating, in its resolution of 17 January, that ""The ESA with its basis of intergovernmental cooperation should in the longer term be brought within the EU"" ."
"In truth, the opposite is the case: we need to apply the principle of variable geometry to Galileo, as for Airbus and Ariane, and create a structure that groups together only those States that are truly involved in the project."
"This would be the best way to pull this project out of the rut it is currently stuck in and make real progress."
". (FR) I would like to start by congratulating my colleague, Norbert Glante, on his research and negotiations on this matter of great strategic importance."
"I would now like to draw your attention to the Galileo system."
"We often hear mention of this project without really being aware of its future applications."
"Galileo is a satellite radionavigation system that allows the user of a receiver to capture the signals transmitted by a number of satellites in order to determine its position in time and in space."
"At the moment, there are two systems of this type: the American GPS system and the Russian GLONASS system."
"These two systems have been developed on a military basis, which is not the case with Galileo."
"On a practical level, we will be able to use this system in areas as varied as transport, fisheries, agriculture, telecommunications, oil exploration, defence and civil protection activities."
"To give you an example, in the field of inland transportation, it will allow planning and better management of transport times, the automatic control of vehicles, a reduction in traffic jams and the number of road accidents and so on and so forth."
"Of course, we are not at this stage yet."
"The implementation of Galileo should take place in four phases."
"We have completed the definition phase."
"We now have to launch the development phase for 2002-2005."
"During this period, we will have to establish the technical and financial conditions necessary for the rapid deployment of infrastructure in 2006-2007 in order to be able to exploit this system commercially in 2008."
"The European Commission has made us proposals with regard to this second phase of Galileo."
"Our Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy was of the opinion that the proposals made with regard to structures were not appropriate."
"Thus, according to the model envisaged by the European Commission, private companies would be able to participate fully in the establishment of the Joint Undertaking."
"Following the example of the rapporteur, I believe that there would be a conflict of interests if these companies were directly involved in the joint undertaking, since they would then have to respond to invitations to tender issued by this same company."
"It therefore seems desirable that only the founding members, the European Communities and the European Space Agency, should be members of this Joint Undertaking."
"The EIB may also become a member of the Joint Undertaking in the future."
"(Intervention cut short pursuant to Article 137 of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (DE) I consider the establishment of a European satellite navigation programme to be generally sensible and deserving of support."
"I have, despite this, voted against the Glante report today, as I am unable to follow the rapporteur down the road he is taking."
"In no way is there any certainty that Galileo will succeed in economic terms as a competitor to GPS, which has until now enjoyed a monopoly of the market."
"I therefore take the view that the financial risk should be borne equally by the public sector and private enterprise."
"The rapporteur wants to facilitate industry's involvement in financing Galileo by means of a development company instead of giving it a share in the Joint Undertaking, as the Commission had planned."
"One objective in this is to allay the Member States' misgivings on the security policy front, and the other is to avoid the private businesses which constitute part of the Joint Undertaking enjoying competitive advantages when tenders are invited to set Galileo up and operate it."
"I take the view, however, that the end result of this purely optional solution to financial participation will be that the investments Galileo will need will be raised by the public sector alone."
"Industry will get on board only when Galileo has demonstrated its earning potential and is set to make profits."
"This would boil down to funds raised by taxation being invested as venture capital and to substantial shares in the profits then being handed over to private enterprise."
"That is not how I envisage taxpayers' money being handled."
"Nor am I convinced by the argument of possible conflicts of interest in tendering procedures."
"It is, for example, the usual practice in municipalities for enterprises owned by the local authority to tender jointly with private firms when contracts are put out, without this resulting in unequal treatment."
"As regards the argument of security policy, I have misgivings of a quite different kind. Both the Commission and the Council leave no room for doubt that they regard Galileo as a central component of the independence of European defence policy."
"Parliament has not been able to make up its mind to decisively reject the use of Galileo for military purposes."
"I, though, reject all use of satellite navigation systems for military purposes."
"- (NL) The rapporteur is right to refer private companies to a separate development company."
"However, I do not back this proposal, for GALILEO is 15 years overdue."
"The benefits which a navigation system supported by satellites could have for the government, industry and individual users have long since been stolen from under our noses by the American competition."
"Only if we intend to close off the European market for American goods and services is it useful to develop a system with Community funding that, within a liberalised global market, is doomed to lose the competitive battle to the American GPS system."
"This intention does not exist, and it even looks like we are painstakingly trying to avoid trade wars with the US over the import of dangerous goods and pollution by noisy aircraft."
"European companies are, of course, free to try, off their own bats, to compete with the American product with something that is of superior quality."
"In doing so, they may be able temporarily to gain a tiny foothold in the market and subsequently do profitable business with the Americans, which will enable them to incorporate European inventions into improvements to the existing system."
"This does not apply to a large-scale project that has partly been funded with tax money and that can only win or lose."
"Such a waste of Community funding only serves the interests of industry and the military machine."
"The members of the MPF delegation to the European Parliament have supported Mr Glante' s report in order to give their backing to the implementation of the Galileo programme, but they are anxious to show their disagreement with the mixed Community and intergovernmental approach, which has been retained."
"This project is a perfect illustration of one of the domains in which European cooperation is vital."
"The common interest is obvious and clearly defined."
"The Galileo system is crucial if we are to ensure the independence of the Member States of the European Union in the strategic domain of satellite position-finding, since it will mean that they no longer have to depend on the GPS, that the United States controls in a discretionary fashion."
"On the other hand, in attempting to manage the project with a 'Joint Undertaking' , where the Commission, together with the ESA, would make up one of the two pillars, we would be running the risk of paralysing its implementation, causing disagreements, bureaucracy and delays and making it impossible to call upon competences outside the Union and so on. The only effective solution would appear to be a specific ESA programme, for ESA mechanisms have proved their flexibility and efficiency."
"Only a voluntary intergovernmental framework will permit the satisfactory resolution of the essential issue of the use of the system by the military."
". I wholeheartedly support this report by my Socialist colleague which will endow Europe with an independent technology which can be widely used for several practical purposes, including transport and telecommunications."
"It is increasingly vital that the EU should develop an independent technology from the only two which exist in Russia and the United States."
"Presently, we have a precarious situation whereby the EU is reliant on these two countries' systems which could potentially be called into use for military purposes at any point."
"Financing for this project has always been a contentious issue: its financial underpinning must inevitably come from the private sector, but the ensuing relationship between the Joint Undertaking and the private sector must be carefully defined."
"This will preclude any conflict of interests or awkward ambiguity between the partners of this project."
"In light of this, it is a sound proposal to establish a development company which would effectively act as an arbiter between the partners of this project."
"Lastly, a monitoring committee which would observe the project throughout its creation will ensure that the project is as transparent and accountable as is necessary."
"Joint motion for a resolution on the Middle East (B5-0101/2002)"
"Mr President, I am delivering this explanation of vote on my own behalf."
"I voted for Amendment No 1 on the Israeli reservists refusing to serve in the occupied territories, against the instruction of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"This instruction was given purely for tactical reasons, because if this amendment had been adopted, the Group of the Europe People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would not have voted for the resolution."
"I feel, however, that if there are men and women in Israel and the Palestinian territories who have the courage to say no to war, there is a glimmer of hope, and this is a wonderful example of courage to which we must cannot, under any circumstances, fail to respond."
"In any case, I feel - and I want to believe - that history will prove these reservists right."
"(EL) The European Parliament resolution on the Middle East may ascribe some responsibility to the Israeli government, but it remains faithful to the general policy of sitting squarely on the fence, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote."
"The Communist Party of Greece condemns the blatant violation of international conventions, international law and bilateral agreements by the Israeli government and, more importantly, the aggressive, barbaric tactics of the Israeli forces occupying the West Bank and Gaza."
"The barbaric move in cutting off President Arafat's headquarters - and hence, to all intents and purposes, the Palestinian Authority - in Ramallah is intolerable and we call for an immediate end to it."
"We also condemn the increased and indiscriminate use of violence by the Israeli forces against the Palestinian people, as a result of which the Palestinians have suffered hundreds of deaths and thousands of casualties among the civilian population and constant bombardment of their infrastructure, including their homes and fields."
"We welcome the fight by the Palestinian people for a fair and peaceful solution in accordance with UN resolutions and we stand by them in their struggle to found their own independent state around the capital of East Jerusalem."
"We also welcome all the Israeli democrats who oppose their government's barbaric policy, who are fighting for a fair and viable solution and who often risk their life by refusing to be party to their government's illegal and inhumane action."
"More importantly, we stand by the Israeli soldiers who refuse to murder civilians."
"We consider that the ÅU's stand to date, despite its pronouncements to the contrary, has not helped to resolve the Palestinian question."
"On the contrary, by promoting the new order together with the USA and keeping to its tactic of sitting firmly on the fence between the murderers and the victims it is perpetuating the problem so that it can turn it to its advantage in accordance with its imperialist interests in the region and beyond."
"We call on the governments of the Member States, especially of the countries represented at the UN Security Council, and the ÅU to raise the issue of increased tension in the Middle East, the failure to apply the UN resolutions already passed and their violation by Israel at the UN and to call on Israel to help find a fair and viable solution to the problem and recognise the right of the Palestinian people to an independent state, which will make a decisive contribution towards stability and security in the region."
". (PT) The situation in the Middle East is so serious that it requires urgent measures and greater solidarity in demanding an end to the continual illegal incursion by the Israeli army into territories under the control of the Palestinian National Authority, to the virtual house-arrest of President Arafat, to the extrajudicial execution of Palestinian representatives, to the violation of the most basic human rights, including the torture and killing of children, and to the destruction of Palestinian infrastructures and other installations funded by the European Union and by other donors."
"The international community must, as a matter of urgency, adopt new initiatives that lead to an end to the violence, to re-establishing trust and to reopening negotiations between the two sides, in accordance with international law and with the relevant United Nations resolutions."
"Hence my support for the Joint Resolution which, although watered down, could express the European Parliament' s concern at this situation, repudiate the statements and actions of Ariel Sharon, and reaffirm that the solution to the problem, including the safety of Israel and peace itself, requires the State of Palestine to be recognised in conditions that are viable."
"I regret the fact, however, that the majority of those on the right has refused to show solidarity with the Israeli army reservists who refuse to serve in the occupied territories, and whom history will show to be completely right, although I welcome the decision to send a very high level parliamentary delegation to the region to meet the Israeli and Palestinian authorities and to convey a message of peace to both communities, together with the European Parliament' s insistence on the need to urgently send international observers to the region."
"I hope that, this watered-down resolution of the European Parliament will at least be implemented immediately."
". (FR) At a time that is particularly tragic for the Middle East as well as particularly dangerous for world peace, at a time when the United States is no longer providing the impetus for the peace process, reverting to a more partisan approach, a time at which the Arab States seem to be stunned by the position adopted by the Americans, it would appear to be the clear responsibility of the Europeans to take the initiative and to try to overcome the current situation of violent impasse with diplomatic advances."
"Alas, however, we have yet to make any significant achievements."
"Member States which may have had the diplomatic ability to act are becoming paralysed by the collective mechanisms of the Union, which can only produce joint statements."
"The European Parliament resolution is just another manifestation of this European powerlessness."
"There are murmurs from France."
"The suggestions are appropriate but France believes that it no longer has the strength to push them forward."
"The organisation in the occupied territories, of elections based on the theme of peace would act, however, as a lever that would force the Palestinians to adopt a clear position with regard to the Intifada and terrorism."
"The recognition of the Palestinian State by all, as a starting point for negotiation, going beyond questions of personality that muddy the waters, would allow the peace process to be relaunched on a more solid basis."
"Naturally, the European Parliament resolution makes no reference to these proposals, since, coming from a single Member State and not from a European authority, they cannot by definition, in the Union' s eyes, be pertinent."
"Not being supported by genuine political will, it is very likely that these proposals will vanish into thin air, when they could have put both parties back onto the path to political dialogue."
"Motion for a resolution on terrorism (B5-0100/2002)"
". (FR) The vote on our motion for a resolution against terrorism means we can state firmly once again that terrorism is evil by definition, is totally unjustified and should be eradicated at all costs."
"The main characteristic of and driving force behind these unscrupulous minority groups is the imposing of their ideas and power through violence and fear."
"The causes of terrorism should not be confused with the means it employs."
"Terrorist leaders, whoever and wherever they are, have need of resources to be able to achieve their goals, namely:"
"money, first and foremost, from their personal fortunes or obtained through racketeering, criminal activity, drug trafficking or petrodollars..."
"foot-soldiers, which they find in fragile environments by playing on nationalism, religion, ambition, dreams, revenge, poverty or despair..."
"terror, which they impose on democracies and their citizens that are ill prepared to resist ... and always ready to negotiate compromises..."
"We remember all the terrorist movements and their actions over the last few years, whether it be the Baader-Meinhof gang in Germany, the Red Brigades in Italy, movements in Corsica, in Ireland or in the Basque Country, striking every day, not forgetting the massacres at the Munich Olympics, the suicide bombers in Tel Aviv and the networks of the fundamentalist multimillionaire Osama Bin Laden."
"All these actions have a common goal: to destroy democratic systems by means of terror."
"Combating terrorism should be the main objective of all democracies, wherever they may be."
"The ability to call upon a large amount of resources is needed in order to implement measures with determination, to mobilise the citizens, explaining to them what is at stake, and to strengthen the power of the public authorities at both national and European levels."
"Without this...there is not much hope!"
"This is why I supported the European Parliament' s forceful and legitimate request to be closely involved in the actions of the Council in this area."
"If we are to combat terrorism effectively, public opinion must be roused, and the European Parliament is the best representative of this opinion."
"Joint motion for a resolution on development aid (B5-0034/2002)"
". (FR) We are living in a world of unprecedented global wealth."
"This wealth, however, has never been so poorly distributed."
"Inequalities on a global scale have reached intolerable, appalling proportions."
"In 1960, the 20% of the world' s population living in the richest countries had an income 30 times higher than that of the 20% poorest. In 1995, their income was 82 times higher."
"At the other end of the scale, almost three billion people live on less than USD two per day."
"More than 800 million are starving."
"In September 2001, in the 'Millennium Declaration' , the international community committed itself to halving poverty by 2015."
"The international community must, from now on, make the move from these good intentions to positive action."
"Europe must provide the impetus for this action."
"Next March, in Monterrey, then in Johannesburg in September at the World Summit on sustainable development, the European Union must take the initiative and make concrete proposals and set a precise timetable to honour these commitments."
"This offensive promoting development and combating poverty should be organised around four key ideas."
"The first is to increase public aid in considerable proportions until it reaches - at last - the objective of 0.7% of the wealth of the northern countries set more than 30 years ago."
"A major step was taken in this direction by the last 'Development' Council, which put this objective back on the agenda and called upon the Commission to set deadlines together with the Member States."
"We need, from now on, to establish a more precise and restrictive timetable."
"Secondly, we need to provide new answers to the problem of the debts of poor countries."
"In order to do this, the number of debt restructuring operations that favour the education and primary health care sectors should be dramatically increased, along the lines of the 'debt-reducing and development contracts' (C2D) implemented by France."
"We need to go further than the HIPS 'heavily indebted poor countries' initiative and engage in a vast programme for the cancellation of the debt of developing countries."
"We need to think about the conditions of access of developing countries to international financing, in accordance with the guidelines mentioned by the French Prime Minister."

"Napolitano report (A5-0023/2002)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted for the Napolitano report."
"The Convention is extremely important and we all support it."
"However, I would like to take this opportunity to state that, in my opinion, there is a lack of democracy in the way the delegates from the European Parliament to the Convention were chosen."
"I feel, for example, that Mr Méndez de Vigo would have been much happier if the House had elected him by secret ballot, as the President of Parliament and you yourself, Mr Vice-President, were elected."
"Everybody would have voted for him and the vote would probably have been unanimous, but that would have constituted a genuine, democratic selection of candidates and therefore of Members of the European Parliament to this Convention."
"I would like to point out here that although 'a good start is half the battle' , in this case, a bad start means working twice as hard."
"I hope that, in future, the appointment of European Parliament representatives to these important bodies will be more democratic."
"Mr President, as Vice-President of Parliament responsible for relations with national parliaments, I very much welcome both the tone and the content of Mr Napolitano's report."
"I am convinced that his ideas will help us enhance what is already a good relationship between ourselves and our national counterparts."
"I strongly believe that this relationship is vital if we are to ensure that the EU is built on democratic foundations."
"However, I agree with some of my colleagues when they emphasise that the regional parliaments which have legislative powers are an equally important part of ensuring democracy in all EU decision-making."
"To take my own country, for example, over half the work of the Scottish Parliament is not about implementing laws thought of in Edinburgh or even implementing laws coming from London, but in fact about implementing laws from Brussels - about ensuring that EU laws are properly transposed into Scottish legislation."
"So while it is important that we look at national parliaments - and I continue to welcome the emphasis we give to that - we should also now consider how we might embrace the regional parliaments in our work."
"I believe this is an excellent and very wise report, much like the rapporteur."
"I am personally in full agreement with this report, because I believe it takes the perfect approach."
"However, I have not taken part in the vote - despite agreeing personally with the contents of the report - owing to my appointment as a representative of the President of the Spanish Government in the Convention."
"Not because I believe there is any incompatibility - which there is not: either legal, material, ethical or any other - but, quite the opposite: the status of MEP - which I share with two other Members who have also been appointed by two other Heads of State and Government, in Greece and Luxembourg - gives added value to the Convention, which is a joint task and not one of opposition."
"Nevertheless, also for personal reasons, which are much more symbolic or aesthetic, if you like, Mr President, I have preferred not to participate in the determination of an approach which will undoubtedly serve as a basis for the position taken by Parliament' s delegation in the Convention."
"Although there is no incompatibility of any type, I would like it to be noted that my blank vote is purely intended to reflect the fact that I was present."
". (EL) The proposed resolution by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is a move in the right direction, which is why I support it."
"National governments are generally relegated to the edge of the European structure."
"Their role needs to be developed, not with yet another institution which will get bogged down in the red tape of the European Union, but by:"
"improving debates of European issues in national parliaments,"
"examining each minister's programme before it is presented to the Council of Ministers,"
"controlling the activities of the Council of Ministers,"
"setting up more high-profile committees on European issues in national parliaments,"
"involving national parliaments in drafting European legislation,"
"strengthening collaboration between the national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"We voted in favour of Amendment No 21, and more specifically paragraph 3, of the report because we agree with the rapporteur that the European Parliament and the national parliaments within their respective areas represent the people of the EU."
"However, we do not believe that increased parliamentarisation of the EU requires the European Parliament' s powers to be extended where all the EU' s decisions are concerned."
"It is important to remember that intergovernmental cooperation takes place between governments controlled by the national parliaments, which also demand accountability."
"We voted in favour of paragraph 7 of the report because we agree in principle with the rapporteur' s view that it would be an unfortunate development if the governments were to go overboard in developing new instruments for exercising power that exclude the parliaments' influence."
"At the same time, we would emphasise that - in spite of its being insufficiently rooted in parliamentary procedure - the open coordination method has been, and remains, a successful and welcome method of achieving increased integration, cooperation and results in areas not considered suitable for more supranational forms of decision-making."
"We voted in favour of paragraph 8 of the report because we agree with the rapporteur that it cannot be regarded as legitimate - in terms either of the practicalities or of providing representation - for MEPs to have a double mandate, that is to say with seats in both the European Parliament and a national/regional parliament."
"Where seats in regional parliaments are concerned, we are nonetheless proceeding on the basis that the rapporteur is referring to such parliaments as have independent legislative power and not to such parliaments as have delegated decision-making power, such as the Swedish county councils."
"It should be possible reasonably to combine a seat in the latter type of parliament with a seat in the European Parliament."
"(FR) The Napolitano report reflects the traditional view held in the European Parliament on its relationship with the national parliaments: that these are isolationist and content to console themselves with the subordinate role of defenders of fragmented national interests."
"This view clearly fails to take into account the fact that the most vibrant level of democracy is that of the nation state, and that to disregard this to too great an extent is also to disregard democracy."
"The European common good is not decreed from above, from a European democracy that is too weak to be anything other than a kind of technocratic smokescreen, but lies instead in the peaceful dialogue between the interests and aspirations of various national democracies."
"There is a point, however, to which the Napolitano report claims, according to the explanatory statement, to have brought 'an extremely important innovation' : that is, the proposal of some sort of 'joint constituent power' ."
"This, in reality, exposes the true intentions behind the report' s mollifying proposals: the idea is, in effect, no more and no less, to take away from the national parliaments the exclusive right of ratifying European Treaties and, therefore, of defining the competences of the European Union themselves."
"This new 'constituent power' would be shared between the national parliaments and the European Parliament, as well as, as is stated in paragraph 21 of the resolution, by the Commission and the governments of Member States, which is truly unprecedented from the democratic point of view."
"Such a reform would constitute a serious climbdown."
"The power to revise the Treaties, not to mention the 'constituent power' , belongs to the people alone, and certainly not to national or European executives; the people can delegate this power in certain cases to assemblies that have been elected for this purpose, such as the French parliament in the cases specified in Article 89 of the Constitution, but the European Parliament is not one of these assemblies, because no constituent power, or even the revision of treaties, is included in the powers specifically conferred on it by the people."
". The report confines the national parliaments to a role of scrutinising their respective governments, a role which has been curtailed ever since the extension of qualified majority voting in the Council broke the link between European decisions and those taken by each people separately."
"It also seeks to widen the powers of the European Parliament, failing to recognise that legitimacy is primarily granted by citizens at national parliamentary level."
"In order to revitalise democracy in Europe, it is essential to give each people the visible power of decision at European level."
"Consequently, in future we must see national parliaments as standing at the centre of the decision-making process, rather than on the periphery."
"The Nice European Council in fact appears to have had an intuition of this when it placed 'the role of the national parliament in the European architecture' (and not on the fringes of that architecture) on the agenda for the next IGC."
"Citizens in the European Union generally see elections to their national parliaments (and, in some countries, elections to the national presidency) as the fundamental democratic choice between, for example a left- or right-wing government."
"The legitimacy of democracy is today based on the elections to the national parliaments and, as a consequence, the institutions of the European Union must be adjusted to this fact."
"Most importantly, major decisions in the Council should have to be ratified by the national parliaments."
"- (DA) SOS Democracy is unable to vote in favour of the Napolitano report because it does not give the decisive role to the national parliaments, which are the only institutions that have a close relationship with the people."

(ES) The fact that the process of European integration is at such a decisive point, as a result of the enlargement under way, on the one hand, and the new political and economic challenges facing the EU, on the other, demands the cooperation of both the European Parliament and the parliaments of the Member States so that the citizens, via their legitimate representatives, may participate in this process."
"Hence the timeliness of the excellent Napolitano report and my vote in favour of it."
"Since, while it is clearly necessary to guarantee the democratic control of Community policies and decision making, it is also clear that this control must be carried out while respecting each of the areas of parliamentary activity."
"In this respect, I believe the commitment given by Mr Napolitano, as chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to draw up a report in the near future on the role of parliaments in the constitutional regions within this process is particularly positive."
"The regions with legislative powers are a fundamental part of the mechanism, and not only because they are closer to the citizens, but also because the parliaments of these regions, as legitimate representatives of the people making up the Union, have the right to participate within the framework of their competences in the control of the legislative process for Community policies and to have a voice so that they can defend their interests."
". (FR) Whilst I generally support the Napolitano report, I abstained in the final vote because I believe it premature to conclude against the possibility of having a second European chamber or Senate for the Member States."
"It will be the task of the forthcoming Convention to develop these ideas, and to draw its own conclusions on the institutions to be created, or not to be created, depending on the global architecture that will eventually be retained."
". (NL) Much of the power robbed from the national parliaments for the sake of European unification has not ended up with the European Parliament, but with the national governments."
"That is why the EU' s existence has enhanced the power of Ministers and Secretaries of State."
"The way in which they reach agreements with each other within the Council cannot be verified by the European Parliament or the national parliaments."
"If a decision is made which clashes with their national public opinion, they can always say that they themselves wanted things differently, but that it was the neighbours that prevented this from happening."
"The Ministers of the neighbouring countries come up with the same excuse."
"This intergovernmental method of decision-making is no longer a guarantee that the diverse wishes that prevail in the Member States are taken into account."
"I therefore call for an interparliamentary method of decision-making, rather than an intergovernmental one."
"The European Commission makes proposals, the European Parliament decides on these at first reading and, subsequently, the national parliaments individually debate the applicability of these decisions to their own countries."
"In this model, the Council no longer fulfils an independent, decision-making role."
"Unfortunately, the proposals by Mr Napolitano do not go that far yet, but he is right to reinforce the role of the parliaments at the various levels in respect of the governments."
". (PT) I felt obliged to vote against the Napolitano report although I acknowledge that its resolution reflects a range of positive concerns about the role of national parliaments, both in exercising control over their governments, especially when these governments are involved in defining and implementing European policy, and in producing this policy."
"I also acknowledge, as I mentioned expressly in my speech, that the rapporteur was able, in part, to include in the document some of the proposals put forward in the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for which I was draftsman."
"Nevertheless, I cannot agree to some of the conclusions that have been adopted, which I feel are of great political significance."
"Amongst these, I would highlight item 21, on the emergence - by means of the Convention - of a constituent power, albeit exercised jointly by the European Parliament and the national parliaments, the Commission and the governments of the Member States, and the outright rejection of a future Senate (item 17), which could, in my opinion, destroy the principle of parity between the Member States of the Union."
"Through this explanation of vote I have made my position clear, because, in addition to the objections I have stated, which determined my vote, I feel that Mr Napolitano deserves my intellectual respect for his work and for his efforts to increase the role of national parliaments in the EU, rejecting the simplistic plan to give the European Parliament exclusive rights to represent Europe' s citizens and to be the guardian of democracy in the relationship with the other institutions of the Union."
"Pohjamo report (A5-0006/2002)"
". (DE) My group agrees with Mr Pohjamo's own-initiative report."
"Positive effects have not yet been forthcoming, to the extent we had hoped, from the current provisions of the law and from the reform of the structural funds within the Agenda 2000 framework."
"The following, in particular, need to be optimised:"
"the lengthy negotiations on programmes between the Commission and the Member States"
"the complicated financial provisions"
"the involvement of the regions in the implementation of programmes and projects"
"the expenditure on administration, and"
"the non-binding nature of the monitoring of project implementation."
"Unless further structural changes are made in the administration of the Structural Funds, it will continue to be scarcely possible to resolve the problem posed by the decrease in disparities between the Member States not being reflected by a decrease in those between the regions within them."
"Such changes must, in particular, cover the following aspects:"
"time limits on projects"
"discontinuance of the financing of projects, the realisation of which overruns the timescale envisaged"
"the redistribution of Structural Funds resources from countries not availing themselves of them to those which have submitted sufficient qualifying projects"
"greater weight to be given to infrastructure projects which promote employment."
"Enlargement of the EU makes it a matter of urgent necessity that the Commission should produce, by 2003 at the latest, definite proposals to guarantee that present Member States should suffer no detriment as regards structural resources and that the countries that are candidates for accession should be treated equally in line with the tasks of a common structural policy."
"There is no other way to achieve the objective of long-term reduction of existing differences in levels of development and the consequent enhancement of economic and social cohesion."
"The amendments tabled by my group have also supported this statement of political objectives."
"- (NL) As long as the structural funds remain unchanged, there will be tension between the regional side and the European side."
"Viewed from the regional angle, this is about the regions' own funding to which they are entitled and which they must be able to spend independently and as freely as possible."
"From the European angle, this is about European money that can only be made available under strict conditions for use in regions and cities and that must be demanded back if deadlines are exceeded or the planned spending plan deviated from."
"These clashing demands can only be brought into line with each other following much official, preliminary consultation and a great deal of inspection."
"This means that high expenses and much bureaucracy are involved in spending these funds."
"It might be preferable for Europe to confine itself to the redistribution of funds that can be freely spent for the benefit of investments in regions suffering from a disadvantage, a crisis or a geographical location that is economically disadvantageous, and keep interference in spending to a minimum, or eliminate it altogether."
"Such a change would allow European officials to be deployed on other tasks on which work still needs to be done and would put an end to the needless re-circulation of funding from rich Member States back to the same rich Member States."
"That might result in fewer propaganda hoardings sporting a European flag, but it would be far more effective."
". I wholeheartedly applaud the call for EU Structural Funds to be made more efficient and more result-oriented."
"Indeed, Structural Funds are a prime way in which European citizens can be made to feel that the EU is doing something for them and it is crucial that the widespread impression of red tape and bureaucracy is not confirmed."
"All too often, the execution of Structural Funds has been bureaucratic and the implementation slow and inefficient."
"With considerable successive growth in the amount of money allocated to the Structural Funds, it is vital that the principles of productivity, regional added value and quality should not only be reiterated, but also vigilantly monitored."
"The effective allocation of the Funds requires the cooperation of all levels of European government."
"National governments have a role to play in freeing up the execution process and I favour the call by MEPs for a more direct channelling of Funds to the regions."
"In addition, the Commission should be more proactive in approving guideline documents, thus further freeing up the process."
"Finally, the consideration of Structural Funds and enlargement is apt: the EU could use this opportunity to allocate Funds more effectively, first time round."
"Musotto report (A5-0007/2002)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, I would like to point out - this document concerns the economic and social cohesion of the regions of the European Union - how important it is in the opinion of the Pensioners' Party and myself that the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union should not bring about any change in the major cohesion policy implemented through the Structural Funds."
"I feel that it is the duty of all the wealthiest regions of Europe to contribute, both financially and otherwise, to the progress of all the other, less wealthy, poorer regions, for I am sad to say that there are still poor regions in all areas of the European Union."
"With this in mind, I therefore voted for the Musotto report."
". (FR) I would firstly like to thank both our rapporteur from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Francesco Musotto, and indeed the whole of this committee for the high quality work they have presented."
"To vote for this report is, as far as I am concerned, first and foremost to underline the fact that the principle of cohesion and thus of solidarity and the integration of the peoples and territories of the Union is enshrined in the Treaties and, this being the case, it is essential that it be defended."
"The fact that the progress made has been uneven, and, more importantly, that unacceptable regional disparities remain, giving rise to the marginalisation of the less developed regions, should therefore be underlined - and this report does so - in an appeal to the States to support the efforts for regional economic convergence made at European level."
"The report' s authors, who, quite rightly, think it essential to ensure an extremely high degree of consistency between action taken at a European level under the heading of cohesion policy, and Member States' domestic policies that support development, therefore call on the Member States, in accordance with the principles of additionality and subsidiarity, to support this drive for regional economic convergence instigated at European level, by means, for example, of an appropriate investment policy."
"This drive is all the more important given that we must overcome the challenge posed by enlargement."
"Cohesion should, in this regard, be even greater if we want to avoid these disparities between regions dramatically increasing upon enlargement."
"Finally, I will fully support Amendment No 49, which underlines all the possible shortcomings of the 0.45% of Community GDP devoted to cohesion policy, if we want to establish an effective cohesion policy that brings genuine solidarity."
". I voted in favour of this report, but would like to stress some key aspects in relation to fisheries policy."
"The preservation of historical fisheries interests is inextricably linked to economic and social cohesion in fisheries-dependent communities."
"Under the principle of relative stability, the proportions of stocks allotted to given states in given fisheries remain constant."
"When catch opportunities increase or decline in a given fishery, all states with legally recognised stakes in that fishery derive a proportional share of the spoils."
"Relative stability is fundamental to fisheries policy and the maintenance of fish stocks, and should not be undermined."
"Moreover, the importance of the Hague preferences must also be stressed. The Hague preferences recognise the extent to which many coastal communities are fisheries-dependent and offer additional protection."
"The socio-economic role of these arrangements cannot be exaggerated - they must be maintained as not only fundamental to the Common Fisheries Policy but also integral to the basic objectives of cohesion policy."
"Finally the importance of FIFG funding must be emphasised when it comes to fisheries-dependent communities, and in particular with regard to fleet renewal for safety reasons for a sector that operates in a clearly hostile environment."
"(FR) I believe there is a fundamental contradiction between the so-called cohesion policy and the neo-liberal tendencies which dominate in Europe; in fact, widespread competition and privatisation run counter to genuine harmonisation."
"This involves the extension of funds providing the necessary transfers and adjustments, which would, in turn, introduce positive distortions rather than pure market phenomena and the blind quest for profitability."
"These funds could be provided by a unified tax on capital returns."
"The Musotto report recognises this contradiction in its own way, for example by underlining ""the need to adapt competition policy and fiscal policy"" ."
"However, it immediately feels the need to make up for this by singing the praises of a private-public partnership."
"In spite of their tentativeness, the report' s suggestions are sound: it calls for a better assessment of the effects of enlargement and considers the 0.45% of Community GDP devoted to cohesion policy to be a minimum."
"This is why I did not vote against this report, even if it falls far short of the requirements of a genuine policy for solidarity and equality on a European scale."
". The EPLP welcomes the conclusions of the Musotto report on Cohesion."
"However we believe it is premature in the debate to take a fixed position on the future options for designating European Assisted Areas."
"There will continue to be areas of need in the UK post-2006 and we would like the Commission to assess the role that both a safety net mechanism and transitional funding could play in assisting poorer regions of the UK post-2006."
"It is disappointing that the British Conservatives failed, among others, to support this amendment."
"In addition their failure to support a stronger role for local and regional governments in the management of European funding is a blow to democracy and partnership."
". (PT) This report has the merit of making a reasonable diagnosis of the current situation with regard to economic and social cohesion within the European Union."
"We agree, in particular, with the emphasis it gives to the fact that cohesion is, under the terms of the Treaties, one of the pillars of the Community. We also agree with the explicit reference to the delays in fighting asymmetries in development and in standards of living and even to the steps backward being seen in regions of some countries."
"We must also agree with the need the report expresses to provide continuity and to strengthen future regional policy and, therefore, to oppose the possible withdrawal of some regions from Objective 1, for purely statistical reasons."
"Nevertheless, and with regard to the causes of these situations of delay and backsliding, the report does not go as far as we would have liked."
"Furthermore, in terms of the inadequacy of financial resources made available for the objective of cohesion, it omits essential aspects such as the absence of a redistributive aspect to the Community budget and the absolute need for a revision of the financial perspectives, all the more important on the eve of enlargement."
"The report also ignores some crucial factors for the least-developed regions, particularly the harmful effects and, consequently, the need to revise macro-economic, financial and sectoral policies, which often prove to be profoundly inappropriate for these regions."
"One of the greatest achievements of European integration was a result of the decision, in 1975, to bring about the solidarity and cohesion needed to reduce the gap between the economic levels of all the EU States and regions."
"Today, we can say that the way we adapt our Community cohesion policy with a view to enlargement will determine the quality of the Union' s future development."
"The European Parliament has, quite rightly, for a long time supported the idea that an appropriate economic and social cohesion policy cannot be reduced to the level of taking from the rich to give to the poor."
"It is the analysis of genuine needs, magnified by the prospect of enlargement, that should be considered as a priority, and not fixed references to budgets set in the past for different contexts."
"For, as the European Commission points out, enlargement will increase the development differential between the centrally located territories, on the one hand, and the peripheral and outermost regions on the other."
"In this regard, I would call for the outermost regions to continue to be considered a regional and cohesion policy priority, through further advances to be made with the implementation of Article 299(2) of the Treaty."
"Furthermore, we need to adapt competition policy, particularly national regional aid, and tax policy in order to strengthen regional and cohesion policy, with the understanding that the Structural Funds are not sufficient to counterbalance the handicaps and the delays in development accumulated over several decades."
"We also need to prepare for the revision of the common agricultural policy and rural development, in order to better coordinate the urban and rural dimensions of regional development."
"Finally, it would appear urgent to create a European monitoring centre for territorial cohesion."

"Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report (A5-0022/2002)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted for Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou' s report, which concerns women in Mediterranean countries, too."
"In this regard, I would like to call upon all the Members to undertake to ensure that the European Union unilaterally extends the scope of Regulation 1408 on pro rata payment for the period of time a person has worked in the States of the European Union to all the citizens of southern Mediterranean countries, who have worked for many years in Europe and have the right to receive a proportionate pension for the work they have done in Europe, above and beyond the provisions of the relevant conventions."
"Mr President, this report creates a depressing picture of the situation of women in some Mediterranean countries."
"It demonstrates that they are disadvantaged economically, that they are disadvantaged in terms of health and, perhaps most significantly, in terms of education, with the levels of literacy among women in some Mediterranean countries way below that of men."
"It is important that Parliament draws attention to that issue, but that is not sufficient."
"We should also ensure that EU policies are designed to help women improve their standing in some of those countries."
"For example, the MEDA programme so far has no lines particularly dedicated to the education of women, to improving the health care of women."
"We should look at that."
"We should also look at the way our economic relations with some of the Mediterranean countries operate and see if they could be used to enhance the status of women, for example, by supporting women's cooperatives and other activities."
". (FR) At first sight, we could ask ourselves why we need to be particularly concerned about the promotion of women' s rights in Mediterranean countries."
"Equal opportunities policy is the same throughout the European Union."
"We do not for one moment think, for example, that due to the particular circumstances or the mentality of men in Mediterranean Member States, implementing equal opportunities policy, a policy which is now firmly grounded in the Treaty of Amsterdam, would be any more difficult there."
"We would not even call the men from these countries 'macho' ."
"They are certainly no more or less macho than men from Northern States."
"But it is clear that, in Mediterranean countries that are not, or not yet, members of the European Union, the situation of women is more worrying in many regards, and that we need, and this is perfectly legitimate, to devote more attention to trying to remedy incidences of unacceptable discrimination."
"I am therefore in favour of this report, with two reservations."
"I believe that positive actions such as those laid down in paragraph 5b of the resolution and the creation of infrastructure should permit not only women but men as well to combine working and family life."
"Paragraph 14 advocates the possibility of creating a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank."
"Do we really need to create a new bank, when we already have the European Investment Bank, which is quite capable of granting loans within the framework of the Barcelona process?"
"We need to be wary of creating precedents."
"If we create a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank, why not create one for the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, or anywhere else for that matter?"
"(Intervention cut short pursuant to Article 137 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Hermange report (A5-0009/2002)"
"I voted for this report, which is an excellent initiative for creating a coherent, clear and effective policy at Community level on the problem of illiteracy."
"This is a problem that has never received the attention it deserves, probably because until very recently it was taken for granted that the more highly developed countries did not have problems of illiteracy due to their systems of compulsory education."
"It should be noted that the last Community actions specifically concerning this problem were approved in 1987."
"Nevertheless, the OECD report on reading and writing, published in June 2000, clearly shows this not to be the case, in other words, that illiteracy is a reality in our countries, entailing high economic and social costs."
"The OECD defined literacy as ""the reading and writing abilities that adults use in their everyday lives, at work or in the community, to achieve their objectives, to acquire knowledge and to increase their potential"" ."
"This being the case, the existence of illiteracy is a negation of one of the most basic human rights, which is the right to education, and is also a barrier to access to other rights, because it prevents people from improving their standard of living, restricts access to the labour market, limits individuals' freedom of expression and, consequently, their participation in society, and prevents them from enjoying the civic rights to which they are entitled."
"The figures available to us on the scale of this phenomenon at Community level cannot be underestimated, because they affect a considerable percentage of the population of the Union European between 15 and 65 years of age."
"It comes as no surprise, but always with considerable unhappiness, that my country, Portugal, is the worst affected."
"Unless something is done, this problem will only get worse."
"(The President cut the speaker off pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (FR) Whilst recognising the fact that knowing how to read and write is a right for all, the report will be of little help in promoting a policy that can really make a difference in the fight against illiteracy."
"I feel that the references made to teachers and trainers are only useful if we safeguard a genuine recruitment policy in national education, because this is a public service remit."
"There are, in effect, tens of thousands of unfilled teaching posts throughout Europe."
"The recent demonstrations by primary school teachers and parents in the Nantes region against the closure of classes and for the creation of jobs and a limit on class sizes are an illustration of this."
"Finally, it is the damaging effects of liberal policies - unemployment and attacks against public services - that are the cause of an upsurge in illiteracy."
"If we are to combat illiteracy, we must also combat poverty."
"However, as the report does propose a certain number of positive measures such as equal access to fundamental rights for all, non-discrimination and equal opportunities, as well as specific aid to the EU regions most affected by this by this form of social exclusion, I voted for this report."
"Hermange report (A5-0004/2002)"
"The EPLP has voted for the Hermange report on the scoreboard implementing the Social Agenda because there are many positive aspects to this report on the European Social Agenda."
"However, there are several areas of concern where the report calls on the Commission to supply information on how it proposes to act on a number of requirements that are in the Social Agenda but which the EPLP did not support in plenary in 2000."
"In paragraph 14 the EPLP could not support the call for a European right to strike and abstained. The EPLP feels that this is already dealt with by Member State legislation and is also covered in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is a debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Terrorist attacks in India, in particular against the Parliament"
"The next item is a joint debate on the following five motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0053/2002 by Mr Collins on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group,"
"B5-0061/2002 by Mr Mann, Mr Morillon, Dr Tannock, Mr Sacrédeus and Mrs Maij-Weggen on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats,"
"B5-0072/2002 by Mrs Frahm on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left,"
"B5-0081/2000 by Mr Sakellariou and Mr Van den Berg on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists,"
"B5-0089/2002 by Mrs Lynne on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party,"
"on the terrorist attacks in India, in particular against the Parliament."
"Madam President, 13 December 2001 was a black day, not only for relations between India and Pakistan."
"The attack on the Indian parliament by radical Islamic terrorists was an assault on the nerve centre of the world's largest democracy, on a freely-elected representative institution and on a multi-ethnic society."
"The aftermath has seen troops mobilised on a massive scale and weapons systems massed in a threatening manner."
"There is great danger that raids by terrorists will gain them access to these weapons."
"The situation has been made more acute by the attack on the American cultural centre in Calcutta, which is suspected to have been the work of militant Muslim fundamentalists."
"Pakistan has for some years been suspected of affording Islamic extremists a safe haven and giving them logistical and material support."
"This time, though, President Musharraf ordered action to be taken."
"Around 1 500 suspects were interned and some 400 offices belonging to Islamic extremist organisations were closed."
"This is something that gives cause for hope."
"The involvement of President Musharraf, a military leader, in the international anti-terrorist alliance has without a doubt helped bring his country out of isolation."
"His words on television to the effect that he wanted to be consistent in fighting terrorism, must, though, be matched by actions."
"It is much to be desired that those Taliban fighters who have gone to ground in Pakistan should be unmasked and arrested."
"The radical Islamic religious schools, which are an intellectual breeding ground for the Taliban, must undergo organisational restructuring and the reform of the content of their curricula."
"What is most important, though, is to investigate the causes of the sympathy for the Taliban and of the continuing adulation of them as freedom fighters over wide areas of the country."
"There is a need for intensive intellectual engagement here, which requires that state education be made a priority."
"People whose good education at school has gained them self-confidence and the capacity for critical judgement will also be in a position to resist all kinds of dictatorship and all forms of manipulation."
"Pakistan must come to accept the idea of religious freedom for minorities."
"This has been brought to our minds by, among other things, the most recent massacre during a service in a Christian church."
"The Islamic terrorists responsible for it have still not yet been caught."
"Anti-Christian discrimination - including at the hands of the public authorities - must become a thing of the past, as must the persecution of other religions."
"India has demanded that Pakistan expose and extradite the ringleaders behind the attack on the Indian parliament, and it is quite right to do so."
"Actually doing this, though, will require a great deal of patience."
"The Indian rocket tests are ineffectual as a means of exerting pressure and constitute a provocation with counter-productive effects."
"The Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats calls on both parties in the conflict to bring all diplomatic means to bear on this crisis situation."
"We must see to it that military force is renounced."
"It is a matter of concern for me as vice-chairman of the delegation to the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation that Pakistan should finally ratify and implement the SAARC Convention on Suppression of Terrorism."
"Overall, the path mapped out by the Lahore and Simla Agreements must be followed."
"The European Union is very well able to play the role of a respected mediator, which surely all the parties want."
"Our balanced policy has earned us a great deal of trust over the years."
"Both these States and the security needs of South-East Asia as a whole are deserving of our commitment."
"Mr President, recently, at the beginning of last month, we faced the unforeseen possibility of a heated exchange between India and Pakistan."
"Luckily, this exchange was avoided thanks to the sense of responsibility demonstrated by both sides."
"In other words, following the heated clash and the circumstances in which it took place, and rightly so, with the terrorists in Afghanistan, there was a risk of yet more unfortunate developments between two large countries with nuclear capabilities."
"However, this does not mean that the problem has been resolved."
"In this sense, the purpose of our debate here today is to remind both countries, both India and Pakistan, of their responsibilities towards their people and the neighbouring region."
"At the same time, however, we too need to assume our responsibility, as the European Union, to help find a peaceful solution to all the differences in the area, to respect for international law and human rights and to anything and everything relating to the Rule of Law and human rights."
"However, this endeavour should not lead us to overlook the fact that Pakistan does indeed have a serious human rights problem, serious problems with democratic issues and serious problems with religious minorities."
"These problems are not being raised here in order to accuse Pakistan or in a gesture of friendship towards India."
"On the contrary."
"They are being raised as urgent priorities which both countries need to address, for their own good, for the good of the area and for the sake of peace in the area."
"Both countries are responsible for the stability of the area."
"And both countries are responsible for future developments, so that these areas can stop being areas of poverty, misery and conflict."
"In this sense, I believe that today's resolution and unanimous support for it from all sides of the House will make both a symbolic and a substantial contribution."
"Madam President, let me say from the outset that I condemn terrorism wherever it takes place."
"But I condemn in particular the attacks on the Indian Parliament and the US cultural centre."
"There is no justification for terrorism, whatever the perceived provocation."
"But we have to look at the root causes of terrorism."
"That is why I am delighted that we have widened this resolution, even though we were unable to change the title;"
"I would not like us to think that we are linking any country or organisation with these attacks."
"We still have no real knowledge of who perpetrated them so I am very pleased that the Indian government is investigating it and that Pakistan is helping with that investigation."
"It gives me the opportunity to address the wider problem: the threat of war again between India and Pakistan."
"I welcome President Musharraf's announcement that he is clamping down on terrorism, but it is also important to look at the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir, which has been going on for over 50 years."
"I repeat the call for the EU to offer its services as a facilitator to both sides and to take account of the relevant UN resolutions."
"What I am proposing is something similar to what Senator Mitchell did in Northern Ireland."
"The people who continue to suffer are the ordinary people and civilians of India, Pakistan and Kashmir."
"People who say a facilitator provided by the EU, the Commonwealth or the UN is no way forward are not offering any alternative."
"We have to find an alternative to the bloodshed and to the continuation of this dispute."
"I hope we will vote for the resolution, to demonstrate not only our horror of terrorism but also the desire to find a solution to the tension within this region."
"Madam President, on 13 December last year an appalling and vicious attack occurred on the parliament of the Indian Union in Delhi, which is their most visible symbol of democracy and secular nationhood."
"Let us not underestimate the danger this posed as, had it succeeded in killing the assembled government ministers and opposition leaders, it could have heralded a war between India and Pakistan, both nuclear powers with massive conventional land forces as well - although India has at least declared a policy of no first use of its nuclear arsenal, unlike Pakistan."
"The responsibility was soon traced to militant Islamic terrorist groups based in Pakistan, with full support and training from the Pakistani government, and also responsible for the earlier attacks in Srinagar against the Kashmiri State Assembly."
"This is in clear violation of Security Council Resolution 1373 forbidding states from sponsoring terrorism against other states."
"Nevertheless, I welcome President Musharraf's change of heart in backing the United States in their war on terrorism which toppled the Taliban regime and destroyed the al-Qa'ida network in Afghanistan, even though this regime was largely a creation of Pakistan's interservice intelligence agency; in particular, his speech of 13 January promising reforms of the madrassas, or religious schools, which fomented so much hatred of the west and bred an atmosphere conducive to the massacre of Christians peacefully at worship last year."
"This is a promising start, but Pakistan has yet to accede to the request to extradite the 20 ringleaders of the plot."
"There are deep concerns that the kidnapping of Wall Street journalist Daniel Pearl may have involved renegade pro-Taliban members of the Pakistani security forces."
"There is now also some evidence from e-mails that the controller of the shoe-bomber Richard Reid, from my country alas, may have been based in Pakistan."
"I call, therefore, on Pakistan to ratify the SAARC and all UN conventions on terrorism and I congratulate India on its restraint in the face of provocation and on its joint declaration with the EU in November last year against terrorism."
"During the Afghan war in the 1980s we in the west supported Islamic militant ideology in order to oppose the spread of communism."
"America, alas, paid the price on 11 September."
"Will the west again repeat this mistake?"
"Madam President, I should like to express the Socialist Group's deep concern about the growing phenomenon of fundamentalist terrorism, not only in India but all around the world."
"I express our concern about the threat this poses to democratic societies and reaffirm that acts of terrorism anywhere in the world threaten peace and stability, but no more so than in India and Pakistan at the moment."
"Both of these possess nuclear weapons and one of them at least has not disavowed first use of those weapons."
"We support India's demands for Pakistan to contribute to a full investigation into the attacks on the Kashmiri State Assembly and the Indian Parliament."
"But we urge both sides to do all they can to avoid slipping into the prospect of war."
"That will require willingness and leadership on behalf of both India and Pakistan, and President Musharraf in particular."
"The only way forward is through negotiations."
"We hope that India and Pakistan, with the support of the European Parliament, can take that road rather than the much more dangerous road for themselves and the rest of the world."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we have had a close shave, particularly because a first text was distributed, signed by both Mrs Lynne and Mr Elles, which was truly unacceptable."
"The work - particularly work that has been done through the night over the last few days - has significantly enhanced the text and has resulted in a document which, although still not perfect, is acceptable."
"We must bear in mind the title of and the reason for this resolution, namely the terrorist attacks in India."
"Therefore, the resolution is, first and foremost, an expression of solidarity with the victims of these attacks."
"Dr Tannock outlined to us the disastrous effects that this attack could have had on the whole of the ruling class in India."
"I think that the resolution underestimates them, just as we, I believe, are to a certain extent overestimating the effect of what are still, at this stage, only statements made by President Musharraf."
"As Dr Tannock quite rightly pointed out, not all the madrassas, or religious schools, have as yet been closed down, and it is therefore vital that we maintain a firm approach towards Pakistan."
"Furthermore, I would also say to Mr Souladakis that, in this case, balance is no real guarantee of democracy."
"We are forgetting that India is a democracy and has been one for over 50 years."
"Democracy is and must continue to be a reference point for Parliament. India is a developing country, which for more than 50 years has continued to strengthen its democracy with the population as it stands."
"There is almost no other situation like this in the world."
"There is China - India' s great neighbour, a great market, an Eldorado for many of our fellow Members."
"And then, there is this great country that we all too often forget, where the Commission has made a fair amount of progress over the last two to three years."
"The first EU-India summit has been held, and has been followed by a second one, but this is really not enough."
"By virtue of its system of government and of its will to forge ahead with its development whilst respecting democratic values, India should serve as a point of reference for our cooperation policy with all the countries of the world."
"India' s difficulties are infinitely greater than those of many other countries, in which we continue to tolerate a dictatorial regime, fundamentalism and other similar scourges."
"I would therefore like to thank the Members who worked late into the night to transform the basic text and to make this into a document that supports India."
"I think that we could have gone further in our support and that we must continue to exercise extreme caution where Pakistan is concerned, because Pakistan has, on many occasions, indicated its good intentions, but it is still not going far enough."
"Madam President, I should like first of all to congratulate Mrs Cederschiöld on becoming the first Swedish Vice-President of the European Parliament."
"I want to say how delighted I am at her election."
"What happened on 13 December of last year in the Indian Parliament was unprecedented. The Parliament of a democratic, pluralistic country was attacked by militant Islamicist groups."
"Parliament - the very heart of democracy - was exposed to a brutal assault."
"People were murdered."
"Democracy as a whole was called into question by these militant Islamicists."
"It is important that we ourselves should try to understand emotionally what happened in New Delhi on that day."
"Imagine if our own Parliament here in Strasbourg or our national parliaments - in my case, the riksdag in Stockholm - were to be exposed to a terrorist attack."
"We should react in the most vigorous way."
"It is perhaps difficult for us, as Europeans, properly to understand the real seriousness of what happened."
"I want to address Commissioner Diamantopoulou and mention something about the Islamic religious schools, or madrassas as they are called, in Pakistan."
"I believe that the Commissioner and the European Union have an incredibly important task when it comes to promoting a form of education in these schools that is based upon the ideas of love and of love of one' s neighbour and does not see other religions or other political outlooks with the eyes of hatred, for it is in these madrassas and other Islamicist contexts that hatred is disseminated."
"Dear friends, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan has fallen, but the Taliban regime' s mentality of hatred and violence, of calling other people 'infidels' and seeing them as inferiors, is a frame of mind that still exists."
"I would call upon Mrs Diamantopoulou to do everything she can to ensure that it is tolerance and the ideas of love and love of one' s neighbour that come to characterise education in Pakistan and, of course, in schools in the Middle East too."
"Religion should be all about ennobling the soul, promoting lofty ethics and morality and giving people spiritual values - not about serving the causes of violence and hatred."
"Pakistan operated as a training ground for the Al-Qa' ida terrorists."
"It was one of three countries in the world that recognised the Taliban regime."
"Afghanistan' s Taliban ambassador to Pakistan was allowed to remain there following the attack on the United States on 11 September."
"Pakistan has a very great deal to put in order."
"What President Musharraf has said is important."
"We are now waiting for him to take vigorous action."
"Thank you for your kind words regarding the election of a Swedish Vice-President."
"Her election has meant a lot to us Swedes."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate you and wish you every success in office."
"This resolution by Parliament is to be welcomed with satisfaction."
"The Members of the House have stressed that what happened was an exceptionally serious terrorist attack against the supreme institution of greater global democracy."
"The European Union has unanimously expressed its outrage at this event."
"The Council has made a number of statements condemning these incidents and expressing the solidarity of the European Union with the Republic of India."
"The Council and the Commission have also stressed repeatedly that Pakistan must continue and expand its anti-terrorist policy."
"India is asking for Pakistan to take specific action to demonstrate that it is determined to stamp out all forms of terrorism, a perfectly legitimate request."
"Following the attack on 13 December, we have witnessed an unprecedented influx of troops along the border between the two countries and the increased tension and military clashes are causing concern."
"We therefore welcome the announcement by the President of Pakistan, General Musharraf, on 12 January, announcing drastic measures to combat terrorism and religious fanaticism."
"It is a step in the right direction and will help to defuse the tension between India and Pakistan."
"The Commission will continue to draw both sides' attention to the need to cooperate rather than take the military option."
"Next week, when the European Union and India meet at ministerial level on 14 February, the troika's message will be twofold."
"First it will assure India that it has its full support in combating terrorism, as agreed in the declaration against terrorism at the second summit, and secondly, it will encourage both sides to return to the negotiating table as quickly as possible and to start withdrawing their troops."
"Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"Humanitarian aid for Goma"
"The next item is a joint debate on the following five motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0058/2002 by Mrs Maes, Mr Rod and Mr Lannoye on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance,"
"B5-0065/2002 by Mr Van Hecke and Mrs Maij-Weggen on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats,"
"B5-0073/2002 by Mr Sylla, Mr Miranda, Mr Sjöstedt and Mr Koulourianos on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left,"
"B5-0082/2002 by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco and Mr Van den Berg on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists,"
"B5-0090/2002 by Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte and Mrs Dybkjær on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party,"
"on humanitarian aid for Goma."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it never rains but it pours, but this especially applies to the distressed population in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
"Not only have they suffered under conditions of war for years, resulting in numerous refugees, and occupation by neighbouring Rwanda, their plight has now also been compounded by volcanic eruptions."
"Recent tragic reports confirm the miserable situation the population is in."
"The short dry season has started and a blanket of heat has descended on the country."
"There is toxic dust, and toxic vapours are emerging from the lava."
"The population has no firewood and uses the heat of this lava stream for their cooking fires."
"You understand that this is a miserable situation involving a city which - at least in part - is reminiscent of Hiroshima in terms of destruction."
"The section of the city that was not affected by the eruption lives its normal life, insofar as this is possible under these circumstances and under the occupation."
"This means, therefore, that it is very difficult to distinguish the real victims from the others, and it is currently hard to tell who is suffering the most."
"This is a report which I have also found confirmed in a recent communication by the Bishops' Conference which complains about the fact that the rations supplied are, in fact, insufficient, while the food supply is adequate; that a large section of the city has been razed to the ground but that it is hard to tell who are, in fact, the people who have really been hit."
"Surveys have been carried out, but the results of these are yet to be confirmed."
"Fortunately, a stream of international aid has been set in motion, and the European Union has played a prominent role in this."
"I feared that, in my speech here, I would have to pass on a few complaints, for they are obviously brought to my attention."
"For example, I hear that all aid has to go via Kigali, and that the situation is being taken advantage of there."
"On the other hand, I have been told that Kigali airport is the most convenient in terms of freight handling, and that aid is no longer being hindered at the moment."
"I know that aid has been supplied by the Democratic Republic of Congo to Bukavu and that it has to leave from there. However, that aid is labelled as aid from the Congolese population, and the occupying forces therefore do not allow the goods to be distributed."
"I therefore want to put your minds at rest in a way, but the measures announced by the European Parliament are absolutely vital."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would actually like just to further underline Mrs Maes' impressive description of the sufferings of the population, but I also wish to address a few other aspects, which perhaps have rather more to do with organisation and also with the political environment."
"Organisational matters first: we hope that ECHO, the European Union with its aid, will no longer be hindered by anybody and will be able to get aid to the spot as quickly as possible."
"We also hope that this applies not only to the city of Goma, but also to the area surrounding it, including Bukavu, where there are also refugees, and Rwanda and Burundi too, where refugees are also scattered."
"We must give this aid, and quickly, to all those persons affected."
"That is my first point."
"The second point is that this again throws the spotlight on the weakness of the organised state and on its absence in the Congo."
"The peace process needs to be firmly supported as soon as possible."
"We have to help the various parties to see reason as soon as possible in order to facilitate reconstruction in the Congo, so that administrative, and also democratic, structures may be restored and so that this great country's descent into chaos may be halted."
"A great task is before us, and the exemplary aid we are currently able to provide is perhaps an incentive for the various participants in the conflict to listen to the European Community and avail themselves of our mediation."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I of course agree wholeheartedly with my two fellow Members."
"As you know, the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano in Goma, in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, is believed to be the most serious in central Africa for 25 years."
"I would firstly like to pay tribute to the people - numbering between 300 000 and 500 000 - who initially fled Goma, but who are now returning because they are committed to their hometown."
"We must bear in mind that this is a humanitarian and ecological disaster, which has occurred at a time when 80% of the farm workers had finished sowing their wheat and corn."
"We must bear in mind that it is the most fertile agricultural land that has been buried beneath lava, which has flattened houses and destroyed public buildings, particularly those housing NGOs."
"What is more, this tragedy has happened in a climate - as the previous speakers said - of violence and conflict in the Great Lakes region."
"As well as this tragedy, I think that we must now fear, because of the lack of clean drinking water, a spate of epidemics, cholera and dysentery in particular."
"We already know what this type of epidemic can lead to, particularly after the so-called 'tropical' genocide in which 50 000 people were killed in the same region of Goma."
"There has even been an explosion - we have seen pictures of it - in a petrol station."
"We have seen people looting and others leaving with jerry cans on their heads, going in search of petrol."
"I think that all this is also contributing to the climate of insecurity, which we must tackle."
"Although we can now welcome the fact that, as Mrs Maes said, the European Union has been quick to play a very active role on the ground, and that humanitarian aid has finally reached Goma, certain questions have, nevertheless, been raised and I think that we must try, along with the Commissioner, to provide an answer."
"First of all, in 1977, the same volcano began to erupt."
"It is deeply regrettable that houses were rebuilt on a volcano, whose embers were still so active."
"This was one of the questions raised in Goma, but I am raising it here because of all the other similar situations throughout the world."
"Houses are rebuilt in areas where similar disasters have already happened."
"Furthermore, I think that this tragedy must encourage everyone to respect the requirements drawn up for the 'ten-year action against natural risks' and that the European Union must play a greater role in this."
"Finally, we must seize this opportunity to compel all political forces, and particularly those that are at conflict, to guarantee that help is provided to displaced people and refugees."
"The Commission and the Member States must play a more active part in the international ten-year action that I mentioned."
"Lastly, since cooperation between the European Union and the Democratic Republic of Congo is now being resumed, I think that we must push our partners to bring an end to conflict and to establish a fair and lasting peace."
"I think that, at the very least, these conditions are necessary if we want to stop the same conflict from happening again."
"We must bear in mind - and this is my final point - that other disasters can happen; we know, for example, that Lake Kivu contains huge methane resources and that the lava which is flowing into these waters risks is causing many other problems as well."
"I thank the European Union for having taken swift action, but I would like to stress that we must step up our work and, through this, we can establish a fair and lasting peace."
"Madam President, the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano has demonstrated two realities which present a challenge to the whole international community in general and, specifically, for the European Union as well as the countries of the region."
"The first reality is the extreme poverty in which thousands of people live, not only in this eastern region, but in the whole of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a poverty which is aggravated all the more by the war which has been devastating that country since 1996."
"Figures have been presented: it has been said that more than 300 000 people need assistance, that 30% of the population is homeless and that 12 000 homes need to be rebuilt."
"In this respect, the resolution we have approved this week, which establishes links between emergency aid, rehabilitation and the development policy, has been very timely."
"The second reality is the hatred which has been brewing up between the people of the east and the neighbouring population of Rwanda, a hatred which has been demonstrated by the rejection by the people of Goma of the hospitality offered by Rwanda and the massive return of this population to their homes, which have now been taken over by the volcano, despite the risk of further eruptions."
"These two realities should lead us to come up with a European Union strategy and action which involves us in this region."
"It is clear that a good reconstruction policy is required for Goma, as well as a policy on forecasting possible new eruptions and control of the Nyiragongo Volcano."
"Nevertheless, none of this strategy will achieve effective results unless the foundations for a democratic system in the country are consolidated, as well as a broad social consensus which guarantees stability and peace."
"But that will be of no use unless there is confidence in that stability throughout the region."
"It is therefore important that this inter-Congo dialogue which is restarting in South Africa in Sun City puts an end to this conflict."
"We also believe it is important to organise a regional conference which reconciles the countries of the Great Lakes region and brings back the confidence which has been lost to its various peoples."
"The resolution we are presenting is a collection of desires, principles and strategies which we wish to see applied in order to deal with the eruption of the Nyiragongo Volcano, without losing sight of what was said previously."
"We support the global plan for 2000 managed by ECO and we ask that this plan, which is very important for the African region, and for the achievement of the objectives previously expressed, be speeded up and that this aid does not arrive late, which has unfortunately often been the case."
"I should like firstly to respond to Mrs Maes' comment by referring to an ancient Greek saying: ""Åíüò êáêïý ìýñéá Ýðïíôáé""."
"That roughly means ""one bad thing can easily lead to many others""."
"I am afraid this is the case in Congo."
"The Goma office of the Commission's Humanitarian Aid Office was directly in the path of the lava flow."
"But a four-man team of ECHO experts, including disaster response and water specialists, was on the ground to assess needs within 36 hours of the eruption."
"ECHO Flight, the Commission's humanitarian air service based in Nairobi, has been made available, bringing in the United Nations Disaster Assessment Team, volcano experts and other key personnel."
"Joint assessments conducted by ECHO and the agencies on the ground resulted in the announcement of an emergency decision on Sunday, 20 January."
"EUR five million is covering the immediate needs of 100,000 people."
"That is about one-third of the affected population."
"Operations are focusing on four main areas: water and health, shelter and non-food items, food, and coordination and logistics."
"The head of ECHO's Africa Unit visited the region from 30 January to 1 February."
"The mission confirmed that urgent needs were being met and that effective coordination was in place."
"What are our next steps?"
"First, the immediate emergency is now being managed by the agencies and resources already available."
"Further in-kind donations and the introduction of new agencies should be coordinated with the agencies already on the ground, to avoid potential duplication."
"After careful appraisal of the options, efforts should now begin to focus on balanced, medium-term assistance with resettlement of the homeless and the rehabilitation of essential social infrastructure."
"Finally, concerning Mr Sylla's main point, the high media profile of this disaster should not distract our attention from the scale of the humanitarian crisis caused by five years' conflict in Congo, already ECHO's biggest customer - EUR 32 million in 2002."
"The Commission would stress the need for an early and peaceful solution to the conflict through the implementation of the Lusaka Agreements and the Inter-Congolese Dialogue."
"Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."

"on Eritrea."
"Guantanamo Bay"
"Madam President, Commissioner, what has been going on in Guantanamo Bay?"
"That section of the European intelligentsia whose approach is still marked by naïve optimism and which still believes that, after 11 September, we can respond to violence without using violence and to war without using weapons, has spoken out about the conditions in which al-Qa' ida fighters, captured in Afghanistan, were transported to Guantanamo Bay."
"Let us try to imagine what would happen if, in the light of the tragic experience of the revolt in Mazar-i-Sharif, the Americans had not taken all the necessary precautions to enable these fanatical fighters to be safely transported; fighters who, for years, have been trained to seek martyrdom by carrying out acts of the most mindless violence."
"Had they not been treated in this way and had they simply been collectively transported by aircraft, they would have become unbalanced and uncontrollable."
"What is going on now in Guantanamo Bay?"
"All eyewitness reports testify that the prisoners are being treated well and that the injured are receiving all the care needed for their recovery."
"So, why is this urgent resolution now being tabled, given the wave of solidarity that Parliament voiced unanimously after the attacks? The only possible reason is so that we can, in the name of fine principles and grand sentiments, distance ourselves from the war that the Americans are continuing to wage against international terrorism."
"No, ladies and gentlemen, this war cannot be waged by applying international conventions, which were approved at a time when we needed to protect fighters engaging in traditional battles, and when civilians were not an automatic target, as they are now."
"The war waged by terrorists against defenceless people renders all the Geneva Conventions null and void."
"The essence of the war against terrorism resides, first and foremost, in collecting information, the aim being to prevent further attacks by infiltrating groups in order to destroy networks which, as we all know, still exist on our territory and in the United States."
"This is what the Americans are trying to do at Guantanamo Bay."
"We can only congratulate them on their efforts."
"That is why our group will not be associated with the joint resolution tabled by other groups, but we will table our own resolution, which, in essence, calls for a revision of international law so that we can adapt to the conditions of the new era that began in New York and Washington on 11 September 2001."
"Madam President, military manoeuvres and Guantanamo analyses aside, mankind is on trial now, as are our willingness and ability to sustain a world in which the rules of law agreed a priori will prevail, because only then will we retain the moral and political right to judge everyone else who is indifferent to or tramples international rules of law underfoot, be they terrorists, the Taliban, anyone at all."
"The European Parliament cannot demand any less than what is being demanded by various legitimate voices in the United States, at the UN and even in the European Union."
"By Mr Powell himself, by Mr Robinson, even down to Mr Solana."
"The world cannot be governed by the law of the Far West, including Texas, or by the customs and habits of the town of Leeds."
"Those with the fastest guns and the slowest reflexes to ideals and institutions cannot take the law into their own hands."
"Because otherwise we shall end up, Madam President, with a world in which what we see is tragedy rather than cinema."
"Ladies and gentlemen, and I appeal here also to my fellow Members on the other side of the House, when we rally against the death penalty, we are not defending the wretched crimes of some murderer or rapist."
"We are defending ourselves, our perceptions and our culture."
"It is for the same reasons that we are calling for the prisoners at Guantanamo to be treated as required under current international law or even American law, which cannot of course be limited to members of the Taliban who are American nationals."
"This sort of discrimination is unacceptable even in the jungle."
"Madam President, this resolution seeks to emphasise the essential point that the fight against terrorism, which will be long and hard, must be conducted as far as is possible in compliance with international law and the Rule of Law."
"This call comes both from United States society and this House itself, which I hope will adopt the resolution."
"With regard to the al-Qa' ida fighters held at Guantanamo Bay who were taken prisoner in Afghanistan, there are two problems."
"The first is that of their detention, in that there are disturbing International Red Cross reports on the conditions in which they are being held."
"The second is the legal status of the detainees: there is some uncertainty regarding this but the fact that John Walker, an American citizen, is being tried by a civil court while the other detainees are being tried by a secret military tribunal is there for all to see."
"This is unacceptable."
"General Morillon may well be right when he says that the Geneva treaties need to be updated, in that the Convention provides for the status of prisoner of war but, where such status is uncertain, provision needs to be made for the existence of prisoners of an undeclared war, for there is no reason why they should have fewer guarantees or receive less care in terms of respect for human rights as far as detention conditions are concerned."
"The resolution also makes the important request that the United Nations Security Council set up a court responsible for Afghanistan, so that both the issue of the legal status of the prisoners and that of the detention conditions can be addressed."
"In endorsing this request, we will be taking a very sensible step which will also help to advance the fight against terrorism."
"Madam President, we have all seen the pictures from the base at Guantanamo Bay of the prisoners with their orange-coloured overalls."
"The issue of how they are being treated has given rise to international concern."
"We have protested in the European Parliament, and we are not alone in having protested."
"Most countries - except, for once, Cuba where the base is situated - have in actual fact protested."
"The fact that there have been no protests in Cuba may possibly be due to the fact that the Cubans are pleased that the focus has been shifted from the way in which they themselves treat their prisoners there, but that is not perhaps a subject for discussion right now."
"There is some confusion about the legal status of the prisoners at the base at Guantanamo Bay, and this issue needs to be clarified by a competent court."
"Such a court could be set up by a UN Security Council resolution."
"Irrespective of what crimes and evil acts the prisoners at Camp X-Ray may have committed - and which we would vigorously condemn - the prisoners must be treated in accordance with international and humanitarian standards and principles."
"Until such time as their legal status has been established, they must be regarded as prisoners of war."
"The chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, Graham Watson, said yesterday in the House that we are actually in favour of a review of the Geneva Convention."
"It would be good if newer and more modern rules could be established that could be applied to prisoners and to acts of terrorism in situations in which, as Mr Napolitano said, there has been no declaration of war."
"It would be good if the whole Parliament could support this."
"This Parliament supports the United States and the international fight against terrorism."
"We have shown this very clearly through our vote earlier today."
"When democracies engage in such a fight, they must however show respect for human rights and legal principles."
"I therefore share the concern expressed by my fellow MEPs where the military courts are concerned."
"It is unacceptable that just one Taliban - an American Taliban, John Walker - should be brought to trial before a civil court when others are to be tried before military courts."
"We require that there be common rules and that everyone be treated in the same way and be given ordinary legal rights and legal protection in civil courts."
"It should nonetheless have been possible to avoid a large part of this debate if the United States had ratified the protocol concerning the International Criminal Court so that there had been a permanent court in which people who had committed acts of this kind could also be brought to trial in accordance with international rules."
"I would really urge the United States to ratify that protocol."
"Madam President, Parliament must deplore in no uncertain terms President Bush's military order permitting the secret trial of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay by a military commission, which may adopt its own rules of evidence, judge and pass sentence."
"This is outside American jurisdiction."
"As has been pointed out by other speakers, the only American al-Qa'ida member so far captured is to be tried in a court in Virginia with full legal representation!"
"This military order breaches all provisions for a fair trial as guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the US is a party, such as the presumption of innocence, choice of counsel, impartial and timely hearing, and the right of appeal to a higher court."
"The US Government has introduced a category of unlawful combatants, an unknown term in international law, while refusing to grant the suspected al-Qa'ida fighters and Taliban troops captured in Afghanistan the status of prisoners of war."
"These concerns have been highlighted by renowned lawyers throughout the world, who contest the legitimacy of forcibly taking those now detained in Cuba out of Afghanistan without any extradition order, as well as their status as combatants, and calls for them to be treated as ordinary criminal suspects with all associated rights."
"We must also take into account the fact that some of these people, who are merely suspected of being al-Qa'ida supporters, have been deported from Bosnia to Guantanamo Bay."
"The reports of ill-treatment of prisoners is absolutely shocking."
"Nobody can deny what we have seen for ourselves on television, including reports that they have been shackled, hooded, sedated during transfer and their beards forcibly shaved."
"This sensory deprivation is something that was criticised in Ireland in the past in relation to prisoners in Northern Ireland - even by our own government."
"Yet everyone is turning a blind eye to what is happening in Guantanamo Bay."
"We have to speak out in the interests of international justice, respect for human rights and respect for the Rule of Law."
"America should abide by those international covenants as well."
"Parliament would do very well to speak out and send a very clear message that we do not agree with the policy they have adopted."
"Madam President, I fully support the USA in its handling of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay."
"It is fully in the interests of Europe's citizens that the American security forces be allowed to interrogate these suspects."
"This would not be permissible were they classified as prisoners of war under the 1949 Geneva Convention, since POWs are only obliged to divulge their name, rank and number, whereas unlawful combatants - their correct classification, in my view, according to the provisions of Article 4(2) of the Geneva Convention - can be interrogated."
"I have to say to speakers on the other side of the House that a declaration or non-declaration of war is an irrelevancy under the Geneva Conventions."
"The US needs to interrogate these individuals as it is an essential part of the worldwide struggle against terrorism."
"The decision by the US to classify them in this way is, therefore, not vindictive but practical and necessary, but it exposes the inadequacy of the anachronistic international jurisprudence in this area."
"Furthermore, it is my belief that many of these individuals are so dangerous that they would not have hesitated to attack their own guards."
"If they became aware that one of their fellow detainees was likely to crack under interrogation, they would have made efforts to kill him as well."
"The only possible alternative - beyond the physical restraints which were placed upon them, both in transit, when they might well have bitten their way through the avionic cables in order to down the planes, and on land - would be the use of high doses of intramuscular tranquillisers which, although effective, would have carried significant risks to the detainees and would have required medical and nursing personnel to accompany them."
"There is no evidence that the Americans are treating them cruelly or inhumanely, and we should support them rather than engage in speculative and ill-informed criticism."
"My concern is twofold: firstly, as regards what will America do with those it does not file charges against who, if returned to their own countries of origin, may face torture and death for reasons of unrelated Islamic militancy; and secondly, with regard to paragraph 5 of the resolution, which suggests a role for the international criminal court, which has yet to get off the ground?"
"Unfortunately, as well-intentioned as this may be, my understanding is that certainly domestic terrorists, rightly or wrongly, are excluded from the Rome Statute provisions, but it may be that international terrorists could fall under its remit."
"This is not clear at present."
"I have a number of additional concerns about the ICC, such as command responsibility, which blames military commanders even if they had no knowledge of the crimes committed, and also the fact that amnesties and peace and reconciliation processes would become more difficult to achieve between belligerents."
"Nevertheless, this whole area of jurisprudence ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, regardless of their situation, today millions of people have seen in the media the degrading conditions in which the prisoners have been transported and have seen on television the humiliating conditions they have been subjected to inside and outside the sadly famous cages."
"It is not simply a question of condemning the attitude of the United States authorities, but also of rejecting the shameful comments made in the initial days by the base' s military commanders."
"Some of them, in very bad taste, showed disdain and racism towards the prisoners."
"A superpower which is not just a military, but also a civil, power should, in my opinion, set a proper example of respect for human rights, even if two twin towers had been destroyed for each of the 50 states of the Union."
"Whatever happens, they should always show full respect for human rights."
"Nevertheless, I hope that 11 September has not numbed American public opinion so much that it has become blinded and cannot react in a decent a dignified fashion within the United States itself."
"In any event, many Europeans are prepared to remain vigilant, to remember that it is essential to maintain our values and principles in this war which we must wage against terrorism and fanaticism."
"Or are we going to be prepared to renounce the values we claim to defend at this point in European construction?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time that those who consider themselves the guardians of western culture, those who give the rest of the world lessons in democracy have proven to be the guardians of barbarianism."
"We see them imposing embargos on Iraq, where they have killed thousands of children."
"We saw them in Yugoslavia, together with their friends on this side of the Atlantic, killing civilians, flattening infrastructures and destroying the environment."
"Barbarianism is a fundamental aspect of imperialism."
"Mistreating any person is a crime."
"Mistreating prisoners of war is an even more serious violation of international law."
"And let there be an end to the discussion as to whether or not the detainees in Guantanamo are prisoners of war."
"If the Americans were waging war on Afghanistan, then they are prisoners of war."
"If the Americans were not waging war on Afghanistan, then the detainees have simply been kidnapped."
"And they have been transferred to occupied territory on the island of Cuba on purpose, as a serious provocation to the heroic people of Cuba."
"The Americans are making no secret of what they are up to with the backing of their friends, and unfortunately some of their friends are here in this Chamber."
"They want the whole world to know what is in store for anyone who falls into their hands."
"But, ladies and gentlemen, however terrible their barbarianism, it will not stop the march of history."
"The people will see to that."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of Gerardo Galeote, signatory, together with General Morillon, of the PPE resolution on this issue."
"I have arrived late for this debate, but I have had time to listen to some speeches and I believe we should return to the basic issues."
"I believe there are three basic issues: firstly, terrorism is the great threat to the Rule of Law and to open and democratic societies today; secondly, the United States and Europe share the same vision, the same social organisation and, of course, the idea that respect for human rights is the very cement of our organisation."
"Thirdly, we must clearly state that, if the European Union flies any flag, it is the flag of respect for human rights."
"On this basis, we clearly can and must raise our voices and, rather than ask, say, because asking would mean believing that the prisoners in the Guantánamo base are not being treated in accordance with humanitarian principles and the truth is that all the indications suggest that they are."
"I am not going to enter into the argument about whether or not the Geneva Convention applies to them."
"We in the European Union must say that, in the case of any doubt, the principles of the Geneva Convention must be applied, but that the Geneva Convention itself lays down a legal basis to resolve all those issues which may endanger the security of the organisation or the prisoners themselves, while a judicial tribunal establishes whether they have the right to protection under the Geneva Convention or not."
"So far, Mr President, I have the impression that they are being treated absolutely correctly and that therefore this debate is unfocused."
"This has probably been an error in terms of European public opinion - if not in terms of American public opinion -, a public relations error, because the truth is that it has been the United States itself that has published these photos which so offend our sensibilities."
"We must clearly continue, and we will continue, to be vigilant, but always on the basis of the idea that we are fighting this war together."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is it that differentiates a Taliban-style regime from a democracy?"
"I believe it to be, above all, respect for constitutional legality."
"Whatever the temptations to deviate from the path of constitutional legality, the fight against terrorism can only be carried on if the Rule of Law and also, above all, international agreements are respected."
"The USA, then, should not even give the impression that that it does not regard international agreements, the Geneva Convention, and so on, as binding when it comes to the treatment of terrorist suspects."
"That is also the reason for our resolution."
"Let me take this opportunity to say something else."
"The lady who spoke before me said that Europe and the USA have the same vision."
"That is, unfortunately, not entirely true, as the fight against terrorism in which the Americans are currently engaged is not, from our point of view, a very effective one, although it is a fight against terrorism which, as such, we all support."
"I might just say that the Americans had a highly ambivalent, not to say, sometimes even tolerant, attitude towards terrorism when it suited them, but, following those first fearful seconds on 11 September, they have, unfortunately, again left the path of multilateralism and of the quest for allies."
"I do not want to defend any of the regimes of North Korea, Iran and Iraq, which differ greatly from each other."
"Yet this simplistic way of lumping all these regimes together and making them out to be an axis of evil in fact demonstrates that the US government, despite Secretary of State Powell's very honourable attitude, is unfortunately taking an approach that does not effectively combat terrorism."
"We know, for example, that there are several groups in Iran that are not very keen on going down the same road as President Khatami, his foreign minister, and his government."
"We are also aware, though, that there are powerful forces in Iran in favour of going down this road, and I therefore believe that, no matter how unequivocal the fight against terrorism, we have to make it clear to the Americans that their way of fighting goes against constitutional legality and is not very effective."
"Mr President, the Commission notes the various concerns expressed by many honourable Members at the legal implication of the United States decision to deny these detainees prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention."
"We have all seen the photographs taken of prisoners detained at the United States military base in Guantanamo and have read reports about their treatment."
"Despite the uncertainty about their formal status there has been no proof that the prisoners are not being treated humanely."
"This has to be the fundamental question."
"The European Union has a long-standing ongoing dialogue with the United States on human rights issues and in the field of justice and home affairs."
"In the majority of cases there is agreement between the European Union and the United States."
"But where we disagree, for example on the death penalty, we put our case and discuss our differences frankly."
"I agree with those honourable Members who believe that this issue strengthens the EU's argument in favour of the establishment of an International Criminal Court."
"We will continue to pursue this line of argument with our United States counterparts."
"The European Union will continue to monitor the situation in Guantanamo. We will do it carefully and will not hesitate to raise this issue bilaterally with the United States whenever appropriate."
"I would like to conclude by repeating what Mr Patten has already said in the Tokyo Conference of donors for the reconstruction of Afghanistan."
"Our main concept is justice for events, and this is the precondition to win peace as well as to win the war."
"The case of Grigori Pasko and the closure of TV6 in Russia."
"Mr President, it is an honour for a small group to be allowed to open the dance, as it were, and I would like to do so by saying that without freedom of the press, democracy cannot flourish."
"The case of Grigori Pasko must make that clear to us."
"It is a heavy blow to the freedom of speech in Russia, to a country born of perestroika and awoken by it."
"It takes us back to the suppression of the free expression of opinion during the Soviet era."
"Hence our criticism of it, for the accusation is still founded on the secret martial laws of the Soviet Union, which are not recorded even by Russia's Ministry of Justice."
"In them, military personnel are forbidden to talk to foreigners."
"They cannot even go shopping any more, as for a long time many of the traders in Russia have been from other countries."
"That is why we have appealed to Mr Ustinov, the State Prosecutor-General, to review this case without delay."
"We call to mind the case of Alexander Nikitin, whose appeal took sixteen months, especially bearing in mind the fact that Gregori Pasko is extremely poorly accommodated."
"There are not even windowpanes in his cell, and that in winter."
"Gregori Pasko does not want a pardon."
"I wish to point out to the Commissioner that there are remarkable false rumours circulating about that."
"This is not about an admission of guilt."
"He is in the right!"
"He is within his rights to use freedom of speech."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner to tell Mr Patten that this topic must at last find its way into the discussions between the EU and Russia!"
"Mr President, certain Members of this House, and certain forces, tend to apply more stringent standards to a small country such as Madagascar, which we will be discussing shortly, than to a large country such as Russia."
"We are, though, obliged to do the very opposite."
"Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, and has a special partnership agreement with the European Union, so, on human rights issues, we must apply stringent standards to this country even if it is a powerful one and partnership with it is in our own interests."
"The Russians signed up to stringent standards when they joined these organisations, and now they must meet them."
"What has been done to Mr Pasko is therefore wholly unacceptable."
"Mr Pasko is a person who has acted in the interests of the people of the European Union, Russia, and its Asian neighbours in warning of dangers menacing the Russian people and all of us."
"As a Russian democrat, as an environmentalist, and as a human rights activist, he deserves our support."
"He campaigns for freedom of opinion and constitutional legality in Russia, and so, in contrast to those who are trying to silence him, he is a patriot."
"This case in particular, then, obliges us to speak plainly and to demand that Russia's secret laws, martial laws, and military courts should disappear and that Mr Pasko be set free, not by being pardoned, but by the utterly unfair and unjustifiable charge against him being withdrawn."
"There is one other thing we must say loud and clear. There is a need to create the conditions in Russia for the restoration of nationwide independent media."
"The closure of TV-6 is a scandal that cries out to heaven, and stands out as the conclusion of a coordinated policy engaged in by the Kremlin and by President Putin himself."
"I therefore ask you to support this motion for a resolution."
"Thank you, Mr President, in my country, we often say that it is beyond anyone' s comprehension."
"I was very much reminded of this phrase during a recent incident at the Russian Kultura channel."
"In a programme, the presenter recommended a recently published book on the position of intellectuals under the Stalin regime."
"He had deduced very subtly that the publishers must have thought the time had come to reflect on almost forgotten survival techniques."
"This is a discerning way of ridiculing the Kremlin' s authoritarian press policy."
"However, the penniless directors at TV-6 have little to smile about these days."
"Last month, their channel was taken off the air by judicial order."
"In that way, the last, national, private channel, with its own independent reporting, disappeared in Russia."
"More than half of the Russian population were able to receive the TV-6 programmes."
"From now on, these citizens will have to rely on the two public channels, ORT and RTR, to provide them with information."
"In short, the forced closure of TV-6 certainly spells a decline in the Russian press landscape."
"The present draft resolution is therefore right to point this out."
"Has TV-6' s fate now been sealed for ever?"
"No, for, next month, the Ministry of Press Affairs will decide on a new licence for Channel 6."
"There is therefore a chance of this independent broadcasting channel being given a new lease of life."
"Interestingly enough, the day before yesterday, it received public backing for this from the right and the left political opposition camps in the Russian Federation."
"This option is definitely not the Kremlin' s preferred choice."
"The leaders in Moscow much prefer the idea of turning Channel 6 into a special sports channel."
"In their view, this also fits in perfectly with Putin' s new campaign for national fitness."
"Whether watching television for hours will indeed produce a healthier nation is very much to be doubted."
"With a view to the desired de-politicisation of society, however, it is an effective instrument."
"This draft resolution also makes reference to the case against the military journalist Grigori Pasko - with very good reason."
"The obvious link between his case and the closure of TV-6 is that both rest upon a shaky legal foundation, something which is not compatible with the fundamental principle of the Rule of Law in the Russian Federation."
"This is one of President Putin' s basic principles, which we gladly share with him."
"Given the expressions of endorsement conveyed by Russian society to Grigori Pasko and the editors of TV-6, there are surprisingly many more like-minded Russians."
"This sober resolution is a welcome affirmation for them and is designed to ensure that justice prevails for Gregori Pasko personally and that press freedom in general is protected in Russia."
"Mr President, Mrs Schroeder mentioned the case of Mr Nitikin."
"The two cases involving Grigori Pasko and Igor Sutyagin are more or less identical."
"Although Mr Pasko was sentenced in 1999, the Kaluga regional court has only recently acknowledged that there was no legal basis for his imprisonment."
"He is still in prison."
"This illustrates the Russia of today, Russia under Mr Putin, the Russia of Mr Putin' s friend, Mr Oostlander, who had us vote on a report on Russia - which I voted against - and in which we approved substantial funding of programmes for the media and for freedom of the media, for an independent judiciary and for the protection of the environment."
"At almost every part-session, however, we have to remark upon the fact that, in these areas and in many others, things in Russia are not working."
"This is the policy of the European Union. In other words, we are funding the fight to protect the environment and, at the same time, we have to fight to have environmental protesters released from prison and so on."
"This is a ridiculous policy."
"It is obvious that Mr Prodi' s concerns do not go much further than Gazprom and gas."
"We all know this and I urge those who tabled texts to include a small oral amendment."
"I also urge the Commission to express its strongest opposition to the Russian authorities."
"I do not think that this is a matter for the Council alone."
"Moving on, it is most shameful that we are not spending enough time discussing the situation in Chechnya."
"Not a day or week goes by, however, when there is not an article on Chechnya in our newspapers."
"I urge you to read the latest article by Mrs Politovskaya in 'Courrier International' magazine."
"What is happening in Chechnya, which is still part of Russia, even though it should not be, is absolutely atrocious."
"Of course, there are no pictures like those taken at Guantanamo Bay; there are no pictures but the situation is obviously much worse."
"Madam President, the Commission shares Parliament's concern about the cases of Grigori Pasko and the closure of TV6."
"Against the background of our joint efforts with Russia to establish closer political and economic relations, the European Union has repeatedly made clear that it expects Russia to act in accordance with the values that it committed itself to respecting when it entered the Council of Europe and the OSCE."
"These basic principles, including free and independent media, necessarily constitute an integral part of our partnership, underlying the strategic partnership that we are building."
"Besides legal considerations, editorial freedom in Russia has suffered a number of setbacks in recent months."
"This is a worrying development."
"In addition, the Pasko case raises concern due to the dim and unclear circumstances surrounding his trial, including the lack of any public incriminating evidence."
"At any rate, we will continue to use all CFSP instruments to support the causes of independent media and editorial freedom in Russia, including by raising all relevant cases in the framework of our bilateral political dialogue with Russia."
"In addition, the Commission will continue to devote special attention to supporting civil society and independent media in the context of the European initiative for democracy and human rights, for which Russia will be a priority in the short and medium term."
"Elections in Madagascar."
"Mr President, the results of the first round of the presidential elections, which were held on 16 December 2001 in Madagascar, have been the subject of great controversy and conflict between the two leading candidates, namely the outgoing president, Didier Ratsiraka, and his rival Marc Ravalomanana."
"It is claimed that Mr Ratsiraka has rigged the election results and his intentions remain a mystery."
"He is not stepping down and his silence is leading to fears of violent actions being carried out by his supporters."
"Although the Ministry of Home Affairs attributes only a small majority to Mr Ravalomanana, he is claiming to have won the first round and is calling for the second round to be cancelled."
"However, the official results mean that the two men must face one another in a second round and the international community is hoping and praying that it will be organised."
"Mr Ravalomanana appears to enjoy the support of the people, as hundreds of thousands of people have demonstrated in his favour, bringing the country to a standstill with a general strike and claiming victory over the opposition."
"This strike is having disastrous consequences for Madagascar' s economy, and last week cost between USD 8-10 million."
"The losses incurred, following 10 days of strike action, have already exceeded Madagascar' s annual education budget."
"Let there be no misunderstanding about this."
"This is not a question of us supporting one candidate over another, and I have no more sympathy for Mr Ravalomanana than Mr Ratsiraka."
"What could be a cause for concern for the future are his autocratic tendencies, which came to the fore when he was the capital' s mayor, and if elected, Madagascar' s power would be in his hands."
"Human rights supporters are becoming disillusioned."
"But what we need, first and foremost, is respect for democracy and the Rule of Law."
"That is why it is essential that the two candidates agree to the ballot being checked and that the High Constitutional Court agrees to compare the results."
"This comparison is the only democratic means of establishing the real results of the ballot."
"The Commission must do everything in its power to resolve this conflict, which is pulling the country apart, but also to help in establishing a genuine Rule of Law."
"The conflict must be resolved with respect for human, political and civil rights, but also for political pluralism."
"Respect for fundamental principles is essential in consolidating the democratic process."
"Mr President, after the dark period of colonialism and dictatorships in the developing countries, I feel that it is positive that we are talking today about elections in these countries, even though their social and civil structure is weak, as is the concept of democracy."
"It is difficult to distinguish between the parties, given that every culture and every society needs to select its own representatives."
"I do feel, however, that we must reiterate the need for transparent elections, for we must promote the development of democratic awareness and culture just as we must promote the growth of civil society."
"Moreover, through the instruments available to us, the Cotonou Treaty and the ACP/EU Joint Parliamentary Assemblies, we must propose systems and methods of democratic control, ensuring they are appropriate to the current level of civil society in those countries."
"We will be able to move forwards if we succeed in getting across the message that democratic growth, the safeguarding of human rights and the creation of a pluralist State - and therefore of consensus within a pluralist society - will enable this country to grow, for it needs so badly to be actively included among the world' s civil societies."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 25 January 2002, Madagascar' s High Constitutional Court published the result of the elections."
"The slow procedure and the quasi-monarchic nature of the regime that has been in power for almost 20 years, which, in particular, had led Madagascar' s government to refuse the presence of international observers, and the ambiguities found in the public statements made by the opposition, sow more than a seed of doubt as to whether these results are reliable."
"But are Madagascar' s leaders solely responsible for this parody of democracy?"
"Why was this country, which is one of the poorest countries in the world, not the focus of particular attention from international public opinion before these regrettable events occurred?"
"Have the countries of Europe, and France in particular, forgotten the past they share with Madagascar?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Madagascans do not need us to take them by the hand, nor do they need us to make electoral choices on their behalf. However, Europe cannot, under any circumstances, stand aside and do nothing."
"In spite of the 'good behaviour' that the observers have emphasised - which is one of the Madagascan people' s defining characteristics - the situation is exceptional for this country."
"More than 500 000 people take to the streets every day to demonstrate on a scale that has not been seen since the country gained independence. Madagascar has been brought to a virtual standstill by a general strike that is having disastrous consequences, and the support for which is as strong as ever despite being in its tenth day."
"We cannot remain indifferent, given the serious nature of this situation."
"We must therefore adopt initiatives to help the people of Madagascar to rediscover a dignified way of life."
"And this will only happen if the second round takes place in a transparent fashion; in other words, if the international organisation and if the European Union ensure the elections are conducted in the proper manner."
"We must demand that the two candidates show respect for the Rule of Law and safeguard civil peace so that the electoral problems do not escalate into an ethnic dispute."
"We must quite simply call for the voice of the people to be heard and for their verdict to be respected."
"Mr President, the Commission, which stands by human rights, respect for democratic principles and the Rule of Law, is particularly concerned and worried about the political situation in Madagascar."
"Time is short and we are under pressure to monitor the elections, which are currently being prepared."
"The Commission will not be able to send observers for the second round of voting on 24 February because Madagascar was not on the Commission's list of priorities for 2002, including for reasons which originate in the country itself."
"However, the European Union is prepared to support the election process and the Commission has decided to send a team of technical experts to the second round of elections in Madagascar with instructions to support a consortium of local observers."
"Elections in Cambodia"
"Mr President, the elections in Cambodia, which at least represented progress by virtue of being the first local elections for decades, were preceded by an electoral campaign in which the media were manipulated by the ruling party and persons in positions of power, who exploited them for their sole benefit."
"A tide of intimidation directed at the opposition parties culminated in innumerable violent deaths and mysterious murders."
"That being so, these elections cannot be described as free in the true sense of the word, even though our colleagues have reported from Cambodia that the ballot itself seems largely to have been conducted in a correct manner."
"We must, though, register the fact that there is still a great need for democracy to really take root in this country, which has been tested by adversity and has suffered more than any other in the world from the horrors of the twentieth century."
"No other country in the world has seen a totalitarian rampage such as took place in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, and so the wounds are not going to be healed overnight."
"We must, though, nonetheless see to it that we apply clear standards and promote democracy and the Rule of Law - and that can only be done through the local communities."
"I therefore appeal to the Commission and the Council to systematically promote and support the newly-elected local assemblies, by which I mean not only the representatives of the ruling party but also those of the opposition parties, which must not be allowed to degenerate into fig leaves, but which are needed so that this first tentative step towards democracy may result in real democracy and not just a propaganda show."
"We therefore need training and development for local politicians; they, their access to the media, and free media themselves, need to be fostered."
"These need to be the priorities of our future policy on Cambodia."
"Forces such as Funcinpec, too, as well as others, need to be promoted by us, so that a genuine and stable multi-party system may arise in this country that has suffered so much more than any other."
"Mr President, the European Commission agrees with Parliament that priority must be given to supporting basic democratic institutions in Cambodia."
"That is why we spent EUR three million in the form of technical assistance to ensure that the recent municipal elections ran smoothly and why we sent observers from the European Union at Cambodia's request."
"The European Commission coordinated a total of 120 observers in Cambodia on the day of the election."
"This is the first time we have sent observers for purely local elections."
"I must say that I was especially pleased that Carlos Costa Neves headed the mission, as this shows that Parliament and the Commission are now working even more closely together on election observer missions."
"According to initial reports, preparations for the elections and polling arrangements went smoothly and voters arrived peacefully and in an orderly manner."
"We did, of course, receive reports of incidents of violence, murder and intimidation which are giving us serious cause for concern and which took place despite the fact that both the government and the other political parties stated they wanted no violence during the elections."
"And we consider that media coverage of the elections was biased."
"As the electoral process has not yet been completed, the results have not yet been announced and accusations and appeals have not yet been filed, it is too soon to draw any final conclusions as to how the elections passed."
"But clearly, for the first time in its history, the people of Cambodia had the opportunity to vote for local councillors and they turned out en masse in order to do so."
"The European Commission representation, together with European Union diplomatic missions in Cambodia, will continue to monitor progress in the post-election period."
"Only then shall we be in a position to evaluate the full importance of efforts to ensure that this country continues on the road to democracy."
"Eritrea"
"Mr President, we, who supported Eritrea' s struggle for independence, are alarmed by the changes in this country's governing authorities, while the tragic consequences of the recent conflict with Ethiopia are already causing suffering."
"In September 2001, 11 members of the Eritrean opposition, including several former ministers who had published a letter calling for a return to democracy by the ruling party, were arrested by the government."
"As well as the arrests, a ban, described by the authorities as temporary, was imposed on the private press."
"The elections were also adjourned and the formation of new political parties was prohibited."
"Journalists and Eritrean dissident politicians were gagged by the regime."
"These repressive measures, which violate freedom of expression, are worrying and unacceptable."
"They blatantly contradict the Eritrean authorities' proclaimed desire to undertake democratic reforms."
"Furthermore, the expulsion in October 2001 of the Italian ambassador, who represented the European Union on the ground, severely undermined relations with Eritrea."
"Yet, in order to enable relations between Eritrea and the European Union to return to normal, it is essential that human rights and fundamental freedoms be respected."
"For this to happen, the Eritrean Government must not only release all political prisoners and journalists, but it must also lift the ban on all independent journalists."
"That is why the European Union must re-examine its relations with Eritrea in the light of the Cotonou Agreement, Article 96 of which calls for an inter-Eritrean national conference to be held, bringing together the various political leaders and representatives of civil society, with a view to finding a solution to the current crisis and to setting the country on the path to democracy and sustainable development."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I ask you to share the sorrow as well as the anger I feel in speaking as a friend of Eritrea."
"From 1889 to 1952 Eritrea was under the flags firstly of Italy, then of Britain."
"It was then given by the international community to Ethiopia in federation, and then it was annexed by that country."
"It then suffered 32 years of war during which its economy and its environment were ruined and its people dispersed."
"We then came to 1993 and its referendum for independence."
"I was there as a UN observer."
"There was a spirit of hope abroad in that country."
"The refugees were returning, reconstruction was beginning to take place."
"90% of people voted in that referendum. 99% voted for independence."
"President Isaias was elected president."
"With a moderate lifestyle and a period of optimism stemming from it, we hoped for the best."
"For some years the problem was border conflict."
"Now sadly the problem is internal."
"Human rights have deteriorated, opposition is not tolerated, eleven former leaders of the government party have been arrested, the press is suppressed and journalists arrested."
"The Italian ambassador has been expelled."
"Multiparty elections which were promised for last December were cancelled and now parties themselves have been banned."
"Democracy has been cancelled in Eritrea."
"Eritrea is desperate for support in rebuilding a country ravaged by war."
"They need our aid, but aid must not be without guarantees of good governance."
"To our friends in Eritrea we say: ""come back to the world community of democratic government."
"To the Commission I say: ""be firm""."
"Human rights are not just for our benefit. They are not to make us feel good."
"They are for the benefit of the people of Eritrea and Eritrea needs those human rights now."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as the previous speakers have already said, the situation in Eritrea is becoming increasingly serious as far democracy is concerned."
"The Eritrean Parliament, which is made up of elected members who all belong to the People' s Front for Democracy and Justice, has decided to ban the formation of political parties."
"The independent press has been suppressed and many journalists, politicians and political opponents, including former government ministers, have been arrested, accused of treason against the national assembly."
"There is an increase in repressive measures being taken to control the citizens, especially students, two of whom died while imprisoned in the desert."
"The Italian ambassador has been expelled. The state of the economy and of citizens' living conditions is becoming increasingly serious."
"The non-governmental organisations operating in Eritrea report situations which have reached hitherto unknown severity: even doctors, nurses and paramedics have been removed from hospitals and sent to the front, leaving the people with no health care at all."
"The violence inflicted on the people, particularly women and children, is indescribable."
"The international community cannot just stand by and watch."
"We need to intervene as swiftly as possible to help define the borders."
"The UN Security Council and the Algiers Commission have committed themselves to doing this, but we need a European delegation, a troika, to go to Eritrea and we need to reassess relations with this country on the basis of the Cotonou agreements."
"We need to demand the announcement of parliamentary elections - already scheduled, moreover, for December 2001 - elections which must take place under international supervision."
"We must demand the release of all political prisoners, and that the freedom of the press, the freedom of association, the freedom to develop society and the freedom to form political parties and trade unions be restored."
"All this must be an essential prerequisite if the Union is to resume the financing which is absolutely vital for the reconstruction of the country' s war-torn economy and for its development."
"The Council and the Member States need to adopt a coordinated approach to relations with Eritrea which is as effective as possible and such as to contribute quickly to the process of achieving peace at the country' s borders and within Eritrea."
"The ACP/EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly will take place as of mid-March."
"We hope that, at that forum, we will be able to debate the processes announced previously as having already taken place, and that we will be able to find a way to initiate a peace process with the Eritreans as well, to restore democracy and, most importantly, to restore to the citizens, men, women and children acceptable living conditions which are no longer shameful."
"Mr President, before saying anything else, I would like to express my total mistrust of the present leaders of Eritrea and my absolute condemnation of their actions."
"The situation in Eritrea is extremely critical, and we now have a better understanding of what prompted this people to go to war against Ethiopia."
"However, the solution reached was not a mutually agreed solution but a concession obtained from Ethiopia, which won the war by military force."
"Moreover, Eritrea brought down a regional resolution at the ACP Assembly of November 2001 by refusing to discuss the issue of relations between the two States."
"With regard to the Italian ambassador, we should ask why he was expelled."
"He was expelled for the 'crime' of conversing with Eritrean civil society rather than just with the country' s leaders."
"Therefore, we must be resolute in addressing this situation, first and foremost in order to free the Eritrean people from the ruling power."
"I feel that maximum effort and total commitment on our part will be needed to bring growth to civil society, to create a world that is civilised and not excluded from the assembly of the civilised nations."
"That the Commission use the Cotonou Agreement to this end is not just necessary but, given the situation, its responsibility."
"We cannot allow the situation in this area to persist."
"Mr President, recent developments in Eritrea are causing the European Commission a great deal of concern, and we feel that arresting political protesters and muzzling the press are making the situation in Eritrea even worse."
"It is good that issues such as the arrest of political protesters, the electoral law and the bill on political parties have been debated in the long-awaited gathering of the national assembly in Eritrea but we are, of course, sorry that no decision was taken on when detainees will be referred to the courts or released and that the formation of political parties has again been put on hold."
"We hope that the committee set up to safeguard the future of the press in Eritrea will be able to help get the restrictions on the private press lifted soon."
"The Commission is working with the presidency and the Member States, so that it can react in a forceful manner to the present crisis."
"Without question, the whole endeavour is based on international law, human rights and human rights conventions and our efforts will be directed towards making sure that political dialogue with Eritrea continues and is reinforced within the context of article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"A visit to Eritrea by the high-level troika is being planned as soon as the report by the Boundaries Commission is published, hopefully within the next few weeks."
"Because of the tension between Eritrea and Ethiopia, the Commission believes that every effort should be made to prevent the conflict from escalating."
"And the Commission needs to make an active contribution towards conflict prevention and the restoration of peace and stability in the area."
"However, we need to tread very carefully and avoid any action which might leave the political leaders in the area with their backs to the wall."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"Earthquake in Turkey"
"The next item is the debate on 2 motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0071/2002, by Mr Van Orden, Mr Morillon and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group,"
"B5-0080/2002, by Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Figueiredo, Mr Papayannakis, and Mr Alavanos, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group,"
"on the earthquake in Turkey"
"Once again, Mr President, Commissioner, tragic events have forced our attention on Turkey, following yet another earthquake recently."
"I think we owe it to our neighbour to provide every type of assistance, financial, humanitarian and, I would add Commissioner, long-term assistance."
"Our resolution says exactly what we are calling for and there is no need for me to comment on it."
"What I would like to say is that, if you take a long-term view of the problem, because earthquakes are endemic in this area, you will soon see that we do not have a practical policy for earthquakes, a damage-limitation policy, a policy on repairs, assistance, anti-earthquake measures to protect us, the European Union and all its neighbouring countries, including of course Turkey."
"However, we do have the means and the centres and the researchers and I wonder, Commissioner, if we are using them properly."
"This is not the first time we have discussed this question and I should like to take advantage of this unfortunate incident to raise it once again."
"Mr President, as a representative of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, which is Christian Democratic in character, I wish to express our deep and sincere sympathy with all the victims of the terrible earthquake in Turkey."
"We would also express our sympathy to the Turkish Government and to everyone in Turkey."
"What has happened shows that, despite all the conflicts of political opinion, the most important thing is still life itself."
"It is important for the Turkish authorities and the EU to do everything possible to get aid through as soon as possible."
"The events in Turkey highlight the need, at international level too, for some form of emergency force to respond to appalling natural disasters of this kind."
"The fact is that the international TV companies are on the scene much more quickly than those of us from the European Union and those from various aid organisations."
"Let us work to ensure that aid gets through more quickly."
"In conclusion, I would just mention the fact that, the last time something similar happened in Turkey, there proved to be some coming together of Greeks and Turks."
"Mr President, I should like to express my most sincere sympathies and undivided support for the Turkish people, hit yet again recently by another earthquake, with lives lost and extensive damage."
"I hope that those who lost their loved ones and those who were left homeless or lost their possessions will soon find the strength to recover from the shock of this unforeseen disaster."
"I should also like to mention here that the Greek government immediately expressed its support and sympathy and offered help to the victims of this catastrophic earthquake, and to pass on to the European Parliament just how much the Greek people sympathise with the suffering which the earthquake caused the Turkish people and how close it has brought them once again."
"The spontaneous response of the people, especially when disaster and suffering strike, is the ultimate expression of sincerity and faith in coexistence and solidarity between nations."
"I trust that in the future, in the very near future, these two nations, Greece and Turkey, will be brought closer by happy rather than tragic events, such as the accession of Turkey to the European family, the European Union, within which these two nations will enjoy and serve the same values and ideals of democracy and personal freedom, values and ideals which unite and safeguard their common desire for prosperity, peaceful coexistence and cooperation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that we all sympathise with and support the victims of the earthquake in Turkey and which, as a previous speaker said, is the second earthquake to hit Turkey in under two years."
"Obviously, action to help the victims speaks louder than words of support and we have no choice here but to admit that there is no mechanism at European Union level to provide help in these and similar natural disasters."
"And another thing: we could say of the area of Turkey which was hit that it is an area where poverty attracts misfortune."
"If buildings had been built to earthquake standards, we would have had fewer victims. Even the director of the earthquake institute in Istanbul stated that there is no building control committee in the area to check that buildings meet specifications."
"So let this too be an incentive to improve our earthquake defences."
"Mr President, the Commission shares the European Parliament's interest in and concern for the humanitarian situation of the victims of the earthquake in Turkey."
"I should like first to reply to Mr Papayannakis's question on dealing with natural disasters."
"The Commission has already proposed, some time ago now, that a service be set up at European level to deal with natural disasters."
"This proposal concerns not just earthquakes, but floods, fires and major accidents such as those which occurred recently in Austria and France, and makes provision for a first decision-making level resulting in a form of cooperation and proper coordination of national mechanisms, so that exponential results can be obtained from the mechanisms in the individual Member States for dealing with disasters."
"As far as the specific question of the earthquake in Turkey is concerned, our representation in Ankara has assured us that the Turkish authorities responsible for dealing with emergencies have not asked for help and that no help with civil protection or humanitarian aid are required at present."
"And that is after cooperation between the Commission and the government."
"According to our information from the Red Cross, humanitarian requirements are being met relatively well."
"The Red Cross has said that it is providing 7,000 tents and 10,000 blankets, as well as survival kits for families, and the government has sent 1,000 tents and 3,000 blankets for people obliged to sleep out of doors."
"This is the situation so far, according to information from our representation and the Red Cross."
"We therefore have no plans for the time being to assist Turkey under ECHO."
"The Commission will monitor the situation in Turkey closely and will work with other donors so as to encourage a coordinated international effort so that priorities for action can be clearly defined from an orderly statement of the needs and problems of the area."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"State of implementation of working time directive"
"The next item is the report (A5-0010/2002) by Mr Koukiadis, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission report: 'State of implementation of Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time ( 'Working Time Directive' )' (COM(2000) 787 - C5-0147/2001 - 2001/2073(COS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am particularly honoured to present the report on the first five years' implementation of the working time directive."
"Working times, like wages, have been one of the main subjects of employee claims throughout the history of industrial relations."
"These claims and success with them are down to the trade union movement, because the arrangements which it has brokered have restored workers' dignity, improved their standard of living, reduced risks to life and limb and, by deregulating working times, given them time for a political and social life."
"Despite the fact that health and safety legislation forms the legal basis for the directive, we must not underestimate its other aspects."
"That is why the Member States must safeguard this acquis as the cornerstone of social cohesion."
"At the same time, it is also why I have the right to express my disappointment in a number of states for their unwillingness to transpose the directive into national law on time, despite their self-evident obligation to do so."
"I should also like to comment on the fact that the Member States have not provided detailed statements of national arrangements which allow the Commission to clearly assess if they are complying with the arrangements set out in the directive."
"For example, it is totally unclear if and to what extent it applies to all public-sector workers."
"Implementation so far has given rise to a series of disputes and/or straightforward infringements."
"One of these issues is the issue of doctors on duty, although this links up with the more general issue of equating readiness to work with working time and, in this sense, it also applies to other categories of workers."
"The ruling by the Court of Justice, whereby readiness to work requiring the worker to be present in the workplace and to have alert physical and mental faculties qualifies as regular paid working time, is in keeping with the traditional approach under labour legislation."
"Another issue is the infringement of the right to leave where there is a limited contract of employment."
"Here too, the Court of Justice's ruling that the right to leave is a basic right to which even temporary employees on a limited contract of less than one year are entitled will help in the fight against infringements."
"A third point which deserves the Commission's attention is the woolly definition of maximum working time."
"It is strange there is still controversy over the exact meaning of a definition which has applied for decades."
"The transposition of the directive in certain countries in the form of collective agreements is also a major issue."
"This is a matter of general interest."
"Without question this method, which promotes collective autonomy, must be encouraged."
"However, it must be used in a way which produces the same results as it would if the directive were transposed in a legislative act."
"This has not been the case in the past, either because sectoral collective agreements have been used, rather than a general cross-sector agreement covering all workers, or because there are no collective agreements which apply to all workers."
"Finally, again in connection with arrangements under traditional industrial relations, there is the problem of special arrangements for specific categories of particular types of workers such as women, mothers, persons with disabilities, children etc. Special care must be taken with arrangements for these categories of vulnerable workers and an initiative must be taken to improve them in the light of past experience so that they can be integrated into the European Union's policy of increasing the number of women in work and making it easier for persons with disabilities to access the job market."
"I should like to use the last part of my intervention to comment on what is to become of traditional arrangements following the emergence of new forms of work, where the principle of flexibility and traditional job security are being turned into employability."
"We need courageous innovations here if we are to guarantee the principle announced at Lisbon of combining flexibility with protection and this principle needs to be translated into industrial relations by taking specific measures to organise working times."
"If we are to replace traditional job security with employability, we need a new approach to working time arrangements because new problems are emerging, such as how to turn part-time employment into full-time employment, what to do about weekly rests and the ban on working on public holidays, how far to adjust working time arrangements where paid work is turned into self-employment, how to control the application of specific working time arrangements in the case of teleworking, what new balance must be struck between home life and work and, finally of course, how can we make time spent on lifelong learning count as working time."
"In closing, I should like to add that the European trades unions rightly want to highlight all these issues relating to modern forms of work as immediate priorities in a widespread campaign which they are planning to start on 14 February to follow on from today's debate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like it to be noted that I am speaking in place of Mr Pérez Álvarez, who has been the shadow rapporteur for this report on behalf of my group and who is able to attend this sitting."
"On his behalf and on my own, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur and say that I am pleased with the work he has done and with the positive attitude he has adopted towards the amendments which had been presented by Mr Pérez Álvarez."
"Directive 93/104/EC is a continuation of Directive 89/391/EC, on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work, with the idea that the creation of the internal market must lead to an improvement in working and living conditions, by means of approximating legislations."
"In this respect, the Commission' s report is a general description of how the Member States have transposed and applied the aforementioned directive with results which clearly indicate that the method and result could be improved."
"It has been demonstrated that not only the temporary delay in compliance with the transposition period and, consequently, the non-application of the Directive within the time limit, but also that the exclusions and exceptions have been due to criteria which are not always clear."
"Therefore, transposition, by means of collective agreement, has not always been accompanied by the desired success for this instrument of social dialogue."
"The amendments presented by Mr Pérez Álvarez were aimed at highlighting and providing a remedy for these shortcomings and the amendments I am going to mention now have the same aim."
"Amendment No 1, because the confusion between the concepts of 'exclusion' and 'exception' , which are always in the singular, must not become an opportunity to sidestep the mandatory nature of the directive."
"Amendment No 2, proposing an additional clarifier, which is not intended to replace, but to clarify and extend the content of the paragraph, also by means of concepts and definitions which guarantee the application of the Directive, faithful to the idea that things should be judged by what they are and not what they are called."
"We believe it is important to expressly highlight these two points for the sake of improving the living and working conditions of workers."
"All of this must done in accordance with Article 31 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, ""Fair and just working conditions"" ."
"Firstly, that ""Every worker has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity"" , and secondly, that ""Every worker has the right to limitation of maximum working hours, to daily and weekly rest periods and to an annual period of paid leave"" . Both aspects - health at work and working times - are clearly linked, and all of this is aimed at a more just society governed by the respect for the individual and collective rights of workers."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to compliment Mr Koukiadis on his report and thank him for the consideration he has given to the conclusions of the Committee on Fisheries, for whom issues of safety are a high priority."
"Mr Koukiadis' report directly concerns only the first of what are now three directives on working time."
"He pinpoints variations in interpretation, types of derogation and manner of transposal as contributing to defects in its implementation."
"Such problems could be compounded by the fact that different rules apply to different sectors."
"For example, fish processors are covered by the first directive but those engaged in fishing as such by the second."
"It is difficult to predict the effects of this for two sectors that are so closely related to one another."
"Similarly, potential changes in the nature of aquaculture may mean that different rules are needed for the future from those that fit its character today."
"That is why we are asking the Commission to monitor these aspects of implementation in future reports."
"It may be that there are other sectors for which a similar approach would be helpful."
"It is desirable that individual sectors are covered by rules that are genuinely appropriate to their own particular situations."
"However, many implementation problems might be avoided and quicker adaptation made to technological and other change if such rules could come out of agreements between the social partners."
"We point to the agreement between the European Community Shipowners' Association and the Federation of Transport Workers in the EU as an example of best practice in this regard."
"Finally, with safety so much at stake, we hope that the rules will become accepted as setting minimum standards to improve upon, rather than maximum ones to adhere to simply because that is what the law demands."
"Mr President, I should like to sincerely congratulate the rapporteur on his extensive and critical work on this report on the working time directive."
"It was indeed quite an urgent issue to be tackled, given the controversial discussions at the several sessions of the Court of Justice on this very matter."
"Before I speak on a number of matters to do with the working time directive, I must say that I am very pleased that a couple of Member States have already implemented a huge number of different legislative, administrative and collective agreements in this regard."
"I also feel that the measures taken by the supranational decision-makers go in the right direction, since the Commission's new directives cover the areas excluded from the scope of the original directive."
"However, there is still a lot of work to be done."
"We all know - and the rapporteur did well to criticise it - that some Member States resort to the tactic of claiming that their existing legislation covers the provisions of the directive."
"I cannot understand, therefore, why they hesitate to implement a fairly flexible directive in the large amount of time available."
"I therefore agree with the report's encouragement of the Commission to investigate why the Member States refuse to comply with some of the directive's provisions."
"We should insist as well on controls on the conditions of application of the directive to new working-time patterns, for example, precarious work, part-time work and fixed-time work."
"In addition to that I see a strong need to focus more intensively on the increasing number of homeworkers."
"The Commission itself has made strenuous efforts with regard to open and distance learning within the Leonardo da Vinci programme, for example."
"I feel obliged then to ask you: why do we not give stronger encouragement to the social partners to negotiate the relevant working-time issues?"
"Nevertheless, the report could have gone further into detail, as it unfortunately neglects so-called self-employed workers."
"I am convinced that the need to include this category within the directive is a matter we should all support and in doing so we should merely be adding further to a well-drafted report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the working time arrangements which we are examining here are part of the neo-liberal policy to reverse the industrial relations which the working classes have fought hard to achieve."
"This policy undermines workers' rights by applying flexible forms of work and working time arrangements and undermines full and stable employment by replacing it with part-time and temporary employment."
"The aim, of course, is to increase the level of exploitation of the workforce and maximum the profits of big business."
"Which is why an attempt is being made to abolish the stable seven- or eight-hour working day and weekends off and why collective agreements are being ripped up and limited contracts are being extended."
"Workers must be on standby whenever and for however long their employers choose."
"In addition, making part-time employment the rule not only hits workers in their pay packets, it also makes it practically impossible for them to acquire pension rights."
"The result of the European Union's policy is an increase in under-employment which, in some countries, already stands at over 30%."
"We support a different policy, a policy which extends workers' rights and fights against capitalist restructuring."
"We are fighting for the repeal of the legislative framework which imposes daily working time arrangements and flexible forms of employment."
"We support full and stable employment, eight hours a day, five days a week, more extensive social rights and pay rises commensurate with today's needs."
"Thank you, Mr President, EU citizens are very prosperous and enjoy the fruits of that prosperity."
"This is expressed in the level of welfare experienced by them."
"Consequently, the protection of employee welfare in an economic climate which centres on productivity and efficiency deserves all our care and attention."
"Citizens' welfare is therefore served by sound legislation on working hours and hours of rest."
"As an extension of the rapporteur' s approach, I should like to draw your attention to Sunday' s being a collective day of rest."
"In my view, the rapporteur gives too little attention to the importance of this in his approach."
"It is one of the tasks of the Member States, in line with customs and traditions in the Member State in question, to designate a day of rest."
"I am delighted to note that in 9 of the 15 Member States, Sunday has been officially designated a day of rest."
"These Member States have taken the order from Parliament in 1996 seriously and realise that a day of collective rest is of great importance to families, extended families and other social networks."
"Research in the Netherlands has this week shown that consumers have little or no interest in shopping on a Sunday."
"It is therefore of major importance that allowance be made in social legislation for the fact that Sundays are to be maintained as days of rest within the European Union."
"To Christians, Sunday has the specific significance of a day of rest designated by God, which goes back to the day of Christ' s resurrection."
"As such, this day of rest is deeply engrained in European culture."
"After all, there is more to life than production and consumption."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission report before us is not merely necessary."
"It will bring a great deal of work in its train in the Member States."
"The rapporteur has taken a great deal of trouble about the analysis, and for that I am very grateful to him."
"The directive strikes me, though, as something of a patchwork rug."
"There are too many loopholes with national regulations crocheted in elsewhere, making individual interpretations possible and the whole thing impenetrable."
"What is most fundamentally at issue is the protection of workers, a cause which we have taken up."
"Both the Commission and the Member States, therefore, have to be urged not merely to adopt the definition and interpretation of particular concepts, but to check precisely on potential deviations from specific legal provisions, in order not to cause any confusion which might, at the end of the day, result in the opposite of what was actually intended."
"Most uncertainty in the Member States concerns the maximum permitted working time, although clear limitations are laid down in Article 6, Article 18, and in the final provisions."
"The possibility of also using collective contracts or agreements between the social partners to transpose the directive should be seen in a fundamentally positive light."
"All that is needed is for this to actually happen, and when it does, it must be completely in the spirit of the directive, without a back door or the possibility of evading its provisions at a halfway stage."
"It is also urgently necessary to reach a clearer definition of the concept of 'standby duties' , and, above all in view of the judgment of the European Court of Justice, to implement it completely along those lines."
"The judgment in Luxembourg clearly brought out this directive's weaknesses, and it is regrettable that the Commission has to lag behind on this point."
"The Koukiadis report will be a great help in the work in hand."
"I hope we will actually find the points listed by Parliament still in the directive when the time comes to transpose it."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Koukiadis on his excellent report on the implementation of the working time directive and agree with the last speaker, who pointed out that there are loopholes in the working time directive, although these are being closed as time goes by."
"I should like to remind the House that there have been significant developments over the last two years in connection with doctors' working times and in connection with working times in the fisheries industry, not to mention the recent directive on workers in haulage companies."
"The Commission report on the implementation of the working time directive contains a general review of how the Member States implement the directive."
"The Commission is not obliged to publish this report but we felt, politically speaking, that it was conducive to greater transparency and openness."
"This means, as Mr Koukiadis rightly pointed out, that the transposition of the directive varies hugely from one Member State to another."
"Here too, we must to admit to the need to reconcile economies and societies with very different customs and practices, which is why the agreed framework is flexible and does not insist on uniform, inflexible solutions which it would be impossible to put into practice and which would make it hard to even agree on a framework."
"The Member States have been given considerable room for manoeuvre in transposing the directive."
"The directive allows a number of exceptions based on legislation or collective agreements, thereby giving the national authorities the flexibility I have already mentioned."
"The Commission is happy with this multi-faceted approach and has no ambitions to push for uniform solutions in this sector."
"However, I should like to comment on a number of specific recommendations made to the Commission."
"The report calls at various points for the Commission to monitor transposition and take the necessary steps if the directive is not transposed correctly."
"We are in agreement here and the proceedings available to us when Community directives are infringed have already been instituted or are due to be instituted in the cases referred to."
"As regards the definition of working time and the implications of the ruling by the Court of Justice in the Simap case, which found that the time spent on duty by medical staff in first aid teams counted as full working time, the Commission is examining the implications of this case and has already held a meeting between the national authorities and the Commission services and is planning to schedule a study of the legal situation and the implications of this ruling on health systems and other sectors."
"The European Parliament report also calls on the Commission to clarify where exceptions are justified on the basis of industrial agreements."
"There is a clear reference to the specific term in Article 18(1) allowing the Member States to deviate from the upper limit of 48 hours, provided that the worker is happy to work the extra hours."
"Here too, I should point out that there are safety valves to avoid measures and implications which are unacceptable to the worker."
"The only country to have made use of this exception is the United Kingdom."
"The same directive stipulates that the Council must review this provision at the Commission's proposal, accompanied by an evaluation report."
"And I can assure you that the Commission will be submitting the evaluation report in question."
"I should also like to stress that the national authorities in every Member State will be filing national reports in 2002, analysing the practical implementation of the directive in question."
"The Commission will use these national reports to draft a summary report on the implementation of the directive in the Member States, which will give us a clearer picture."
"I should like to close with a few comments on new work models."
"Obviously it is hard to apply traditional working time to new forms of work and the debate on lifelong learning and time compression is a major issue."
"What I can say here is that social dialogue is already playing an important part and will play an even more important part in the future."
"The social partners and their discussions and agreements on the role of lifelong learning and the principles of teleworking and the agreements already reached in specific sectors demonstrate that, in the initial stages, individual agreements at European level can create the right conditions for moving forward, if necessary, to a legislative framework."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"Stimulating Internet access"
"The next item is the oral question (B5-0003/02), on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to the Commission on stimulating Internet access."
"Mr President, I should like to welcome Mrs Diamantopoulou here this afternoon."
"I know she will be speaking on behalf of Mr Liikanen."
"We are obviously disappointed that he is unable to be here."
"We understand the pressures on the time of Commissioners."
"We know that across the Commission there is great interest in this subject and, in particular, in a number of the areas for which Mrs Diamantopoulou is responsible, this issue will also be of crucial importance."
"The thrust behind our question - which is tabled at a timely point in the run-up to the Barcelona Summit - is that the need across the European Union to deliver access to information society services and to encourage the climate in which new services will develop has to be at the foundation of the Lisbon goal to deliver the most competitive knowledge-driven economy in the world."
"I emphasise ""knowledge-driven"" because what we are talking about is the ability to achieve the widespread dissemination and availability of that knowledge."
"Part of the problem with this topic is the whole issue of jargon, and our question perhaps falls into that trap by talking about flat-rate Internet access."
"Perhaps colleagues will bear with me if I just set out why that is so critical."
"If the Internet is really to deliver its full potential as a global knowledge network, as an instantly accessible medium, then we have to encourage people to use it in such a way that they become detached from the feeling that, with a time-based connection, they have to hurry through what they are doing, that the facilities are not always there and available to them."
"That really is what this is all about."
"It is making that huge library of information and services available in such a way that people can have continuous access to it at a price they can afford. That is really at the heart of this question."
"We know that quite a lot has moved forward."
"I am pleased to have been a member of the teams in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which have worked very hard with the Commission to push through directives on matters such as the unbundling of the local loop and the whole of the electronics communications package."
"We understand our role and responsibility here."
"The ultimate delivery of these services will have to come from the marketplace."
"It has already happened successfully in mobile telephony; it is already happening now in the marketplace as new investment is going in."
"However, we have to encourage investment in the backbone capacity that will carry these services and encourage people to develop the new services that will take advantage of that increased capacity."
"What we are talking about is moving from the relatively small knowledge pipelines that are coming into our houses and our businesses to much larger pipelines of knowledge."
"New services will be delivered with them."
"For example, a full-length movie will be delivered in seconds rather than hours, as it is at the moment."
"In conclusion, we look forward to hearing how the Commission is going to encourage that development of fast Internet access, how it is going to stimulate that provision across the Member States, what further action may be necessary, and what further support we can give to this crucial aim for the future of the European economy."
"My special thanks to the honourable Member; this is indeed an exceptional issue which is a top priority not just in the European Parliament and the Commission but in each individual portfolio, because an electronic Europe is at the top of everyone's agenda."
"The summit in Lisbon called for cheap, high-speed networks for accessing the Internet."
"For reasons which you yourself explained, this is the cornerstone of a European knowledge-based economy, the cornerstone of policy for a Europe of justice, equality and inclusion."
"As you state in your question, Internet access charges are an important factor."
"There is the matter of flat-rate charges for access - as you quite rightly said, there is a problem of terminology and how to translate terms into all the languages and I have to say here that there were words which I recognised in English but not in Greek - so, flat-rate charges for access based on flat-rate connections by Internet service providers and the new telecommunications companies which have taken over the networks of the former monopolies."
"The national regulations of four Member States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain and France require the former monopolies to provide all market factors with flat-rate Internet access."
"This is known as the FRIACO principle, which means Flat Rate Internet Access Call Origination."
"This service will soon be up and running in Italy too."
"The industry maintains that FRIACO results in increased use of the Internet and, because there are no time charges, users spend more time on the Internet and become Internet literate."
"It also maintains that, with all these FRIACO services, consumer demand for broadband access and services is increasing."
"The Commission welcomes the decisions by the regulatory authorities in the Member States which I referred to earlier and encourages the use of this model in the other Member States."
"The Commission's support and encouragement take the following forms: first in the open network provision committee, the forum chaired by the European Union, in which the regulatory authorities and the ministries of the Member States are represented in their advisory and regulatory capacity."
"This issue will again be on the agenda of the open network provision committee at its meeting on 20 February 2002."
"Secondly, in the seventh publication on the application of the package of regulatory arrangements in the telecommunications sector which it submitted to the European Parliament and the Council in December 2001 and in which it specifically supports flat-rate narrowband Internet access as a gateway to broadband access."
"Similarly, as you too mentioned, binding decisions have been taken within the wider context of the continuing implementation of the e-Europe action plan."
"The Commission is also making sure the regulation on unbundling local loops is applied correctly."
"Unbundled access to local loops allows newcomers to compete with established service providers by providing high-speed data transmission services and constant Internet access using digital subscriber line technology."
"The Commission also referred to this aspect of high-speed Internet access in its seventh publication, together with the provision of equal access to high-speed Internet access services retailed by established service providers."
"The Commission is also encouraging guaranteed fair and equal terms for the provision of short leased lines which take costs into account. These are another form of access to the Internet and are important mainly to small companies and companies using the data services of newcomers to the telecommunications market."
"So the Commission is clearly operating at two levels."
"On one level it is backing specific cooperation policies and the use of models which are already a success, and I have said how, and on the other level it is monitoring the application of binding decision such as regulations which, of course, play a very important role."
"As far as disseminating and consolidating broadband technology is concerned, the Commission acknowledges in its report to the European Council in Barcelona that this technology is not at present being provided and used by the Member States as quickly as we would expect."
"This being so, the Commission has proposed to the European Council that it set a target date of 2005 for the provision of broadband technology throughout the European Union."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Rail freight in the Channel Tunnel"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the oral question (B5-0004/02) by Mr Savary and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to the Commission on rail freight in the Channel tunnel;"
"the oral question (B5-0005/02) by Mr Davies and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to the Commission on rail freight in the Channel tunnel."
"Mr President, since 7 November the SNCF has suspended all cross-Channel rail freight services because of fears for the safety of its staff at Calais following threats from those seeking to enter the UK illegally."
"As a result, Channel Tunnel freight services are now in a state of deep crisis."
"However, we are pleased today that both French MEPs and British Labour MEPs have pushed for a debate, and indeed that the ELDR Group has joined us in calling this debate this afternoon."
"We need cooperation, not conflict, to resolve this particular problem."
"No more naming and shaming, no more buck-passing; we need the British government, the French government, the SNCF, Eurotunnel, EWS and others to start working together more effectively."
"A lot has been done, but there is a lot to do."
"Added to my list is the European Commission."
"Articles 28 to 30 of the Treaty and Regulation 2679/98 guarantee the free movement of goods."
"That means free movement through the Channel Tunnel."
"I thank the Commissioner for intervening in this particular crisis and for responding positively to requests from myself and others."
"In the past few days a security fence has been built and we welcome that."
"But policing is still only between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m."
"We hope to be able to persuade our French colleagues of the need for 24-hour policing and adequate police numbers."
"We need the SNCF to resume services as soon as possible and we need urgent modifications to locomotives to ensure they do not need to stop at Calais purely for technical reasons."
"These are practical measures that will make a big difference in the short term."
"We hope you, Commissioner, will continue to act to ensure that this vital link in the single market is restored."
"Mr President, the Commission is worried about the fall in rail freight due to security problems at the SNCF station."
"This situation is having an adverse impart on the distribution of freight transport services between the modes of transport on this important route."
"This is damaging rail transport and runs counter to the Commission's collective view of the role of rail transport, as set out in the White Paper presented in September 2001."
"The partial suspension of rail traffic through the Tunnel is reducing the use made of its potential and, as a consequence, the return on the investment in this vital European transport infrastructure."
"The Commission has been fully apprised of the situation since it emerged in November."
"In application of Regulation No 2679/98 on the free movement of goods, the Commission services asked the French authorities to take all the necessary measures to restore the smooth flow of traffic back in November."
"They also asked for regular reports on developments in the situation."
"According to our most recent information, the situation has improved slightly."
"The police are patrolling the area, rail capacity has been increased, where possible, from 1,200 to 1,600 tonnes. Work on the Frethun freight terminal started in December and a reinforced fence is expected to be completed at the beginning of February."
"Security installations on the site, such as video cameras and heat detectors, will be in place by the end of June."
"Contacts with the French authorities will be maintained, Commissioner Bolkestein has suggested meeting his French and British counterparts and the ministers responsible for the internal market in order to discuss the matter on the fringe of the next Market Council on 1 March."
"Our objective is to restore the free movement of goods by June at the latest, once all the work on the terminal has been completed."
"My last comment refers to asylum and external border controls."
"The policy of the Union and the Member States on asylum and external border controls is also in jeopardy."
"The Commission believes that approving harmonised rules will help stop certain Member States from being more attractive than others and it has already tabled proposals along these lines."
"Mr President, we used to have a joke in the United Kingdom about there being fog in the Channel and the continent therefore being cut off."
"Now it seems more a case of people loose in the Tunnel and trains and trade cut off - which is altogether more serious."
"The effects of the restrictions are very damaging to free movement and employment: thousands of jobs are at risk."
"I have to say that for those affected, removing the restrictions by June sounds a very long way off."
"The problem is the proximity of the Sangatte camp for refugees: it is too close and should be moved, and makes policing very difficult."
"This Tunnel is an asset and enterprise which is jointly owned and benefits both France and Britain, as well as the wider Community of Member States."
"It is probably the single most important physical link drawing Britain and the continent together."
"The difficulty of policing illegal immigrants is damaging to this process and must be resolved soon."
"I call on the Commission to press the French authorities to take action."
"I call on the United Kingdom government to offer more assistance to its French counterparts and to the hauliers and businesses concerned, rather than seeming to turn a blind eye to their concerns and difficulties and spending more time harassing truck drivers and train operators with prosecutions and fines."
"The authorities need to take action and not take it out on other innocent parties."
"Mr President, firstly, I should like to pay respect to my colleagues Mr Watts, Mr Savary and Mrs Darras for bringing this point to the House for our consideration."
"It is ironic that I speak on this subject because, as a rapporteur, I helped push through this House the issue of free movement of goods at border areas where there was disruption."
"Primarily it was meant to attack the issue of industrial relations at borders."
"But this is interesting: I praise and applaud the Commission's lateral thinking about the application of these articles that have been laid before them."
"I knew then, as I know now, that the requirements set down in that particular set of articles were merely mechanistic, that it comes down to political goodwill."
"People here today will appreciate that it requires all parties to pay attention to what is happening at the Channel Tunnel and to make sure that they do not allow it to be obscured by the mere arguments, cultural or political, that exist there."
"There are problems. In this particular issue there are problems of slender resources - we understand that - whether of the police or of security personnel at the areas where they are involved."
"But we need to get freight through unfettered."
"Let us also recognise that this is an international problem."
"People have been displaced as a consequence of wars and of major disruption and there are also economic émigrés who will pay any price to get into the UK."
"Quite often it is a price paid to criminal gangs, there to exploit the motivation of these people."
"Real solutions, therefore, lie in the hands of politicians coordinating their actions at government level."
"Peace and development in the areas of the world facing crisis are also what we must strive for."
"In France we have also seen, all too unfortunately, human tragedy that has left in our minds the human aspect of all that is going on there."
"The attempts of the French authorities to tighten security are welcome."
"The highest level of vigilance must continue to be demanded, as Mr Watts has said."
"Attending to this question in the House confirms the international status and interest which it deserves."
"Not just the Channel Tunnel, but other issues as well, will be resolved by such processes."
"This gives us just such a platform to launch that process."
"Mr President, first of all I would be grateful if Commissioner Diamantopoulou would convey to Commissioner de Palacio my personal thanks for the work that I know the Commissioner has already undertaken in this regard."
"Coming from one of the more remote parts of Europe, namely Scotland, it is so important for us to be connected with the centre."
"The problems we face at the moment are acute."
"I refer to exports and the logistical problems that are being created, as well as the problems for the rail freight companies generally."
"What is an acute problem could, if matters are not dealt with properly, become a chronic one."
"Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already referred to the fact that what is happening with the Channel Tunnel is counterproductive to the policy which we all want to see pursued, namely that of getting freight on to the railways and off the roads."
"Given the present situation within the United Kingdom, the difficulties that it has in exporting and the railways there, and looking to the future of the whole transport policy of the European Union, I sincerely hope that as much pressure as possible can be brought to bear from all quarters to get this problem resolved as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, I follow Mrs Attwooll as one of the other Members for Scotland in this House."
"I am very grateful to Mr Watson and to the Liberal colleagues who put forward the questions which promote this debate today."
"It is a vital debate."
"To try and make the point Mrs Attwooll was making yet more vivid, 30 miles away from the house in which I live in Edinburgh, midway between Edinburgh and Glasgow, at the town of Motherwell, lies the most northerly freight outpost of the trans-European network into the United Kingdom, the Motherwell Eurocentral depot."
"We have been told in recent weeks that the carrier out of that port, EWS, will not be able to afford to continue providing a service out of Scotland at the current available number of trains per day."
"It would be a crisis for Scotland, and therefore a crisis for transport across the Union, if that happened."
"It is well known, for example, that the Scotch whisky industry depends heavily on rail freight to get malt scotch and blended scotch into the European market."
"Heavy losses are being made on a vitally important trade."
"In these circumstances it is encouraging to be told that the Commission takes this matter seriously, but it is not encouraging to be told that all will be well by June, because the information we are receiving from the commercial parties involved is that they cannot last until June at present levels."
"This is a time when people throughout the European Union people are asking themselves the question: Do we obtain the benefits which we are promised from our membership of the European Union?"
"These benefits particularly relate to the opportunity to trade freely across the Union."
"Other benefits which have been promised are those arising from intermodal transport - that not everything should go on the roads."
"That affects not just people in Scotland; it even more affects people down the motorway routes through England, if far too much heavy freight traffic goes down there."
"We need traffic on the railways."
"We also need traffic by sea."
"We are very grateful to Commissioner de Palacio for the work she has put into securing the new ferry link between Scotland and Zeebrugge, but if we are going to have a sensible transport policy which really does spread the load and save the roads from excessive use by heavy traffic, we must have this railway line kept open."
"I am grateful to colleagues who have raised this question."
"I am grateful to the Commission for taking it seriously; but I want to know as well what compensation will be available to ensure that those who have lost money are not prevented from trading altogether by the uneconomic conditions now prevailing on this route."
"Mr President, the free movement of people, goods and services - one of the cornerstones of the internal market - is in various ways at stake in this matter."
"The free movement of people, but also of goods, should not lead to the unverifiable movement of asylum seekers as a result of open borders."
"Untenable situations have arisen at the Eurotunnel caused by stowaways on trains."
"As a consequence of this, restrictions have been in place for three months now, as a result of which the volume of goods by rail through the tunnel has at least halved."
"This loss of turnover causes disproportionate damage to the Channel Tunnel operator, who is not even certain that the sanctions for stowaways are now in place."
"The discussion on the White Paper on transport policy is in full swing."
"Despite all the differences of opinion, almost everyone involved is agreed that the growth in the transport of goods must not unilaterally end up on the roads."
"Rail, in addition to water, is a sound alternative."
"The restricted use of the Eurotunnel has forced many companies to transport goods by road for the time being."
"There is a fear that, once again, the reputation of rail transport will incur lasting damage."
"In order for transport capacity to recover, the underlying problem has to be solved."
"This is not the place to discuss the problem and tragedy of illegal immigrants in Europe."
"However, the asylum policies of the two countries on either side of the Eurotunnel is undeniably responsible for the drastic decline in the transport of goods by rail though the tunnel."
"The United Kingdom has to contend with the dubious reputation of pursuing a flexible immigration policy and of hardly fighting illegal employment."
"Whether this is an accurate description or not, the British government fails at any rate to discourage refugees."
"On the other hand, French asylum policy can be referred to as being two-faced."
"The large stream of refugees via France is not stopped until they reach the Eurotunnel and are held at the camp near Sangatte."
"This amounts to a concentration of hundreds of desperate people only 3 km away from the Eurotunnel, the gateway to England, their country of destination."
"Locked up in a camp within walking distance of the gate to the other side. Surely this is tantamount to leaving the fox to watch the geese!"
"Asylum seekers deserve our sympathy, for they too are ultimately the victims of ambiguous rules, random implementation and inadequate inspection."
"It is high time that the French authorities detained the asylum seekers in France, for example near an international airport, from where, upon being refused admittance, they can return to their own countries."
"The sad images from Frethun require both the Commission and the Council to do everything in their power, not only to remove this impediment, but also to tackle the cause."
"They must not be allowed to shirk their responsibilities while the market for the transport of goods is being disrupted in this way."
"Mr President, I am truly perplexed by the oral questions tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party on the disrupted Channel Tunnel rail freight services. This disruption was caused by refugees trying to enter Great Britain illegally."
"Judging by the oral questions tabled, the main, or even the only problem, is that of the disruption to the freedom of movement of goods through the Channel Tunnel, and therefore the losses incurred by rail freight companies which could be exacerbated - I shudder at the thought - by unfair competition between the various methods of transport to the detriment of the railways."
"Like my fellow Members, I strongly regret the losses incurred by the rail freight companies and I would even add that, in my view, it is illogical that France, whose socialist government bears the responsibility for this matter, is not severely punished, morally and financially, for its inability to maintain public order."
"However, I would also like to say, ladies and gentlemen, that this matter poses much wider and much more serious societal problems than just unfair competition between private operators."
"That is why I will add a set of additional questions to those tabled by the PSE and ELDR Groups."
"First of all, some of the people who attempt to enter Great Britain illegally are asylum seekers, but some are illegal immigrants, even in France."
"How do many illegal immigrants manage to reach the heart of Europe, having passed several internal borders, without being noticed?"
"This is a fundamental issue that should be resolved."
"Furthermore, what measures are being taken to immediately escort these illegal immigrants back to the European Union' s external border?"
"My second question refers to the fact that a large number of asylum seekers who attempt to enter Great Britain are from Afghanistan."
"However, as far as I know, the Taliban regime has now been eliminated and these people can return home."
"What measures are therefore being taken to repatriate them?"
"My third and final question refers to some people's belief that if we had a single European asylum policy, we would not have such problems."
"Of course, this might mean that refugees would no longer receive unequal treatment in different European Union countries."
"But does the Commission think that the overall number of asylum seekers would go down?"
"If it does, how exactly would this be achieved?"
"On the other hand, this might mean that if the European asylum standards were aligned at a high level - which is what the Commission regularly states it intends to do - the overall number of asylum seekers in the European Union would significantly increase."
"Mr President, I join my Scottish colleagues in asking the Commissioner to help us to resolve this situation as urgently as possible."
"It may surprise the Commissioner to have such a representation from Scotland, but Scotland is probably one of the greatest victims of this situation in the Channel Tunnel."
"Because of the reduction in transit through the Tunnel, we do not have a mere three services a night - we have none, because the service from Scotland to the continent has been withdrawn completely."
"As Mr MacCormick said, it is no longer possible to transport Scotch whisky to the Continent or to send our microcircuits to Paris, Frankfurt or Milan."
"But more than that: it is no longer possible for us to import parts and continental products by train."
"Costs for both exports and imports are increasing, as are road congestion and pollution."
"A service which did something to bring Scotland closer to the golden triangle of Europe has been lost, and so Scotland returns to the periphery."
"This is a tragedy, and why?"
"Because we seem incapable of organising our immigration systems on a European basis and of providing adequate security to ensure that any such arrangement works."
"Clearly there are faults on the French side of La Manche and on the English side of the English Channel, but the victims are my constituents - hundreds of miles from Dover and Calais - in Scotland."
"I call upon the UK government to resolve its immigration system, in collaboration with its neighbours, so that it does not attract tens of thousands of desperate people."
"It is surely not coincidental that the UK is one of the only European countries without identity cards."
"I call upon the French authorities, from their old allies of the Auld Alliance, their Scottish cousins, to enforce real security at their end of the Tunnel so that the rail freight service to and from Scotland can be resumed."
"I call upon the Commissioner and the Commission to knock all their heads together urgently in order to reach a solution to this absurd state of affairs."
"Mr President, I apologise for my late arrival and I would like to thank you for rescheduling my speech to a later time."
"The reason why we tabled this question is because the public sees the problem at the Eurotunnel site - since it involves two large European countries and also since it concerns our security and asylum policy - as requiring intervention by the European Union."
"We cannot let this situation rumble on, as it would then illustrate Europe' s lack of power."
"This situation also implies that we have envisaged solutions that can be applied to other borders and to other locations that are under pressure from migration."
"We are therefore calling, since the asylum policy and judicial and security policy are not sufficiently harmonised, for the Commission to work with France and Great Britain so that strong measures can be taken in three areas."
"The first area is to re-establish, as far as possible, the freedom of movement, particularly that of rail freight in the Channel Tunnel."
"What is happening, despite considerable investment by the rail operators and the SNCF in particular, contradicts our policy of moving towards using rail rather than road."
"The second area is that if we fail to harmonise security legislation and mechanisms, we must take coordinated and coherent measures in the two countries to combat those involved in human trafficking, by increasing controls and introducing stiffer penalties, as this activity constitutes an intolerable attack on human rights and is a shameful trade."
"As far as the third area is concerned, what is happening at Eurotunnel demonstrates the urgent need to harmonise Europe' s asylum policy."
"This is because what is happening there, and what France and England are being remonstrated for, is a problem which may concern all European Union countries in the future."
"We know, thanks to the experience of what is happening throughout the world, that there will never be a perfect and wholly reliable solution, given the disorder in the world and the growing disparities between North and South."
"The first and most important solution, the fundamental solution is, of course, to have a much more generous and more balanced development policy."
"However, since we do not have this and as a short-term measure, I think that we must implement common measures in the two countries, so that we can ruthlessly track the people who trade on illusions - human traffickers, in other words."
"I think that this is very important."
"Lastly, I personally hope that, rather than leaving the these two countries to face their responsibilities alone, we find, with the help of the Commission, measures which are strong enough to be held up as an example and that can be applied to other locations in Europe."
"Mr President, clearly we are having trouble applying one of the basic principles of a free Europe, the principle of the free movement of goods."
"Numerous approaches have been voiced, from the possibility of invoking articles in the Treaty to intervention by the Commission to persuade the French government to act more quickly."
"The current legislation of the European Union allows the Commission to institute infringement proceedings against a Member State found to be obstructing the free movement of goods."
"However, these proceedings are subject to strict criteria when the obstacle is created by a few private individuals and the Commission can only act if the authorities in question fail to take the necessary measures."
"This clearly does not apply in the present case."
"Serious efforts are being made, contacts between the Commission and the French government have proven useful and we shall continue to work along these lines."
"The French government has already closed the site in question, a study has been carried out and initial efforts have been made to install the technology required but, of course, the level of policing, the number of police officers required and the installation of the high-tech equipment needed are matters for the French government."
"The second point I should like to make brings us to the root of the problem."
"Why has traffic been suspended?"
"Why are there constantly problems with train traffic through the tunnel?"
"Why are illegal immigrants trespassing on various sites used by rail freight transporters?"
"I think, as several Members have said, that the root of the problem is to be found in common European policy; we need a common asylum policy to discourage immigrants from trying to reach specific Member States."
"So the Commission has already tabled a number of proposals on procedures and rules for granting refugee status and minimum common requirements for receiving asylum seekers."
"Another proposal sets criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining asylum applications."
"These proposals stipulate that, if an asylum seeker remains in one Member State for an extended period, then that Member State is responsible for examining the asylum application."
"This means, in this particular case, that asylum seekers will be unable to acquire refugee status in Britain after an extended period in France."
"So I think that, when it comes to finding an immediate solution to a problem which is having a significant impact on certain areas, especially remote areas in Scotland, as well as on the European continent, and on trade relations with Great Britain, the French government alone is responsible."
"It needs to take action as quickly as possible to complete the plan submitted and it is working with Great Britain and the Commission in order to do so."
"As far as a long-term solution to the problem is concerned because, as numerous Members have said today, the problem today may be on the border between France and Great Britain, but tomorrow it could well surface somewhere else in Europe, we need a fast decision on a common asylum policy at European level."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the sitting is suspended until voting time at 6.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 6.10 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.)"
"Vote"
"Report (A5-0010/2002) by Mr Koukiadis, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission report: 'State of implementation of Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time ( 'Working Time Directive' )' (COM(2000) 787 - C5-0147/2001 - 2001/2073(COS))."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Koukiadis report (A5-0010/2002)"
"Bonde and Sandbæk (EDD), in writing."
"(DA) We have chosen to abstain from voting on the overall report."
"We believe that implementation of the directive in Denmark - characterised as inadequate by the Commission - would undermine the Danish system of agreements in the long term."
"Denmark had chosen to implement the directive on the basis of the collective agreements and so hand the matter over to the two sides of industry."
"Because, following pressure from the Commission, the directive is, however, shortly to be elevated to the status of law in Denmark, we can only express our dissatisfaction with the Commission' s interference in a system that operates well."
"We nonetheless support the general improvements proposed by the report, including more precise definitions of concepts, for the wordings of quite a few definitions have led to misinterpretations during the implementation of the directive."
"It is important that the text should be clarified in many areas so that employees' rights are protected and there is improved health and safety in the workplace."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 6.40 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I hereby declare resumed the session adjourned on Thursday, 7 February 2002."
"Statement by the President"
"It is my duty today with the support of all the Members of this House and particularly with the support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to express on behalf of the European Parliament our deep concern at the kidnapping of a parliamentarian and candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections in Colombia, Mrs Ingrid Betancourt, a kidnapping by the so-called Revolutionary Armed Forces of the Columbian People's Army FARC."
"The European Parliament unreservedly condemns such attacks on innocent civilians and interference in this way in an electoral process."
"As President, I appeal to the perpetrators to immediately release Mrs Ingrid Betancourt, the five other parliamentarians being held hostage and the 40 civilians who have been kidnapped in the recent past and are still being held in illegal captivity."
"Furthermore, I remind the kidnappers that it is especially inhuman to hold hostages who are in a precarious state of health and that these should be released immediately on humanitarian grounds."
"Members will recall our strong support following the statement to plenary by President Pastrana on Tuesday, 26 October 1999 for the peace process in Colombia expressing numerous resolutions on 'Plan Colombia' ."
"The European Parliament regrets all the more the breakdown in the peace process negotiations and the recent resumption of hostilities and calls on the parties concerned to resume their search for a democratic and negotiated settlement for peace in Colombia."
"Parliament expresses its solidarity with the families of the hostages and with the people of Colombia."
"Mr President, thank you for that statement."
"We will send someone to Colombia to see what we can do as a European Group and we hope, within a few weeks, to have a different option than simply to deplore that our candidate has been kidnapped."
"Mr President, I would like to draw my fellow Members' attention to the gathering, which is taking place right now opposite the Parliament building, of some 3 000 men and women from France, Italy, Belgium and elsewhere."
"They are calling on Europe to do everything in its power to bring about an equitable peace in the Middle East, in the spirit of the resolution that we ourselves adopted at our last part-session."
"I think that we must welcome this gathering, firstly because it is healthy, when we are discussing the future of Europe, to see so many people demonstrating to urge Europe to fulfil its role as a world player."
"And also because this is a demonstration for peace, justice and human dignity in the light of an appalling tragedy, which requires us to make an exceptional effort."
"I welcome the fact that most groups have agreed to hold discussions with the citizens' delegations; this is promising."
"I think that the next step should now be to send, as we decided, an official delegation from Parliament to the Palestinian territories and to Israel, and also, once there, to organise a visit to Europe by President Arafat."
"Order of business"
"I move now to the order of business."
"Mrs Pack, I understand that you wish to make a request concerning the agenda for Thursday."
"Mr President, on behalf of all members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, I would like to make a heartfelt plea that we should not, as planned, have a combined debate on culture, education and youth on Thursday morning, as these three topics should not be thrown together."
"There may well be points of contact between them, but they need to be dealt with separately."
"I ask that these three topics be dealt with in the same time as set aside for the joint debate, and I believe that this is something that this House would support."
"Let me then make a proposal which the House in its wisdom is at liberty to accept or reject."
"In the light of this request I propose taking the three reports from the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport in separate debates."
"(The House agreed to this proposal)"
"Mr President, you proposed a change to the agenda based on the Council' s availability, which, of course, we understand."
"Basically, your proposal is to take Mr MacCormick' s reports on the waiver of parliamentary immunity now and, whatever the quality of the work by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which gave its opinion on the two reports last week, we believe that the time we have been given to examine the two requests for the waiver of parliamentary immunity might be insufficient."
"We also believe, in the interests of holding a good debate, in order for our parliamentary democracy and the essential procedure of parliamentary immunity to function properly, in order for us all to be able to give our honest opinion, having had the opportunity to examine all the documents and in order that we do not give poorly informed opinions, that it would have been better to place the two reports on the agenda of the Strasbourg part-session."
"I hope that the House can support us in this decision."
"Rule 6(6) is very clear: ""The report of the committee shall be placed at the head of the agenda of the first sitting following the day on which it was tabled""."
"Under the Rules I am suggesting the correct procedure today."
"The rule itself is very clear and it does not seem to fall within the discretion of the President or, at this moment, of the House itself, to alter that rule."
"I understand and appreciate the point you make about political preparation but it seems to me that this must remain on our order of business in order to respect the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, this change to the agenda was not taken into account when you made your proposal."
"This change is directly related to the Council' s availability."
"Until now, it has always been customary to examine waivers for parliamentary immunity at the Strasbourg part-sessions."
"I understand perfectly well, therefore, that we placed this issue at the head of Monday' s agenda, but I do not think this was what was intended, especially after last week' s vote by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Madam Berès I made the suggestion to take the McCormick report at 4 p.m. because of the lack of availability of the President-in-Office, not on the assumption that the reports would not have been taken today."
"Our agenda, as originally foreseen for today, was to be led by the Council on the Barcelona Council."
"Mr McCormick's reports would ordinarily under our Rules of Procedure have appeared in today's agenda."
"My announcement was simply to reverse the order on the grounds of the absence of the Council."
"Decisions taken at today's meeting"
"The next item is the communication by the President of the European Commission, Mr Prodi, on the annual political strategy for next year."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure today to inform you about three important matters dealt with by the Commission."
"I need to be clear but also go into some detail in this speech, and so I apologise if it gets a little boring!"
"I will deal first with the Commission's political priorities for 2003, then with the Commission's human and financial resources and, lastly, with the Convention which is going to start work tomorrow."
"First, then, the Commission's political priorities for 2003, which will be one of the most important stages in the organisation of our political life."
"This year, for the first time, the three main institutions will conduct an in-depth dialogue on the political priorities and the legislative working programme for the coming year."
"We shall do so on the basis of the new understanding presented at the Conference of Presidents on 31 January."
"For next year, we have identified three priorities: enlargement, stability and security and a sustainable and inclusive economy."
"Fully successful enlargement has been a top priority for this Commission since the beginning of its mandate, and enlargement will therefore remain a key priority throughout the second part of my term of office."
"In this context, 2003 will be a very important year, in which we must all be ready to assume our full responsibilities towards the new Member States."
"We must be ready to welcome into the Commission our colleagues from the new Member States and to face new challenges."
"Let me remind you that if we complete the enlargement negotiations in 2002, then 2003 must be the pivotal year when we prepare ourselves to make sure that enlargement goes ahead smoothly on 1 January 2004."
"During 2003, therefore, the Commission intends to do several things."
"Firstly, we must help the future Member States prepare to fully assume all the responsibilities arising from accession."
"Secondly, we must make sure the Commission fulfils all its obligations from the very first day of accession."
"Thirdly, we must rethink Community policies."
"This will be the most significant enlargement in the entire history of European integration, and it is essential that we reflect on what common policies the enlarged Union will need."
"However, if enlargement is to be a total success, we must also give a high profile to the other two priorities I mentioned just now."
"Indeed, the three subjects we are talking about today are closely linked."
"First and foremost, stability and security."
"Within the Union, our main objective is to step up progress towards a European area of justice, security and freedom."
"Therefore, the fight against crime in all its forms - including terrorism, or rather, starting with terrorism - is and will remain at the top of our agenda."
"I also believe that there needs to be particular focus on all the complex effects of immigration."
"Outside the Union, another of our priorities is to spread stability and security throughout our continent and to the regions bordering on the enlarged Union."
"To achieve this, we need to strengthen our partnerships with neighbouring countries."
"The reinvigoration of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership must do more than seek to establish a market place: it must create a genuine community of good neighbours."
"To this end, we shall pursue our strategy of strengthening the Barcelona process."
"In particular, on the economic front, we shall seek to develop joint projects and initiatives together with the countries on the Mediterranean's southern shore through a new financial institution based on the EIB's operation - notably, this morning, we approved the idea that it should be an institution in which the EIB holds the majority share - on the basis of the guidelines the Commission has, indeed, adopted."
"Furthermore, we shall spare no efforts in seeking to help resolve the conflict in the Middle East, where the most recent developments have, at last, generated a glimmer of hope after months of tragedy."
"We shall also move forward with the association and stabilisation process in the Balkans and, in the wider world, we shall continue to support the reconstruction of Afghanistan."
"Our third priority for 2003 is a sustainable, inclusive economy."
"I believe it will not be long before the economy recovers, but a lot depends on how resolutely the EU implements the Lisbon Strategy."
"Indeed, the external dimension of this strategy is particularly important as it can help us direct the path of globalisation and ensure that its benefits are shared as widely as possible."
"To achieve this, we shall be fighting on several fronts. Firstly, the negotiations begun at Doha will be entering a crucial phase, not this year but in 2003."
"Then we must ensure that the Kyoto commitments are implemented. Finally, we must improve the global partnership between north and south, practically affirming Europe's solidarity with Africa."
"Proper discussions will be opened on these issues at Monterrey in a few weeks' time."
"The situation is certainly not the most encouraging, there is certainly no cause for optimism in our - at last serious - commitment to the Developing World, but the Commission undertakes to work in this sphere."
"My second subject for today is the analysis of the Commission's human and financial resources."
"Our Annual Policy Strategy does not simply identify the key political priorities; it also seeks to ensure that the Commission has sufficient resources for its tasks."
"This is the commitment I gave at the start of my term of office, and it is now becoming reality as we achieve coherence between policy decisions, planned activities and resources."
"This Commission has never undertaken to do anything without having the necessary resources and will never do so."
"We must therefore ensure - and this is the plan we are working on - that optimum use is made of human resources."
"We have made every endeavour to improve the situation, through productivity gains, negative priorities - identifying tasks to be abandoned, that is - and internal redeployment."
"At this point, however, we cannot prepare properly for enlargement without more staff."
"There is absolutely no doubt about that if you consider, for example, that the number of languages used - in Parliament too, of course, and in all the work of the different institutions - will almost double."
"As you know, the Commission must also be ready to ensure application of the Community acquis right from day one of accession."
"This means we have to complete all aspects of enlargement preparations by the end of 2003."
"To this end, precisely with a view to preparing gradually for enlargement, after rigorous analysis, the Commission has requested 500 non-permanent staff in its Annual Policy Strategy for 2003."
"We all know that the current ceiling for administrative expenditure does not allow sufficient resources to cover preparations for enlargement."
"The Commission therefore considers it essential to use the flexibility instrument it has proposed."
"This request for 500 non-permanent staff in 2003 forms part of a global package of staffing needs to cope with enlargement, and it is derived from a detailed analysis of all the activities the Commission will have to perform in future."
"The complete results of this analysis will appear in the preliminary draft budget for 2003 and will be presented for debate in this House."
"Our other two priorities - security and an inclusive economy - give the Commission additional responsibilities too."
"However, in order not to have to ask for yet more staff we have decided to approve new initiatives only if they can be carried out by redeploying our existing staff and/or by phasing out some of our existing activities."
"This shows how seriously and responsibly the Commission is committed to its priorities and also to budgetary discipline."
"Apart from anything else, the Commissioner for the Budget is here and she is watching to make sure that I respect this undertaking."
"With regard to financial resources, the Commission and the Budgetary Authority must urgently find a more structural solution to the permanent overstretching of external relations Heading 4."
"No action can be totally efficient under the current constraints: in other words, we are wasting resources."
"Last year's international developments, and especially the events of 11 September and the ensuing war in Afghanistan, showed once again that the Union needs specific mechanisms for making the extra funds it needs for crisis intervention swiftly available."
"This is of the utmost importance if we are genuinely to strengthen the European Union' s voice in the world."
"The breakdown in Heading 4 that the Commission proposes therefore accommodates crucial political priorities such as Afghanistan, the Euro-Mediterranean Bank and the Global Health Fund, without jeopardising our other fields of external action."
"I would therefore urge this House and the Council to address the issue of resources as soon as possible, for the actions I have mentioned cannot be put off."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, focusing on the Commission's political priorities for 2003 must not make us forget that we are on the threshold of a genuinely historic event that will shape the future of Europe."
"Indeed, tomorrow, in this building, the Convention mandated to put forward proposals for the Europe of the twenty-first century and to prepare a first draft of Europe's future Constitution will meet for the very first time."
"Under the present Treaties, the European Commission has the role of initiating legislation and safeguarding the general interests of the Community."
"Naturally, therefore, the Commission wishes to deliver a strong political message on the Convention's significance and on its objectives."
"Let me start by reminding you that the Convention is the result of the joint efforts of the European Parliament and the Commission, and we must be proud of this joint achievement, for not everybody supported the idea of a Convention some months or even weeks ago."
"The Commission is therefore very pleased to see a constitutional debate on the future of Europe getting under way, especially as most of the Convention' s members will be elected representatives of the people, not just representatives of national governments."
"I am pleased to see that the appointed representatives are of a very high calibre."
"No one can attempt to direct the Convention or to dictate the way it should work or the conditions it should respect."
"The Convention is composed of the highest calibre people who will manage their work themselves, independently."
"I believe that not only will it work freely and produce excellent results but that afterwards, ultimately, the governments will not be able to ignore its outcome when they set about reforming the Treaties."
"The governments are still sovereign, of course, but the work of this Convention will have a huge impact on the future of Europe."
"Of course, as we know, the Convention is open to ideas coming from civil society."
"Thus, no one will be able to claim that the new Treaty is the result of negotiations between Brussels bureaucrats and diplomats from which ordinary citizens have been excluded."
"We must not forget that the desire for a Convention was conceived the morning after the night of the Nice Council."
"It was conceived when we realised that we could not go on like that."
"It was not the result of a coincidence, it was generated by the realisation that a method had failed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission intends to play an active role in the Convention's work via the two designated Commissioners and my own direct, personal undertaking."
"We are aware of what is at stake and we can see that European integration is the only new development, the only proper institutional change being attempted in the world."
"It is the only practical attempt at democratic globalisation amongst the seas of words."
"However, we must also, through this Convention, propose a common plan for European society with which our citizens can identify, and we must therefore decide immediately, at the start of the Convention' s work, what we want to do together and in what kind of society we want to live in the coming years."
"It is this choice of society in Europe that will determine the means we use to achieve it and the powers and responsibilities the future European Union should have, not the other way round!"
"Therefore, we must first decide what we want to do together and then adapt the institutional structure to suit our objectives."
"We believe that the Community method is still a suitable instrument, the instrument that has distinguished and characterised Europe' s greatness thus far."
"However, we cannot take the conservative line of simply defending it to the hilt: we shall be proposing innovative ways of adapting it to the needs of tomorrow's Europe."
"I am confident that this House will support the Commission as we strive to find solutions that will ensure that the European Union' s decision-making process is both efficient and democratic."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I do not at this moment want to go into the fundamental question of whether it makes sense to deal with such an important contribution to debate by the President of the Commission on the basis of who manages to catch the President's eye."
"We will certainly have to discuss that on another occasion."
"Mr President of the Commission, we can of course go along with everything that you have said."
"You spoke about enlargement, and I would ask you to think - and perhaps say something later - about whether you in the Commission might also apply the system we want to introduce after the accession treaties are signed, that of having observers from the candidate countries here in Parliament."
"Do you think it might be possible to involve figures from the candidate countries in the work of the Commission, while these countries are not, as yet, Members?"
"You then talked about the Mediterranean."
"If it is true that around 7 000 deaths a year occur in the Mediterranean, for example among people in transit by boat from Morocco to Spain or Portugal, how can we, on the one hand, achieve an improvement in the situation in these countries, and, on the other, make the prevention of these pitiable people's deaths an achievement for our security policy?"
"You spoke about the Mediterranean Bank, which can be a positive element to which we are not opposed, but no structures must be created in addition to the European Investment Bank."
"I would therefore be grateful if you could say something about that."
"You spoke about stability, and, as far as stability and the repatriation of debts in national budgets are concerned, I would like to encourage the Commission to keep on course and write your warning letter, as you had planned, ..."
"... to both these Member States. I find it an unacceptable system in which those who are at the end of the day to be criticised, themselves decide whether such criticism should be meted out!"
"I think we need quite new ways of forming judgments in this area."
"My final observation, Mr President, is perhaps aimed more at us ourselves, but I would be grateful if the President of the Commission could say something about it."
"(Interruptions)"
"Just calm down!"
"It is your convictions too that I am expressing."
"The Council is not here today."
"I do not want to criticise anybody, but we must prepare for the future, and for the reform of the Council, by ensuring that the Council is represented when the President of the Commission makes an important statement in this House."
"This is not now aimed solely at the Spanish Presidency; it is a topic of general relevance to the reform of the Council."
"I believe that there is an urgent need for reforms to the European Council of Ministers!"
"(Applause)"
"Before I call on the President of the Commission, I would like to observe, Mr Poettering, that was a long minute and point out that Council was not expected to be here."
"Our debate on the strategy for next year is planned for 20 March."
"Normally when we question the Commission in these circumstances, we do so without the presence of the Council."
"Mr Poettering, I am very happy to answer your questions and I will try to be as brief as possible."
"You raised the question of observers coming from the candidate countries to visit the Commission."
"In my opinion, this is a good idea."
"Technically, it will not be easy, but if we want the Commission to be able to work up to speed as soon as enlargement has taken place, we must start to establish this relationship of training and learning now."
"It will not be easy because the candidate countries are not, of course, as yet in a position to decide who their future Commissioners will be, and the rules are not yet quite clear."
"I can assure you, however, that we are addressing the issue and we intend to resolve it openly and constructively."
"The second point is security."
"I have always maintained that, like all serious problems, the major issue of macro-immigration is something that cannot be resolved at national level."
"It is absolutely impossible for the problem of the great waves of migration from the east and the south to be resolved purely by national measures."
"European cooperation is needed, and so we must conclude this element of the Tampere agenda and work together on protecting borders, as we proposed."
"A further point is the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank."
"What were the political and economic aims behind this?"
"We have seen increasing dissatisfaction on the part of the southern Mediterranean countries in recent years, caused by our favouring the east - as they put it, in clear, direct terms."
"I explained that, in effect, we had been compelled by history to undertake this enlargement immediately but that I was committed to setting up a strategy for the south as soon as possible. This we have done."
"The bank could have merely been a fund or a facility, as has been suggested - that is a fund set up for the purpose - or it could have been a genuine bank."
"A bona fide bank will have greater autonomy, a greater capacity to intervene in the private sector and greater flexibility, and, most importantly, it will be in a better position to perform an education role, to get the leaders of the countries of the southern Mediterranean to work together with our people."
"We therefore decided on a bank, but we do share your concern, Mr Poettering, the concern of everybody here and in the Member States, not to create another minor bank and further bureaucracy when there is a European Investment Bank which is already dealing - with extraordinary success - with EUR 9 billion of investments in the southern Mediterranean."
"I would inform you that there have been no cases of default on payment, except with regard to the investments made in Gaza, and you will understand why that might be the case there."
"We want to capitalise on this experience and so the Commission has proposed a bank. However, the major shareholders in the bank will be the European Investment Bank, the Commission, the share-holding countries and, most importantly, the countries of the southern Mediterranean."
"Although these countries will, of course, start off with a fairly small share, their role in the bank itself will increase with time."
"With regard to the last point, I do not feel the Commission needs to give Parliament any explanation of how it is dealing with the matter."
"It has fulfilled its obligations and mandates consistently and complied with the need to give early warnings where the figures showed that this was necessary."
"We have not carried out any special assessments."
"We have complied with our primary obligation, which is to fulfil our mandates, and will continue to do so in the future."
"Mr President, a complaint and three messages."
"The complaint is that we are experts in devaluing important debates."
"This is the most important debate in terms of the European Parliament' s work over the next year and we are dealing with it as if it were a question of procedure and a rubber-stamping debate."
"I believe that this is absurd and things should not be done in this way."
"As for the messages; firstly, I would address the Commission."
"Mr President of the Commission, in December we criticised you, but now we must welcome the Commission' s efforts and I am quite happy to say that the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, has actively contributed to our reaching an agreement which makes it possible for there to be a legislative programme and a work programme."
"Please carry on in this way."
"Specifically, you have asked us to support you in relation to having more civil servants and more resources in order to deal with enlargement."
"I would remind you that Parliament already indicated in Agenda 2000 that enlargement could not take place without amending the forecasts for 2000."
"You have added Afghanistan and other priorities."
"The Council should be hearing this because it is the Council which is most intransigent."
"No representative of the Council is present."
"I have noticed that Mr Poettering, in a display of generosity, has not applied the Poettering doctrine; I imagine that if the Secretary of State comes, he will apply it; he will say that it should be a Minister."
"But, in any event, it is important that the Council should also hear this message from the Commission."
"You have our support."
"Mr President, I am not going to go into detail on each of the issues because they are all very important and there is a degree of convergence. I will make a final point."
"In relation to the Convention, we are in agreement; I also welcome the fact that you said it was a joint initiative of Parliament and the Commission."
"This morning I read some headlines in a prominent Italian newspaper which said that it had been you alone."
"I am delighted that you have countered what the Italian press has said by pointing out that it has been a joint effort."
"Mr President, Parliament wanted something like the Convention before the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It wanted it afterwards and it wants it now."
"I believe this is very important."
"Mr President of the Commission, you are the guardians of the Treaties, and my specific question is, are you prepared to exercise your powers of initiative in the Convention in order to preserve and strengthen the Community method?"
"Here is a brief response to a brief question."
"Thank you, Mr Barón Crespo, for your positive comments on our progress; moreover, I said in a previous debate that my rhythm was like that of a diesel engine, and diesel engines take a while to get going but then run at full speed and keep going for years!"
"The issue of flexibility in the budget is of paramount importance."
"We cannot confuse the need for rigour and your supervisory obligation and the Commission' s obligation to be subject to your supervision - which is the fundamental basis for democratic legitimacy - with the failure to be flexible and take major new events and changes into account."
"This is a question of adapting to change that we must address together."
"We must succeed in genuinely taking control of the budgetary changes which prove to be necessary and which are discussed and agreed on."
"This is the line we are taking."
"With regard to the joint effort and the comments in the Italian press, I did not say that I was alone but that I was alone the morning of the press conference, and I can assure you that I certainly was alone, for I had Mr Chirac on one side and Mr Jospin on the other, with the journalists facing me, and I can assure you that nobody dreamed of suggesting the Convention then."
"Of course, Parliament had already proposed it - that is clear; it was fiercely debated but it seemed a totally unfeasible project."
"It was only the negative events which made it a clear possibility, and we were able to move forward."
"It is my opinion that, if that crisis had not happened, we would not have the Convention now."
"Of that I am convinced, for even crises can be learning experiences."
"With regard to the right of initiative, it is, of course, the great distinguishing feature of the Community institutions, marking them out from other bodies, and we are committed to it."
"It is vital that we defend it, as you said, and strengthen it, but we must also adapt it, modernise it and bring it into line with Parliament' s work, for the right of initiative is not a weapon: the right of initiative is the driving force behind the institutions."
"We must be totally responsible in our use of it, and that is our aim."
"..."
"And he should fit a turbo to the diesel engine."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, these are important issues you are addressing."
"There is good reason for returning to them and developing this debate."
"I look forward to such a debate' s being held in a few weeks' time with more detailed proposals concerning your priorities."
"Allow me to thank you for your contribution to the new procedure we have now brought about."
"Above all, I want to say thank you to the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio."
"We now have a timetable and new procedures for bringing about better cooperation between the Commission and Parliament when it comes to the annual legislative and work programme."
"I believe that this interaction in the form of a partnership will operate extremely well, that it will be easier for citizens and the rest of us to follow the procedures and that the follow-up will be better, etc. I believe that, as early as in a week or so, Parliament' s different committees will enter into discussions with relevant members of the Commission."
"That is an important part of the work of reforming our various institutions, both for Parliament and the Commission."
"I should like to ask the President of the Commission how those in the Commission intend to proceed with the work in the White Paper, sent out in March of last year, on better forms of governance."
"Many of the issues affecting democracy and the future of Europe will be discussed in the Convention but, at the same time, we of course have 'everyday issues' which also fall under the working title, 'better forms of governance' , for example increased openness, simpler procedures and increased participation on the part of citizens."
"I wonder if you can say something about those matters."
"A question of this kind requires only a very brief response."
"Amongst other things, we are working together with the European Parliament in an interinstitutional group on precisely these matters."
"Huge progress has been made, which has been widely acknowledged, and, most importantly, we have approached the issue of transparency working together with Parliament."
"Clearly, we will only be able to make major changes to the rules in conjunction with the Convention, but I can assure you that we work differently now: we will be changing the rules together."
"Mr President, I thank you for the commitment you demonstrated in saying, with regard to the Convention's task, that we must decide what sort of society we want and what it will demand."
"My question is this: is it to be that society in which everything, including social issues, is governed by the market?"
"Or is it to be one in which social justice continues to be vigorously advocated and given form, with society itself taking its share of responsibility for it?"
"Is the Europe of the twenty-first century to remain a Europe of solidarity, not only within the framework of the European Union itself, but also through cooperative partnership, for example with the states that will not only be joining the European Union, but are, moreover, still European, but not yet Members?"
"This is a crucial question to which, I have to say, we - all of us in Europe - have not paid enough attention."
"Clearly, we are all involved in a battle in which most of us are displaying solidarity - liberalising the markets, standardising rules, streamlining systems, eliminating monopolies, abolishing privileges, which are certainly very important operations - but, and here I share Mr Modrow' s concern, we are also faced with a situation in essentially all the European countries of increased disparities."
"These are facts, statistics."
"I am not criticising or passing judgment."
"I therefore feel that it is essential to initiate another debate on these subjects, to focus on them once again, for the European model has always been concerned with justice and solidarity as well as efficiency."
"There is no doubt that, if we fail to do this, we will be sowing the seeds of Europe' s destruction."
"We are, however, setting an example of solidarity."
"Enlargement is a unique event, it is the only instance in the world of countries whose economic situations differ widely being brought together."
"If only others in the world would try to do something similar to what we are attempting."
"This is a practical display of solidarity."
"We must move forwards in this direction, but I would stress that the carelessness with which all of us in Europe are currently treating these major issues of solidarity and social balance is unacceptable."
"They warrant much deeper reflection at this time, and prevailing thought on these matters appears to be far too one-dimensional."
"Mr President, enlargement presents us with really interesting tasks."
"I believe it to be important to the public that we should build visible bridges, one example of which is the bridge between Vienna and Bratislava."
"I believe that we should in fact, as part of the TEN programme - the Trans-European Networks - start on the building of visible bridges."
"I wish to urge the Commission to do everything possible to enable the public to see that these bridges are a guarantee of Europe's future."
"We must not just create visible bridges but rebuild those which have been destroyed as well."
"Indeed, we must not forget that, although the Danube has been reopened, it is served by pontoon bridges and other partially effective remedies for the destruction of war, remedies which only allow some of the traffic to resume."
"Therefore, not only have we failed to make any progress but we have actually regressed."
"I feel we must dedicate more attention and resources to this than we have thus far."
"Mr Prodi, I do not wish to speak about something you have decided on today, but rather on something that you have not decided today."
"It is the issue of the directive on temporary work agency workers, which has been under preparation for a long time already."
"I am disappointed because Parliament has been waiting since last summer for this proposal to come on the table, and I am a bit embarrassed because it seemed that it was almost finished and ready to be published, but last Monday's Financial Times has since published an article with a lot of press complaint against this proposal."
"It looks as if the Commission is giving in to such pressure and postponing the decision again, so I should like to ask you whether you really are impressed by these kind of press campaigns and when are you planning to issue the proposal?"
"I think it is a proposal which fits in perfectly with the Barcelona summit and should be presented before that summit."
"May I remind you also that the Social Affairs Council of next week has already scheduled it on its agenda."
"In all sincerity, Mrs van den Burg, we do not base our agendas on what we read in the financial pages: we set them according to our own criteria."
"This issue of temporary work has been scheduled for debate on 20 March for some time: we chose 20 March because we needed to fine-tune certain technical aspects since, as you know, there are certain specific rather than general solutions which impact on cost and services in the different European countries."
"Therefore, approximately a month ago, when we set our agenda, we decided to give ourselves until 20 March, not least because it was not envisaged that the issue would be debated at Barcelona."
"However, we will focus on this matter when the Commission meets immediately after Barcelona."
"Mr President, it seems wholly appropriate to me that the Commission should focus on enlargement and on emergency situations in countries such as Afghanistan next year."
"My question to the Commission is: how does it intend to fund these operations?"
"Is the Commission looking to fund these from existing Headings 4 and 5, in other words by shifting the funds?"
"Is it looking to obtain extra funds from other budget headings or is it looking for a complete break from the financial perspectives and to present a completely new budget for next year?"
"I will give a very brief response and then Mrs Schreyer will go into the details."
"We have presented a document on enlargement in which we remain within the constraints of the Berlin agenda."
"We have made huge sacrifices and we have also aroused some discontent in the candidate countries, but the transfer of resources is considerable for we will be giving the new countries 4% of their national income each year, which is an absolutely huge, unprecedented amount."
"I will now give the floor to Commissioner Schreyer, who will give you the breakdown of these transactions."
". (DE) Mr President, I will reply to Mr Mulder's question by saying that 2003 will of course also see a great deal of the foreign policy budget being taken up, because European policy is being faced with ever greater demands."
"We will be able to raise the funds needed for Afghanistan, as promised at the Tokyo donor conference, from the foreign policy budget."
"New things may also, for example, be required of us in respect of Cyprus."
"If the successful outcome is actually achieved, with a political process leading to Cyprus's accession to the EU in 2004, this will mean that we will have to make preparatory funds available in 2003."
"That, then, will be a new requirement - and let me add that I hope this will be so."
"The Council has decided, within the framework of the common foreign and security policy, to send a police task force into Bosnia from 1 January 2003 onwards, and this too will make demands on the European budget."
"I believe that we should work together on this, affirming that we also want part of this mission, being a joint action, to be jointly financed, and that is something we have to make clear."
"Mr Mulder, we had the opportunity to talk about this yesterday."
"The Commission has proposed a new financial instrument for crisis operations, and I am gladdened by the many expressions of support there have been for this in Parliament."
"Together, perhaps, we can convince the Council that the right response would be to fund such emergency measures on a Community-wide basis."
"Mr President, let me say a few words about the Mediterranean Bank."
"I welcome the way the Barcelona process is being made deeper and given a more definite form."
"I would again like a definite answer about something I cannot comprehend, namely why you decided against this facility, which, in this year alone, could demonstrate with what commitment we are working on a pro-active Mediterranean policy, whereas - as we learned from our experience with the foundation of the 'Bank for Eastern Europe' - a bank or its subsidiary needs a longer period of time even to become operational, and is much more expensive in terms of personnel and budget allocations."
"Quite apart from that, have you even found a political solution to the problem?"
"If we need partners in the Arab states - where there are already so many funds that certainly not all the Arab states will get involved - what will you do if Israel also wants to participate in this bank?"
"Would this not handicap its foundation from the start, and would it not therefore be better to start work on a facility capable of demonstrating to everyone the European Union's commitment to a Mediterranean policy?"
"Let me ask in conclusion: When will the Commission, as guardian of the treaties and thereby obliged to watch over the Member States' commitment to Europe as a community based on law, send a warning letter to Member States which jeopardise the rule of law?"
"Thank you, Mrs Randzio-Plath, for bringing the debate back to the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank, for I have realised that there are some other issues that require clarification."
"You made the direct comparison with the EIB, and it is precisely in order to avoid a long start-up period that we have opted for a structure in which the European Investment Bank holds the majority share."
"The EIB has EUR 9 billion invested in that area, it has experts and an established way of operating."
"I have, of course, in recent days, been in almost daily contact with President Maystadt regarding this matter, discussing the technical side of the issue."
"For their part, they can see no problems or obstacles and are ready to get off to a quick start."
"Moreover, in my speech just now, I stressed that there have been no defaults on payments."
"Why have I mentioned this, Mrs Randzio-Plath?"
"Because, in my opinion, this shows that the EIB is proceeding with extreme caution, that it is pursuing this policy with all possible care, but, at the same time - and this would not be possible with a facility - we can undertake operations which we have not attempted before: we can be much more active in the private sector and we can work together with local, regional and national banks, thereby greatly increasing our action; we can thus have a very different type of activity."
"This structure also provides part of the answer to your second question."
"I can see - and I would stress that we are still at the stage of the Commission proposal and so we can still explore the matter further - that the countries of the southern shore of the Mediterranean appear to be content with a structure with which they can form a relationship and work together and in which they can be shareholders and sit on the management board."
"In other words, we have opted for this compromise formula to enable these countries to make an active, responsible contribution - they can sit on the management boards and have an active role - and, at the same time, to exploit the experience of the EIB, on which we can all rely."
"Which countries will take part?"
"It is open to the countries of the southern Mediterranean, but we have not addressed the specific issues because they will be dealt with in a political debate with the Council, nor the future debate with the third countries."
"For now, I believe that it is right to take this path, to link Europe and the southern shore of the Mediterranean; to start work and see what opportunities present themselves in the future."
"I can assure you, however, that we have also reflected on the problems of coordination with the World Bank, which already operates in this field but only has a quarter of the EIB' s investments, employs four fifths of its resources in a single country, Turkey, and, in other words, does not have a general activity dedicated to the Mediterranean; the African Development Bank operates throughout the Mediterranean but with negligible impact."
"Our bank' s responsibility for development will be absolutely vital, and the choice we have made strikes precisely the right balance between innovation and caution."
"Mr President, first of all an observation about the Convention which begins tomorrow with a draft agenda that is completely unacceptable."
"Mr Giscard d' Estaing will adopt a position on whether MEPs' proposals are good enough to be translated and debated."
"Every MEP must naturally be entitled to make proposals and have them translated, put on the agenda and, finally, voted on."
"Today our delegation has obtained the fifth draft agenda."
"We are not familiar with the first four, and I would therefore ask our own President to ensure that, in future, we are given all the documents as soon as they arrive in Parliament."
"Turning now to the Commission President, Mr Prodi."
"I see that the Commission is opposed to a competence catalogue which is able to place limits upon the EU' s activities."
"In that connection, I should like to ask Mr Prodi whether, at least, the debates in the Convention might not be prepared for by putting forward proposals as to what might be transferred back to the Member States if, for example, there was an obligation to halve the number of laws."
"To draw up a competence catalogue, knowledge of each individual area is required such as only the Commission and the national governments have at their disposal."
"Finally, I should just like to thank Mr Prodi for the fact that, two years after the decision, we can now obtain agendas and Minutes from meetings of the Commission."
"That is major progress."
"Mr Bonde, I have not gone into the issue of competences."
"I merely said that we first need to establish what we have to do together and then the debate on the working of the institutions will follow on from that."
"I feel that the most important thing is what the Union will do in the future, what role it will play in the globalised world and, therefore, what tasks have to be performed at Community level for these objectives to be achieved."
"Subsequently, we will move on to the debate on competences, which will clearly be based first and foremost on applying the principle of subsidiarity, which we want to avoid violating at all costs and which will serve as a guide as to what we can and cannot do."
"Thank you President Prodi."
"I want to thank the President of the Commission and Commissioner Schreyer for assisting with this communication this afternoon."
"Can I just remind colleagues that this communication offered a possibility for the first time here today to hear the general strategy of the Commission."
"It does not replace or displace the debate which is foreseen for March 20."
"That debate will include the participation of the Council of Ministers and of the Presidency-in-Office."
"That was not foreseen for this session."
"It is never the case that a Commission communication followed by questions leads to a full debate, nor is it the case that the Council normally attends and I should like the record to indicate that."
"Mr President, I have just one brief comment to make."
"Mrs Karen Fogg is the EU Commission's representative in Turkey."
"She is in a great deal of difficulty, as her e-mails were not only intercepted and read, but also published in a newspaper, and a great effort was required to get Turkey to put a stop to this."
"As this also has to do with contact between the EU Commission's representative and Parliament, I ask you, Mr President, to bring it to Turkey's attention that we find this unacceptable and that we expect Turkey to leave no stone unturned in finding out whether the secret service or someone else was behind this, and to prevent personal and official e-mails being published in newspapers."
"Mr Swoboda, could I point out to you that last week already, because I agree with the seriousness of this issue, I spoke personally and directly with the Turkish Ambassador to the European Union and conveyed what I am sure was the collective concern of this House."
"Mr President, I asked earlier to take the floor for a point of order."
"This is what I wanted to say:"
"Mr President, a few days ago, the Pastrana government took advantage of provocation in the form of hijack, which was condemned by the FARC, which denied it had any part in it, to break off peace talks and start mercilessly bombing the buffer zone, putting into action the United States' 'operation Colombia' to wipe out the FARC and resolve the problem militarily, at the expense of the interests of the Colombian people."
"It goes without saying that, under this American operation, paramilitary teams will be shipped in after the bombings have spread death and destruction in order to finish off the job."
"I should therefore like to call on you, Mr President, when you intervene to try and get the green candidate released, to ask the Pastrana government to halt the bombings, release the hundreds of FARC members being detained in inhumane conditions, together with your three Irish compatriots being held in the same inhumane conditions, and call for the peace talks to resume."
"That, of course, is the first statement which with I opened the sitting today and I made precisely that call."
"Request for the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Pasqua and Mr Marchiani"
"The next item of business is the two reports (A5-0032/2002 and A5-0033/2002) by Mr MacCormick, on behalf of the Committee of Legal Affairs and the Internal Market concerning requests for the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Pasqua and Mr Marchiani."
"In these cases which are before us, there are very serious allegations levied against two Members of Parliament, which are stated on the first page of the explanatory statement of my report, which I recommend to Members to take a look at."
"The procedures were commenced in July 2000, concerning illegal arms trading, influence peddling, misuse of corporate funds, breach of trust and receiving stolen goods."
"This concerned the sale of arms to several African countries in breach of French law on arms trading by companies through which countless transfers and even cash payments were made to a string of different people."
"There is a charge against Mr Pasqua, but not against Mr Marchiani, which concerns illegal funding of an election campaign through acceptance of donations and funding of the European election campaign in breach of the provisions of Article L52.8 of the Electoral Code."
"These being the charges, the first charge concerning illegal arms trading, etc., against both Mr Pasqua and Mr Marchiani, the second against Mr Pasqua only, the examining magistrates are requesting the waiver of parliamentary immunity of these two gentlemen, so that certain judicial supervision measures may be taken against them."
"The Members would be forbidden to enter into contact with certain witnesses, or co-accused, or to visit certain countries and they may be required to put up bail."
"This notification order was forwarded first to the public prosecutor of the Republic at the level of the Court of First Instance, then through the public prosecutor at the Paris Court of Appeal and then from that public prosecutor to the Minister of Justice and by the Minister of Justice to the Parliament here."
"It should be noted, at the First Instance, that the public prosecutor of the Republic firmly supports a request for judicial supervision by the examining magistrates, stressing the gravity and nature of the case and describing it as necessary in principle."
"However, the public prosecutor at the Court of Appeal considered that, and I quote, ""contrary to the view expressed by the other prosecutor, the present request for waiver of immunity gives grounds for reservations""."
"On the one hand, the request for judicial supervision does not stipulate what countries the accused would be forbidden to visit and on the other, following a ruling by the Cour de Cassation, the scope of the proceedings finally to be pursued is still to be determined by the relevant Court of Appeal."
"The Minister of Justice, however, forwarded the request for waiver of immunity, together with the forwarding letters from the public prosecutor at First Instance and at the Court of Appeal, without attaching any further remarks."
"This is the situation in which we have to take a decision."
"I want to say, first of all, that the crimes of which these Members are charged are serious ones."
"We have an absolute rule that we form no opinion either way about the merits of the charges but that the Members enjoy the presumption of innocence."
"The public prosecutor in France is entitled to pursue his duties under law and Parliament takes no side on that issue."
"They are serious crimes and of a kind that would not ordinarily attract parliamentary immunity because they do not relate to the ordinary and proper activities of a Member of this Parliament, or a politician operating in a democratic society."
"It does make it important that I should acknowledge that both Members strenuously affirm their innocence and denounce what they consider to have been abusive elements in the prosecution process."
"However, in the nature of the case, I can have no view and Parliament should take no view about these points."
"The present request for waiver of immunity, therefore, does not concern the issue whether these prosecutions may or should continue in accordance with French law."
"Under Article 10 of the Protocol of 1965, there is no relevant immunity, either for a deputy of the French National Assembly or, therefore, for a French MEP in the face of prosecution on charges of this kind."
"The issue of immunity and the request for waiver relates only to the issue of whether the Court may issue binding orders restricting the MEPs' freedom of movement, or their freedom in making contact with other persons."
"I would draw to the attention of all colleagues that if there are freedoms which are vitally important to the exercise of public representative office, especially in a Parliament of this kind, freedom to communicate with other citizens and the citizens of other countries, and freedom to move as one chooses, is critically important, as part of doing the job."
"In its present form, the request for waiver of immunity seems unacceptably precise and indeed the documents of the case seem to indicate that no attention has been paid to the recommendation for the request of waiver to be taken forward only on the basis of a more specific statement, concerning places and persons involved."
"There is one other aspect of the case which, I regret to say, gives rise to a suspicion that regard for the conditions of free parliamentary debate has not sufficiently animated the prosecution, and that is the fact, which was disclosed in the course of this, that the prosecutor at one point asked our President, your predecessor, for details of the voting records of these two Members in order that the possibility of their having exercised improper influence could be pursued further."
"Article 9 of the Protocol, as President Fontaine sharply reminded the prosecutor, makes us entirely free from any legal proceeding whatever in any expression of opinion of vote cast in performance of our duties as Members of this Parliament."
"In these circumstances, the Legal Affairs Committee, and I wholly endorsed its view, proposes that the request received from the French Minister of Justice for waiver of immunity ought to be rejected in the form in which it has been presented to the Parliament."
"I hope that decision, together with the explanatory statement, will be forwarded, if it is adopted by the Parliament."
"This may not be the end of this matter but, in the form we received it, this request for waiver of immunity was in the view of the Legal Affairs Committee unacceptable, and I commend that view to the House."
"Mr President, I will not be availing myself of my two minutes."
"The Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats shares the rapporteur's viewpoint and that of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"We, too, are opposed to the lifting of immunity."
"Mr President, I would like, if I may, to make some comments that have been inspired by this report."
"My first comment is that this report deals with a serious matter."
"Firstly because the charges are serious, and secondly because this relates to the freedom of individuals and the freedom of Members of Parliament."
"I have four comments to make on this report."
"First of all, a debate is clearly taking place on the purpose of parliamentary immunity - something that the general public do not understand and which is perceived as a privilege, even though it should not be a privilege."
"I think that this debate must be held especially since the general public does not understand the issue and that the charges are particularly serious and particularly significant."
"Having said this and be that as it may, under the Rule of Law, the procedure must be strictly observed and we must ensure that these matters are considered in law and that procedures are strictly observed."
"My third comment is that the media coverage of these procedures is not compatible with an impartial justice system and the requirements of an impartial justice system."
"My final comment is that the Europe of human rights is obviously not yet in place, that there is no habeas corpus in France, although a great deal of progress has been made, particularly as a result of the support given by Mr Jospin' s government to the issue of the presumption of innocence."
"Nevertheless, with 125 suicides committed each year in prison, France may have abolished the death penalty but it has not yet eliminated it altogether."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Professor MacCormick, for his work on these two very difficult and contentious reports."
"However, there are two points which I would like to make in particular with regard to these requests."
"Firstly, there is a hint, maybe not explicit, of political interference with regard to the judicial operation of the investigation into these alleged crimes committed by Mr Pasqua and Mr Marchiani, and secondly, there has been a continuous source of leaking to the media, which obstructs and interferes with the proper recourse to justice and investigation."
"There is an old maxim in the British system legal system called ""justice delayed is justice denied"", and this case has been dragged out again and again."
"Misinterpretation, purposely or otherwise, of the Rules of Procedure of this Parliament has been used to delay it even further, and literally because somebody is a candidate in an election, or forthcoming election, in France, this is being used as a stick with which to beat them."
"We must therefore concur with the opinion of the rapporteur and the Legal Affairs Committee that the way in which this procedure has progressed is incorrect and that immunity should not be lifted, and we should commend that report to the House."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Barcelona European Council"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"Council and Commission statements on preparations for the Barcelona European Council"
"the report (A5-0030/2002) by Mr Bullmann on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Spring 2002 European Council meeting"
"the report (A5-0021/2002) by Mr Karas on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the economic consequences of the attacks of 11 September 2001"
"the oral questions (B5-0006/2002 and 0007/2002) by Mrs Jackson on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to the Council and to the Commission respectively on sustainable development strategy for the Barcelona Summit"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the European Parliament for giving me the opportunity to appear before the House."
"I appeared before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 7 January, and it is a pleasure for me to be able to present the economic and financial priorities for the six months of the Spanish Presidency, particularly in relation to the Barcelona Summit."
"Since 7 January, when I appeared before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, there have been significant advances on certain aspects, such as the agreements between Parliament, the Commission and the Council, in relation to the harmonisation of financial services."
"On behalf of the Presidency-in-Office, I would like to thank the parliamentary groups for the efforts they have made, especially the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to reach an agreement in this area."
"In a little less than two weeks time, the spring European Council will take place under the Spanish Presidency in Barcelona, and I would now like, Mr President, to give details of the main economic issues this Council will deal with."
"Firstly, it is beyond doubt that the launch of the euro, on which a report will be presented to the Barcelona Council, has been a success not only from a monetary and technical point of view but also from a political point of view, as a result of the considerable support it has received from all citizens throughout the European Union, throughout the eurozone, and also the efforts made not only by the European Central Bank and its excellent staff, but also by very important sectors of European society, such as the financial sector and the commercial sector, to make the physical introduction of the euro a success."
"In this respect, European society owes a debt of gratitude to all those workers and professionals who have contributed to the consumers and families having been able to enter the era of the euro so easily."
"I believe it is also important to point out, as I did in the meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 7 January, that the introduction of the euro must be understood as a response, not only of acceptance of the single currency, but also a positive response from the citizens to the processes of European integration and also the processes of economic reform and change."
"And, in this regard, I believe that the slogan of the Spanish Presidency, 'more Europe' , is perfectly compatible with the spirit of those millions of European citizens who have accepted from the outset the existence of a single and common currency for us all, or at least for the eurozone."
"One of the characteristics of the beginning of 2002, from an economic point of view, is undoubtedly the slow-down of the European economy, which was more pronounced than initially expected and which saw negative product growths, even in some of the large economies, and the Barcelona Summit is therefore to take place within a context in which the growth potential of the European economy - the capacity of our economies to grow - is becoming one of the citizens' demands, and the Presidency believes that they must receive a response from government, the European Parliament and the Commission."
"I believe that, regardless of the speed of the response from the European authorities on some occasions, as in the case of the events of 11 September, what is beyond question from the point of view of economic growth, and given the good macroeconomic foundations of the euro economy, from the point of view of both budgetary stability, which I will refer to later, and from the point of view of inflationary pressures, the Presidency believes that the potential for growth is the key to recovering the confidence of the European citizens in sustainable and stable growth throughout the region."
"In this regard, it will be the potential for growth in the medium and long term which will lead to an increase in employment and near full employment in the European Union, as indicated in the Bullmann report which is going to be discussed during this same sitting in relation to the spring European Council, that is, the Barcelona Council, together with the Karas report on the economic situation following the attacks of 11 September."
"For all these reasons, I believe that the Barcelona Council must highlight certain aspects relating to the coordination of economic policies, but above all, the structural reform aspects."
"Mr President, I would like very briefly to refer to the coordination of economic policies in EU Member States, particularly those in the eurozone, and indicate that the fundamental instrument for the coordination of these policies, together with the Stability and Growth Pact, are the broad guidelines of economic policy, which, as Parliament well knows, are approved by the Ecofin Council, after being accepted by the European Council in June."
"Therefore, the Presidency believes that the Barcelona European Council will guide Ecofin on the main issues to be included in the broad guidelines of economic policy and these proposals will be included in the Key Issues Paper which the Presidency will communicate to the Barcelona Council."
"In that Presidency document, which is being drawn up at the moment in accordance with the results of the informal debates of Ecofin in February and the next Ecofin of 5 March, with all the countries of the European Union, the Presidency intends to strengthen the coordination of economic policies between the Member States, and particularly in the eurozone, to consolidate the commitments which guarantee budgetary balance, contribute to the sustainability and quality of public finances, and promote, without doubt, the growth potential of the European economy by means of structural reforms."
"Mr President, I will comment on two points in particular: coordination of economic policy and structural reforms."
"In relation to the coordination of economic policy, there is no doubt that the consolidation of the internal market and greater integration and interdependence amongst the economies of all the Member States points to the need for greater coordination of economic policies throughout the region and particularly in the eurozone."
"I would point out that the broad guidelines of economic policy are an essential instrument that should be specifically targeted at the eurozone with a greater intensity than on previous occasions."
"Furthermore, in relation to the coordination of economic policies, there are requests from various countries, which the Presidency believes to be very well-founded, which point to the need to improve and harmonise European statistics and indicators, both macroeconomic and in relation to structural reform, and also to carry out a periodic analysis of the policy mix in the eurozone, which ensures that the combination of budgetary and monetary policies, with an independent European Central Bank, are consistent with the needs of the European economy."
"In this regard, as I announced on 7 January to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, at the end of January in the Eurogroup there was an initial analysis of the policy mix with a report both by the European Central Bank and by the Commission and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which concluded that, at the present time, the orientation of macroeconomic policies - both monetary and budgetary - in Europe, is suited to the needs of the European economic cycle and the Spanish Presidency intends to hold another specific debate on policy mix before the end of June."
"From the point of view of the coordination of economic policies, I must mention the need to maintain the principles of macroeconomic stability and reduction of public deficit, which ensure the stability of the eurozone and the whole of the European Union, and, at the same time, guarantee the development of interest rates in the medium and long term which are compatible with a recovery of investment and business confidence, which are essential to the recovery of all the economies of the region."
"In relation to the political commitment of the European countries to the stability pact and the convergence plans, I would like to repeat that there is currently a commitment from each of the Member States to achieve budgetary balance by the target date of 2004."
"Furthermore, we are analysing the sustainability and quality of public finances, analysing the effects of generational pyramids and the ageing of the populations in each of the countries, and the Commission, as Parliament knows, has reiterated to the Member States the need to take measures which ensure the sustainability of public finances."
"It is in these very first few months of the year that the Ecofin Council analyses the Member States' stability and convergence plans for the current year, that is, for 2002, and that review has taken place in the meetings of January and February; the Commission' s recommendations on each of the convergence and stability plans have been unanimously approved at those meetings."
"In the case of those countries which were most out of line with their initial forecasts, as a result of the slow-down of the economic cycle in relation to their respective internal demand, there have been clear commitments to comply with the objectives of the stability pact in both the short and the medium term."
"In the chapter on structural reforms, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Barcelona European Council is going to pay particular attention to the liberalisation and opening up of various markets."
"I would like to refer specifically to three areas which are going to form part of the central nucleus of the Barcelona Council: the reforms of network industries, the liberalisation of the financial and capitals markets and also the reform of the labour markets."
"I will comment on the three areas in that order, Mr President."
"Firstly, in relation to the reforms of the network industry, which principally involve transport and energy, there is no doubt that over recent years there have been asymmetrical liberalisations within the European Union, which, in order to update the degree of liberalisation in all the countries of the region, now require movements in the same direction and of the same intensity that will guarantee, on the one hand, the same situation of liberalisation in all European markets, and therefore the absence of disparities which may affect competition throughout the Union, and at the same time also a policy of exchange or of cross-border networks which will allow us to create a genuine market of supply and demand at European level, in relation to both transport and energy."
"The Presidency believes that the Barcelona Council must mark the beginning of a genuine energy market which exceeds the minimum limits laid down in the current directive, and this requires the adoption of ambitious liberalisation timetables in the gas and electricity sectors in order to favour the free choice of provider, especially in the companies market."
"As demonstrated by the experience of the countries which have made most progress in the liberalisation timetables, these measures must be compatible with greater quality of service and with security of supply, in accordance with the public service nature of electricity supply in all the countries."
"Nevertheless, liberalisation must also be accompanied by homogenous instruments for measuring the openness of markets in all the countries of the region and also transparent rules on access to transport networks which ensure the existence of genuine competitiveness for third countries that want to participate in a liberalised domestic market."
"Furthermore, the process of liberalisation, as I have said, must be accompanied by quantified objectives for interconnections between the networks of the Member States, and this requires the implementation of the measures contained in the legislative package approved by the Commission on 21 December, including the proposals for the development of infrastructure projects and changes to the system of funding trans-European energy networks."
"From the transport point of view, Mr President, the Presidency believes that the Barcelona Summit should have two objectives: on the one hand, to promote the single sky package for air transport, and on the other, to promote the railways package in order to gradually introduce competition into the provision of services, essentially in relation to the transport of goods."
"I will now refer to the financial markets, Mr President."
"The completion of the process ..."
"Mr President ..."
"Is it customary in the European Parliament to offer the speaker water?"
"I am sure we can look after the Council Presidency."
"Thank you very much, Mr President, for your compassion towards the Presidency-in-Office of the Council."
"Not all parliaments are so friendly to the government."
"With regard to the reform of the capitals and financial services markets, the Presidency believes that completing the process of integrating the European financial system is a fundamental challenge within the general objectives of the Presidency."
"In this respect, the efforts to create a genuine financial and capitals market in Europe are concentrated on three important areas: firstly the achievement of a fully integrated share market, that is, of fully integrated European stock exchanges by 2003."
"Secondly, the achievement of the so-called 'financial services action plan' in 2005 and, finally, the achievement of the objectives of the 'risk capital action plan' , which is essential to the development of the funding of small and medium-sized companies."
"These are, no doubt, ambitious aims, Mr President, which cannot be achieved - and I believe all the European institutions have understood this - without a more rapid and flexible legislative procedure that meets the needs of markets as dynamic as the financial markets, which, furthermore, are fully globalised markets, as we all know."
"In this regard, and in line with the initiatives taken under the French Presidency, a working group chaired by Mr Lamfalussy was set up and it communicated its recommendations to the European institutions and, after a process of negotiation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, agreements were reached."
"I would like once again to congratulate Parliament on its cooperation in this respect."
"I believe that the first directives the Spanish Presidency will try to promote, and which will benefit from the new legislative framework, are those on which there is already a political agreement as a result of the efforts of previous presidencies, and especially the Belgian Presidency, which I would like to acknowledge here."
"The directive on market abuse is essential - as Parliament knows - to guaranteeing the rules of conduct which investment services companies are subject to and which guarantee the protection of all investors on a European level."
"Furthermore, Parliament is currently studying the directive on financial guarantees, which may be approved under the Spanish Presidency, and to this we must add the regulation on international accounting rules, which will provide a European framework for accounting which will increase the transparency and comparability of information throughout the European financial markets."
"In Barcelona we must also move forward and pay attention to directives which, although they will probably not be adopted during the Spanish Presidency, are going to mean considerable progress and can be adopted under subsequent presidencies; furthermore, the directive on brochures, which is aimed at harmonising the transparency obligations of issuers; secondly, the directive on financial conglomerates, which will provide sensible regulations on a European level, by trying to reduce the so-called systematic risks by means of greater cooperation as established in the Brouwer report; thirdly, the directive on pension funds, which is clearly essential in order to achieve a genuine supplementary pension fund market in Europe, which will benefit workers and all citizens, and which requires a suitable balance between their needs, the security of investors, and freedom to diversify the portfolios of these funds within a framework of security; and progress is also being made on other directives which we hope will be given impetus under the Spanish Presidency."
"Lastly, Mr President, I would like to comment on the reform of the European labour market as a priority of the Barcelona Council."
"There is no doubt that the development of employment in Europe has been satisfactory but not sufficient, as demonstrated by the fact that, at the highest points of the cycle, the European economy maintains structural rates of unemployment, notably greater than those of other regions such as the United States."
"And furthermore there is no doubt that the labour market' s capacity to adapt to evolutions in the economic cycle ensures quicker recovery of the economies and, therefore, more intense recoveries of employment at times of sustained growth or at the high points in the cycle."
"In this respect, the Presidency believes that more progress must be made on active policies relating to labour markets, focussing on groups which have difficulties accessing the labour market, and also reducing the fiscal burdens relating to employment."
"There has already been progress in this respect, but we believe that efforts must continue to focus, on the one hand, on measures on work opportunities such as those based on a review of the Luxembourg process, so that we may have a better system of incentives in relation to work creation."
"With regard to the demand for work, we must promote work-seeking by the unemployed, by means of policies which make it absolutely clear that it is better from both an individual and a collective point of view to work than to be receiving benefit, both in terms of personal development and the financial situation of everybody, and also to promote schemes for extending the retirement age in all our countries."
"There are specific issues such as the increase in the employment of women, special care for women with young children and the reconciliation of their family and work responsibilities, and also introducing greater capacity for European companies to adapt to the evolution of demand, to adapt their costs to European and international demand situations, as well as a system for setting salaries which allows, in addition to the appropriate involvement of social partners, sufficient flexibility and decentralisation which offers companies the margin to adapt to very different geographical and sectorial markets throughout the European economy and the globalised economy."
"Mobility is also one of the challenges, not only on a European level, but on a national level, and particularly on a regional level, and here I believe that policies for seeking better practices and comparisons between the policies of each of the countries are essential measures which must be promoted in Barcelona."
"All these issues relating to the labour market must inspire the review of the Luxembourg process and give impetus to the adoption of the necessary structural reforms of the labour markets in each of the countries of the European Union."
"Mr President, at the European Council, in addition to these three areas of the financial markets, network industries and the labour market, the Presidency is going to incorporate, for the first time, an analysis of the relationship between growth and the environment, or in other words, the need for environmentally sustainable growth, and to this end, it is clear that we must make progress on formulae which guarantee sustainable development."
"I would like to make the following comments in relation to the incorporation of the sustainable development strategy at the Barcelona European Council:"
"In accordance with what was agreed at the United Nations Assembly in Rio in 1997, the Gothenburg European Council added a third environmental dimension to the process of economic reform, as I have said, and in accordance with these conclusions, the Council took note of the need to draw up a 'road map' of an annual nature, with the measures to be taken in the environmental field, within the strategy of sustainable development, and to be taken into account by the Presidency of the Council, in collaboration with the Commission."
"The Laeken European Council welcomed the choice of environmental indicators, for the monitoring of the implementation of the sustainable development strategy, and also welcomed the progress made in relation to the European ratification of the Kyoto Protocol."
"Using the environmental indicators which I have just referred to, which were approved at the Laeken Council on 17 January 2002, a first synthesis report has been presented assessing the process carried out."
"With regard to the Ecofin Council, at its next meeting next week, on 5 March, a report on this issue will be discussed, that is to say a synthesis report which has already been prepared by the Economic Policy Committee and which will allow the Barcelona European Council, as well as successive spring Councils, to continue to guarantee the implementation of the three dimensions of sustainable development."
"The Barcelona conclusions, together with the Commission' s communication, must allow the Seville European Council at the end of the Spanish Presidency, on 25 and 26 June, to prepare the European Union' s position for the summit on sustainable development which will take place in Johannesburg in September 2002."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to mention the framework for the development of entrepreneurs in Europe, which is another concern that various Councils have demonstrated, and which will be taken into account in Barcelona, especially in relation to the development of a suitable framework for small businesses and new entrepreneurs in Europe."
"Last weekend, the Presidency held an informal Council of Ministers on small and medium-sized businesses in Aranjuez, in Spain, which came to several conclusions that I would like to communicate to the European Parliament."
"Firstly, the commitment to hold informal Councils on small and medium-sized businesses, before the structural reform summits in the spring, which can communicate specific recommendations to the spring summits in relation to a sector which represents more than 90% of European companies and a considerable proportion of employment in our countries."
"Secondly, specifically in relation to the Barcelona Summit, the Aranjuez meeting believes that member countries and the Commission must be informed of the need to favour the development framework for European small and medium-sized businesses by means of two methods: firstly, by reducing time limits and administrative costs through the use of new legal instruments which are easier for entrepreneurs to implement and secondly, by using telematic means, and at this first stage of a quicker and less expensive framework in terms of time and costs, to make a detailed analysis of how each of the legislative measures taken affects small and medium-sized businesses."
"Therefore, legislators and governments must think firstly on a small scale, bearing in mind the effects their legislation and regulatory measures may have on small and medium-sized businesses, and they must do so while taking account of the contacts made with the business organisations for small and medium-sized businesses."
"Mr President, with regard to priorities of the Spanish Presidency, the Ecofin Council will analyse next week, on 5 March, a priority which responds to a mandate of the Laeken Council, in relation to the need to improve and increase our presence in the development of the countries of the south of the Mediterranean, seeking instruments which take account of costs, but which also allow the countries of the south of the Mediterranean to play a greater role."
"It is a question of introducing a genuine partnership into the formula for pursuing the economic and social development of these countries."
"This must focus not only on works and infrastructure, but also on the creation of a genuine fabric of industries and private businesses, a genuine economic civil society in the countries of the south of the Mediterranean."
"Work is being done in this regard within Ecofin, in the Financial and Economic Committee, together with the European Investment Bank, on proposals which, probably within the field of the European Investment Bank and in cooperation with the Commission, may allow the existence of a development institution in the Mediterranean, with the priority and majority participation of the European institutions, and specifically the European Investment Bank, but also the borrower countries which can cooperate in the design of development programmes, as well as third countries, inside and outside the region, which wish to cooperate with Europe and with the countries of the south of the Mediterranean on this initiative."
"Lastly, Mr President, the candidate countries will participate in Barcelona and, to this end, the Barcelona European Council has invited not only the Heads of State but also the Economic Ministers, who will hold a meeting on the structural reform of the enlargement countries, together with the European Union' s Economic Ministers."
"I would like to end my speech, Mr President, by thanking the European Parliament for being kind enough to allow the Presidency to participate in this sitting, during which I believe we will not only be able to explain the Presidency' s positions, but also reply to the questions and initiatives which the different parliamentary groups and Members may raise on structural reform in Europe and on the priorities of the Spanish Presidency."
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
"Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I will do my best to be very brief, not least because I have already made one speech today in this House and because Mr Rato y Figaredo has already given a detailed explanation of events as regards Lisbon."
"With any luck, this will also mean that I do not need the Presidential glass of water."
"The European Council in Barcelona will be the first Council since the euro notes and coins were introduced."
"The euro has been a great success, it has been welcomed with great enthusiasm and now we must push ahead with related tasks, including the completion of the Lisbon process."
"This decisive stage which we will be undertaking at Barcelona will take place in a totally different economic climate, for the optimism of Lisbon is no longer present, but the global economic slowdown makes it even more necessary that we complete this strategy."
"Barcelona will therefore be a milestone along that road."
"As Mr Rato y Figaredo said, a lot has already been achieved in these first two years, and my genuine thanks go to Parliament for, especially in recent months, we have worked together in perfect harmony and have achieved genuine successes in the fields of telecommunications and financial services and in many social programmes."
"A great deal remains to be done, however: I am thinking of the Community patent, the Galileo project, which seems to have received fresh impetus in the last few hours - and we truly hope that it will be able to make progress - and the new legal framework for public procurement."
"If we take these decisions, we will certainly be giving a major boost to European development."
"Of course, there are also many areas of concern: the citizens are wondering whether Europe will have the courage to adopt these measures which are necessary for long-term development, whether it will have the courage to take further steps towards the goal of a more competitive, inclusive society."
"When I have conversations with citizens and businesses, I hear them expressing grave concerns, for they do not yet see the tangible effects even of the decisions we have already taken, and this is understandable in that we have completed the initial phase of these political decisions but the work is not yet finished."
"Therefore, it is now up to the Council and to Parliament too, to adopt, without delay, all the legislation, programmes and policies which will complete the Lisbon strategy."
"We will then, at last, be able to move on to the final stage - the stage of practical implementation - and then the citizens too will understand what we are doing."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Spring European Council has become a regular event, and this is another good innovation."
"In spring, we take stock of the economic policies."
"It is a practical demonstration of the interinstitutional dialogue, and I, like Mr Rato y Figaredo, hope that the Barcelona Summit will deliver tangible progress in terms of stimulating reform, job creation, strengthening cohesion and environmental improvements."
"And it is precisely the Council which will have to set the priorities in these matters."
"Barcelona' s first task must be to confirm the firm commitment to macroeconomic stability based on sound public finances and controlled inflation."
"We took this line when responding to the questions posed just now and it applies in this context too."
"This is the basis we need for lasting success, and we will not have wasted the benefits of our hard work or the sacrifices many countries have made in order to be able to enter the eurozone."
"At Barcelona - and this is a sensitive but, I would say, fundamental point of the Commission' s proposals - we will also have to coordinate economic policies more closely, at least within the eurozone."
"We cannot be content with coordinating monetary policy: quite the opposite, the coordination of monetary policy and the single currency make it imperative that we coordinate macroeconomic policies too; therefore, from this moment onwards, there must be greater transparency, more timely provision of information to the Commission and the other countries and common rules of conduct in the field of monetary policy."
"Secondly, the strength of the Lisbon strategy lies in the fact that the measures it contains reinforce one another."
"Each is important in itself, but together they form the recipe for long-term success."
"Thirdly, the Barcelona strategy must contain a response to the present economic situation and an assessment of the progress made by the different countries in implementing their various policies, so that we can see which priorities need to be focused on in the coming 12 months."
"We have to act and invest today to ensure growth and employment throughout the rest of the decade."
"We will therefore concentrate on employment, economic reform and investing in knowledge, as has already been indicated."
"The fourth objective for Barcelona is to take stock of the progress made in the area of sustainable development."
"We must ensure that sustainable development is at the basis of certain specific decisions we have to take, not least, for instance, when it comes to opening up the energy markets and restructuring the transport sector."
"Sustainability can also generate growth and create jobs in areas such as clean technologies."
"This, of course, means that we must provide incentives and resources for this sector."
"Lastly, we expect the European Council to firmly endorse the importance of life sciences and biotechnology: this is an area in which there is no reason why Europe should not lead the world."
"We have a pool of scientists in both the Member States and the enlargement countries who, with the proper organisation, will soon be able to assume this leading role."
"We also - and this is my last point - need to examine the impact of our policies on the wider world, and I expect the European Council to deliver a major contribution towards preparing for the Johannesburg Summit."
"I will end by touching on another subject which will be addressed indirectly but quite extensively at Barcelona, and that is how we should organise our work in the light of the impending enlargement."
"Indeed, we must launch a dialogue with the candidate countries to identify what they themselves can do to pursue the Lisbon agenda and priorities - with help from the Community, of course."
"In other words, although the decisions of this summit will, in theory, concern the Member States alone, in practice they will concern the new countries too."
"We must therefore start off along this common path, this walk together, at Barcelona."
"To this end, the candidate countries will be taking part in a European Council working session, during which the discussion will focus on their views on the Lisbon strategy and its implementation."
"As of 2003, the candidate countries will be included in the structural indicators the Commission uses to assess progress on the Lisbon strategy."
"They must therefore be actively involved in the Lisbon objectives and working methods. Our strategy must be a help, not an obstacle, to their accession."
"Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I am confident that the Barcelona European Council will be the first of the key milestones before us this year on the road to successful implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"Only thus will we be able to build properly on the enthusiasm and heightened public demand for more Europe that we have witnessed at first hand in recent weeks."
"It is my genuine hope that Barcelona will be a success for the Spanish Presidency but that it will, above all, be a success for the European citizens. A success for the whole of Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I see now that you are enjoying the fruits of your labour with a drink of water."
"You had remarked earlier in the House that you likened yourself to a diesel engine."
"I was afraid that you might look for a glass of benzene, which would not of course accord with the security conditions of the House."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to start by welcoming the Commission's presence here in such numbers, with not just President Prodi, but also Vice-President de Palacio and Mrs Reding and Mr Solbes from the Commission itself."
"I believe - and Mrs Wallström is also present, sitting in the second row; I crave your forbearance for not mentioning you at the outset, but being greeted separately is so much more effective - that this shows the importance we attach to cooperation between the institutions of the Council, the Commission and Parliament, a subject on which I shall make a few concluding remarks."
"What the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission said in Barcelona meets with our entire approval."
"In your own country, Mr President-in-Office, you and your own policies have been very successful over the past years."
"You are, though, a natural heir to the tradition of the Lisbon decisions, which are framed in very demanding terms: the most dynamic, most competitive and most sustainable economic area is to come into being."
"We would all, I think, be the better off for more modest language, as criticism would then be less marked when we fail to act according to these principles and in line with these objectives."
"Although it is clear to us that the Spanish Presidency has been led into a difficult situation here - which is why I do not want to criticise the Presidency too harshly - our group would very much have welcomed it if the Finance Ministers of the EU countries had gone along with the Commission's proposals when what was at issue was the requirement that two EU countries should actually abide by the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is, among other things, an institutional problem when those who will be giving out marks at the end of the day who deserve to get bad ones, and when, moreover, these people promise something for 2004, namely, an almost balanced budget, which we already know to be scarcely achievable."
"We therefore call for credibility and stability and urge that we should keep to what we agreed in the treaties on the common European currency."
"Our group stands alongside the Commission, whom I encourage to stick to their stability policy and pursue it consistently, and we would welcome it if the Finance Ministers were to take that on board."
"Mr President-in-Office, you were right to speak about small and medium-sized enterprises, and I was glad to hear that an informal Council has been held."
"I believe that we should, in our economic policy as a whole, give much more attention to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The best economic policy would be for us to maintain a moderate tax regime."
"The more we lift the tax burden from small and medium-sized enterprises and liberate them from bureaucracy as well, the more they will be able to invest and also create jobs."
"That then benefits the workers, and so it is right to put small and medium-sized enterprises centre stage."
"You were right to speak about the liberalisation of the markets, of the markets in transport, energy, and, I would like to add, postal and financial services."
"One could get the impression from the use of the expression 'liberalisation' that it is something that benefits the income of enterprises."
"No, ladies and gentlemen, we must say more distinctly that liberalisation means more competition, more competition means reduced prices, and reduced prices benefit precisely those people - that is, consumers - who do not have such high incomes, and that is why it is important that we bring this competition about."
"In order that I do not go over time, this will have to be my last comment."
"Mr President-in-Office, our group will judge the Spanish Presidency by how it succeeds in reforming the Council."
"Mr Solana, the Council Secretary-General, will, if I am rightly informed, be submitting proposals in Barcelona for reform of the Council."
"There is also now a paper by the British Prime Minister and German Chancellor, and Mr Aznar, the President of the Council, has no doubt followed it sympathetically."
"It is not enough to make public statements, though, if we want to reform the Council; that desire must be communicated to the Permanent Representatives."
"I get the impression that what is being thought by the Heads of Government has not yet reached the inter-institutional working party set up by the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"So I ask you to contribute to the Council's reform of itself, to have it, as a legislature, always sitting in public, and always present here when important debates take place in Parliament."
"If you achieve that, your Presidency will be counted a success!"
"We want it to be a success, because we want a shared success for Europe."
"The Commission is, in any case, standing alongside Parliament, and if we take action together, the success will be Europe's, and from the depths of my heart I want some of its lustre to reflect on the Spanish Presidency."
"By the way, I hope that, next time you visit Parliament, you will at once be given a drink, because we always treat our guests well."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission and the majority of the female representation of the Commission, whose presence we should welcome, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office of the Council began his report with the success of the introduction of the euro, which is a success for our peoples, and which has exceeded any expectations we may have had in any of the European institutions."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has congratulated the European Central Bank and its staff."
"I would be grateful if he would expand on his congratulations to the Commission on the work it has done and, in particular, President Prodi and his predecessor in the post of Minister for the Economy, Mr Solbes."
"I do not say this because I am a fellow countryman, but because of the important work they have done."
"Now, the problem facing us is that the success of the euro demands a response which can only take one form: an active economic policy in Europe."
"We are in a new situation."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has reminded us how the BGEPs, Ecofin and others work; but it has been demonstrated that when faced with problems, things, in the form they were conceived some time ago, do not work well."
"In this respect, the review relating to the economic evolution of the Member States shows that some, politically, have been hunted hunters."
"They created a Stability and Growth Pact in order to monitor others and, in the end, they have had to apply the lesson to themselves."
"But this does not lead me to feel any Schadenfreude, as the Germans say."
"The issue is that in the medium term we cannot safeguard the euro with the current economic management structure."
"Secondly, the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned the structural reforms and the policy mix since Lisbon."
"We see the policy mix as the fight for full employment, social cohesion and sustainable growth, bearing in mind the need for Europe to recover technological leadership through strong investment, above all in human capital."
"In this respect, the important issue is the composition of this policy mix cocktail."
"We believe that it must consist of a harmonious and combined quantity of each of the three elements."
"On this basis, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, please allow me to comment on your proposals on liberalisations."
"My group has been committed for many years, and I am thinking of the creation of the single market with its four hundred directives, of the process of structural reforms which has allowed us to create internal markets within the Union."
"From this point of view, the President-in-Office has spoken firstly about the network industries: energy transport and also, as a network activity, telecommunications."
"We believe that what we have to do, and we have been doing so for some time, is to make progress on the creation of these markets."
"What has surprised us, and I would be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council could explain this to Parliament, is the public statement by the President-in-Office of the Council and President of the Spanish government, and he has not denied it, that, in view of Barcelona, the problem is the confrontation with the Socialist majority, and he mentioned three governments by name, the German, French and Portuguese governments."
"I do not know what form this confrontation is supposed to take."
"We want organised markets."
"We do not believe that liberalisation has miraculous effects such as the removal of rules."
"We believe that what we have to do is establish rules which protect producers and also consumers and citizens."
"I do not want to go into Spanish matters, but the Minister for the Economy has enough work to do in Spain in order to deal with the problems of the liberalisation of the energy market."
"Secondly, with regard to financial services, I take good note of the fact that the Council values the agreement proposed in the von Wogau report on the so-called Lamfalussy proposal."
"But I would also like to point out that, while it has allowed us to get out of trouble, it has not resolved our problem."
"In other words, in terms of democracy, I believe that in the Convention we will have to hold very detailed discussions on the basic legislation and the implementation of the legislation with the possibility of parliamentary control."
"Finally, Mr President, in relation to the liberalisation of the labour market, I believe that many of the things the President-in-Office of the Council has said are reasonable; in other cases he has used so many euphemisms that it is really difficult to know whether the intention is the liberalisation of redundancies or greater flexibility by means of negotiation."
"I would like to express a concern which is felt by our fellow citizens and, if you will allow me, Mr President, I will quote; ""we must condemn the errors of unfettered liberalism, with no rules, one of the main problems of which is uncertainty in the workplace and a model of society in which globalisation brings everything down to precariousness, mistrust and individualism without perspectives."""
"Mr President, this quote is not from Karl Marx but from the Cardinal of Milan, Carlo Maria Martini, who has just retired."
"I believe that this closely reflects a concern which is widespread amongst our fellow citizens."
"It is all very well to move ahead with the reform of the labour markets, in a positive fashion, but there is enormous concern about a form of liberalisation which may lead to the disappearance of the rules of the European social model and also a form of liberalisation which replaces public monopolies with private monopolies."
"In this regard, we hope that the Barcelona Summit is a summit which can bring positive results and does not become a series of pre-electoral confrontations."
"Mr President-in-Office, this House will vote tomorrow on an amendment on your National Hydrological Plan, so we hope you enjoy your glass of water today."
"If the European Union were drawing up an end-of-year report card on the Lisbon process, I suspect that the report would say ""must try harder""."
"Over the last year, we have seen some progress on this agenda, in particular the adoption of the telecoms package in Council, the agreement on the European company statute, reduction of the tax burden by three-quarters of 1% of GDP."
"All of these things help to promote growth and jobs, provided they are consistent with the growth and stability pact, and clearly we need to be shifting the tax burden away from things we want more, like jobs, and onto things that we want less of, like pollution."
"But I am afraid this report card would also show that the Union is failing in too many areas."
"The Commission communication to the Barcelona European Council speaks of a firm commitment to the growth and stability pact, which will help build confidence."
"If this is so, it was sadly lacking when the Finance Ministers fudged an early warning decision on Germany and Portugal just recently."
"The rejection of the take-over bids directive is a major setback to competitiveness in the Union and I challenge the other political groups and the Council to join us in speeding through the new Commission proposal under a fast-track procedure, so that we can get it onto the statute book by the end of this year."
"Another area where we have failed is the failure in Council to adopt a common position on the pensions directive which is essential, not just for a secure retirement for an elderly population, but also for labour market mobility."
"The European Parliament has done its job."
"We gave you our first reading opinion in July of last year and we now look to the Spanish Presidency to send us a common position by June of this year, if we are to meet the Commission's target of adoption by the end of this year."
"Another area where the schoolteacher would rap the Council over the knuckles is the European patent."
"If we want to close the innovation gap between Europe and the United States, we need easier and cheaper and faster pan-European patent protection."
"When it comes to behaviour in class, I am not sure that the Union would score well."
"I welcome the Commission's decision this afternoon to take the Council to the Court of Justice for an attempt to take away the Commission's powers over state aid."
"The reason we have state aid rules is to ensure a proper functioning of the single market and we need to abolish barriers to competition and to free trade to allow the Commission to be the policeman, and the Council should frankly be ashamed of challenging the Commission on that."
"Finally, our report card would show a pupil which is lacking ambition."
"If the European Union is to be a star pupil, we need progress on liberalisation of energy and gas markets, on implementation of the financial services action plan, on agreement of a public procurement framework."
"The process of economic reform is not an end in itself."
"It is about increasing prosperity of our people and preparing the European Union for enlargement."
"What message is it that we are sending to applicant states if we are incapable of implementing ourselves the demanding reforms that we are expecting of them?"
"When it comes to reviewing what happens at Barcelona, we will be judging you by the report card."
"At the moment, the pupil has to work harder."
"Mr President, a lot of things may be going to happen at the Barcelona European Council, but it will not be the opportunity to assess the implementation of the sustainable development strategy that was proposed at Gothenburg: a sustainable development strategy which - I would remind you - is based on the balance between the economy, social cohesion and the environment, three factors which all the European institutions - Commission, Parliament and Council - recognised as being inextricably linked."
"We thought, after Gothenburg, that the idea had been established that the Lisbon objective of making Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 was inadequate as it stood, and that it should be supplemented by the goal of making the Union the most ecoefficient economy."
"Evidently, we were wrong."
"The Spanish Presidency' s commitment to returning to the initial Lisbon philosophy and to confirming the three sacrosanct principles of liberalisation, deregulation and neo-liberal globalisation was matched by the Commission' s marked reluctance to pursue the proposals made last year, despite their commendable nature, and by the explicit decision to make the environmental pillar a sort of almost covert addendum to the Barcelona agenda."
"Indeed, we feel that the Commission communication to the Spring European Council in Barcelona fails to take sufficient account of the environmental factor or of the crucial need for certain changes to the current economic development model."
"This is serious because it is evidence of the inability of the European institutions to ensure any sort of continuity in their pursuit of priorities established by common agreement, which clearly cannot be reshuffled every six months to suit the political preferences of the Presidency-in-Office."
"This is why we feel that the Spanish Presidency' s intention to speed up the process of liberalisation in the most diverse sectors is in direct conflict with the sustainable development strategy."
"We have many doubts regarding the economic and social model based on deregulation, flexibility and further liberalisation of the internal market, as recently confirmed by Mr Blair and Mr Berlusconi in their joint statement, which, it is no coincidence, made absolutely no reference to sustainable development."
"We are particularly saddened by this in view of the meeting due to take place in Johannesburg, where all the world' s Heads of State will meet to assess the environmental situation 10 years on from Rio de Janeiro."
"However, we do feel that the Barcelona Summit should be treated as an opportunity to make substantial progress in incorporating environmental issues into the European Union' s policy package and, to this end, it is vital that we assess and review all the sectoral strategies."
"I would like to touch briefly on the issue of energy efficiency, Mr President, which is an area that is clearly still extremely problematic. In this context, we feel that it is essential to reiterate the importance of renewable energies."
"Of course, we are also completely opposed to the increasing pressure, not least from the Spanish Presidency, to reopen the debate on nuclear energy, for it is dangerous and outdated in terms of both acceptance by society and environmental sustainability."
"In other words, Mr President, we fear that Barcelona will be a wasted opportunity from the point of view of achieving the agreed sustainable development goals."
"We hope fervently that we are wrong and we look forward to meeting again to review the situation after the Barcelona Summit."
"Mr President, the Lisbon process was unclear and ambiguous right from the beginning."
"It contained two different strategies."
"The one strategy prioritised cutting-edge technologies, research-based innovations, e-commerce, the liberalisation of network markets and such like."
"The second strategy prioritised full employment, social integration and education for all, instead."
"In that way, all the groups could imagine they had won in Lisbon, and everyone could therefore applaud the decisions."
"Now, however, we see ever more clearly the gulf between the two ways: that which pinned its hopes on the élite and that which put its faith in the ordinary people, often the weaker groups."
"I think that, as rapporteur, Mr Bullmann has really endeavoured for as long as possible to preserve unity and the policy of compromise on socio-economic matters."
"We can nonetheless see how certain Member States and political parties have become increasingly impatient and wish to abandon the route of a compromise policy."
"We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left view many of the amendments that have come in with great concern."
"If they were to be adopted tomorrow, the majority of our group would feel compelled to vote against them in the final vote."
"We should not do that with any pleasure, but there are limits."
"One simply cannot just go on compromising."
"We shall therefore follow the vote, amendment by amendment, before we adopt a position."
"Finally, I wish to lodge a protest against the fact that almost no account at all has been taken of the candidate countries' needs and interests in our discussion prior to the Barcelona Summit."
"There are only a few years left before enlargement, and it is high time that we began to face that reality head on."
"It is a shame that we have not taken a clearer and more comprehensive view of this state of affairs."
"When we come to prepare for a summit of the scale and size and opportunity that is presented by Barcelona, it is necessary to take into account what has happened in the past and to try to predict with some certainty where we need to be in the future: It is wrong for any group of people, whether the Council, the Commission or even this Parliament, to think that we have to come up with new ideas for every single summit."
"There are so many things that remain to be done and so many priorities that were set down at Lisbon, Stockholm, or Cardiff that have yet to be completed, to be achieved and to be reached."
"We ought to focus more on improving the quality of the proposals that we put forward, ensuring that they respond to the demands and needs of the peoples of Europe, and more importantly, ensure that they lay down a solid foundation for the future development of economic prosperity, of stability and of sustainability."
"I do not believe that there is a conflict between economic development and sustainable development, nor that we cannot put in place an aggressive taxation policy to create employment, to ensure that business and industry can have a competitive environment in which to succeed and prosper, and that does not necessarily lead to the detriment of social protection, or of investment in social services like education, health and infrastructure development."
"I would certainly oppose all measures or any ideas towards harmonisation or coordination of tax policy within the European Union."
"This is an area that is exclusively within the remit of the Member State governments alone, and it is wrong and has been proven wrong many times, that, to use the simple analogy of previous eras, higher taxation means that you can spend more on social protection."
"That idea has been turned on its head by the economic realities of existing Member States - also by the performances of other Member States, such as in my own country in particular - Ireland, where an aggressive reduction in taxation policy, reducing the cost of labour and the income tax levy and ensuring that business can survive in a harmonious industrial relations environment with the majority of the earnings that the workers are getting going into their pocket and not going into taxation; while at the same time, increasing the levels of protection that are available for those who are most vulnerable within our society and increasing investments in education and health."
"There is a new and different way forward that can succeed and operate for the betterment of the governments and the European Union as a whole, but most importantly for the betterment of the people."
"What we bring forward from the Lisbon process and the Lisbon summit, most importantly of all, is access to education, training, learning and knowledge."
"If we do not give the skills to our people in order to take advantage of new employment opportunities that are out there, then we deny them the real human and civil rights of participating fully in society."
"If anything is to come out of the Barcelona summit, it is a re-endorsement and re-affirmation of the importance of lifelong learning and a knowledge-based society with education and training for all."
"It is the most important aspect to come."
"Fine words have been spoken at past European Council meetings about the integration of sustainable environmental policy into economic and social policy."
"Unfortunately, these fine words are not reflected in the plans which are being presented to us under the Spanish Presidency."
"Muchas palabras sin hechos."
"This is why I would call on the Council and Commission to take the Gothenburg environmental agreements seriously, and to translate these into concrete policy plans."
"This means in the first place that an unequivocal system of indicators must be put in place."
"Strong cohesion between indicators is very important in this respect for the development and assessment of a sustainable environmental policy."
"This system of indicators must obviously be integrated into the way in which the development of economic and social policy is measured."
"Secondly, the sustainability impact assessment, as promised by the Commission, is to be developed in the short term."
"In addition, I should like to ask you to give your attention to the liberalisation of the energy market."
"Opening up the energy market must not lead to the unwanted formation of monopolies."
"If there is to be a proper guarantee of the supply of energy, government intervention to ensure supplies must still be possible."
"Situations such as that in California can still be prevented by intervening in the Commission' s plans in good time."
"Mr President, not only words, but deeds are what we need, precisely in those areas where we have a responsible role as stewards of God' s creation."
"Mr President, with the Barcelona European Council in mind, the Commission has just presented an action plan for the mobility of people in Europe, which, in our view, contains several debatable points."
"Some proposals are, admittedly, based on obvious common sense such as lifelong learning, better coordination of social security systems or the transferability of pension rights."
"The Commission' s initiative, however, is written from a strange point of view."
"First of all it states that geographical mobility is five times higher in the United States than in Europe, as if the intention was to render the nations of Europe identical to the United States."
"This would be a serious misinterpretation."
"Our real objective, which is what most of our fellow citizens want, is the respect for nations and also for the lifestyle, culture and language to which they are rightfully attached."
"Let us not switch round the priorities on the sly."
"To do this would be to take a truly totalitarian approach."
"The Commission has also slipped calls for a common immigration policy into this action plan which really do not belong there."
"This is another matter altogether."
"We should not use this method to force the States to adopt guidelines, of whose existence they are not fully aware."
". (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am glad that the report on the economic consequences for Europe of 11 September is being debated in the run-up to the Barcelona Summit and in the Bullmann report, as the consequences of 11 September are very closely connected with the future development and implementation of the Lisbon process."
"Although many have returned to their daily business, the attacks on 11 September dealt the Western world a shock, as terrorist acts on this scale had hitherto, in any case, dwelt in the realms of science fiction."
"At the same time - and this is very important to us - they struck at a crucial stage for the global economy, marked as it was by perceptible slow growth in most of the industrialised countries."
"It is for this reason that I would like to warn the Member States and enterprises against seeing the events of 11 September as the sole cause of the contraction in economic activity and using it to cloak their own economic and political omissions."
"Our economic problems were, to a great extent, exacerbated by 11 September."
"We have to distinguish precisely between the problems that existed even before 11 September and were further aggravated by the attacks, and those which, in contrast, arose only after them."
"It often, though, seems today as if - thank God - the terrorist attacks' adverse effects on the European economy are being contained, and, as Mr Duisenberg was saying only a few days ago, problems in several areas have now resolved themselves."
"The sectors which were disproportionately affected were, and are, the insurance industry, to a slightly lesser extent the tourist industry, above all the conference trade, and the incentives sector."
"It was fortunate that enhanced economic activity in the internal market in tourism made it possible to regain a great deal of ground."
"Insurance for large-scale industry, as well as airlines and airports, have been particularly affected."
"Parliament's report makes a very clear distinction between these two areas."
"We are also glad, and we should say so today, that cooperation between the European Central Bank and the American Federal Reserve, between Mr Greenspan and Mr Duisenberg, has worked."
"The euro has proved itself in this difficult stage, and the erosion of its value, albeit striking and shocking, has not resulted in a global economic crisis or in a monetary crisis in Europe."
"At the same time, we have also seen that we are still, and by a long way, insufficiently independent of the American economy, and that our internal market and the economic activity within it is not yet sufficiently independent of global economic developments."
"This is where we have to begin at home, and so what we ask of the Barcelona Summit is a new offensive on the growth and innovation front, aimed at stimulating growth, investment and employment by means of justifiable optimism about economic activity."
"We need to look carefully at where there are still hindrances to the internal market."
"Where are directives not yet being transposed?"
"Where is the implementation of common objectives such as the Action Plan for Financial Services, the Lisbon process or yet others being held up by differences about competences?"
"We must do everything possible to support the establishment and economic structure of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"My group has therefore tabled an amendment to Mr Bullmann's report, calling on the Commission and the Member States to make it their concern, in the revision of the new capital accords in Basle, to take the structural characteristics of European enterprises into account, help small and medium-sized enterprises and to create the underlying conditions in the new EU capital base framework, so that the process being moved forward in Basle, which is the right one, may not result in adverse consequences, but lead to support for the economy."
"I also think that we have to make more use of our right of initiative in order to remove the hindrances to the internal market, become more autonomous and, at the same time, to make fully effective the economic potential that exists in Europe, in line with our objectives."
"If this happens and we learn the lessons of 11 September and take ourselves seriously, then we will be able to make even better use of the opportunities arising from the new worldview, and of our role in the world in accordance with our supersedence principle, of the environmentally responsible market economy, and perhaps get them more in motion."
"Mr President, this is a debate which is going to take very different routes depending on which committees Members sit on."
"As a Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I want to concentrate on environmental issues in the context of Barcelona."
"The first thing is to stress the importance which the Committee on the Environment, and I hope the European Parliament, places on the addition of an environmental dimension to the Lisbon Process of annual assessment of economic growth and social cohesion."
"Indeed, we were really rather surprised in the Committee on the Environment that the environmental pillar of sustainable development should not be considered of equal importance to the social and economic pillars."
"I would like to take this opportunity of expressing thanks on behalf of myself and my colleagues to the European Environment Agency for the work that it has done in relation to the environmental indicators."
"The director of the Environment Agency, Mr Beltrán, will be retiring soon and we are very grateful for the work that he has done."
"It is also important that we should not leave these indicators floating in the air while congratulating ourselves on the fact that we have produced them."
"In the view of the Environment Committee, it is very important that we link their production to clear targets and timetables for the work of the Commission and of the Parliament."
"I would make a domestic point to my colleagues here, namely that we really address the issue of sustainable development better in this Parliament."
"We ought to organise, for example, an annual debate with an annual assessment of progress in all our committee areas."
"It is essential to continue to see that environmental considerations are taken into account in other policies."
"This is something which environment commissioner, Mrs Wallström, has always been very keen on."
"She faces a tremendous uphill struggle."
"One policy which illustrates the desperate need for environmental considerations to be taken into account within it is fisheries."
"I represent the south west of England."
"We have a number of fishing ports and we are currently facing the consequences of a desperate failure to take environmental considerations into account when operating the Common Fisheries Policy."
"We have exhausted fish stocks."
"We have fishermen with no fish to catch."
"We have dead dolphins being washed up on the beaches of Brittany and Cornwall because industrial trawlers are trawling them up in the middle of the channel and then leaving them for dead."
"That is a very good example of non-sustainable development and the Parliament ought to get involved in doing something about it."
"Sustainable development is going to be very important in the context of enlargement."
"The likelihood is that the applicant states in eastern and central Europe will want to be like us as soon as possible - heaven help them."
"That means that they will want more roads, more cars, more transport emissions and so on."
"More damage to the environment will probably be done and we have to find a way, without being culturally imperialist about it, to ensure that rapid economic development in the countries of eastern and central Europe does not damage the environment, particularly the natural environment, in the new Member States."
"Rio and the Rio Summit is going to bring forth an absolute cascade of words."
"Whether or not Rio means anything and brings about any concrete results remains to be seen."
"It is a pity that the Commission has produced its document so late that we cannot give at this point our collective view in the context of Barcelona."
"That document for Rio contains some very good points, especially the emphasis on providing incentives for environmentally and socially sustainable trade."
"One thing I would highlight from the position of the Environment Committee is the need for the European Union to sort itself out when it comes to addressing the issue of genetically modified production in the countries of the third world."
"In December in South Africa there was news of a large increase in the acreage in South Africa which is under cultivation for genetically modified products."
"What is our message to a country like that?"
"Do we say that the more you produce of that, the less you can export to us?"
"Is that going to be a sustainable message to give them when they want to make a living for themselves?"
"Finally, a word on the dreaded Spanish hydrological plan which has moved across the screen of the European Parliament increasingly frequently."
"It is not a good idea to condemn one Member State for action taken in good faith by a democratically elected government."
"In this instance, the Spanish government has submitted an environmental impact assessment in relation to the plan and the European Commission is considering it."
"This is not the point at which we should start condemning Spain."
"The Spanish hydrological plan will be a very difficult issue for the British Labour Members of the European Parliament to decide how they are going to vote."
"Even at this moment, Mr Tony Blair is desperately cultivating Mr Aznar as an ally, so the British Labour Members are caught between supporting their Prime Minister and voting against Mrs Roth-Behrendt who has tabled the amendment."
"That is not an enviable position to be in and I do not envy them."
", draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. (ES) Mr President, if it is a trait of the high-born to be grateful, I would like to begin by saying to Mr Bullmann that I, being of the extreme centre, am extremely happy to have reached an agreement, a compromise, with him."
"Secondly, as a generic request from both the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I would now ask the Council to involve the European Parliament in both the definition and the monitoring of the strategies established in Barcelona."
"As Pablo Neruda said, the work we have to do is like the old wine of my country; it is not produced by one man but by many, and not from one plant but from many."
"My third point: the areas of agreement that have been expressed here."
"I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council that it is absolutely essential to maintain intact and unharmed the dogmas of price stability and budgetary austerity, both for the large countries and for the small ones."
"We in this Parliament well know how monetary delights and budgetary frugality end: like days of wine and roses."
"They lead to nothing more than a headache the next morning."
"With regard to structural reforms which increase competition, those benches have shown a certain reticence, certain reservations."
"In the field of the liberalisation of strategic sectors such as transport, electricity, gas, telecommunications or financial services we must not move backwards, even in order to gain momentum."
"Fourthly, I also agree with other speakers that we must attach importance to strategic development factors: lifelong education and support for small businesses."
"I would say a final word to Mrs Jackson."
"The National Hydrological Plan is not, as the amendment says, an example of unsustainable development."
"It is a fine example of sustainable development, because it is a question of taking water from where there is a surplus of it to those places where some days we pray for rain and on others we are moving around in boats following a storm."
"As she has pointed out very correctly, it is a parliamentary decision by a legitimate parliament following a broad discussion and with the almost unanimous support of the National Water Council, in which all the Autonomous Communities, including the Socialist ones, are represented."
"Somebody has been selling false currency in this Parliament."
"I would ask you to bring them to account and that this false currency be exchanged for a good one, for a genuine one, like the one we now have in the European Union."
"Mr President, I will begin by noting an interesting development in this House."
"The criticism is levelled over and over again - and, I think, rightly - that we do not engage in debate."
"The latest consequence of that is that we now have Barcelona, 11 September, and water."
"I venture to doubt that that will add up to a debate."
"I will speak, though, on the subject to which my Committee devoted its opinion, the fallout from 11 September."
"Here are a couple of core theses to add to what Mr Karas, I think quite rightly, had to say: one should not overestimate it as an event, but the experience of its impetus has taught us that we are vulnerable, and the first consequence of 11 September was, and is, that politics has once again become the driving force."
"It has done so whether you like it or not, as even the leading captains of industry have conceded in the meantime, but we too must be honest about the fact that it is precisely at the European level that politics is failing!"
"Secondly, 11 September made it even clearer that the greatest peacetime redistribution of assets in human history is jeopardising peace and also taking away market opportunities, and that right across the board, which is leading, through the failure of politics and the new situation in which we are now, to enterprises having demands made on them from the centre."
"For them, 11 September might well have been an opportunity, if they had gone about it in a credible way, to do what global politics has not been able to do so far, that is, to unreservedly support human rights."
"We are discovering something quite independent of 11 September - but, again, taking shape because of that event - the changes in all sectors of the market, with growth in many of them."
"I am thinking of counter-terrorism, of what we are considering doing in space, and mobility."
"If neither politics nor business can come up with what they should, consumers have power through their freedom of choice, and they now want enterprises to act in way that is socially, and not only environmentally, responsible."
"I am therefore very glad that what we got through the Industry Committee, that is, the call to consumers to demonstrate social awareness when buying goods, is now also to be found in the main report."
"What is missing, though, is the great logical conclusion to this, which we had taken through the Industry Committee, and the absence of which from the main report I regret."
"We need a global Marshall Plan, without which we will have drawn the wrong conclusions from these events, and without which Barcelona, too, will be ineffective."
"Mr President, in the report for the 2002 Spring Summit, the committees on Employment and Social Affairs and Economic and Monetary Affairs have attempted to point out innovative approaches, and, in many areas, they succeeded."
"Speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, I congratulate Mr Udo Bullmann on the work he has done and also on his capacity for dialogue and compromise."
"What has to be on the agenda in Barcelona?"
"Firstly, reform of the education systems."
"The PISA study provided something of a salutary shock in Germany."
"Training and education are at last being given political priority."
"In order to be moved forward, the pupils need greater demands to be made of them, with all-round education as early as possible, and specialisation as late as possible."
"It is only through comprehensive knowledge, including languages, that they will have unimpeded access to the labour markets of Europe, which will be open to them."
"Secondly, reform of the systems by which people are employed."
"The total of unemployed people in the EU stands at 13.6 million, and this is a development that is not going to be done away with by giving statistics on the labour market cosmetic treatment."
"The management of unemployment must give way to perceptibly increased employability through training schemes, market-driven continuing education and connection to the Internet."
"Simplistically concocted and standardised solutions, such as the reduction of working time across Europe, are of little weight."
"We need intelligent, discriminating solutions such as more flexible working times, tailored to different sectors and regions."
"Thirdly, reform of the social partnership."
"Social dialogue must prove its worth, all the more so when times are hard."
"The European social model has made a significant contribution to the peace of society and to increased productivity in Europe."
"As a model, it is flexible and far from rigid, and so it deserves to be extended."
"Fourthly, the way in which the social partnership is regulated."
"Workers have a vested interest in small businesses and trades, which are the backbone of all in the EU's national economies, securing 70% of all jobs and 75% of all apprenticeships."
"They should be helped to set up and to become innovative."
"They are in a permanent learning process, through which they achieve a considerable growth in experience."
"Qualities such as these must not, though, be undermined by the burden of taxes and levies and by the excessive regulation of SMEs."
"Fifthly, reform of the States' budgets."
"Our group insists that the obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact must be adhered to by all the countries in the eurozone without exception."
"Not even downturns in economic activity may be misused to soften it."
"It was only the threat of a warning letter that led at last to a consistent austerity policy being at least hinted at in Germany."
"That all expenditure by the State should be tested applies, though, not only in my own country, but is true of all subsidies."
"I have great confidence in the Spanish Presidency, which knows the value of our European social model, and how important sustainable economic growth is."
"Let us trust in its ability to motivate us at the Spring Summit in Barcelona!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we live in a dangerous world, even if, from the outside, the European Union appears to be a haven of peace."
"Of course, not everything in Europe is perfect."
"We must modernise our economic and social structures and we must prepare for the challenges of globalisation in order to seize the opportunities that it presents."
"In doing so, the Socialists want to protect the European social model."
"Social justice and social inclusion must remain our constant objectives but this does not prevent us from reforming the employment market."
"But if flexibility and mobility are a cure-all for full employment, how do you explain the recent rise in unemployment in the United States?"
"In the Silicon Valley, the heart of the new economy, unemployment currently stands at 6%."
"The workers concerned, who are generally highly qualified, are not moving away."
"Those who are forced to leave are the 500 000 non-American specialists who had received temporary work permits under a special law."
"When comparing employment markets, we cannot disregard the fact that there are 2 million Americans in prison, versus 80 000 in Germany or 60 000 in Great Britain."
"The American model is not always to be commended."
"To sum up, we accept social reforms but are against 'social dumping' ."
"Following the Lisbon Summit, Barcelona is expected to step up economic reforms."
"The Socialists do want to achieve a real internal market."
"Liberalisation, however, does not mean deregulation."
"Liberalisation calls for better rules and a genuine monitoring of these rules; the Enron affair should be a lesson to us all."
"By modernising its economy, Europe has a duty to maintain efficient public services for its citizens, particularly the least affluent."
"At a time when the United States is rediscovering the virtues of public service, Europe must not bring down its own."
"The Socialists are in favour of macro-economic stability."
"However, the Stability and Growth Pact must be applied in a non-dogmatic fashion but attention must at the same time be paid to the global situation."
"We need budgetary discipline, but we need flexibility as well, when the state of the world economy demands this."
"Today the Americans are showing us their pragmatism in terms of budgetary and fiscal policy."
"We are also in favour of globalisation, but reject globalisation that has no well-defined and multilaterally accepted rules."
"We reject globalisation that offers no solidarity, particularly to the developed countries."
"Yet - and the events of 11 September serve as a cruel reminder of this - the developed countries can only live in peace if they help to resolve conflicts which allow dogmatic agitators throughout the world to convince unemployed young people that they live in a world that has no prospects."
"It is up to us, Mr President, to show them that a common future is possible."
"Mr President, it has been no easy task to formulate Parliament' s discussion paper for the forthcoming summit."
"Mr Bullmann has done his best, and I thank him for that."
"My group would nonetheless make reservations about a number of points in the report, certain parts of which are, in our view, pervaded by a fear of liberalisation."
"For us, there is no contradiction between a free market economy and good social conditions. On the contrary."
"Experience shows that, in by far the majority of cases, we all benefit as consumers from free competition guaranteeing low prices and good quality."
"At the Barcelona Summit, government leaders will have to adopt positions on a very ambitious plan of action for promoting qualifications and mobility in the EU over the next five years."
"I think this plan is a really good initiative."
"Decisions must be made at EU level to make life easier for those who wish to seek new challenges by studying, or taking jobs, in other EU countries. They must be guaranteed social rights."
"However, there is also a long list of initiatives that the Member States must implement in order to strengthen the various forms of education."
"This must be done through open coordination, and I think it a splendid idea that we should implement open coordination in this area. I just think it important that it be accompanied by an open debate involving all the parties concerned, for, without such an open debate, there is a democratic deficit in the method of open coordination."
"I also think we must take care that open coordination is not used out of all proportion and that we do not set common European objectives and quotas for everything under the sun."
"We should then end up by destroying a good idea, and we are not in any case in favour of open coordination where child care is concerned."
"Mr President, as a Catalan, I am pleased that Barcelona will be the capital of Europe for two days."
"I fear, however, that the great expectation that my fellow countrymen have of the Union will be disappointed."
"The Heads of State and Government will be gauging the progress we have made in meeting the challenge set at Lisbon."
"Catalonia, however, is expecting a great deal more from Europe than this rather puerile challenge: first of all, it is expecting the European Union to acknowledge Catalonia for what it is, in other words, a major nation."
"It is also expecting the Union to recognise its ancient language, spoken by almost 8 million people, as an official language and a working language of Parliament."
"Lastly, it is expecting to be able to fully participate, as the major nation that it is, in the various European bodies."
"It is hoping for a political Europe where encouraging the spirit of enterprise does not mean discouraging those who crave justice."
"A Europe where liberalisation does not mean the liquidation of public services."
"A Europe that is concerned about sustainable development and which is consequently unable to adopt the National Hydrological Plan, in spite of all the pressure that is currently being put upon us to do so."
"Catalonia is hoping for a Europe that welcomes immigrants and shows solidarity for people who fight against new forms of colonisation."
"Catalonia needs Europe, without a doubt, but Europe also needs Catalonia."
"Seny - Catalan common sense, in other words - would work wonders at the Council and the Commission."
"In a few days, my fellow countrymen will, no doubt, firmly express some of their aspirations much better than I can."
"I hope they, or rather we, will be heard."
"Mr President, what stands out in the Commission document is, on the one hand, the acknowledgement that the backdrop to the Lisbon strategy was an economic growth rate of 3%, which did not reoccur in 2000 or in 2001 as a result of the economic slowdown that took place and, on the other, the document focuses on two fundamental objectives also mentioned in the Bullmann report: fulfilling the objectives of the Stability Pact, specifically the 'zero deficit' strategy, by 2004, and the speeding up of those processes that are lagging behind."
"Consequently, although it acknowledges that we are still seeing worrying levels of poverty and of inequalities in income, the proposals it makes are designed to exert greater pressure for the liberalisation of public markets, the creation of a single market for risk capital by 2003 and of financial services by 2005, the opening up of the electricity market by 2003 and of the gas market by 2004, pushing ahead with a second package of liberalisation in the rail sector and the commitment to reforming the labour markets."
"Although the document puts forward some positive measures in the social sphere, with the halving of poverty levels by 2010 and the adoption of social inclusion indicators, the fact is that speeding up privatisations, the attempt to make the labour market more flexible and the insistence on applying the rigid criteria of the Stability Pact whilst failing to take account of the diversities of the Member States and the serious social problems that some of them face, will lead to greater poverty and unemployment."
"The trust that employers as a class are placing in this Barcelona Summit is telling. Hence our firm opposition to this Commission document."
"The Bullmann report, which was initially reasonably balanced, was then ruined by moving too close towards the positions put forward by the Commission, another reason why we should oppose it."
"Mr President, the right-of-centre government in my home country, Denmark, has today appointed an internationally recognised con man, a Mr Lomborg, as leader of the government' s so-called Institute for Environmental Assessment and in that way taken a major step towards abolishing any kind of sustainable development."
"Through its verbal manoeuvrings, euphemisms and concealments, the EU's Council Presidency is more elegant at overcoming social and global conflicts, but the overall result is the same."
"It is claimed, for example, that the integrated transport systems programme is of benefit to the environment, but the development of the EU' s motorway network since the Treaty of Maastricht was adopted ten years ago has, alone, led to a 15% increase in traffic-related CO2 emissions, and that is quite independent of the political resolutions to reduce total emissions."
"There is nothing in the programmes to suggest radical changes."
"The summit programme represents everything but sustainable development, and that is true not only in an environmental perspective."
"What, then, of global social and economic sustainability?"
"What Barcelona is mainly about, of course, is consolidating and developing the EU countries' share of world economic domination."
"It is not only the environment that is being sacrificed, it is the great majority of the world' s population."
"The link between the EU' s full-blown capitalism and the political and military oppression it practises is frighteningly clear - only not to the EU élite."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I fully endorse the recommendations in Mr Bullmann' s report, particularly the appeal to respect some of the goals established at Lisbon, which are based on a vision of the welfare state in which it is not just a mere appendage to economic policy but an essential part of a sustainable development policy seeking to achieve full employment and raise the quality of employment."
"I also support many of the - sound - recommendations made in Mr Karas' report."
"However, the strategic role assumed at Lisbon by the research and development policies of promoting education and lifelong learning and increasing the active population and the employment of older workers requires that these goals be part of an economic and social policy developed and decided by a single entity according to an agreed decision-making process, not least using forms of open cooperation."
"From this point of view, the delays which have accumulated in public and private investment in research and lifelong training, which - I would remind you again - make the processes of mobility and flexibility dependent on the achievement of the absolutely imperative conditions of security and employability, are cause for concern."
"Still more disturbing, however, are signs of a slackening of efforts to develop a policy mix which combines responsibility for coordinating economic policies promoting sustainable development with responsibility for coordinating the employment and social cohesion policies, introducing a new era in social dialogue."
"If the significance of this sort of approach, which seems currently to prevail - that is, separating once again the common economic policy, which is, moreover, often implicit, from social policy, which is in danger of being relegated to the status of an auxiliary policy - were not actually to be acknowledged at Barcelona or if it were not to be openly discussed, that would irreparably compromise the goals set at Lisbon for the period 2002-2010."
"This danger is all the more serious in that it appears to coincide with the aim of a transnational political front which is openly seeking to distort the strategic content of the Lisbon decisions."
"This is the case with a document signed by the Italian and British Heads of Government which endorses not structural reform but deregulation of the labour market and the abolition of collective bargaining, making it subject to voluntary opting-in of individual employers and workers."
"This is a violation of Article 30 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which cannot be accepted or endorsed at Barcelona."
"Mr President, while of course the liberalising thrust of the Lisbon process in the Barcelona Summit is welcomed, I would like to bring to your attention two warnings."
"Firstly, what we do not do, and what we refrain from doing, is as important as what we are positively trying to do."
"We should learn in the name of competitiveness to refrain from burdening and cluttering the European Union from excessive regulation or initiatives which are not strictly necessary."
"In that perspective, I hope the Barcelona Summit will turn its attention to the crucial issue of regulatory impact assessment."
"Too often, initiatives are launched without the full impact on business, on the environment, but also on consumers and administrations, first being fully examined."
"Let us all turn our attention to tightening up the hurdles which we need to leap over before we actually launch initiatives."
"The second warning is this. The Lisbon process - and no doubt this will be picked up at the Barcelona Summit - is now groaning under a whole series of targets."
"Targets are fine, but they can quickly undermine the credibility of the process if the targets are either not met or are simply met by Member States through a statistical sleight of hand."
"I would appeal to the Council and the Commission to be wary about implementing and establishing too many targets if those targets are clearly not always going to be met."
"My group has long been critical of the Lisbon process, not least because of its unquestioning belief in economic growth per se, with no attempt at any qualitative evaluation of it at all, yet we still cling to this as a key indicator of economic wellbeing and assume that that means social wellbeing as well."
"If I have to fence my house, put up burglar alarms, catches on the windows, etc., it may be good for the economy, but it is not good for my quality of life."
"We also criticise the ambition about being the most competitive knowledge-based economy, on the basis that in any competition, there are going to be losers, both within the European Union and globally."
"What we are looking at with Lisbon is that we have to beware that social cohesion, which was another of the goals, does not become a casualty of our search for competitiveness."
"We are also very much aware that Lisbon is not enough."
"Gothenburg added the environment and the promise of Spring summits, which Barcelona is, as sustainability summits."
"In my group's view, all summits should be about sustainability, but I would settle for at least one a year as a start because the environment underpins our economic development, and if you do not have sustainability, you can kiss goodbye to the stability pact."
"Mr Bullmann's original report gave us a comprehensive reminder of a number of issues concerning employment, social cohesion and the importance of sustainability, but I think we saw considerable tension introduced with that report, with certain EMAC resolutions; not least, paragraph 25 and its push for liberalisation with no qualitative evaluation on the social and environmental side whatsoever, and paragraph 36, which tells us that the European Union did a very good job at Doha in our push for the liberalisation of world trade as the catalyst for international growth."
"We have to get away from this idea that sustainable growth somehow means 3% year after year, if that is going to eat up our finite resources and pollute our environment."
"We have to decide as a European Union what we mean by sustainable economic growth and it is not what we are voting about here."
"Mr President, More Europe, the theme of the Spanish Presidency, is an objective that we support in principle."
"The real question, however, is what Europe?"
"At a time when the European Union is in need of strong economic and social growth and must meet the aspirations of its citizens who are making their voice heard, the Barcelona Summit is being heralded as a decisive step in achieving an accelerated liberalisation of public services that the President-in-Office of the Council earlier referred to as 'a network industry' ."
"Liberalisation provides the magic answer."
"We face growing expectations of more ambitious and high-quality public services, however."
"Can this just be national self-interest?"
"I think that this need is universal."
"The sizeable disparities that exist between countries in terms of people' s access to these services justify drawing up common European standards that will allow harmonisation to be carried out from above."
"It is not fewer public services that should be on the agenda, but more public services, which have been improved through development, by being made more democratic and through modernisation."
"The Union still believes that public services, or services of general interest, are an exception to the rules of competition."
"They must instead become the heart of European social cohesion, the key to action for a progressive Europe, and become one of its reference points and one of its values."
"When presented with the progress report on cohesion in the Union, will we continue to destroy with one hand what we are trying to achieve with the other?"
"The Barcelona Summit will not restrict itself to this issue, of course, but the fundamental problems are the same: the economic situation, the fight against terrorism, enlargement, the need for more democratic institutions; that is, so many issues which call for renewed consideration of the meaning of the European Union and its goals, with the first meeting of the Convention opening tomorrow."
"It is no longer sufficient to include the formal reference to 'a more social Europe', and to the fact that we need to be closer to the people."
"We need strong signs and practical action."
"The answers predicted to come out of the summit are not yet moving in the right direction - very much the opposite in fact."
"A more liberal Europe is unfolding behind the More Europe theme, and this is the credo of the market."
"The people have other expectations and they will express these expectations forcefully at the demonstrations that will take place on the eve of the Summit."
"It is crucial that we listen to them."
"Mr President, Mr Rato y Figaredo and Commissioners, I believe we are debating a very important topic today, and I am delighted that this is being done under the Spanish Presidency."
"Nowhere has unemployment fallen so dramatically as in Spain."
"I calculated a moment ago that the Union' s total unemployment figure has fallen by 1% thanks to Spain' s enormous efforts."
"Without these efforts, we would have had an unemployment figure of 9.5%; instead it is now 8.5%."
"I think this is an exceptionally important achievement which should be emulated in some other countries."
"This achievement has been brought about by a combination of economic reform, social dialogue, etc., and the intention is to follow this example across all European countries."
"There are also a few unfortunate developments, of course."
"The first one has already been mentioned by Mr Poettering, namely the issue of the warning letter in Germany."
"How did this come about?"
"I should also like to mention two perfidious features, the first one being that a country that is not a member of the eurozone, namely Great Britain, should intervene in eurozone matters."
"It is not their concern, they are not involved in it in any way; yet they still help make a qualified majority impossible."
"This is really outrageous!"
"At this rate, Putin and Bush will soon have a say in our interest rate."
"This is not acceptable and, in my view, we should put an end to this at the earliest opportunity."
"The second perverse feature, the internal German Finanzausgleich, is of a different kind. In the Stability Pact, we try to avoid getting into debt, but in the German Finanzausgleich, the accumulation of debts is rewarded, and federal states which have no need of getting into real debt are forced to do so nevertheless."
"This must also be put a stop to."
"If we can manage to do this, this will benefit our economic role which will become more community-oriented."
"Mr President, I personally considered the decision taken at Gothenburg to incorporate the environmental dimension in the Lisbon process to be crucial."
"However, I feel somewhat pessimistic about the possibility of the forthcoming Spring Council developing that approach coherently."
"I will limit myself to mentioning the three main reasons for this pessimism, in the hope, of course, that I will be proved wrong. Firstly, the slow pace of the attempt to place the environmental dimension on a genuinely equal footing with the economic and social dimensions, evidence of which is the fact that only some of the indicators for assessing progress made have been established thus far."
"Secondly, the excessively closed way in which the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategy is being managed, without the European Parliament, or the regional authorities or social partners either, being involved as they should. Thirdly, the delay in the endeavours of the Community institutions, including Parliament, to bring their activities into line with the principle of sustainable development, a principle which allows neither completely separate departments nor overlapping responsibilities."
"This concept of development is based on the principle of policy integration and therefore requires maximum coordination and cooperation and the creation of joint planning, guidance and monitoring instruments."
"The reason for all this is fundamental: innovation, research, training, quantity and quality of work and valuing the environment and culture are increasingly becoming elements of the same policy."
"These requirements are clearly expressed in both the Bullmann report and the motion for a resolution discussed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and they therefore have my full support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we in the Liberal Group support the general approach and objectives presented by the Spanish Presidency for the Barcelona meeting and we were able to discuss them in detail when Vice-President Rato y Figaredo appeared before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Nevertheless, I would like to make a few comments."
"One is that we believe that, by the end of the Barcelona European Council, there must be a timetable for the objectives set."
"Two years have passed since Lisbon and the truth is that, if we look at the evolution of productivity levels, for example, the evolution of the economy itself, not in absolute terms, but in comparison with the United States, or the failure to achieve certain fundamental objectives such as the liberalisation of certain sectors which are still over-protected and which clearly distort competition, the results of this process are not so far satisfactory."
"Therefore, in order to make the meeting of the European Council credible, in addition to creating another list of things to be done, as has often been said, we must establish a clear relationship between the objectives and the timetable."
"Mr President, two years after the Lisbon Summit, the most optimistic and most willing Europeans recall the announcement of a new paradigm: to make the European Union the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world and achieve greater social cohesion."
"This strategy, which was finalised at Gothenburg, is becoming a strategy for sustainable development in the environmental and social spheres."
"We wanted to believe this, we would like to believe this, we still want to believe this, but, in reality, the integration of economic, social and environmental dimensions is still merely an illusion."
"The Spanish Presidency, however, is not pretending."
"It is working with great honesty."
"It perceives the Union' s sustainable development to be the efficiency of markets, goods, services, capital and employment."
"Can we pretend to believe this?"
"They want to sell us the accelerated liberalisation of the markets, transport, electricity and gas, although they know that this will result in our being less capable of supplying services to combat poverty, to provide social protection; it will bring about less territorial cohesion and fewer high-quality jobs, as all the studies have shown."
"We are providing flexibility in the employment market and the mobility of employees instead of a real job creation policy."
"Mr Bullmann' s report is trying to achieve the impossible."
"He would like to have his cake and eat it."
"He wants the commitments of the Stability and Growth Pact to be fulfilled and to see investment in education, research, the environment and networks."
"He wants high-quality employment and flexibility in the market."
"There is no doubt, in our view, that the real priorities of the Barcelona Summit are the development of the social economy based on solidarity, an independent income, including for young people who are slipping further into poverty, a real definition of services of general interest, a reduction in working time, investment in the environment and lifestyle."
"These, in our opinion, are the priorities of the Barcelona Summit."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr President of the Commission, I wish to limit myself to speaking about Mr Karas' report."
"Firstly, it is to be welcomed that a distinction is drawn between actual economic consequences of 11 September and political and economic deficiencies that preceded them by some considerable time."
"It goes without saying that the European Union must allow Member States to support enterprises with serious problems that really are attributable to the consequences of the attack, in order to alleviate or prevent adverse effects on their employees, whether these effects are direct and commercial or are associated with these and of a social nature."
"Secondly, though, it is irresponsible for enterprises to take steps to rationalise - in other words, cut jobs - out of hand, and unjustifiably defend this by reference to the events of 11 September."
"It would in fact be nonsensical and damaging to use State aid to intervene in such situations."
"Thirdly, the assertion that the European Central Bank's cutting of interest rates and the introduction of the euro in Europe could nip an international financial crisis in the bud, is one that I consider incapable of being proven."
"Fourthly, additional adverse consequences for the economic situation, such as the rapporteur fears, might be brought about by increased expenditure on the armed forces and on internal security, can be drastically minimised by a sensible policy of development, which would focus on removing such causes of terrorism as poverty, oppression, exploitation and cultural intolerance."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in these two minutes I would like to concentrate on a related matter that will play an important part in the Barcelona Summit."
"Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, has mentioned that the biotechnology action plan proposed by the Commission will also be on the agenda."
"I believe it is a good thing that this will be discussed in Barcelona, as biotechnology offers opportunities for growth and employment."
"I think it right that the Commission should be advancing so courageously on this issue."
"I will state openly that most applications of genetic technology and biotechnology throw up no fundamental ethical problems, and so biotechnology should be supported, and, in that we save resources by its astute use, biotechnology can also make a contribution towards sustainable development."
"However, Mr President of the Commission, there are also well-founded concerns."
"I get the impression that, in the Commission's action plan, these well-founded concerns tend to be presented as a problem of acceptance, so that all that is needed is enough talk and public information and there will then no longer be a problem."
"Parliament, though, has always emphasised that there are also requisite boundaries, boundaries that are necessary in themselves and which we have to lay down politically in order to protect health and the environment, but also on ethical grounds."
"For we are no longer the European Economic Community; we are the European Union, and so we need common values, with the consequences that derive from them."
"I therefore consider it false of the Commission to deal with stem cell research in a very wholesale way in their document, which does not sufficiently distinguish the ethical problems."
"Mr Aznar has done things very differently in recent days."
"He has explicitly aired the ethical problems."
"I would like to call on the Council and the Commission to give their attention to these problems."
"I wish to ask my fellow Members to support Amendment No 27 to the Jackson resolution, in which we have precisely and even-handedly dealt with this balance between opportunity and risk and call on the Council to act appropriately."
"I want to address three points. Firstly, the liberalisation of the energy market, secondly the European research area and the flanking measures which need to accompany the sixth framework programme, and thirdly, entrepreneurship."
"On entrepreneurship, is it not about time that we heard some of the results from the many benchmarking exercises which have been undertaken?"
"Is it not time that we named and shamed those Member States who are not taking the actions necessary to improve entrepreneurship and competitiveness?"
"The European Parliament's Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has voted on the liberalisation directives for gas and electricity and we have reached the conclusion that if liberalisation takes place without paying attention to the environmental, consumer and social consequences, you are embarking on a dangerous journey."
"We would ask, for example, that energy efficiency be used as an indicator in the Lisbon and Barcelona processes."
"If a Member State is so inept that it does not use energy intelligently, it will never be competitive."
"It is one of the best indicators of the will of that country to do well in today's world, so we ask for indicators there."
"And please, tell us what your many benchmarking exercises have shown."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has drawn up a fine resolution on sustainable development."
"Everyone is in favour, yet when it comes to specific initiatives, the support base dwindles very quickly."
"The Aznar government currently wants an annual European subsidy of EUR 1 billion for its Plan Hidrológico Nacional, a ludicrous plan, which flies in the face of sustainable development, to transport water across one thousand kilometres instead of saving water and desalinating sea water."
"The Commission is tempted to give this 1 billion. This is unacceptable."
"That is why I urge all fellow MEPs to support Amendment No 10, including the reference to Spain."
"Allow me to conclude my speech with the following words in Spanish: El plano estupido del Gobierno Aznar no pasará."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, to put the environmental dimension on the same level of importance as the economic and social dimension and to act accordingly means stopping talking about sustainable development and actually getting down to implementing it."
"To be vigilant and demanding in relation to the application of the sustainable development criteria in the Member States with regard to their compliance with European legislation and the application of Community funds is the obligation of the Community institutions."
"The motion for a resolution from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is an initiative which insists on these aspects and it therefore deserves the support of this House."
"However, to bring a national issue such as the National Hydrological Plan to the European Parliament, in the context of this resolution, is a grave error which has nothing to do with the desire for sustainable development but which has to do with an intention to abandon the principles of subsidiarity and autonomy on the part of the Community institutions."
"Mr de Roo, to try to deprive a Member State, a priori, without good reason, of the Community funds necessary for its economic development and for the social cohesion of its regions is, in reality, to go against the very sustainable development of that Member State. The Spanish National Hydrological Plan is not an enemy of sustainable development."
"Its approach is based on a total commitment to compliance with Community environmental legislation and the criteria underlying the sustainable development strategy. It has the majority support and approval of the competent national institutions and constant national and Community scientific and technical supervision."
"Improving the quality of life of more than fifteen million people depends on its implementation and the immense majority of the Spanish population show support and solidarity towards it."
"Our electors expect us to offer appropriate responses to the issues on which we have to take a position."
"The best political responses are the result of reflection, prudence and a profound knowledge of the issues; under no circumstances do they result from demagoguery."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, often it seems that education plays second fiddle to the issues of market liberalisation, technological innovation and indeed the promotion of telecommunications and entrepreneurial infrastructure."
"However, the Bullmann report calls to our attention that all these measures come to absolutely naught if we do not have an educated citizenry that can create, operate and service these sectors."
"Therefore, education in the context of a sophisticated manufacturing and entrepreneurial milieu in a society that requires frequent switches in skills basis and a society that requires mobility across borders, becomes a precondition, a predeterminant, of our success in a knowledge economy, not simply one of the results of its successes."
"How can we hope to have a competitive, dynamic economy when Member States today have substantial proportions of illiteracy, huge inequalities in linguistic capacity, protectionism and discrepancies in occupational and educational qualifications, and numerous financial and legal barriers to mobility."
"The changes we need, require fundamental cooperation across Member States of a kind that education ministers, vice-chancellors of universities and national qualification agencies find enormously difficult."
"Therefore facing these extraordinary difficulties, the one thing at Barcelona that would move us forward immensely would be to provide the framework, the joint commitment and a realistic appraisal of the resources required to ensure that we make these fundamental leaps to promote education as the fundamental step in the future of the competitive knowledge economy in Europe."
"Mr President, the Parliament's committees on which I sit have in the last few days made important progress with legislation on both financial services and energy market liberalisation."
"It will be tragic if the European Council cannot also match Europe's urgent needs and their own rhetoric at Lisbon and bring this area of legislation to completion and soon."
"Beyond this, I stress the critical importance of research and development and innovation to the future of Europe."
"Mr Prodi highlighted this policy area and said quite rightly there is no reason why Europe should not lead the world in biotechnology, which is undoubtedly going to be the leading area of science and industry, of employment and improved quality of life for the next few decades."
"And yet, what do we have?"
"Bickering over the Community patent, moratoria and antagonisms, procedural obstacles which have forestalled all progress in genetically modified crops and a tremendous promise they offer to us in Europe and the developing world especially."
"What do we have?"
"Over-complex and expensive approval procedures and patenting processes for new products in healthcare and pharmaceuticals."
"We cannot afford to lose our best scientists to our competitors where they are better appreciated, given scope to realise their ambitions and are suitably rewarded."
"We are already two years past Lisbon, there are only eight more years to 2010 when we are to be the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world."
"Action will speak louder than words, Mr President-in-Council, there is little or no time to lose."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to achieve the ambitious objectives set in Lisbon and make the EU a knowledge-based economic area and the most competitive and dynamic in the world, we must first step on the accelerator, then define its target groups more clearly, and finally apply the instruments with greater consistency."
"If the proportion of women in employment is to be increased to 60% by 2010, the Member States will have to become more pro-active - as they did when combating youth unemployment - and set benchmarks, in order to promote women in the seminal information technologies."
"Their share still ranges only between 10% and 20%, with the percentage of women owning small and medium-sized enterprises under 20%."
"The representation of women at the top in business management is only 10% at most."
"What has become of their impetus?"
"Although the structural regulations include equal treatment of women as a priority and the strategy framework on gender mainstreaming holds remedies in readiness, women earn, varying between countries and business sectors, between 20% and 30% less than their male colleagues."
"Young women expect much from Europe and are demanding flexible child care facilities, and, Mr President-in-Office, so are the children's fathers, because they share responsibilities and want to combine work and family life."
"European initiatives such as lifelong learning and Community initiatives such as EQUAL take this into account."
"Now is the time for further steps to be taken."
"New forms need to be created, and we do not want women to be disappointed, as they are by the Convention, where, unfortunately, only 20% of the delegates are women."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, when I spoke to you in January during the debate on the priorities of the Spanish Presidency, I stressed that the European Union could learn a great deal from Spain, with its largely successful policy that the Prime Minister, Mr José María Aznar, has pursued for several years."
"Today I can only repeat what I said then and say it more firmly, in the run-up to the Barcelona European Council."
"At Lisbon, against the backdrop of a difficult international economic climate, the EU Heads of State and Government expressed the desire to make the European Union, in the medium-term, one of the most competitive, most dynamic and most prosperous regions of the world."
"The Barcelona Summit must ensure that this desire does not turn out to be a vain hope and that the economic, social and environmental reforms contained within this ambitious objective are carried through to completion and that they are not allowed to be deferred."
"We must take the euro as a starting point to achieve a seamless Europe, where the markets are fully integrated, a Europe where businesses, workers and students can use the whole of the Union as a reference and as a sphere of action."
"There is no better way for our fellow citizens to achieve social integration than by undertaking a professional career."
"The new phase in the employment strategy must place more emphasis on the structural barriers to job creation, on the tax regimes and social welfare systems, and enable closer cooperation between the national services that are tackling unemployment."
"In all these areas, it is not the time to withdraw into oneself, to be overcautious, or reckless."
"Just as some countries of the European Union are single-handedly conducting a policy resulting in restricting people' s will and ability to start up a business, work, and therefore hire employees, other countries of the Union, of the eurozone, are establishing an environment enabling everyone to develop their spirit of initiative and creativity."
"I therefore hope that the Barcelona Summit is an opportunity for Europe, for the whole of Europe, to move in another direction, which encourages dynamism, entrepreneurial freedom, competitiveness and responsibility."
"Mr President, the Lisbon strategy was a success."
"I also wish to state that the previous summit - the Spring Summit in Stockholm - was a success."
"However, I am not too sure that the Barcelona Summit will be so."
"That will depend upon the balance between the various issues, for most of the talk I have heard so far has been about liberalising various markets."
"I myself come from a country, Sweden, which has a Social Democratic government and which has done more than many other countries to liberalise the markets."
"I therefore have nothing against liberalisation as such, but it must be balanced against a vigorous employment strategy, quality of employment, the fight against poverty and, in particular, efforts towards sustainable development."
"These aspects do not appear to weigh so heavily in the arguments deployed prior to the Barcelona Summit."
"In his report, Mr Bullmann has succeeded in achieving a balance between, on the one hand, liberalisation and, on the other hand, sustainable development, employment strategy and quality of employment."
"I hope that this balance will be achieved at the Barcelona Summit because that summit will be judged by outsiders on the basis of how successful it is in that respect."
"It must not just be about liberalisation."
"The other aspects of the Lisbon strategy must also be dealt with if the Barcelona Summit is to be a success."
"Mr President, before I start my speech proper, I will digress briefly in order to respond to Mr Trentin."
"When populism is introduced into a debate or a discussion, the debate will not bear much fruit."
"Mr Berlusconi and Mr Blair did not meet out of a desire for formal ceremony. They met in the conviction that there is a labour market model which needs reforming."
"We have an outdated model which needs modernising."
"We are also aware that there are conservative forces which protect workers on paper but do not afford them any protection at all in practice."
"That said, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Karas on his excellent report."
"It is a faithful, accurate description of the state of the European and world economies following the terrorist attacks of 11 September last year; it is also a working document containing proposals on the future development of the European economy."
"To bring about this economic revival, we must start with the rigorous application of Regulation 1466/97, which obliges the Member States of the eurozone to present and comply with stability programmes, while it obliges all the other States, pending total accession, to establish a sound, rigorous economic policy which is very close to that of the Member States."
"It is absolutely vital that all the acceding States apply these rules rigorously: any deviation or indulgence would be counterproductive and would mean that they would subsequently be unable to endorse positions adopted towards other States which appear weaker on paper."
"The sectors worst affected by the crisis are also identified: insurance companies, the aeronautical industry and tourism."
"The suggestion put forward of a State reinsurance mechanism is certainly interesting, precisely because these terrorist acts are not committed against individuals but against the community of all people."
"It is vital that we learn from this crisis for the future."
"Growing nationalism and our performance of a leading international role must not lead us to disregard poverty and marginalisation."
"The greatest error we can make is to identify our own security and stability with the weakness of other, potentially enemy countries."
"Mr President, the Lisbon process was important because it made a significant breakthrough by deciding to take an integrated approach to the economic employment and social policy dimensions to ensure that each was given an equal standing in terms of policy development."
"It is important that Barcelona does not backtrack on that commitment."
"It is important that Barcelona realises that if there is going be social cohesion, if we are going to reform and develop our European social model then the equilateral triangular approach to the development of Europe has to be maintained and developed."
"Specifically, I refer to paragraph 22 of the Bullmann report which deals with the question of services of general interest."
"It is extremely important in my view that this House gives strong support to that paragraph."
"This an area of the European economy which accounts for something like 16% of investment and close to 9% of employment."
"Of course it has to be reformed, but at the same time we have to ensure that the services which general interest deliver are delivered in an equitable, fair and a universal way."
"That cannot be done in an ad hoc way."
"It cannot be done by each Commissioner or each Council taking its own ad hoc approach."
"We need to take on board a proposal of this Parliament that we put in place a directive, not a one-fit-for-all directive, but a directive which would provide a framework for services of general interest, which would establish the principles on which they are to be provided and which would put on an institutional basis an evaluation of how those services are delivered."
"Mr President, I would like to address the House to talk about the issue of sustainable development at the Barcelona European Council."
"The Commission' s resolution clearly contains many interesting points; but in relation to Amendment No 10, which discusses information and the sustainability reports which have to be produced in order to receive Structural Funds and in relation to the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, I wish to say that I am very concerned, because the criteria for sustainability are not well-defined at the moment."
"We have no good definition of what we consider to be sustainable and this leads to subjective views, propaganda and unjust positions."
"I believe it is necessary to improve the criteria that are going to define sustainability with an open mind, because the integral policy requires that we incorporate the multifaceted nature of sustainability."
"But we must also take account of territorial criteria."
"We must therefore employ objective and territorial parameters, since sustainable development always affects a specific territory."
"In this respect, climate change, for example, cannot only be applied to gas emissions, but also to desertification, which is perfectly quantifiable, and to rain levels."
"Something else also worries me, however."
"While we have managed to incorporate sustainability and the environment into a transversal policy, the latter, the environment, must also open the door to social and economic criteria."
"There cannot be sustainability without an assessment of the social impact, of the habitability of regions, of the negative economic impact and of the costs."
"We must therefore enrich the criteria for sustainable development, otherwise we will create situations of asymmetry and injustice which make it difficult to implement energy and water policies in the future."
"Mr President, it was very important progress we made in Gothenburg with the adoption of a combined strategy for sustainable development and the simultaneous incorporation of the environmental dimension into the Lisbon strategy."
"The Barcelona Summit next month will therefore be the first opportunity for taking stock of their implementation."
"I think that the challenges in the environmental sphere have not been dealt with fully enough either in the Spanish Presidency' s work programme or in the Commission' s discussion paper for the summit."
"By means of the proposals to be debated tomorrow here in Parliament, those of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have tried to correct some of these deficiencies."
"Allow me just to mention a couple of examples."
"I believe it is important to get the Cardiff strategy on environmental integration tightened up so that we might have clear objectives and timetables established for implementing the strategy."
"It is also important that we arrange for systematic sustainability assessments to be carried out of all the EU' s political initiatives."
"In the area of agriculture and fisheries, we are all aware of the problems."
"It is hugely important that, in the new agriculture and fisheries reforms, we should see to it that the requirements in terms of the environment and sustainability are also considered in relation to enlargement."
"Finally, I hope that the European Council will demand of the Commission that work on a new chemicals policy for the EU be hurried along as much as possible."
"I hope that the Council will listen to Parliament' s eminently justified demands and recommendations."
"Mr President, a great deal has been said already. I have just two comments to make."
"The first concerns the strategy for sustainable development in the run up to the Barcelona Summit, which puts flesh on the bones of the endeavour started in Gothenburg last year, when the environmental dimension was woven into economic development and social cohesion, successfully in my view."
"The common objective of these endeavours is to put the European Union's long-term, global strategy on sustainable development into practice."
"Biotechnology is an important sector today - and will be even more important tomorrow - and we must not overlook that aspect of it which can play an important part in sustainable development."
"This point is covered in Amendment No 27 proposed by my group."
"If used with care, biotechnological applications, and genetically-modified organisms in particular, can make a positive contribution both to the economy and trade and to environmental protection, for numerous reasons which there is no need to reiterate."
"At the same time, if we are to establish consumer confidence, we need to pay attention to concerns on this count and the call for analytical control methods, as well as markers and tracers, to be applied to genetically modified organisms is a legitimate one."
"It will guarantee compliance with the principles of safety, responsibility and proper information and, at the same time, create conditions of healthy competition in a highly promising sector."
"My second comment concerns the Commission communication on the action plan on mobility."
"The Commission proposal for a social security card is lacking in substance."
"Why?"
"Because it does not create a European area of health which meets the demands of European citizens; all it does is simplify bureaucratic procedures."
"Unless the card includes details and medical data, naturally with the interested party's consent, which can be used in the other Member States, it will do nothing to improve present medical coverage at European level."
"Naturally, what we need is for the Member States to run compatible medical IT systems. This, of course, is where the Commission comes in and we expect it to take positive action on this issue."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to single out one aspect of the summit, namely employment, since the socio-economic policy which we pursue has, after all, a considerable bearing on employment."
"Firstly, I am of the opinion that the summit should consider whether the objectives laid down in Lisbon can be met."
"In my view, this is impossible at the sluggish pace which we are currently seeing in Europe."
"I have studied the figures relating to the development of employment and unemployment."
"Last year was disappointing, and we will therefore never be able to meet the target."
"This is partly due to the fact that there is no longer any pressure from the European Union to actually implement the national action plans for employment which Member States are required to submit every year."
"During the initial period of the Luxembourg process, the bad reports which the Commission gave the different Member States were still headline news. News of such reports has now been relegated to token entries on the last pages of some newspapers."
"This means, therefore, that the pressure to utilise the open coordination method is slowly being reduced."
"The summit should therefore consider what can be done to increase this pressure."
"I would now like to mention two specific points. Firstly, the costs to employers of creating employment are far too high."
"If I look at the difference between the costs and what employees are eventually left with, then non-management staff, for example, retain on average 45% of the costs of employing them, while management retain 35 or 36%."
"If nothing is done to curb these costs for employers, the level of redundancies will remain high."
"Secondly, the difference between unemployment benefits and wages is too small."
"Many people remain unemployed and combine this situation with moonlighting, because wages are too low."
"Mr President, when the Barcelona Summit takes place, it will be two years since the Lisbon process began and the objective was set of creating the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by the year 2010."
"It is now high time that we provided stronger support for developing and consolidating the process of modernising the European economy and that we made clear our demands for practical measures."
"If we are to be able to create a dynamic and competitive Europe, then deregulation, liberalisation, structural changes and tax reductions must be implemented."
"That will in turn lead to basic conditions being created for new companies and new jobs, as well as to increased prosperity."
"We shall not obtain a dynamic and competitive Europe though further detailed regulations or through the EU' s taking on responsibility for an increased number of areas."
"What is fundamental to achieving the Lisbon objective is, first of all, an internal energy market characterised by liberalisation, competition and openness."
"This is of the greatest importance to European industry and the people of Europe if they are to obtain better service and lower prices."
"The second prerequisite is an internal market for financial services with a view to improving the opportunities for investment and economic growth by means of lower capital costs and increased profitability."
"Modernisation of the European economy is partly aimed at reducing unemployment in Europe, for example by increasing employee mobility, something which is also very important if the common currency is to flourish."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, must also be provided with sound basic conditions in which to start up, grow and become larger - or, perhaps, even to become large companies."
"I believe that these viewpoints should have been the main content of Parliament' s statements about the continued direction of the Lisbon process prior to the Barcelona Summit."
"Unfortunately, that has not quite been the case, something which we Conservatives regret."
"The report even contains a number of points that are in direct conflict with dynamic and competitive development."
"If the report were really to have supported the Lisbon process, it should have focused upon deregulation, liberalisation and increased competition."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"On behalf of the Presidency, I would firstly like to thank all the parliamentary groups for their speeches and I will try to be as concise as possible, bearing in mind that there have been many references which have overlapped or coincided."
"I would firstly like to address those who have noted any kind of defect in the excessive deficit procedures, that is to say, the procedures for monitoring the governments' stability plans."
"I would like to insist that the Eurogroup and the Ecofin Council have had absolutely no hesitation in confirming the validity of the stability pact and that, with regard to the implementation of the early warning procedure in Article 99, by the Commission, the Council believes that the declarations and specific commitments made by two countries in relation to their compliance in the short term, that is, during this year, and in the medium term, from now until 2004, with the objectives of their stability plans and the stability pact in general, with a balance or almost a balance, in 2004, were commitments which met the needs stemming from our stability commitments."
"In this regard, I believe that the Commission has acknowledged that, independently of procedural factors, the efforts and commitments made by both countries are clear and thorough from the point of view of the macroeconomic stability of the European Union and the eurozone in particular."
"I would also like to stress that, in Barcelona, from the point of view of competition and liberalisation, the Spanish government, and therefore the Presidency, is going to promote political agreements which represent considerable progress towards the liberalisation of markets, bearing in mind that we are talking about services which in many respects are essential to society, and that they must therefore be accompanied by levels of quality and security of supply, which must not be reduced."
"I believe that economic experience does not indicate there are any cases where competition in the market economy has led to the countries involved having worse services than those which do not have competition, but quite the opposite."
"Nevertheless, efficiency in the allocation of resources, and therefore prices for consumers, can be extraordinarily beneficial."
"Spain is a good example of this."
"Spanish family consumers, that is, domestic consumers, have made a saving since 1996 of EUR 2 400 million as a result of the liberalisation of the electricity market, and the same has been true in relation to telecommunications and other markets."
"To continue with the same example, I would highlight the effort that Spanish society has made in relation to the modernisation of the labour market, which has reduced the unemployment rate in Spain from 23% in 1995 to 12% in 2002, and that during the current Spanish legislature, that is, by 2004, that rate will be 9%, which is around the European average."
"Therefore, liberalisation and competition do not pose a risk for the citizens, but quite the opposite. There is a considerable saving in the cost of public services and a considerable increase in employment, and it is unquestionably the responsibility of the public authorities, the regulators, to guarantee such factors as the quality of service and sufficient supply."
"I believe that experience, not only in Spain but in many countries of the Union, confirms this."
"What is beyond doubt, ladies and gentlemen, is that we are now fortunately at the end of a recession which has been very intense and relatively rapid, as the President of the Federal Reserve, Mr Greenspan, has assured us this afternoon; and what Europe needs is capacity for economic growth."
"Many of the objectives which you have raised, such as environmental, social, health, educational and quality of life objectives, require economies whose potential grows, and I must remind the European Parliament that, over the last ten years, the European economy as a whole has only grown by over 3% in one year and by less than 3% in the other years."
"An economy in these circumstances has to be content with a structural unemployment rate of close to 9 or 10% and I am convinced that not a single parliamentary group present believes that to be a good policy, either in economic or social terms."
"I believe that the introduction of the euro has demonstrated that European citizens want more Europe and want economic reforms, and - while Mr Barón is present, since he urged me to also congratulate the Commission on the introduction of the euro - I congratulate the Commission, all the central banks, the governments and all the people who have contributed to the introduction of the euro in Europe, and above all the citizens."
"Various speakers have also mentioned the problems of sustainable development, and I believe that they are perfectly compatible with economic development and furthermore that is the clear definition of the type of economic policy we want in Europe."
"I would like to point out that the Barcelona Council, in line with the recommendations of the Gothenburg Council, is going to take account of the third dimension of structural reform, that is, the dimension which includes sustainable development and that, following the Laeken European Council, we now have environmental indicators which are going to lead to the first report, which was made public in January 2002, just a month ago, on 17 January, and on 5 March, next week, the Ecofin Council will analyse that report in order to take it finally to the Barcelona European Council which will also allow us to reach agreements establishing the European position, with a view to the Johannesburg Summit on sustainable development."
"I perfectly understand the demand from the parliamentary groups and Members that environmental issues must be at the forefront in terms of structural reform, and in this respect I would like once again to stress that the Barcelona Summit is going to bear these issues in mind, not in a generic way, but in accordance with the environmental indicators approved by the Laeken Council."
"The candidate countries have been mentioned."
"The candidate countries are going to be in Barcelona, and they are going to be there to talk about their structural reforms, and therefore, in an informal but effective way, they are going to be able to participate in the debate on the liberalisation of markets in Europe and the increase in growth capacity and I believe that is a good demonstration of the will - not just of the Spanish Presidency, but of all the countries of the European Union and this Parliament - for the candidate countries to participate effectively in the debates on the establishment of European policies, even before the accession process is complete."
"The issues relating to small and medium-sized businesses have also been mentioned; I would like to confirm that we are not talking about generic declarations, that the informal meeting last weekend in Aranjuez, in Spain, is going to bring proposals to the Barcelona Council so that the countries make reductions in timetables, reductions in administrative costs and use new technologies intensively in order to achieve this, and that, furthermore, the Commission, before the end of the Spanish Presidency, will make a series of recommendations on certain issues which are essential to small and medium-sized businesses such as the transfer of ownership of family businesses, which over the next ten years may make up approximately 30 to 40% of property transfers within European companies."
"Issues such as Basilea II, which has been mentioned by the parliamentary groups and by some Members, are going to be analysed during the Spanish Presidency in the informal Ecofin in Oviedo, where we will hold a debate on the new rules which are going to affect the financial sector as a result of the Basilea agreements, known as Basilea II, on how they may affect the funding of all companies and, in particular, small companies."
"It has been rightly pointed out that the labour market is not just a question of flexibility."
"This is undoubtedly the case, and the public authorities have a role to play on issues such as the defence of workers' rights, the defence of the creation of active and passive social policies which respond to the needs of workers, the creation of training systems and positive discrimination policies in favour of specific groups such as women or women with young children."
"What is absolutely clear, however, is that the best kind of social and labour policy is one that can generate stable and quality employment, and which accepts the idea that on the one hand we have a policy of social protection and on the other we try to give the European citizens the incentive to work rather than receive benefits."
"That is being used today as an instrument in all the countries of the European Union, and I believe that the benchmarking procedure is useful for analysing questions relating to direct public spending incentives for people to leave behind unemployment benefit and join the labour market with salaries which do not clearly benefit from the fiscal reductions which are taking place in our countries; with formulae which give people receiving unemployment benefit the incentive to accept job offers and with formulae which reconcile training with the needs of companies, as well as extending working life within our labour markets."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to refer to the need, which has also been raised by some speakers, for specific timetables to be established in Barcelona."
"There is no doubt that the Barcelona Council intends to set quantifiable objectives which allow the States to make commitments which the public understands and accepts."
"I believe that, by reconciling political positions, which are not necessarily similar, no issues which are clearly sensitive, such as the provision of essential services, in which public authorities undoubtedly have a role to play in terms of guaranteeing the concept of public service, and the concept of quality, I also believe that we can establish processes which create genuine European internal markets which put the European economy in a position to compete with other world economies, now that we have taken the gigantic step, in terms of the construction of Europe, of introducing the euro."
"Mr President, I asked the President-in-Office of the Council a specific question on statements by the Spanish Prime Minister - who is also President-in-Office of the European Council - that made reference to my political family in the Council, but he has not yet answered my question."
"It is for the President-in-Office of the Council to decide whether he answers the question or not."
"Mr President, I have no problem reminding Mr Barón of what he already knows - that there is a very constructive relationship between the Spanish government and other European States, and that we have been able to reach political agreements with all governments, whatever colour their political family - to use the language Mr Barón himself likes to use - and that, bearing in mind the influence Mr Barón has over his political family, we hope that the conclusions of the Barcelona Council will allow all political families to contribute to the wellbeing of all Europeans."
"Mr Rato y Figaredo, thank you for speaking to the European Parliament this afternoon."
"We wish the Spanish Presidency every success in its term of office, as I am sure you are aware."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"International Criminal Court"
"The next item is the Council statement on the International Criminal Court."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that, due to lack of time, you will have to strictly adhere to your allocated speaking time."
"Mr President, I am delighted to be able to appear before Parliament today to present the President-in-Office of the Council' s position with regard to the steps the European Union is taking to bring about the forthcoming establishment of the International Criminal Court."
"The European Union has firmly supported the historic project to establish a permanent international criminal jurisdiction with universal scope."
"The European Parliament is well aware of this fact since it has always been on the front line in promoting the European Union' s efforts to achieve this essential objective for human rights and justice."
"I would, however, like to state once again that the establishment of the International Criminal Court is an important component of the European Union' s external policy, and consequently a feature of the programme of the Spanish Presidency."
"The European Union particularly welcomes the imminent achievement of this objective, which we have been waiting for such a long time and which we are all confident will take place this year."
"We cannot overstate the importance of the establishment of this Court, which so many legal experts, defenders of human rights and political leaders have been fighting for, and it is now truly within our reach."
"It will be a triumph for all humanity which is due, in no small measure, to the determined and consistent action of the European Union."
"Our collective experience on this continent, which has been involved in conflicts and horrors throughout the last century, makes Europeans particularly sensitive to the absolute need to develop and affirm international criminal justice as an instrument of service to human rights and humanitarian standards worldwide."
"It can be a surprise to nobody, therefore, that European States and the European Union are at the forefront of this movement in support of the International Criminal Court, a court that will be truly universal, independent and efficient."
"The European Union is absolutely convinced that the establishment of the International Criminal Court will represent a huge step forward for the whole world."
"When serious crimes are committed that are an affront to civilised society as a whole, when common values are attacked head on, the international community must act with the full force of the law."
"We need to enthusiastically and appropriately punish the most serious violations of human rights and international law, using the mechanisms agreed upon within the international community for this purpose."
"The International Criminal Court will be a powerful tool in this fight for justice and against impunity for the most heinous crimes - war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide."
"In a wider context, the establishment of the International Criminal Court is part of a movement characterised by the evolution of our world in recent times; the emergence and consolidation of an international criminal justice system that pursues particularly heinous crimes beyond the borders of our States, because these crimes are a serious threat to the security of all citizens worldwide."
"In such cases, which affect us all, we have to call upon either national criminal justice systems, through mechanisms which closely cooperate with one other, or properly constituted international criminal tribunals such as those created for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, set up by the Security Council, or in the near future by the International Criminal Court itself."
"The trial of ex-President Slobodan Milosevic in the Hague which has recently started is just one more example of this tendency that is gathering more momentum throughout the world, for this is what world-wide public opinion demands, and because it has to be seen as the logical conclusion of the current process of globalisation."
"The most important thing is that we are winning the battle against this culture of impunity, a culture based upon silence and amnesia, which is being replaced by a culture in which we demand that those responsible for heinous crimes be brought to justice."
"In the same way, we are moving away from the attitude of turning a blind eye to crimes committed against a neighbour to one where we are involved and look for effective means to act and cooperate with each other in order to deal with these intolerable situations."
"This does not mean seeking revenge or retaliation, but to ensure that justice prevails as an essential condition for long-lasting peace and reconciliation in every situation where there has been serious conflict."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the preparatory work for the establishment of the International Criminal Court is now at a very advanced stage."
"Upon the basis of the Statute adopted in Rome in 1998, the preparatory committee has laid down the majority of the instruments that the Court will need to be able to function effectively."
"In this process, which is undoubtedly of a technical nature but with fundamental scope and importance, EU States continue to play a very important role, I would even dare to say a leading role, in the collective work that has been carried out by countries worldwide."
"And, even more importantly, the process of ratification of the Rome Statute is advancing at an even faster pace than we could have hoped for."
"Whilst in the Rome Diplomatic Conference 120 States voted for its adoption, the Treaty has been signed by a total of 139 States, that is to say, an overwhelming majority of the international community."
"As you already know, 60 ratifications or signatories are needed for the Statute to enter into force and consequently for the International Criminal Court to be set up."
"At this stage there have been 52 ratifications, which leads us to believe that we will get the 60 ratifications needed within the next few months. I would even dare to say that this will certainly take place before the end of the Spanish Presidency."
"As you are all aware, all the Member States of the European Union have ratified the Statute or have implemented the necessary constitutional mechanisms for it to be ratified in the very near future."
"We firmly believe that all the Member States will be amongst those countries which, with their participation in the assembly of signatory States, whose first meeting could take place this very year, will implement those concrete decisions which pave the way for the effective operation of the Court."
"In accordance with the common position adopted in the Council of 11 June 2001, the European Union urges all States that have not ratified or signed up to the Statute to do so as soon as possible, so that the International Criminal Court can be established in the near future."
"I would like to point out that recently 15 candidate or associate countries have adopted the common position and are closely cooperating with us on this commitment."
"It is also appropriate to highlight the work that is being carried out in this regard by a large number of non-governmental organisations, frequently with the assistance and cooperation of the European Union."
"In accordance with this appeal, the European Union has been making representations to third countries and groups of countries in order that they can speed up the internal procedures necessary to ratify the Statute as soon as possible."
"These representations have been accompanied, in certain cases, by offers of technical assistance in this field."
"In the next few weeks we intend to intensify these representations on various continents with the aim not only of achieving the swift entry into force of the Statute, but also to ensure that the assembly of signatory States reflects as accurately as possible the varied composition of the international community."
"In fact, the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Court will crucially depend on its composition and the support it receives being interpreted as a genuine reflection of the international community as a whole."
"It is extremely important that all continents and all legal systems are duly represented in the Court and that this includes lawyers of both sexes as specified in the Rome Statute."
"The search for this wide-ranging support for the Court should inspire our efforts."
"We feel encouraged in our commitment by the fact that the ratifications that have already been registered and those that will take place in the very near future are from States on all continents, predominantly European, African and Latin American States so far, with different legal systems and levels of economic and social development."
"No one can say that the International Criminal Court is going to be a Court simply for the Western world or developed countries."
"It will be a legal institution for the whole international community, fully independent and linked to the United Nations system."
"It is important to point out that all countries, whether they have signed the Statute or not, can play an active role in the process of establishing the International Criminal Court through their participation in the work of the preparatory committee and then, if they so desire, as observers in the assembly of signatory States."
"And the doors will always be open to any country that wants to ratify or sign up to the Statute at a later date."
"In this regard, the European Union has maintained a constant and sustained dialogue with several countries harbouring doubts, some of which are our closest allies - I am referring, in particular, to the United States - and we will remain ready to continue these exchanges, with the aim of clarifying respective positions and promoting a favourable atmosphere for cooperation in the future."
"It is obvious that this task will not come to a conclusion with the entry into force of the Statute and the decisions that will be adopted in the next meeting of the assembly of signatory States."
"We will need to take all of the necessary measures so that the establishment of this new institution in its permanent headquarters in the Hague will be as quick and efficient as possible."
"The preparatory committee and the host country, the Netherlands, are already preparing for the implementation of these measures and the European Union is cooperating with them."
"Next, we will have to develop and strengthen all the mechanisms that will help the new institution in order to guarantee its effectiveness both in its headquarters and on the ground."
"The experience of the courts for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda have taught us that international criminal justice, in order to be effective, needs to be equipped with considerable human, material and operational resources."
"The Court, with its potentially universal scope, will require no less. It will certainly require more."
"Within this context, the European Union and its Member States will have to be prepared to give any assistance that may prove necessary."
"Furthermore, the Court, whose proceedings will be governed by the principles of complementarity and cooperation with national legal systems, will only be able to operate effectively if it can rely upon the cooperation of the judicial and administrative authorities of the States."
"This means that a very substantial proportion of the implementation of the Statute will consist of the adoption of measures on a national level to make this cooperation possible."
"This corresponds to each State in accordance with their constitutional practices, but the European Union can help in this process through the exchange of information and, when appropriate, the offer of technical assistance to countries that need it."
"All of this is taking place on the basis of the common position adopted in June 2001, which I mentioned earlier, which, if necessary, could be supplemented by a more detailed action plan or, when appropriate, through an updating or refining of its terms depending on the progress of the process."
"I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council will pay very close attention to the ideas that arise from this debate when it comes to taking decisions."
"Mr President, we share a firm commitment to supporting the swift and efficient establishment of the International Criminal Court as an independent and impartial institution devoted to carrying out justice in the worst cases of violations of human rights and humanitarian law throughout the world."
"In this regard, all of us, the European Parliament, the Council, Member States and the Commission, are closely united and committed to continuing to act with determination and tenacity."
"This conviction, this determination, is what has allowed the European Union to play an unquestionably leading role in this process, together with other countries characterised by their attachment to democracy and human rights."
"We are very close to achieving our objective through the entry into force of the Rome Statute and the establishment of the Court."
"This will provide us with a 'before' and an 'after' in the history of humanity' s effort to introduce justice throughout the world."
"We will therefore be able to feel proud of Europe' s contribution to this progress in the international community, but we will by no means be able to rest on our laurels, for this will be the moment at which we have to move on to the next stage in this struggle for justice, in which Europe will again have an indispensable role to play."
"I am sure, Mr President, that we will lack neither the will nor the consistency to be able to persevere in our commitment, and, for this reason, I believe I will always be able to count on the support of this Parliament."
"Thank you, Mr de Miguel."
"You can rest assured that you will always be able to count on the support of this Parliament, which has expressed its political will in this regard on many occasions."
". (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, EU policy in the sphere of human rights and democratisation includes as an integral component the fight to ensure that serious crimes do not go unpunished and the struggle for justice at an international level."
"The statute of the International Criminal Court, concluded in Rome, represents probably the most significant achievement of international law since the establishment of the United Nations."
"The European Union has always advocated the International Criminal Court and continues to support this project vigorously, as demonstrated by the common position adopted by the EU in June 2001, in which we put the case for the agreed statute to enter into force as soon as possible and for the Court to be established."
"The Commission unreservedly approves the start made in this common position, and I, too, wholeheartedly concur with what Ramón de Miguel has just set out in his capacity as President of the Council."
"The Commission welcomes the official statement in January 2002 by the Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union, as well as by Cyprus and Malta, countries also associated with it, and the EFTA countries belonging to the European Economic Area, to the effect that they associate themselves with the objectives of the common position."
"The EU's budget is being used to support projects by non-governmental organisations, by means of which projects the whole world is to be made aware of the need for the Court to be established."
"Since 1995, then, within the framework of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, some EUR 6.9 million have to date been spent on projects of this sort. EUR 2.1 million were made available in 2001 for three projects by non-governmental organisations in support of the International Criminal Court, which complement each other."
"The 'NGO Coalition for the Criminal Court' project aims to facilitate civil society's involvement, in cooperation with governments, within the framework of the United Nations' Preparatory Committee for the Criminal Court, and promote and facilitate technical cooperation, so that binding national legislation can be enacted to implement the statute concluded in Rome once it is ratified."
"The project 'Parliamentarians for Global Action' is engaged in a parliamentary campaign to ratify and effectively implement the statute of the Criminal Court and promote the rule of law, and the project 'No peace without justice' concentrates on campaigns to build public awareness and organise conferences in support of the Criminal Court."
"In the May 2001 Commission communication on the role of human rights and democratisation in third countries, the combating of unpunished crime was ranked as a measure to be promoted as a high priority."
"The Commission will therefore continue to support the establishment of the International Criminal Court."
"EUR 5 million has been allocated to the special budget line for the International Criminal Court, which also includes the ad hoc courts for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and also the newly-established court for Sierra Leone, for 2002."
"In 2002, the Commission will be concentrating its efforts on two aspects, firstly on increasing awareness of the Criminal Court, as part of which it wants to call on more than the necessary sixty countries to proceed with ratification, so that the statute can enter into force, whilst, at the same time, wanting to ensure that all areas of the globe are represented."
"We want, secondly, to concentrate on the enactment of binding national legislation to implement the plan; this would cover the training of the specialised staff involved - judges, lawyers, law enforcement agency staff and parliamentarians - to enable them to contribute to the work of the Court."
"We can also make a limited contribution to covering the Court's main costs."
"Proposals as to how to realise these objectives will be invited in March this year."
"I too was fortunate to be able to listen to Commissioner Verheugen first, so that I can now concur with both speakers, both the speaker on behalf of the presidency and the speaker on behalf of the Commission."
"Their statements dovetail perfectly with what the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats would like to see."
"We also fully share their views on the significance of the Court."
"If we talk about the need for reconciliation, then it is true that justice is to be done first, and the Criminal Court that has been set up for this purpose is therefore an extremely important instrument for ensuring the international rule of law, particularly in its preventive effect on people with dubious criminal backgrounds who have acquired high political positions, as we have witnessed in Yugoslavia and near the Great Lakes in Africa."
"It is of the utmost importance for impunity to be no longer acceptable and for this now also to be universally known."
"The resolutions submitted by Parliament contain a few important points."
"First of all, we as groups mutually agreed during the negotiations to urge the President and the Congress of the United States to review their position on taking part in the International Criminal Court."
"We have such high regard for the US that we need to make this appeal in a proper manner."
"This is why I also deem the amendment in this connection, which concerns an old document from the negotiations, to be wholly inappropriate."
"It makes no sense to try to convince the Americans by using tough words."
"Instead, we should prevent the irritation, which is already in evidence among the Americans in respect of Europe, from escalating any further and try to discuss these matters in a friendly manner."
"Another point is the need for the provisions of the Geneva Convention with regard to prisoners of war to be updated, so that we can take account of the status of the people currently held in Guatanamo."
"We, as a group, set great store by providing a definition in this connection."
"In addition, we hope that the Spanish Presidency will succeed in setting up this International Criminal Court under its own presidency."
"Mr President, too much time has passed since, on 17 July 1988 in Rome, the establishment of an International Criminal Court was approved, to bring to justice those individuals responsible for the most serious crimes which, as has already been mentioned here today, are the scourge of the whole world, including terrorism."
"There have been 52 ratifications of the Statute to date but, ladies and gentlemen, as you are all well aware, 60 are needed for it to enter into force."
"Given that we anticipate that the International Criminal Court will enter into force in the first six months of this year, under the Spanish Presidency, that the first assembly of signatory States will take place in New York, in September this year, that the attitude of the United States has not been positive so far and there are also well-founded suspicions that the American administration will be supporting a campaign against the Court, even going as far as to revoke Clinton' s signature at the UN on 31 December 2000, I would like to take advantage of your presence here, Mr de Miguel, to ask you a few specific questions."
"What does the Presidency of the Union intend to do with regard to the Bush administration to avoid this risk of taking a backwards step?"
"Does the Presidency not think it necessary to draw up a plan with specific measures and resources to attract the United States to the International Criminal Court?"
"What does the Presidency of the Union intend doing to guarantee that the 18 aforementioned judges, an integral component of this Court, designated at national level, meet with the requirements with regard to qualifications, balanced regional distribution, experience and parity between men and women?"
"When the Rome Statute was approved, Kofi Annan considered it a gigantic step forward."
"However, a long time ago, Benjamin Ferencz, former prosecutor at the Nuremburg War Crimes Trial, said that there can be no peace without justice, no justice without law, and no meaningful law without a court to decide what is just and lawful under any given circumstances."
"Today, following 11 September and the conflicts in the Middle East, the citizens see the establishment of this Court as something urgent and necessary."
"Let us not, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, let time slip away and forget about this until the next crime or war reminds us of this ever-present threat."
"Mr President, right is wrong."
"If all individuals are not treated in the same way, if war crimes and crimes against humanity go unpunished, how can we credibly pass judgment on less serious violations of the law?"
"It is of the utmost importance for a permanent International Criminal Court now to be set up specifically in The Hague, the judicial capital of the world."
"This court is one element in the development of our civilisation."
"It should naturally be universal."
"Asian and Arab countries, in particular, are still under-represented, and I urge all signatories to proceed to ratification."
"It is very poignant that the United States too should refuse to ratify the Treaty."
"It was mainly the Americans who proclaimed in Nuremberg that individuals have duties towards the international community which prevail over those towards their own State, and that this should become international law."
"Meanwhile, for the Americans, the same international criminal law apparently applies to everyone apart from themselves."
"A rare insight into the arrogance of power is provided by a bill that has already been adopted by the Senate and that boycotts the court and every country which participates in it."
"Another outrageous bill would even authorise the President of the United States to use violence to liberate people kept in prison by the court."
"If sufficient guarantees are built in to ensure a fair judicial process and competent judges, there is no reason at all why America should be fearful of this court."
"The Council and our Parliament should get this message across to our counterparts in America in a friendly, yet unambiguous manner."
"Also, as many countries as possible, spread across the different continents, should proceed to ratification in the short term."
"The court should not become too European. It can prove in practice that States that do not participate are in the wrong."
"Anyone who refuses to recognise the International Criminal Court commits an injustice and lags behind our civilisation."
"Mr President, only another eight ratifications are needed for the International Criminal Court Treaty to enter into force, but there are a number of problems to be resolved before the Court can become that instrument of international justice and the fight against impunity that we want it to be."
"The first obstacle is the persistently hostile attitude of the United States."
"We call upon the Presidency of the Council and the Commission to make it clear, once again, at all formal and informal meetings with the United States, how much importance Europe attaches to this issue."
"It would be genuinely feasible to find some creative instruments to put pressure on the United States, and I believe this has not been seriously attempted."
"The second problem concerns the difficult issue of internal rules to bring national legislation into line with the Court' s Statute."
"This will certainly be a difficult process but we must not allow it to become too drawn-out."
"From this point of view, I would genuinely like to express my pleasure at Commissioner Verheugen' s words to the effect that he and the Commission are in favour of supporting the training of specialists to help the Court operate more effectively, not least by providing financial aid."
"Mr President, I come from a country that has already completed the process of ratifying the Rome Statute, thereby confirming the humanist tradition of attachment to justice which characterises the Portuguese people; the tradition of a country which abolished the death penalty 450 years ago and life imprisonment 118 years ago."
"The most important thing, however, is that we can see the values of justice and of the fight against impunity spreading to the five continents."
"Slowly, it is true, but spreading nonetheless."
"We are also pleased to note that the forthcoming establishment of the ICC will contribute on a different scale to the rejection of the death penalty."
"It should be added that justice is only justice if it applies to everyone in the same way."
"We know that the ICC is not and never will be perfect."
"It will often appear to be dispensing 'winners' justice' , but, in addition to its normal jurisdictional function of investigating and prosecuting particularly serious crimes, it will also perform two other highly relevant tasks: one is to act as a deterrent to prevent further crimes being committed and the other is to provide compensation and reparations for the victims."
"It should also be pointed out that the International Court will only take action if national criminal authorities are not proceeding with the investigation and the prosecution of crimes, either because their laws do not cover such crimes or because the authorities are not able to proceed."
"We consider this to be a satisfactory solution as long as it is properly applied to the difficult problem of the conflict between the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the sovereignty of the national criminal systems."
"Mr President, the impartiality and the independence of the ICC are fundamental values and are part of the defence of what is the greatest asset of the European Union: the respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms, as well as the Rule of Law."
"We should, therefore, take every opportunity to praise the objectives that have led to the creation of the Court, and these objectives should not be disparaged under any circumstances."
"Mr President, I feel that, in recent years, the way this issue has been addressed has been a prime example of cooperation between the European institutions."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission, the Commission officials and the Council for their constant focus on the matter and for their openness to society, Parliamentary group and NGO initiatives, for I feel that a model of cooperation has emerged from this exercise - which we have already applied, for example to the treaty on antipersonnel mines - which is proving effective and therefore warrants due analysis."
"Mention has been made here of some of the countries which have not ratified the Statute. There are others, from Russia to China, which should, perhaps, also be mentioned or be the subject of focus."
"Fifty-five countries have ratified the Statute, and I feel that our efforts must now be directed towards achieving a political and geographical balance."
"The endeavours made at the Seville Conference, for example, to include the Arab countries, the very positive, unexpected stance adopted by the Arab League and the recent statements by the Mexican President, Vicente Fox, give rise to the hope that, with further endeavours, we might not merely achieve that quota but, I believe, even attempt to take a flying leap beyond it and make participation as universal as possible."
"From this point of view, I feel that, as in other cases, Europe can be proud of these 10 years of dogged, resolute, difficult hard work, in which it was alone at the outset but which is now widely recognised."
"The attention accorded to the special courts of accountability too, such as the Sierra Leone court which is about to be set up, is evidence that, when it so wishes, Europe can also be a community of values."
"Mr President, I feel we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that 55 States have signed the Statute. However, some European States have still not done so."
"It is therefore crucial that we encourage them to sign up."
"Since 1995, this Parliament has been working towards the creation of this criminal court, and subsequently, in 1998, the Rome Conference very clearly stated the work that needed to be done to set it up."
"We are at the end of this process, but, perhaps, at this point, an effort must be made to get 60 signatories to the Statute."
"However, Mr President, I would also like to say to the Spanish Presidency that all this effort is only worth it if the end result is significant."
"In order for this to be an instrument of fundamental importance, we need a whole series of working and operating mechanisms."
"I would ask the Spanish Presidency, during whose term of office the Statute for the International Criminal Court will in all likelihood be approved, to put all its efforts into ensuring that the court will have the sufficient means to be able to function as it should."
"This has been Parliament' s concern since 1995: that this struggle for a future that is more just will be successful and that this International Criminal Court will take on the crucially important role that it should have in the future."
"I have received 7 motions for resolutions pursuant to Article 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Democratic rights in Turkey, in particular the situation of HADEP"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on democratic rights in Turkey, in particular the situation of HADEP."
"Mr de Miguel has the floor on behalf of the Council."
"Mr President, Turkey has for several years made clear its interest in establishing closer relations with the European Union."
"From the signing of the Association Agreement, in 1963, and its formal request for accession in 1987 and the Customs Union signed in 1996, relations have had a long journey, which has not always been easy, characterised by mutual interest, rapprochement and, at the same time, by the clear European requirement for certain indispensable conditions that apply to every candidate for accession to the Union to be met."
"The Copenhagen European Council laid down the political criteria that the candidate countries must fulfil, which are; achieving institutional stability that guarantees democracy, the Rule of Law, the defence of human rights and respect for minorities and their protection."
"Furthermore, the Helsinki European Council formally acknowledged Turkey' s application to join the Union, by concluding with the words that Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the Union on the basis of fulfilling the new criteria that also apply to the other candidate countries."
"From now on, Turkey should benefit from the same association strategy for accession as the other candidate countries, which should act as a stimulus and a support for its reforms."
"The conclusions of the Laeken European Council indicate that Turkey has made progress on fulfilling the political criteria set for accession, in particular by means of the recent amendment of its constitution."
"The prospect of opening up accession negotiations with Turkey has thereby come a step closer."
"The European Council urged Turkey to continue making progress on fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria, both the economic and the political criteria, especially with regard to respecting human rights, and acknowledged that Turkey is participating on an equal footing with the other candidates in a matter as vitally important as the Convention on the future of Europe, which will be inaugurated tomorrow in this Parliament."
"The Progress 2000 report stated that Turkey had initiated a very positive debate on the political reforms necessary for its accession, one of the most important of which is the fact that it has signed up to various international instruments in the field of human rights."
"Two-thousand-and-one saw one of the most important changes in Turkey' s process of democratisation: the adoption of a package of 34 amendments to the constitution, which is the most profound change that this fundamental legislation has undergone since its entry into force in 1982."
"Amongst the more innovative aspects are the recognition of the freedom of thought and expression, measures to prevent torture and the strengthening of civil authority as opposed to military authority and major prison reforms."
"These reforms have undoubtedly benefited from the fact that Turkey' s candidature has been acknowledged and from the prospect of its joining the Union in the future."
"Similarly, at the end of January 2002, another major step forwards was taken when the Turkish government decided to remove its opposition to Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, concerning the right to freedom and security in relation to the maximum periods of detention an individual can be subjected to before being put on trial."
"The Secretary General of the Council of Europe expressed his satisfaction at this decision, and stated that this marks a step forwards in the field of the protection of prisoners' rights."
"I would also mention the decision to create a commission, comprising of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs and Human Rights, to supervise the situation at field level of the protection of human rights and adopt the necessary measures."
"The same applies to the entry into force in Turkey of the new Civil Code, which signifies considerable progress in the recognition of non-discrimination on the grounds of gender, in family law and also in the law of succession."
"We should also mention the amendment of the law on the National Security Council, which is about to be approved in the Turkish Parliament, in order to adapt it to the new wording of Article 118 of the Constitution and which increases the number of civilian members of the National Security Council, thereby more clearly demonstrating its consultative nature."
"It is also to be welcomed that the Council of Ministers has approved the decree that will allow Amnesty International to legally open an office in Turkey."
"Although these constitutional amendments represent enormous hope for the process of democratisation - despite some important omissions, such as not having fully abolished the death penalty, which will still apply in the event of war or to punish particularly serious offences, such as terrorism - the legislative development of these constitutional rules has, however, been clearly inadequate."
"Although the legislative minipackage for developing the constitutional reforms adopts a more restrictive definition of the offence of promoting terrorism and provides greater guarantees for prisoners awaiting trial, at the same time extremely vague concepts have been introduced and even, in some cases, the range of punishable actions has been increased, as well as the fact that limits are continuing to be set on the right of association and the right to demonstrate, which is totally incompatible with current practices in the European Union."
"The same could be said of the reform of the Civil Code."
"The amendment of the status of legal persons does not solve the problem of the legal obstacles to the right of association or to the law on foundations, recently ratified by the Supreme Court, prohibiting the acquisition of property by foundations run by non-Muslim religious minorities in Turkey."
"It is worth pointing out, on this matter, that one of the priorities of the Association Agreement for accession is non-discrimination on the grounds of religion."
"Another important factor that should be taken into account is the practical implementation of the reforms."
"It is not sufficient for the laws simply to be approved; their provisions must also be put into practice."
"Turkey could be said to have the basic characteristics of a democratic system, but the implementation of the reforms necessary to guarantee democracy and the Rule of Law is taking place extremely slowly."
"Essential reforms in the State Security Courts have still not been carried out, the situation of torture and abuse has scarcely improved, especially in the southeast, due largely to difficulties in prosecuting the members of the security forces who are responsible for these acts."
"There are limitations on the practical independence of the judiciary, due amongst other reasons, to the fact that the Supreme Council of judges and prosecutors is headed by the Minister of Justice, which prevents any practical separation of the competences of the executive and the judicial powers."
"The Law of Criminal Prosecution still prevents judgments that have been challenged from being reviewed or any measure to compensate for violations of the European Convention of Human Rights from being adopted."
"The action plan for the southeast has still not been made public and Turkey has yet to sign up to the Council of Europe' s framework convention on the protection of national minorities."
"All of this remains problematic, not to mention the major limitations inherent in the judicial system itself."
"Despite the legislative reforms, any real improvement in this field will depend on the correct implementation and interpretation of development legislation."
"In practice, it has already become clear that actions that no longer constitute an offence, in light of the recent reform of the Penal Code, could still be considered to be an offence under some other Article of criminal legislation and punished, in some cases, even more harshly."
"An essential element of the Turkish process of democratisation is what is known as the National Programme for the Incorporation of the Acquis, presented by the Turkish government shortly after the Council of the European Union approved the Association Agreement for accession in March 2001."
"This represents a major step forwards in the right direction but it is inadequate because it contains various shortcomings that could endanger the objective of fully meeting the priorities and objectives required by the Union."
"In some aspects, this National Programme for the Incorporation of the Acquis is imprecisely worded, which will lead to problems of interpretation before it can move ahead."
"Specifically, it should mention the abolition of the death penalty, the subordination of the armed forces to civilian authority, the eradication of corruption, the socio-economic situation of the southeast of the country, which has a majority Kurdish population and the lifting of the state of emergency in the southeast."
"Furthermore, this plan gives no commitment to eliminate legal barriers to the transmission of radio and television programmes in mother tongues other than Turkish or to safeguard the cultural rights of Turkish minorities."
"In this process of reform and progress, in the recognition of the cultural rights of minorities, Turkey is still falling short."
"The recent reform of the Constitution has led to the amendment of Articles 26 and 28 and to the corresponding removal of the ban on the use of other languages."
"Nevertheless, the recent demonstrations by university students and parents of schoolchildren demanding the inclusion of Kurdish language courses in the academic curriculum have been harshly dealt with by the security forces, who state that the Kurdish language as such does not exist, that the only national language of the Republic is Turkish and that individuals who were arrested and who remain in prison are being detained because of their suspected support for the terrorist organisation, the Kurdistan Workers Party, otherwise known as the PKK."
"This message was repeated by the National Security Council when it stated that the campaigns requesting Kurdish language education have been orchestrated by the PKK with clearly separatist intentions, adding that this party, the PKK, is attempting to take another step in its strategy of politicisation and of creating a Kurdish nation."
"Another problem that cannot be sidestepped in the legislative process of Turkey' s democratisation is the problem of the recognition of the right of association, to be specific, the criminalisation and shutting down of political parties."
"In 1994 and as a replacement for the banned Democratic Party (DEP), accused of maintaining links with the terrorist organisation of the Kurdistan Workers Party, the People' s Democratic Party (HADEP) was created; the former members of the DEP who wished to become members of HADEP had to request the express permission of the government, which only allowed those who had no criminal record or against whom there had been no complaint to join."
"Since its creation, HADEP has been the dominant political force in the southeast of the country and controls the majority of the councils in the cities in this region; but also, since its inception, HADEP has had the threat of being closed down hanging over its head."
"The Constitutional Court' s decision of June 2001 to close down the Islamicist Fazilet Party highlighted the problems existing in the field of freedom of expression and association."
"The Constitutional Court is now trying the HADEP case."
"The public prosecutor has requested its ban on the grounds of its suspected links with the terrorist and leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, Abdullah Ocalan. It is being accused of using party meetings to spread propaganda for Ocalan and to incite hatred against the constitutional order and the indissoluble unity of the Turkish Republic."
"There have been thousands of cases of people from the HADEP party being arrested, and although the majority have been released following a short period of detention, these individuals were arrested for being suspected members of the PKK terrorist organisation and were accused of being involved in terrorist activities."
"No one was arrested and tried simply for being a party member."
"It can nevertheless be stated that in Turkey any mention of Kurdistan, its flag, or the call for education in the Kurdish language, is considered to be collaboration with or support for terrorist activity."
"It is also true, however, that, until it is banned, HADEP is a legally recognised party in Turkey and no one can be arrested simply for being a member of this party."
"Making it illegal would signify a step backwards in Turkey' s progress towards accession and would require the European Union to adopt a common position expressing its concern at the negative impact of such a move on freedom of expression and of association and on political pluralism, on the understanding that respect for the cultural rights of the Turkish people of Kurdish origin is one of the objectives set out in the Association Agreement for accession."
"Mr President, it cannot be denied that Turkey has made progress in fulfilling the political criteria for accession; consequently, the prospect of opening negotiations has come even closer."
"Nevertheless, this progress is still not sufficient to begin talks on accession."
"One of the main obstacles is the protection of the cultural rights of all Turks, regardless of their ethnic origin."
"Recently, the Secretary General for European Union Affairs, Volkan Vural, announced that a second package of legislative reforms is being prepared."
"This gives us hope today that we will see a new step in Turkey' s process of democratisation, which will open the way to a more fluid relationship and to negotiations, perhaps in the future, on its future incorporation into the Union."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes today's debate, which gives us the opportunity to draw up an interim balance sheet of democratic rights in Turkey and on the progress made in the area of political reforms."
"The background to our debate is the decision taken in Helsinki in 1999 to accord Turkey candidate status, and the pre-accession strategy agreed on this basis."
"All this strategy's elements have in the meantime been implemented."
"Turkey has, in particular, in order to meet the priorities of the Accession Partnership, accepted a national programme for the adoption of the acquis communautaire, thus at last setting in motion a reform process that is also playing an ever greater role in public discussion in Turkey."
"Initial results are already visible."
"Last year's constitutional reform is evidence that Turkey is seriously getting to grips with the political reforms that are needed."
"The Laeken European Council paid tribute to Turkey's efforts and noted that Turkey had moved closer to its objective of joining the European Union."
"Allied with this is, though, the expectation on the part of the European Union that the reform process will be carried on consistently."
"Turkey does not at present meet the political Copenhagen criteria."
"During my conversations in Ankara a few days ago, I strongly encouraged the Turkish government to be determined in proceeding with their package of political and economic reforms."
"My conversation partners, who were from all the parties in the present coalition government, confirmed to me both their desire for reform and their objective of rapprochement with the European Union."
"In order to implement last year's constitutional changes, Turkey has, this month, enacted a first mini-package, the provisions of which the Commission welcomes in so far as they deal with pre-trial detention."
"Although these provisions comply with EU standards, we take the view that they do not go far enough as regards freedom of opinion."
"Having expected more extensive and comprehensive reforms in accordance with the constitution, we are unable to find much improvement in the new wording of the relevant articles as compared with the current legal provisions on freedom of opinion."
"During my brief visit to Turkey, I therefore underlined our expectation that further steps would be taken in such areas as freedom of association, the use of languages in radio, television and education, the abolition of the death penalty and the introduction of fundamental legal rights in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights."
"Alongside changes in the law, there need to be real changes on the ground through the way the law is interpreted in Turkey."
"At the end of the day, we must not measure the human rights situation in Turkey according to what is written down, but have to judge it by what actually happens in practice from day to day."
"State prosecutors and judges have an important part to play in this."
"To this end, the Commission offers Turkey a range of training programmes, which are eagerly taken up."
"The Commission, like Parliament, is observing developments in connection with the court case against the HADEP party in the Turkish Constitutional Court."
"A new hearing is to begin on 1 March, that is, the day after tomorrow, and representatives from the Commission are endeavouring to be present at it."
"It goes without saying that the Commission assesses this case on the basis of the Copenhagen political criteria, and so I can tell you that, in our view, a ban on the HADEP party in Turkey would offend against our political principles."
"Last year, the Turkish parliament amended the constitution towards strengthening human rights in Turkey, but left untouched the legal basis for the banning of political parties."
"It has therefore to be said that current provisions in Turkey cannot accord with EU standards."
"The Commission therefore calls on the Turkish government to make further efforts to comply with these standards."
"It can indeed be said that Turkey is in the midst of an intensive debate on the future course of its reform policy."
"Positive steps, for example the constitutional reform, can be set against other areas, in which we continue to observe deficits."
"As a result, though, I am confident that Turkey possesses the strength and the will to carry on with its reform policy."
"I see Turkey's consent to the opening of an Amnesty International office as a favourable indication."
"I also see it as positive that the mini-package to implement the constitutional reforms, enacted a few weeks ago, is soon to be followed by another package of legislative implementing measures, which is, apparently, to cover laws on the press and on public assembly, criminal law and the law on the powers of the police."
"It is my hope and expectation that this legislation will clearly manifest a strong desire for reform, and so I take this opportunity again to encourage Turkey to strengthen democratic rights within its borders, set the relevant legislative initiatives in motion and bring them to a conclusion."
"What is and will continue to be crucial, is that human rights are safeguarded in practice and that Turkey, as regards day-by-day social coexistence guarantees the benchmarks of a democratic and pluralist society."
"It makes a nation - and the Turkish nation is no exception - stronger rather than weaker, when it sets itself the highest objectives as regards the realisation of democracy and human rights."
"Mr President, the Christian Democrats in the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats are able fully to support what has been said by the Council and the Commission."
"Turkey' s constitutional court wishes to declare a further political party illegal."
"Over the last 40 years, as many as 23 political parties have been declared illegal in Turkey."
"These have been parties with religious, regional, cultural and ethnic bases which have been considered to go against the Kemalist structure of the unitary state."
"Allow me to draw a clear comparison."
"If we had had such a constitution among the various Member States of the European Union, a large number of parties would have been declared illegal including, for example, my own party, the Swedish Christian Democratic Party, and its sister parties throughout the EU."
"I promise that we in the European Parliament will show no lack of vigour, energy and persistence in monitoring this judicial process in Turkey."
"Within the framework of an ad hoc delegation, we intend to act in such a way as to protect democratic rights, the multiparty system and, of course, the rights of the Kurdish minority too in Turkey."
"Kemal Atatürk, who died more than 60 years ago, founded a unitary Turkish state."
"It is time for a debate among the Turkish people about whether this constitution and this unitary state fulfil the requirements of modern society and pluralistic democracy."
"My view is that the Kemalist unitary state is based more upon power, threats, compulsion and authoritarian demands for loyalty than upon winning over people' s hearts and inspiring an inner loyalty, healthy affection and patriotism in relation to their own country."
"The time should be past when a constitutional court declares one political party after another illegal."
"Moreover, these are large political parties more often than not."
"Turkey has not signed the Council of Europe' s convention governing the rights of minorities and proceeds ultimately on the basis of Kemal Atatürk' s constitution harking back to the 1920s and 1930s."
"I wonder if Turkey is not in actual fact scoring an own goal by not opening itself to the outside world and not acting differently towards its minorities."
"Only if it changes in these ways can people' s hearts be won over in Turkey and the rest of Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Council and the Commissioner have rightly observed that we have managed to set in motion a process of reform in Turkey, but one that still has many, many deficiencies."
"What is decisive, as the Commissioner has said, is actual practice and implementation."
"I sometimes rather feel that we are being led a dance when the constitution is amended, but not the implementing legislation, thus making it possible for the police and the other security authorities to act, for example, against those who want to be taught in Kurdish and sign up for courses accordingly."
"I believe that we cannot accept that."
"Anyone who believed that the Kurdish question was resolved by Öcalan's arrest has, alas, been disappointed, as Turkey has not yet taken advantage of the chance to pursue another policy on the Kurds, for example, by giving the mayors of whom the President of the Council has spoken, the means - financial and otherwise - enabling them to improve matters in South-East Anatolia, which is what they want to do."
"On the other hand, admittedly, intransigent officials are arrested or abducted without it being known whether this is the work of the security forces or of private organisations and without any real attempt being made to find the people who have been abducted or those responsible for the abductions."
"What Parliament stands by is this: We campaign for the cultural rights of the Kurds - rights that are inalienable, that do not amount to separatism or terrorism, that do not create difficulties for Turkey, but which could be the salvation of Turkey as a European country."
"Mr President, the prosecution of the people's democratic party stems from disturbances at their party congress as long ago as 1996."
"Since then, the PKK has declared a ceasefire and Turkey has started its long programme of political reform."
"In particular the revision of Article 69 seems to be designed to expand the scope of party political activity within the political system."
"The reform should be taken further quickly so that no regionalist party, nor those of mainly Kurdish origin, should be under threat."
"It would be a very good signal of the resolve of Turkey to carry on with European integration should the Supreme Court decide this case at the very moment when Turkey takes its seats inside the Convention."
"The banning of the Fazilet party last year was a poor signal."
"If there are serious allegations against persons for connections with terrorism they should be charged, but the party itself should be saved for parliamentary democracy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I can be brief about what has led us to this discussion: the charge of separatism against HADEP is undesirable and, mainly, unjustified."
"HADEP is a democratic party which is trying to defend the cause of the Kurds peacefully, and has done so in the past."
"It is therefore only right that the Council, the Commission and Parliament, too, should denounce this charge unequivocally."
"I can only hope, therefore, that the decision to re-examine this case next Friday in terms of the present constitution and the proposed constitutional changes, and not to proceed full steam ahead towards a ban, forms part of a more general change of direction regarding what, in my view, is the central issue under debate here, namely the question of how political, cultural and religious minorities in Turkey should be accorded a place in the political system."
"This is about fundamental human rights: the right to speak one' s own language, the right to use that language in the media and the right to be taught in that language."
"But more than anything, it is about the need for crucial political reforms."
"In this sense, the case against HADEP epitomises the choice which Turkey is facing: either the country opts for pluralism, democracy and freedom of expression, or these basic European principles remain subordinate to a dogmatic view of state security."
"However, let there be no misunderstanding about the fact that this criticism of Turkey and this support for HADEP are based on one crucial premise, namely that it is to be welcomed that Turkey is one of the EU' s candidate countries and that the European Union must do everything in its power to enable Turkey to acquire membership."
"Consequently, it is not my intention, by supporting HADEP and criticising the Turkish government and authorities, to keep Turkey outside the EU indefinitely, but rather to prepare Turkey for fully-fledged democratic membership of the European Union."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when Turkey embarked upon a constitutional review process last autumn, my group immediately visited the country in order to initiate an in-depth dialogue with the government or the Grand National Assembly and with representatives of civil society."
"Unfortunately, we quickly became aware of the limits of this process."
"We were refused permission to visit Mrs Leyla Zana, the Sakharov prize-winner, and other former MPs of Kurdish origin, who are still in prison."
"Whilst the human rights organisations welcome every advance that is made, the sheer number of specific cases they deal with demonstrate how much work still needs to be done before we see the democratic Turkey that we all hope and pray for."
"We did not expect, however, to find out some weeks later from the President of the HADEP party himself, Mr Murat Bozlak, that he was summoned before the Constitutional Court to face a likely ban on the political party that he leads."
"In order to encourage the European Parliament to react strongly to this extremely serious and arbitrary development, we immediately invited President Bozlak to come and meet all the groups and proposed sending a parliamentary delegation to Turkey."
"I welcome the unanimous support for both these initiatives."
"The only crime that HADEP has committed is that of continuing to gain influence throughout Turkey, to the point where it is now guaranteed, if elections were to be held, that it would enter parliament, in spite of a specially made law, which sets a 10% minimum score for parties to be represented in parliament."
"I also welcome the fact that we decided, by means of a resolution which all the groups support, to send a clear message to the Turkish authorities, and the following statement, in particular: 'The European Parliament calls for the case against HADEP to be dropped' ."
"I therefore propose that together we undertake to ensure that this is done."
"It is the very least that we can demand of a country that will tomorrow be taking part in the Convention on the future of Europe."
"Mr President, certainly the Turkish Government has improvised some cosmetic measures to hide its awful human rights record, but new repressive actions give us more serious grounds for concern, as the President-in-Office has said."
"The atlas showing the world's languages in danger of extinction presented last week on International Modern Language Day highlights the critical situation for most of the languages of this planet."
"We ought to have the courage to denounce all governments - like the Turkish one - that threaten so many linguistic communities with extinction."
"President-in-Office, can we accept under democratic criteria that political parties opposed to the disappearance of whole communities could suffer the prohibition of their activities."
"Should we set a bad example with our own situation in the Basque country where our language has been considered at risk of disappearing?"
"Mr President, in no way has the human rights situation in Turkey improved over the past year."
"I am in favour of Turkey's admittance to the EU, but the Copenhagen criteria must be met."
"Whilst I welcome the amendments to the constitution, they fall far short of my expectations."
"Turkey must take still further action, or else it will not be able to join the EU."
"The death penalty has not been abolished, but only restricted."
"Turkish politicians show little zeal when it comes to putting the changes to the constitution into practice."
"Whilst Arabic, English, German and Chinese may be taught at Turkish institutions of higher education, Kurdish, the mother tongue of 12 million people, remains barred from the education system."
"Over 10 000 students who availed themselves of their constitutionally guaranteed right and petitioned for Kurdish to be allowed, now face criminal proceedings."
"They are charged with separatism."
"Any peaceful and political solution to the Kurdish issue will involve the lifting of the ban on the language and the incorporation of Kurdish as a subject in the curriculum."
"The Copenhagen criteria include the right to native-language teaching and media, and must be a non-negotiable condition for accession."
"Members of HADEP have also been arrested and accused of initiating the Kurdish campaign."
"The opening of proceedings to ban HADEP have seen increased repression of its members."
"In the past year, 2001, 3 245 HADEP members were arrested, over fifty-five offices were searched and shut down."
"Over 3 000 HADEP members were arrested on World Peace Day, and one person was even killed."
"Commissioner Verheugen, I challenge you to travel to South-East Turkey and talk to the thirty-seven mayors who belong to HADEP, and who receive no financial aid."
"The villages that were destroyed have still not yet been rebuilt."
"How are the thousand refugees meant to survive?"
"Why is it that the South-East gets no money from MEDA Programme funds, even though the rules require it?"
"Banning HADEP will be a backward step for democracy, and will set Turkey off on a march in the wrong direction on the road that leads to Europe."
"Along with my group, I vehemently demand that the proceedings against HADEP be abandoned at once."
"The Conference of Presidents has resolved to send a delegation to Turkey."
"Until such time as Turkey publicly speaks out against banning HADEP, any delegation must show its solidarity with HADEP and support it."
"We must show here and now that this House does not accept undemocratic actions!"
"Thank you very much, Mrs Uca."
"I have received five proposals for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 8.39 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
".eu"" Top Level Domain"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (Á5-0027/2002), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the common position established by the Council on the implementation of the .eu Top Level Domain."
"Mr President, the draft regulation we are now discussing provides for the implementation of the .eu top-level domain, which should raise the profile of the European Union in cyberspace and allow the ring of confidence created by the single market to shine through to the Internet."
"In the vote at first reading in July 2001, Parliament adopted amendments tabled by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"The amendments primarily reaffirmed the principles of non-interference and self-management in the realm of the Internet and recommended efficient administration of the .eu domain, with less red tape."
"Although the Council accepted a large number of our amendments in the common position adopted on 6 November 2001, some of them did not meet with its approval."
"The Committee on Industry therefore went back on the offensive to call for the 'first come, first served' principle to be taken into account in registration policy, so that the policy of extrajudicial conflict settlement could be based on recovery of costs and in particular so that the consultative procedure could be provided within the committee structure."
"In fact, the Committee on Industrial Affairs, like the Commission, felt that the .eu top-level domain must become operational as soon as possible and must be able to work quickly and efficiently in order to be successful."
"To the very end, the issue of the consultative or regulatory nature of the committee structure was the main sticking point in the discussions between Parliament and the Commission on the one hand and the Council on the other."
"Informal contacts between Parliament, the Council and the Commission were continued after the amendments tabled by the Committee on Industry were adopted, and the three institutions finally reached an agreement."
"This agreement is reflected in Amendments Nos 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, which have been tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Group of the Party of European Socialists and Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"As far as the committee structure is concerned, we split the difference or rather, we adopted two thirds of the one position and one third of the other."
"The regulatory mode will apply to most measures concerning the implementation of the regulation, in other words, the general interest policy rules and principles and the definition of the criteria and procedure for the designation of the Registry."
"The consultative mode will apply to the designation of the Registry and to the conclusion of the contract between the Commission and the Registry."
"The reason why the Commission and Parliament ultimately accepted a compromise about which they are less than enthusiastic is that they want the .eu domain to be made available to users as soon as possible, in accordance with the desire expressed by the Lisbon European Council."
"Mr President, on behalf of Parliament, may I insist that the Commission and the Council undertake to pursue this aim with due diligence."
"I know that Commissioner Liikanen intends to make a statement to this effect during this part-session and that the declaration to the same effect that is due to be adopted by the Council will be communicated to us tomorrow before the vote on the amendments."
"On this basis I recommend to the House that we vote in favour of Amendments Nos 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12."
"Mr President, following the numerous informal contacts with the Council and the Commission which enabled us to reach a compromise, I should like to thank Commissioner Liikanen and the staff of his departments, the Spanish presidency for its unstinting efforts, my colleagues, Mrs McCarthy, draftsman for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and the coordinators of the political groups."
"Together we have achieved a result which should pave the way so that the .eu top-level domain can be launched at the end of the year."
"It is a pleasure to be speaking under your gavel for the first time and to offer you my congratulations, and I hope I can have 10 seconds extra at the end for saying that."
"It is a pleasure once again at second reading, to be supporting this very important measure on behalf of my group and also to pay tribute to Colette Flesch for the energy and time that she has put in, particularly in handling very astutely the negotiations with the Council and the Commission over the last few weeks, so that we quite rightly have a compromise deal which I have signed up to on behalf of my group, and which we urge your colleagues to support tomorrow."
"One of the crucial reasons for that, as Mrs Flesch mentioned in her speech just now, is that we need to get this new .eu domain name operational as quickly as possible."
"We are working in a crowded market, colleagues. The .eu has to survive in a whole world of new domain names, and it will only be of real value to commercial organisations and NGOs and other institutions who want to use it, if the procedures that are put in place for registration are the best possible that can be achieved."
"People want to be able to have their registrations handled quickly and clearly and to have the sort of guarantees about their copyrights and trademarks that we expect, because after all, with the institutional backing it has from the European Community over all the European Union, people will expect it to be nothing less than the best."
"It is going to be under scrutiny, so best practice is all-important."
"But we must get this done and get it through as soon as we possibly can."
"We look forward to the declarations of the Council and the Commission."
"I will be withdrawing my amendment, which put down a specific timescale of 6 months for getting the registry authorised, or rather to get the tender documents out in 15 months overall."
"I have been criticised in the industry for being too generous, so I hope that will be the absolute maximum."
"We look forward to hearing your declaration, and I should like to say in conclusion that this is an important measure, which must be done well and be done quickly."
"Mr President, I too, on behalf of my group, endorse what Mrs Flesch and Mr Harbour have said."
"The solution put forward with the amendments, which we urge Parliament to adopt en bloc, is a compromise solution, but I feel that it is a useful, appropriate compromise in that it will allow us to move forward quickly with the creation of the .eu domain."
"I feel that this is to be welcomed as positive for it represents another tangible step forwards - made possible by the cooperation not just of the rapporteur, Mrs Flesch, but also of the Commission and of Commissioner Liikanen, in particular - towards the implementation of the undertakings given at the Lisbon Summit."
"Therefore, since it is clear in many other contexts that decisions too can sometimes encounter practical difficulties and delays in implementation, I feel that our review of the situation tonight is cause for great satisfaction."
"I will stop there for fear of repeating what my fellow Members have said on the matter, but, without wishing to pre-empt what Commissioner Liikanen has to say, I add my voice to the call for the time frames for putting the .eu domain in place and making it operational to be made as short as possible."
"This point remains to be discussed and so I will leave the floor to the Commissioner now, who, we hope, is going to make a statement on the matter."
"The adoption of the regulation to make the .eu top level domain a reality is now reaching its final stage."
"I would like to express my thanks, particularly to the rapporteur, Mrs Flesch, for her sustained efforts to reach a compromise."
"I wish also to thank, in particular, Mrs McCarthy and Mr Harbour and also Mr Carraro."
"Their understanding of some of the complexities raised by this initiative has contributed significantly to the outcome we are discussing today."
"It is my pleasure to indicate that the Commission can accept the compromise amendments from 7 to 12."
"Several of the amendments proposed introduce useful additional clarifications to the provisions of the common position."
"The Commission can support the amendment relating to the examination of the first-come, first-served method amongst the existing options when defining the registration policy and within the boundaries of the regulation's framework."
"It can also support the amendment introducing the cost-recovery principle in the policy relating to the extra-judicial settlement of conflicts."
"The most complex issue to address was without doubt the type of committee and procedure to select for this Regulation."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12."
"With respect to Amendment 6 of the recommendation for second reading, as adopted by the Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy Committee, the Commission cannot support the amendment to Article 8."
"However, in the light of Parliament's concern over the implementation of the .eu top level domain, the Commission wishes to state the following:"
"The Commission shares the view of the European Parliament that, to be successful, the .eu top level domain should be in place very quickly and should not be burdened by an excessive regulatory framework."
"An advisory procedure was therefore considered by the Commission to be the most appropriate for this regulation."
"In line with the decision adopted at the Stockholm European Council in March 2001 to adopt all the necessary measures to ensure that the .eu top level domain is available users, as soon as possible, the Commission has resolved, however, to accept the regulatory procedure for Article 3(1) and Article 5, in order to facilitate the early adoption of this regulation, and with the confidence that this step can further promote the spirit of collaboration needed to achieve the objective set at the Stockholm Council."
"The Commission stresses that the selection of the Registry, to organise administer and manage the .eu top level domain, should take place as early as possible and that all reasonable efforts will be made to ensure a prompt publication of the call for expressions of interest after the entry into force of the regulation."
"This presupposes that the criteria and procedures for the designation of the Registry are completed in due time."
"The Commission is committed to submitting the measures required for the implementation of the .eu top level domain in a timely fashion and shall do its utmost to ensure that the relevant procedures are completed and promptly to allow the .eu registry to become operational as early as possible after the entry into force of the regulation, unless exceptional circumstances intervene."
"The Commission calls on the Member States to fully subscribe to this objective and to provide the support required for achieving it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"1999 discharge (measures taken by Commission)"
"The next item is the debate on the report (Á5-0024/2002) by Mr Blak, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the action taken by the Commission on the observations contained in the resolution accompanying the decision giving discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 1999 financial year."
"Mr President, in the discharge for 1999, we looked at the budget from all sides."
"Light was shed on all the sectors."
"All the EU institutions were examined in turn because, even if it is ultimately the Commission that is responsible for implementing the budget, it does not, of course, act in isolation."
"It is bound by decisions taken in Parliament and in the Council, and it is dependent upon the effectiveness of supervision in the Member States."
"The agricultural area is a shining example."
"The Commission is proposing a reform of agricultural policy, but the Council and Parliament are resisting this and proposing that the subsidies be made still more bureaucratic, over-generous and vulnerable to fraud and trickery."
"The flax, milk and sugar subsidies are good examples."
"There is, however, a continual need for fundamental reform and a new administrative culture in the Commission."
"We do not always agree with the Commission, but we basically have the same objectives, namely that the Commission should become an efficient and modern administration."
"What is most important is that the Commission' s reform plan should proceed in the right way."
"My original plan was to compare the individual directorates-general of the Commission and offer a characterisation of each one of them."
"That would have been in keeping with the spirit of the reform, but it has not been possible to carry out that comparison."
"I should like to call upon the Court of Auditors to investigate what is practised in the Member States."
"The discharge for 1999 highlighted a number of very sore points in the Commission' s administration."
"One of the most important was the inadequate review of auditors' reports and the insufficient degree of follow-up."
"In the report on the discharge for 1999, the Commission is asked to send Parliament reports twice a year, summarising all the auditors' reports and their recommendations together with the ways in which these have been followed up."
"Apparently, the Commission will only agree to the internal auditing service' s briefing Parliament once a year, and that is absolutely not enough."
"The financial controller used to brief Parliament four times a year, and that is what we also expect from the new department."
"The supply of information is always the biggest bone of contention between Parliament and the Commission."
"I have had an incredible amount of information supplied in connection with the discharge for 1999, and I should like to thank the Commission for this."
"However, clear rules that can be applied are needed, irrespective of the identities of the Commissioner and of the rapporteur for the discharge."
"The framework agreement is a mess."
"It can be used to withhold documents and to keep them confidential, for it is the Commission which, in the last analysis, decides whether a document is confidential."
"What is more, it is bureaucratic and leads to long delays."
"I have respected the framework agreement because that is what applies at present, but I think we should make efforts to have it renegotiated, and I should like to ask our President, Mr Cox, to honour his pledges concerning openness and reforms, especially in this area."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control might well consider spending more time on evaluation."
"We must ensure value for money."
"It is unfortunately my impression that most evaluations are simply binned."
"The Commission has promised to submit results of evaluations that have been carried out."
"It does not go into how often and in what way."
"What does the Commission say to providing a briefing every quarter or every six months?"
"There are quite a few practical issues arising from the discharge for 1999 that it has not been possible to follow up, either because OLAF investigations are not complete or because a disciplinary case is under way in the Commission."
"Many of the big issues raised by the discharge for 1999, such as the IRELA case, are still being dealt with by OLAF, which does not put much of a move on."
"There has been a lot of focus on IRELA, the Institute for European-Latin American Relations that has now been closed down."
"I am not sorry that the Institute has been closed down."
"The Commission now has delegations in the majority of Latin American countries which attend to the links between Europe and that part of the world, but matters have to be properly cleared up."
"OLAF is at present in the process of concluding an internal investigation to clarify whether disciplinary procedures need to be instituted."
"IRELA still has EUR 3.4 million to repay."
"I should like to ask the Commission what the situation is regarding those repayments."
"I should also like to applaud the Commission, and especially Mrs Schreyer, for following up the Flechard case."
"This showed that it is possible to admit to a mistake and then change the rules."
"I really do think it is a splendid result we have achieved."
"There is then the issue concerning the Stockholm Representation which, on the other hand, cannot be brought to a conclusion."
"I accept that the matter rests with the Swedish prosecution authorities, but we shall need to do something about this."
"I should like finally to say thank you for one and a half year' s worth of sound cooperation and, in particular, to thank Commissioner Schreyer."
"It has been a pleasure to work with someone so well qualified. As it turned out, it was not just cooperation but more along the lines of a good friendship, through which we have achieved fantastic results."
"That is something for which I should very much like to convey my thanks here in this House and, if this is to be the pattern for the future, then it is really something we can build further upon."
"It has been really splendid."
"Mr President, I should like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur for this report, which concludes the budget discharge for 1999."
"Parliament is required to exercise its powers of scrutiny over the Commission's expenditure."
"However, this is only possible with access to all the documents and information."
"Otherwise, the discharge decision does not constitute genuine scrutiny but is merely a formality."
"I therefore draw your attention specifically to the demand set forth in paragraph 4 of the report, which states that Parliament must have the same access to Commission documents as the Court of Auditors has."
"The Commission must stop devising a wealth of new strategies and delaying tactics to withhold documents from us."
"The latest example is the van Buitenen report of 31 August 2001."
"I was the rapporteur on the first phase of the Leonardo programme in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, yet the Commission gave me absolutely no indication that fresh accusations of mismanagement had been raised and were being investigated by the Commission and OLAF."
"Indeed, if a third party had not drawn my attention to the situation at the very last minute, the Commission, despite its superior knowledge, would have allowed Parliament to grant discharge for Leonardo I. Since then, the Commission has played down the situation and deployed a variety of stalling tactics."
"I ask you, Mrs Schreyer, is this the trust and cooperation which you and your colleague Mr Kinnock never tire of demanding from this House?"
"What have you got to hide?"
"The entire report is apparently already in the hands of at least one German newspaper, together with the relevant OLAF report."
"Is not it time, Mrs Schreyer, for it to be made available to us as well?"
"The Framework Agreement, which was cobbled together and presented to Parliament immediately after the 1998 general discharge without any opportunity for discussion, has shown itself to be ambiguous and misleading, and clearly conflicts with our Rules of Procedure."
"It is therefore unacceptable in its current form."
"The Agreement must be brought into line with the Rules of Procedure, not the other way round, which is what Mr Bourlanges' proposed amendment appears to be demanding."
"I therefore ask you to reject Mr Bourlanges' amendment and to leave Parliament's rights of scrutiny - set forth in the EU Treaty - intact."
"No committed European can genuinely be in favour of curtailing the rights of Parliament to benefit an already excessively powerful Commission, putting Europe at risk of becoming an uncontrolled and uncontrollable bureaucracy."
"This is the last thing our citizens want to see."
"As regards the disgraceful affair of the adulterated butter, known as the Flechard case, I would have preferred more plain speaking."
"However, I have no doubt that the spineless investigation into the Flechard case - which concerns not only wasted money but also the risk these products posed to health - is an issue which will give us plenty to talk about during the 2000 discharge procedure."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I, too, should like to add my voice to the congratulations addressed to the rapporteur."
"He also worked very hard on the main report on the 1999 discharge and produced excellent results."
"We wholeheartedly support this report too."
"I also believe that the Commission has been at pains to provide the relevant information within a short time."
"However, I naturally endorse the criticism voiced by Mrs Stauner: we have the impression - and this is reflected in the relevant paragraph of the Blak report - that the Commission is still playing its childish game of hide and seek with the European Parliament."
"The events of the last few days and the publications on a further van Buitenen report show that European reality does not take place between Parliament and the Commission, between a few officials and MEPs; it takes place in the real world, among 370 million Europeans, who cannot and should not continue to be led by the nose."
"I would be delighted if the Commission could finally move towards a more generous system - which, in my view, is an integral part of any democracy - regarding the disclosure of documents and the transparency of its administrative procedures."
"Mr President, with the discharge procedure for 1999, the Commission and Parliament opened up a new approach, characterised by greater institutional cooperation."
"It is the Commission that deserves praise for this result, but also the rapporteur, Freddy Blak, for having managed this procedure with determination, common sense and intelligence."
"We are undeniably seeing progress in the field of agriculture, not least as a result of the implementation of the integrated management and control system, but it is equally true that no progress has been made in the monitoring of fraud in the food industry."
"This situation is paradoxical: a deviation by half a meter in the route of a tractor working the land or the replacement of a milk cow on a date that is not considered to be in accordance with the regulations can lead to a declaration of financial irregularities and corrections by means of statistical projection."
"Nevertheless, fraud in the food industry committed in order to obtain export subsidies is rarely monitored and when it is, cases of fraud often disappear within the labyrinthine processes of national justice systems, and do not result in Community sanctions or a public explanation of the facts."
"This is a state of affairs that we cannot accept."
"Mr President, Mr Blak, ladies and gentlemen, the discharge procedure for 1999 really does bear the rapporteur's handprint."
"It was an extremely intense process of collaboration which, while not always setting out from the same starting point, I believe nonetheless consistently yielded substantial results after intensive debate."
"I do not intend to review the entire procedure here; instead, I would like to highlight one aspect of our collaboration on the discharge, namely the issue of 'access to Commission documents' ."
"After all, a major change has taken place here compared with previous years, and this is due in no small part to the rapporteur's persistence."
"Of course, the Commission is happy to read in your follow-up report that you are pleased to have received all the documents requested in the discharge resolution."
"However, we have different views on how this was achieved."
"In my view, it clearly shows that the agreement between the Commission and Parliament facilitated this treatment of confidential information."
"Let me stress that I believe the treatment of the agreement is working very well in this respect."
"It is not only the discharge procedure per se and the various reports that clearly bear the rapporteur's handprint. The same can be said of the follow-up measures or the measures taken during the budget discharge procedure."
"Again, let me cite just one example, namely the guidelines for the application of the proportionality principle for the writing-off of debts."
"There was considerable debate about this point during the discharge procedure, especially in the light of a 1994 case when Parliament felt that the decisions made by the Commission departments were lacking in transparency."
"As a result of our lengthy discussions, the application of the proportionality principle is endorsed on principle but Parliament has insisted that clearer and more transparent procedures must be adopted."
"The rule which has now been adopted in line with the proposed resolution is this: certain criteria must always be upheld, and above all, once a specific sum of debt write-off is involved, the Commission must make the decision as a collegiate body so that it is quite clear that a political responsibility is being assumed."
"Let me mention just one dissenting point on the follow-up report."
"The Commission cannot comply with the request contained in the follow-up report that the appointment of the accounting officers - that is, of the most senior officials responsible for keeping accounts - or of the financial controller, ought to be conditional upon prior consultation of the European Parliament."
"These are not interinstitutional posts but Commission posts for which the Commission itself is the appointing and decision-making body."
"Mr Blak, in your statement a moment ago, you enquired about the further procedure with regard to IRELA."
"Here, the Commission has decided to take the next step."
"As you know, the Commission issued a recovery order, but no recoveries can be made as the Institute itself no longer exists."
"Nonetheless, it still exists as a legal body."
"The Commission has therefore agreed to take the next step and instruct the Legal Service to determine the extent to which there is scope to proceed on the basis of personal liability."
"As regards the issue of the dossier compiled by Mr van Buitenen, I must point out that Mr van Buitenen has himself strongly insisted that only a few copies are in existence."
"I have not received a dossier from Mr van Buitenen either."
"As we have heard from my colleague Mr Kinnock, OLAF and the relevant departments in the Administration Directorate-General have examined the dossier."
"OLAF has designated eight experts from its area to examine the document."
"I must emphasise that there have been no delays here: the dossier's author himself conceded that it is likely to be March before the documents have been scrutinised."
"OLAF has now submitted a report. I have not seen it, but the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control has a copy."
"I believe that my colleague, Mr Kinnock, has also informed the Committee."
"As soon as recommendations are made to the Commission, the Commission will examine them and if new procedures are to be introduced, it will, of course, do so."
"Let me turn now to the issue of DAS as this is also included in the follow-up report."
"The aim is to ensure a positive DAS for the budget year 2003."
"I must reiterate on the Commission's behalf that we, for our part, cannot promise when a positive statement of assurance will be issued by the Court of Auditors for the means of payment as well, as this decision is a matter for the Court of Auditors, which has not set itself any benchmark stating when a statement of assurance will be granted."
"However, I believe that during the eighteen months of discussions on the 1999 discharge procedure, we have concluded that it would be a welcome step if we could find common indicators by which to identify and measure progress on financial management."
"I assume that this issue will also feature in the budget discharge for 2000."
"In particular, the Commission has reformed the system of financial management."
"If allegations of poor management are made, we investigate them, and if allegations of fraud are made, OLAF investigates them."
"I refute any claim that an investigation by OLAF would be a delaying tactic."
"This is not the case: OLAF was set up in order to investigate allegations of this kind!"
"Let me make it clear that there has never been a complaint that the Commission has tried to influence the findings of an OLAF investigation in any way."
"It would be foolish of us to do anything of the kind, for OLAF is an important body, not only in intensifying cooperation between Member States on combating fraud; it is, of course, also a sound and objective instrument by which to investigate internal matters."
"I am gratified by yesterday's judgment by the European Court of Justice."
"OLAF and its significance have been enhanced as a result of the ECJ judgment."
"The European Union's budget will undoubtedly continue to grow."
"There are new tasks ahead, and, of course, enlargement, in particular, represents a new and major challenge in the field of financial management."
"Against this background, I am sure that future discharge procedures and follow-up reports will raise a great many important issues which I hope we can resolve together with the same effectiveness as has been evident in the 1999 budget discharge."
"I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur once again for his collaboration."
"Mr President, I am sorry to take the floor again, but I am a little surprised that there is a report from Mr Van Buitenen of which I have been unaware."
"I should like to say here in the House - and this is something of which I am totally convinced - that that man should be removed from the Commission."
"He smashes and destroys European cooperation because his life' s work is to set himself up in opposition and to carry out assignments we cannot live with. I am very sorry to see something like this appear at the last minute, but I want to recommend to the Commission that it get rid of this man once and for all."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Supplementary estimates for 2002 - DAB 1/2002"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets:"
"Á5-0056/2002 by Mrs Buitenweg on supplementary estimates of revenue and expenditure of the European Parliament for the 2002 financial year and"
"Á5-0057/2002 by Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg on the draft supplementary and amending budget No 1/2002 of the European Union for the 2002 financial year for Sections É, ÉÉ and ÉÉÉ."
"Mr President, I shall be discussing both documents together, not only that on Parliament' s budget but also that on the Convention, a report which I drafted together with Mr Costa Neves, for both reports are closely connected."
"The Convention on the European Union' s future commences tomorrow."
"We are therefore in good time to commit the funding for this."
"The Convention offers a good opportunity to obtain a more decisive institution, to bring about more efficiency in this House and also to increase the legitimacy of the institutions."
"The concept of such a meeting of representatives of Parliament and governments was born here in this House."
"The European Parliament sets great store by the success of this Convention."
"This is one of the reasons why we agreed to an accelerated procedure."
"I therefore hope that Parliament makes it possible for the supplementary and amending budget No 1/2002 to be approved tomorrow, to coincide with the start of the Convention."
"I should like to single out a few details of the Convention' s budget."
"The Council' s Secretariat-General has made an estimate and arrived at an amount of approximately EUR 10.5 million for a 10-month period, until December 2002."
"Part of this amount, EUR 6.5 million, will be payable by the participants: the three institutions - Parliament, the Commission and the Council - and the governments and parliaments of the Member States or the candidate countries."
"This, for example, covers all kinds of travel expenses which are usually borne by the institutions or the national governments."
"This leaves us with a balance of some EUR 4 million. This is the amount which actually matters for this is the Convention' s own budget."
"How will this EUR 4 million be managed?"
"It is only a small amount, of course, but, politically speaking, it is very important for the three institutions to have a sufficient say in the budget."
"On a limited, practical level, it goes without saying that the Convention and its Praesidium will decide on how this budget will be spent. But if expense funds are moved elsewhere, for example if more funding is needed for daily expenses, to the detriment of the forum for NGOs and citizens, then that is a political matter."
"Then it is important, particularly for a Parliament which wants to play an important role in the Convention, to have a say in the budget."
"The problem, however, is that the Convention itself has no legal basis and that the normal budgetary principles did not, therefore, apply."
"The Member States insisted that Parliament and the Council should not form the two arms of the budgetary authority, but that the EU Member States as a whole should have the final word."
"Although this was inopportune for us, we showed an understanding of this problem in the negotiations and arranged matters in such a way that the Member States were eventually able to give their seal of approval, though not before the three institutions had given their avis conforme."
"Accordingly, the Member States can only approve something if the three institutions agree."
"As a result, the European Parliament has acquired the right of veto, we have a say in the budget, we also have the right to information and to peruse documentation, we can give discharge and such like, and we have therefore, in practice, held on to the important achievements of Parliament."
"I am very aware that this solution is not very attractive on the surface."
"We would, of course, have preferred it if the amount had been included in the budget in the normal way, but this is how it was, for there was no legal basis."
"Seen against this backdrop, I therefore think that the Committee on Budgets has achieved a very respectable result."
"Despite this, there has been some criticism."
"I was at the Bureau today and, there too, concern was expressed about the role of Parliament and about the implications of Parliament not answering to the Council but to the Member States as a whole."
"There was also concern in the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"This is the reason why we have included a long amendment in the resolution which expressly states the achievements of the agreement and which also states that this agreement in sui has no legal character."
"It forms an exception, an agreement that only applies to this particular situation."
"I hope that this addition, in which we expressly state that the agreement is an exception, as well as the fact that we managed to retain Parliament' s say in the budget after all, will lead to wide support for this agreement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a result of the consensus achieved between the institutions in the trialogue held on 18 February, Parliament is now, I believe, able to give its assent to the Draft supplementary and amending budget No 1/2002, which deals with the financial resources intended for the special 'Fund' that will cover the spending of the Convention on the future of the European Union from the first day it begins its work."
"The work has been carried out swiftly and, in my opinion, well."
"Given the need to ensure that all the factors that might contribute to the effectiveness of the Convention' s works are put in place in good time, its budgetary framework has already been defined, in accordance with the rules of transparency and institutional balance."
"The particular nature of the Convention explains the specific characteristics of its legal and budgetary frameworks, revealed immediately by the very existence of the 'Fund' , and by the fact that this is subject to exceptional financial rules."
"Particular account has therefore been taken of the temporary nature of the new body and the requirement for greater flexibility has been met."
"The factors I have mentioned form the basis of a specific interinstitutional agreement, which defines, in particular, the sum of the contributions from the institutions providing the finance, which are Parliament, the Council and the Commission, as Mrs Buitenweg already mentioned."
"Under the terms of the agreement reached in the trialogue of 18 February, the full involvement of Parliament is, therefore, guaranteed at all stages of the life of the 'Fund' , (created by intergovernmental decision) - it must be stressed - particularly with regard to the processes of transferring appropriations and of discharge. The exceptional nature of the initiative and, as a correlation, that of the applicable rules is perfectly clear."
"I should like to conclude by thanking all my fellow Members for their cooperation, and I would specifically like to highlight the work of those who took part in the trialogue, Reimer Böge and Kathalijne Buitenweg, as well as the contribution of the Committees on Constitutional Affairs and on Budgetary Control, which helped to focus attention on certain aspects."
"I also hope that, by means of this budgetary procedure, we will remain associated with a Convention that could well make history."
"Mr President, let me begin by saying that it is a great pleasure and an honour for me to address the House under your Presidency for the first time."
"I should like to make it clear that I am speaking primarily on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The rapporteurs - whom I also wish to congratulate on their work - have both pointed out that the Committee on Budgetary Control gave this matter very careful consideration and this is reflected in the reports."
"We did so because we want the proceedings of the Convention to be a success."
"This is our unanimous view, and I would like to make that clear."
"On this basis, we will be voting for the supplementary and amending budget which is contained in the report submitted to this House by the Committee on Budgets."
"However, it must be clear that this extraordinary budgetary procedure is a one-off; under no circumstances can it constitute a precedent for the future."
"This has been emphasised by the rapporteurs."
"Furthermore, the budgetary transactions must be conducted with maximum transparency and clarity, not least in order to justify the trust and hopes invested in the Convention."
"Although the Committee on Budgets is satisfied with the agreed procedures, a number of key issues remain unresolved as regards budgetary control."
"We have set these out in our statement, which was drafted in great haste, and we note that some of these points have been included in the resolution, for which we are grateful."
"The main concern, from our point of view, is the granting of discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget which, under the Treaty, is the prime and sole decision of Parliament and is normally non-negotiable."
"Yet Article 20 of the Council Decision on the financing of the Convention states that the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States shall give a discharge to the Secretary-General of the Convention, after Parliament, the Council and the Commission shall have consented thereto."
"What exactly does this mean, given that the terms assent or avis conforme are not defined in the various language versions? What procedures are envisaged for this process?"
"A satisfactory solution has yet to be found in this respect."
"The second issue which inevitably arises is Parliament's access to documents."
"The Treaty clearly states that the Parliament must receive all documents and information which it deems necessary to the discharge resolution procedure."
"Yet Article 4 of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Budgets merely refers to the Court of Auditors in this context."
"This does not reflect the spirit of the Treaty."
"As has already been noted, this is a sui generis procedure which diverges in part from the Treaty."
"Nonetheless, Parliament must have full and free access to all documents."
"I welcome Article 5 of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Budgets, which stresses that budgetary procedures, in particular on discharge, will have to comply with ordinary law, should the Convention's remit be extended beyond the period originally projected."
"I would like to reiterate my hope that we will be able to adopt this report tomorrow and thus get the Convention off to a good start ."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we have to vote on a supplementary and amending budget which, without doubt, is, and will remain, unique in the history of this Parliament, for we are negotiating a figure which amounts to 0.005% of the European Union budget and have even arranged a debate specifically for this purpose."
"We asked Commissioner Schreyer to appear before this House to discuss the reports and the action we are taking."
"There is good reason to discuss these matters, for they concern the financing of the Convention."
"This House pushed harder than any other European institution for the setting up of the Convention; we promoted and demanded it."
"We demanded it because we believe it is necessary to develop and introduce new procedures in Europe in order to improve interinstitutional relations and the interdependence between the three institutions."
"This means that there must be mutual respect, an awareness of roles, and transparency."
"The Spanish Presidency's initial proposal on the management of the funds necessary for the financing of the Convention alarmed us all, for it stipulated that the Council alone would provide the money, administer it and - above all -monitor how it is spent."
"It made no reference at all to Parliament!"
"Of course, under no circumstances can this be a precedent for future relations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"The Committee on Budgets and this House firmly rejected this model."
"In doing so, we had to adopt an accelerated procedure as there was no time to follow our usual procedure."
"Indeed, we had to involve coordinators to discuss the matter."
"We could not even make proper preparations within the Committee on Budgets."
"Nonetheless, we did so because we were keen to ensure that the Convention could be launched tomorrow."
"What this House has achieved is to ensure that in conformity with our powers, we are now part of the budgetary authority as regards the allocation of funds."
"We are one of the two elements of the budgetary authority whose task is to decide on the allocation of funds."
"Transfers of funds can only be carried out with our consent, which is also necessary for the granting of discharge."
"This gives rise to other issues and we have discussed these as well."
"In the Committee on Budgets, we believe that the solution identified is a good one."
"We have, however, gone one better, for our colleagues from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control have added an extra dimension, which is all to the good."
"We will certainly ensure that the procedure adopted for the Convention, and the implementation of this procedure, do not become a blueprint for any other institutions which may be set up at European level at any time in the future."
"One existing institution - namely Coreper - will assume a function which has not been assigned to it at all at European level."
"It will be the body to which Parliament, the Council and the Commission grant the right to consent to discharge."
"It is astonishing: the Council will grant consent for the discharge of Coreper - one of its own institutions!"
"This is very bizarre."
"This will not be a blueprint for any future arrangements in the European Union, and the discharge procedure will not be carried out on this basis in any other context."
"We will vigorously resist any moves in this direction."
"Parliament will defend its rights, and we will monitor developments very closely."
"However, we will vote in favour of the report tomorrow because we recognise that the Convention must be able to start its work."
"It is important to send out a positive signal to Europe by demonstrating that we are no longer applying the old procedures but are adopting a new approach, a new direction, and are shaping the future of Europe!"
"Thank you Mr Walter for your excellent speech, but I have to say that I am not the good fairy today; it is Mr Costa Neves, who had five minutes and only spoke for three."
"Mr President, the proposal to free up EUR 4 million for the Convention, which commences tomorrow, was rushed through the institutions at breakneck speed."
"We have therefore witnessed a complete change from the sluggishness of the decision-making process for which, with good reason, we are often blamed."
"Having said this, the funds are community funds raised by the citizens."
"Without giving a value judgment here about the Convention phenomenon, it is evident that it entails costs."
"Given the Convention' s working method, the lion' s share of these costs, however, will be accounted for in terms of the normal activities of national parliaments and European institutions."
"This does not detract from the fact that these costs should also be made transparent, like those required for making infrastructure available."
"Neither the Convention' s character, nor the urgency, can absolve the Council or Parliament from their joint responsibility for the EU budget."
"This fund of EUR 4 million should also be spent in a transparent and effective manner and will, inter alia, cover the costs of the chairman and the secretariat."
"Precisely at a time when the remuneration of expenses is high on the agenda in this House, it is important that the Convention too pursue a responsible policy."
"Reports about exorbitant remuneration can best be refuted if transparency is in place."
"There should certainly not be a whiff of profiteering surrounding a project concerning Europe' s future."
"There are no objections, as long as this fund still has a healthy balance at the end of 2002."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the setting up of the Convention is indeed a step of extraordinary significance."
"I believe that the Convention on the future of the European Union will shape the face of Europe."
"I am pleased that it has been possible to reach an agreement, an understanding, on its financing despite the misleading speculation at the outset, especially concerning the amount of funding necessary."
"As has already been mentioned, the costs for this year are estimated to total EUR 10.5 million."
"Part of these costs will be covered by the Member States or candidate countries, namely the travel expenses for their members."
"Most of the costs will, however, be borne by the European institutions."
"I should particularly like to mention Parliament's contribution here, which will be provided as infrastructure resources, namely translation and interpretation."
"One estimate reveals that a further EUR 4 million will be required for other sundry expenses."
"What are these other sundry expenses?"
"They include, for example, the funding of any studies which may be required, or, perhaps, additional translation services."
"The estimate thus stands at EUR 4 million, and a consensus has been achieved very quickly on how these EUR 4 million are to be provided: EUR 400 000 from the Council, EUR 1 million from Parliament, and EUR 2.6 million from the Commission."
"I believe that with the Interinstitutional Agreement, to be signed tomorrow, our discussions have resulted in an arrangement which will ensure extraordinary transparency."
"In this way, all three institutions will be involved in setting the budget for the Convention, making any amendments to this budget, and granting discharge. In this context, the prior assent of all three institutions will be required, especially in respect of the discharge."
"The institutions will not be dealt with en bloc; voting will not be based on majorities. Instead, the assent of each individual institution will be required."
"Clearly, this is a quite exceptional model, and I am pleased that this point is emphasised again by this House in its resolution."
"It is entirely in the Commission's interests - and let me stress this point - for this exceptional nature to be underlined."
"The Convention is exceptional, and the solution which we have found makes it clear, above all, that it is in the interests of all three institutions to ensure that the proceedings of the Convention are a success."
"Let me conclude by reiterating one key point: despite all the speculation, we have achieved a good solution very quickly, and it would be a very positive step if the signing of the Interinstitutional Agreement, together with the adoption of the resolution on the supplementary and amending budget, could take place tomorrow."
"In conjunction with the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets, we will thus have made a significant contribution to establishing conditions for its success."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"EU relations with South Caucasus"
"The next item is the debate on the report (Á5-0028/2002) by Mr Gahrton, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the European Union's relations with the South Caucasus, under the partnership and cooperation agreements."
"Mr President, the South Caucasus, that is to say Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, is a region with which one quickly falls in love, with fantastic people and amazing countryside."
"At the same time, it is a region that easily causes even its best friends to despair."
"Only in the last few weeks, preliminary census figures have shown that Georgia and Armenia have each lost approximately a million people since independence."
"It could scarcely be any clearer that post-Soviet social and economic policy has been a total failure."
"The Soviet planned economy has only partly been replaced by a normal market economy."
"Instead, widespread corruption flourishes, based on clan loyalties and mafia domination."
"However, the catastrophic situation is not entirely self-inflicted."
"A study by the Centre for European Policy Studies describes developments during the 1990s as being 'partly a result of liberalisation ... caused by transition to a free market system' ."
"The wretched economic and social situation has exacerbated the political, cultural and national conflicts that characterise the area."
"Unfortunately, there are no clear signs of solutions to the conflicts concerning, for example, Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia or Abkhazia."
"Sometimes, there is positive news, such as President Shevardnadze' s appointment of a mediator from Abkhazia considered acceptable to all the parties, the regular discussions between Presidents Alijev and Kocharian concerning Nagorno-Karabakh or Turkey' s recent decision to make it easier for Armenians to obtain visas."
"Just as often, however, there are worrying reports concerning, for example, an escalation in Georgian protests on the border with Abkhazia, increased tension on the border between Georgia and Chechnya and the cessation of the Armenian-Azerbaijani discussions at presidential level following the Key West Summit in April of last year."
"Against that background, it is no exaggeration to state that the South Caucasus is a powder keg that could explode at any moment."
"The risks are not reduced by the fact that the area is a transport route for the Caspian Sea' s and Central Asia' s gas and oil field and is situated in the vicinity of Afghanistan, a factor which has led to reports to the effect that Al-Qaida members may be found in the border country between Georgia and Russia."
"That has now in turn caused the United States to send troops to a country which still accommodates Russian military bases."
"The South Caucasus can be designated a test case for the EU' s peace policy."
"At the Gothenburg Summit, a programme was adopted for the prevention of violent conflicts."
"A civil peace corps could constitute a tool for such an action plan, designed to prevent conflicts."
"I also propose that the EU draw up a clear strategy for the South Caucasus, benefiting from lessons learned from the Stability Pact for South-East Europe."
"If it is to be possible to implement this, the EU' s presence in the region must be strengthened by full representation in Jerevan and Baku too, and not only, as at present, in Tbilisi."
"The environmental situation in the South Caucasus is alarming."
"The nuclear power station in Medzamor must, as agreed, be shut down by no later than 2004."
"For this to be possible, alternative energy sources are obviously required, a need which the EU could help meet on the basis of its experience."
"The EU must also continue its attempts to get regional cooperation projects under way, especially when it comes to the railway line between Baku and Nakhichevan."
"The vast majority of politicians, intellectuals and representatives of independent grassroots movements in the region have expressed a strong desire to be bound more closely to Europe."
"This has partly happened because the three states are members of the Council of Europe."
"At the same time, many also have a strong desire to see their countries become members of the European Union."
"I think that the European Parliament should give the clear answer that the countries of the South Caucasus are, of course, entitled to become Member States of the European Union if they so wish."
"With regard to the amendments, I recommend approving all of these apart from Amendments Nos 2, 14 and 16."
"I would particularly advise against approving Amendment No 2 because such approval would mean a sudden U-turn, unsubstantiated by new arguments, in relation to the position held by the European Parliament since 1987."
"I am conscious of the fact that there are Armenian circles that try to exploit the events of 1915 to excuse today' s Armenian politics."
"It is, however, clear from the report that I have not been influenced by this factor."
"This report is very critical of the Armenian occupation of Azerbaijani territory."
"That does not, however, mean that history has to be re-written."
"After the First World War, Turkish courts sentenced those mainly responsible - Enver Pacha and many others - to the most severe penalty under the law, partly for their responsibility for the mass murders of Armenians."
"It is a mystery to me why, 80 years later in Turkey, the attempt should be made to brush all this under the carpet."
"All nations have skeletons in their historical cupboards."
"Those who recognise this and openly come to terms with their pasts command respect, while those which deny and conceal their pasts mostly evoke surprise and disappointment."
"Mr President, may I start by congratulating you and wishing you all the best for your term in office."
"May I also congratulate Mr Gahrton on a job very well done and on the skill he demonstrated in reconciling the basic positions of the various political groups on the individual issues and setting them out in his report."
"It was a painstaking task but it has brought about a well-turned, balanced text which, with the members' additional amendments, is a realistic and objective summary of the current situation in the South Caucasus, the problems and the prospects outlined and the various dimensions and parameters which colour relations between third countries in the region and the European Union."
"Given the generally-accepted view that the region of the South Caucasus is especially important to Europe and the fact that the European Union has taken various political and economic steps to express its desire to support the process of safeguarding reform and political stability and establishing the rule of law in these countries, I think it is worth pointing out the advisability of reinforcing the role of the European Union in formulating a strategy to resolve the problems in the region, while taking account of the specific national and historical sensibilities of these nations and encouraging neighbouring countries, especially Russia, Iran and Turkey, to make a constructive contribution towards the peace process in the South Caucasus."
"The report rightly calls in this context for Turkey, which has a partnership agreement with the European Union, to prove itself worthy of its European ambitions by terminating the blockade of Armenia and creating a basis for reconciliation with it in line with the compromise set out in paragraph 15 of the report, which I urge the House to adopt."
"Russia is called upon to play an equally important and pivotal role in averting conflict in the South Caucasus and resolving the highly sensitive energy question, with the countries in the region involved either as power producers or consumers."
"I should like to close by stressing that the European Union's interests in the South Caucasus have to be maintained and stated consistently, with active support for the desire expressed by these countries to belong to Europe and with close collaboration between them and the European Union and its institutions in all sectors."
"Congratulations!"
"Mr Gahrton' s report is an excellent, balanced report calling for a greater European Union presence in a bridge area between Asia and Europe."
"The southern Caucasus could become a calvary but it could also remain a powder keg."
"Behind the essentially peaceful facade, tensions are rising which could explode given the right political situation."
"It would therefore be as well to play down the age-old disputes between the Turks and the Armenians."
"We hope that paragraph 15, upon which we are going to vote tomorrow, which is in line with the policies of many international bodies, will be a useful step in this direction."
"If the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy' s proposal is endorsed by the majority, we will henceforth be able to start to look towards the future and leave the past behind."
"In addition to the ethical and political issues, major economic interests are at play in the region: there is controversy regarding the exploitation of the Caspian Sea and the routes for the oil pipelines are still provisional; there is the potential for great pressure to be put on Russian policy, which applies different criteria for each of the three countries and in respect of the ethnic minority too."
"It would appear that the OSCE Minsk Group is exploring a fresh approach to the compromise for Nagorno-Karabakh and the various occupied territories behind closed doors."
"Let us hope so!"
"Mr Gahrton is right to call for a European Union special envoy to be appointed for the southern Caucasus."
"A conference between the countries of the southern Caucasus and the European Union could also yield results and make it clear whether it would be better to adopt the 'step-by-step' method or an overall solution."
"Mr President, our fellow MEP, Mr Gahrton, and I usually disagree about most things where the EU is concerned."
"It is therefore especially pleasing to have the opportunity this evening to praise Mr Gahrton for what is in every respect a well balanced and sound report on the South Caucasus."
"The EU must have a clear and well thought-out policy for a region as important as this on the border between Europe and Asia."
"We are aware of Russia' s significant role, of the opportunities - but also problems - presented by oil and of the region' s increasingly strategic role following the war in Afghanistan."
"Today, five American military advisers went to Georgia to train the army there in counter-terrorism."
"The EU can operate as an active mediator."
"It has an important task in terms of strengthening the democratic forces and civil society and combating the environmental problems."
"Mr Gahrton mentioned the fact that a first important step in strengthening the EU' s presence in the region would be to set up delegations in both Azerbaijan and Armenia, but more money from the EU is also needed for the region."
"Mr Gahrton and I are in agreement."
"There needs to be more EU involvement in the South Caucasus too."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should give a very warm welcome to Mr Gahrton' s report, which offers the three republics of the South Caucasus region the prospect of a way out of a situation marked by regional conflicts and a state of uneasy truce, so that they can finally find the path towards the durable peace that each of the republics and their populations desire."
"We have the political responsibility to help them in their quest."
"The reflections and proposals contained in the report also give an indication of the potential of the European Union to wage an active diplomatic campaign and to affirm its status and its role, and these are not fine words or empty rhetoric."
"Be they friends or rivals, these three republics in the South Caucasus are sister nations. The doors of the Council of Europe have been opened to them, and in that forum of discussion and exchange many of the tensions between them have already been eased."
"This antechamber of Europe must offer them new prospects of even closer fellowship with the European family, so that the Union can ultimately snuff out their age-old tensions."
"This highlights our responsibility, for the world and our continent are becoming increasingly interdependent."
"Besides the familiar question of oil, water is now becoming an equally strategic issue for the entire region, and before, on top of all this, an accident occurs in the Metsamor nuclear power station, it is also our responsibility to help these three countries to pre-empt such a threat."
"Mr President, the report contains a long list of good intentions for the South Caucasus, which is undoubtedly an unstable problem area."
"Europe naturally has an interest in the conflicts in the area being solved, but I must express doubts as to whether the EU is in a position to play such a large role in the area as this report proposes."
"I therefore wish to emphasise that, even if the possibility of EU membership is only mentioned as a long-term prospect, these countries do not constitute natural candidates for EU membership."
"All these many fine words are scarcely enough to solve the major problems in the area, and I would venture to doubt whether the Commission has the capacity to implement the desired changes."
"I should like to add a few remarks on Amendment No 2 to paragraph 15."
"I think it wise of Mr Duff to propose a formula that simply talks about reconciling historical differences."
"I would therefore call for a vote in favour of the amendment."
"Events during the First World War, which neither the British nor the American governments were then able, following investigations, to characterise as genocide, cannot profitably be discussed in the terms they are discussed in paragraph 15 of the report."
"That is not the way to achieve the normalisation of economic and diplomatic relations."
"It is true that the land border between Turkey and Armenia is closed, but there is no question of a blockade in the ordinary sense of the word."
"There are air links between the countries, and Armenian citizens are able to travel into Turkey."
"The closure of the road and railway links is a consequence of other unsolved aspects of the political and diplomatic situation."
"What the EU can do is work towards a combined negotiated solution to the issues that divide the two countries."
"Reflection and diplomacy are required."
"The European Parliament will not promote a solution by setting itself up as a judge of events in the distant past."
"The Union for Europe of the Nations Group will vote in favour of the report on condition that Amendment No 2 to paragraph 15 is adopted."
"Mr President, I cherish very intense, personal memories of South Caucasus."
"More than ten years ago, I was there as a journalist and followed the process of post-Soviet decolonisation."
"The hospitality and geniality of the local population have always stayed with me."
"At the same time, however, inter-ethnic conflicts have darkened the political horizon of the three Transcaucasian republics."
"The rapid, armed escalation of these conflicts is still a burden upon the entire region."
"Just think of the explosive centres of crisis formed by Abkhazia and Nagorny-Karabakh."
"Mr Gahrton has attempted to unravel the Caucasian knot of conflict, which is a nigh impossible task."
"The aim is to provide specific recommendations for a constructive European contribution towards the pacification and reconstruction of the region."
"I would particularly like to underline his appeal for prioritising European support for establishing the rule of law in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan."
"A western Caucasus specialist told me yesterday that this matter of concern requires more coordination between the Member States and the European institutions."
"The Commission may be able to tell me whether it shares this concern."
"More so than with the draft resolution, reading the explanatory statement to the Gahrton report evoked a sense of protest in me."
"I should like to single out two controversial points."
"Firstly, Mr Gahrton' s analysis and interpretation of the post-Communist socio-economic collapse of the Transcaucasian republics has no regard for the legacy of the Soviet economy, or the mockery which native leaders made of the privatisation process."
"Secondly, the rapporteur is very critical of the role of the United States in the region."
"I doubt whether the republics are in danger, or should live in fear, of 'neo-colonialism' from specifically that quarter."
"Meanwhile, the idea of an 'Organisation for Economic Cooperation in South Caucasus' appeals to me greatly."
"It is a practical step towards establishing mutual trust, turning back the process of regional economic disintegration and re-creating a transnational system of infrastructure."
"Current European aid projects, including Traceca and Inogate, are ideally suited to these goals and, what is more, prove that European efforts of this kind would be worthwhile in the southern Caucasus."
"Mr President - I am delighted to see you perched so high up there, if I may say so - Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Per Gahrton, for the many efforts he has made to try and bring this report up to an acceptable level."
"He reminded us very clearly in his introductory remarks that we are not there yet, that we still have a very long way to go."
"Today, as he said, the South Caucasus is a powder keg; as for the North Caucasus, the less said, the better."
"Today in the South Caucasus there are the unresolved questions of Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia, Adzharia and so on."
"All of these issues have been smouldering for years."
"In thirteen years of transition from Communism to democracy, during which time the European Union has invested a billion euros in the region, I do not believe we can claim that European policy in that part of the world has been a resounding success."
"As Mr Gahrton said, the underlying question concerns these nations' future prospects, and the Commission in particular - with the complicity of the Council, as usual - is refusing to offer any enticing political prospects to these countries and seems to reject the view that the only criterion for membership of the European Union is the fact that the people of a particular country feel European at heart."
"One need only travel to Georgia, Azerbaijan or Armenia to ascertain that the people of these countries feel European, and so we have no reason whatsoever to deny them the prospect of a European future, which we have been doing in countless ways."
"The other extremely serious problem, and one for which President Prodi bears the brunt of responsibility, is the failure of the European Union to safeguard its fundamental interests, the fact that it signs agreements, month after month, year upon year, with the Russian Federation."
"As for the pipelines, all of them have to pass through Poland to reach Russia."
"No energy-supply lines can pass through the Caucasus."
"If it were not for the Americans, we would not even have the little pipeline that passes through Azerbaijan and Georgia."
"This is the sort of policy that breeds dependence rather than interdependence."
"Commissioner Nielsen evidently believes that the Caucasus is a region with a population density akin to that of Greenland or the Antarctic."
"That is not the case."
"The Commission is forgetting that the Caucasus region is the doorway to Central Asia, which will be the chief supplier of the energy of tomorrow."
"This is the prospect that the Commission and the Council are presenting to us, but we in this Parliament could and should be calling on the Commission to take a decisive step, to make a bold political gesture by inviting these three countries to become candidates for accession to the European Union, to accede in ten years' time, once they are ready."
"They certainly could be ready by then if this prospect were set before them now."
"As things stand, the only prospect is that the powder keg of which Per Gahrton spoke is likely to set off a few more explosions."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our delegation to the EU-Armenia, EU-Azerbaijan and EU-Georgia Parliamentary Cooperation Committees is most grateful to the Committee on Foreign Affairs for enabling us, with Mr Gahrton's report, to focus in more detail on the South Caucasus region in this debate today."
"This region on Europe's periphery draws on a wealth of cultural and Christian traditions."
"It is Europe's gateway to Asia."
"With the troika initiative and the visit to South Caucasus, the European Union has sent out encouraging signals, but things are moving far too slowly."
"What is especially alarming, as far as south-east Europe is concerned, is that Russia suspects that al-Qaeda fighters may have taken refuge in Georgia and has announced that it will expand its action throughout Georgia."
"Georgia, on the other hand, is hoping for support from the US, which is already responding."
"But where does this leave Europe?"
"We have already discussed the aftermath of 11 September in the European Parliament in Strasbourg and expressed concerns about the difficulties which might arise if the situation in the region escalates."
"Unfortunately, it seems that our concerns are justified, for events have now taken a truly dramatic turn."
"In recent centuries, South Caucasus has constantly been riven by conflict. Surely, in 2002, it must be possible to stabilise these regions at last and give the people there a future and the chance to live their lives in peace and with some measure of lasting prosperity in their home territories."
"All three countries are striving to establish democratic structures and assert their independence from their over-mighty neighbours."
"Yet if we consider that Russian troops are still present in two of these countries, and that while Azerbaijan has been liberated, one third of its territory is effectively out-of-bounds across Armenia, these are issues which are not only of concern to the local population, but could also unleash a new wave of aggression."
"I therefore address my comments to the Commissioner in particular: oil could undoubtedly become a key issue here, and I wish that as well as America and Russia asserting their interests, the Europeans - in the countries which still count as Europe - would not only take action but would also ensure that stable development takes place in these countries."
"If corruption and crime gain the upper hand here, life for ordinary people will become intolerable."
"I think that as Europeans, we face an enormous task: to respond as quickly as we can and do our utmost to play a positive role in this conflict in order to give these countries a future."
"Mr President, the rapporteur has presented an impressive report which makes it clear that the South Caucasus states are of key importance for Europe's security."
"In particular, the fossil fuels and energy reserves known or suspected to exist in abundance in these countries, and their strategic position as the new 'silk route' for oil and gas, give them a global political dimension."
"This is both a blessing and a curse for them."
"At present, promoting social and economic development in these states is undoubtedly the imperative."
"Against this background, the resources allocated by the EU naturally seem distinctly insubstantial."
"It goes without saying that closer ties with the European Union are a desirable objective."
"The EU must not renege on existing agreements such as the closure of the nuclear power station in Armenia."
"As regards the fraught historical relations between Turkey and Armenia, we must avoid awakening hopes on either side that the European Union will assume the role of referee in this conflict."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I would like to stress that item 15 of the resolution, which will be put to the House' s vote and which calls on Turkey to create the conditions for reconciliation with Armenia, is highly apt and important."
"As we know, reconciliation between these countries is one of the key prerequisites for the establishment of peace in the Transcaucasian region, and the international community has every right to expect Turkey, as a major power, to conduct itself in a responsible manner on this important issue."
"Nobody can understand why the Turkish government continues to reject dialogue and to maintain a policy of systematic hostility towards its small northern neighbour, opposing the establishment of diplomatic relations and maintaining a stringent and damaging blockade that it imposed in 1993."
"This blockade must be lifted unconditionally, and its lifting must not be linked in any way to a requirement that Armenia drop her legitimate demand for international recognition of the genocide committed against the Armenian people."
"On the contrary, the abandonment of all revisionism by Turkey, in the same way as Germany has done, which would form the basis of a profound reconciliation with Armenia is, as we are well aware, the only means of guaranteeing the establishment of lasting peace in the South Caucasus."
"That is why, Mr President, we shall support item 15 of the draft resolution."
"Thank you very much Mr President."
"I am very happy with Mr Gahrton' s report because it makes a timely and useful contribution to our discussions on Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan, three countries, currently members of the Council of Europe, which have not reached the level of political and economic development to which they aspire and which we would want them to have."
"The conflicts in Nagorno Karabakh, Abkhazia and South Ossetia still represent the greatest threat to the stability and development of the region and of its neighbours."
"These conflicts, at a standstill today, could tomorrow become new danger zones, and, for this reason, I fully agree with Mr Gahrton' s point that the European Union must make a huge effort to help solve these problems, with a view to promoting the causes of peace and development."
"We are not starting with a blank slate, which is why before looking at some of the key points of this report, I shall give a brief summary of our current relations with this region."
"The partnership and cooperation agreements that we have signed with each of the three countries provide a unique platform for cooperation in a broad range of fields, from political dialogue, trade and investment, to relations with civil society."
"The implementation of these agreements, which entered into force in 1999, is gaining impetus."
"Furthermore, we are continuing to provide considerable levels of aid to Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan."
"The European Union has provided some EUR one billion since 1991, the year in which these countries gained independence."
"Last year, the European Union sent the region a clear sign of its wish to make a greater contribution to conflict prevention, to conflict resolution and to rehabilitation following conflicts."
"In February 2001, the first EU ministerial troika for the region conveyed this message, which was later confirmed in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 26 February."
"In a joint statement adopted at the meetings of the Cooperation Council last October, the three partner countries explicitly expressed their satisfaction with the intentions of the Union."
"Mr Gahrton draws our attention to some of the instruments we have used in other places and suggests that we apply them to the southern Caucasus: a common strategy, a stability pact, a special envoy and other measures."
"Since we are aware that there are limits to what we can do, let us look at how far we can go and what the new financing needs are."
"Instead of creating new instruments, we should focus on maximising the benefits of already existing instruments."
"In this regard I should like to highlight three aspects of our discussion: firstly, the political will of the participants, above all else, is the key, the aspect most likely to result in progress."
"In the current situation it is crucial that we maximise our efforts to support our commitments, particularly by means of political dialogue."
"Difficult choices will have to be made and a culture of commitment to the southern Caucasus will have to be developed."
"Secondly, in order for the European Union to be able to participate to the highest possible degree in conflict resolution, we must continue intensifying our common foreign and security policy as well as our role in the measures to promote conflict resolution."
"I am referring, in particular, to the OSCE Minsk Group, to Nagorno Karabakh, to the friends of the Secretary General of Abkhazia and to the Joint Control Commission for South Ossetia."
"We have made progress recently; since last year, the Union European has been participating in the tasks of the Joint Control Commission for South Ossetia, but a great deal remains to be done to ensure that the Union' s voice is heard in certain mediation circles."
"Thirdly, we have to ensure that the southern Caucasus has a definitive place on the agenda of our relations with the main players in the region, such as Russia, Turkey, Iran and the United States, and as some of you have said, also in our own interest, amongst other things, for reasons of energy supply."
"In conclusion, there is not a single and easy answer to the question of how to improve relations between the Union and the southern Caucasus."
"The Gahrton report rightly reminds us that we have to work patiently, on various parallel levels, probably for a long period of time, within the limits of available resources and on the basis of the achievements of the last year."
"The Commission wishes to explore new ways of promoting peace and development in the southern Caucasus."
"I wish to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that at a certain point, there will have to be a limit to European integration, and I should like to point out that in terms of geographical proximity and of historical ties, we are closely connected to countries such as Morocco, Algeria or others on the shores of the Mediterranean."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Impact of transport on public health"
"The next item is the debate on the report (Á5-0014/2002) by Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the impact of transport on health."
"Mr President, I am very happy to be able to introduce my report at this evening's plenary session."
"Colleagues will recall that this is an own-initiative report and in our early discussions in committee some concerns were expressed about the potentially enormous scope of a report on such a broad subject as transport and health."
"We agreed that in order to be useful, we would need to prioritise the issues that we focussed on very rigorously."
"For that reason I focussed this report on just two key issues: gaps in existing legislation and where further work can have genuine added value."
"First, the introduction of health impact assessments for all major EU transport projects and policies is probably the single most important initiative which could help integrate transport and health policies and help to minimise the negative impact of transport on health."
"The second issue I focussed on was the promotion within the bounds of subsidiarity of cycling and walking within EU transport policy."
"This would have an enormous impact on maximising the positive effects of transport policy on health."
"To demonstrate why action is urgent and necessary, my report summarises some of the key negative health impacts arising from transport growth."
"These include air pollution, noise, lack of physical movement and others."
"To take just one of these, transport is now the dominant source of air pollution in urban areas and despite the past decade's improvements in air quality in Europe, close to 90% of the urban population is still exposed to excess ambient levels of particulate matter, NO2, benzene and ozone."
"These can affect respiratory functions and lead to other health problems and diseases like cancer and cardiovascular diseases."
"Although it is true that vehicles have become relatively less polluting, the effect in absolute terms is offset by the increase in the number of vehicles on the road together with the increases in the length and frequencies of journeys."
"The significance of this was demonstrated by a recent study that found that air pollution now causes a higher mortality rate than road accidents."
"This is also a very timely debate."
"New evidence from scientists in California in just the past few weeks demonstrates that car fumes can actually cause asthma rather than only exacerbating asthma in existing sufferers."
"New research in the UK, part-funded by the UK Government, reveals that children find it increasingly hard to breathe the closer they live to main roads."
"So having focussed on two priority areas, I should explain the process used to identify those areas."
"First, on health impact assessments: in all the relevant literature it is clear there is still a lack of integration of health issues into transport policy at EU level."
"This was most recently and clearly evident in a synthesis report produced by the WHO and the UN Economic Commission for Europe in January of last year."
"That report was called for by European ministers to provide an overview of relevant existing agreements and to provide further recommendations."
"Their overwhelming conclusion was: ""The main gap seems to lie in the lack of an overarching integration strategy which would bring together and use the synergies of policies and legislations relevant to transport, environment and health."""
"We also have an EU Treaty obligation to better integrate these fields."
"Having spoken to a number of experts, it seems to me that health impact assessments should be introduced for all major EU transport policies and projects so that we can understand better the potential health risks and benefits of different proposals."
"These analyses could be very helpfully integrated with strategic environmental assessments."
"This proposal actually complements and builds on proposals that are currently being considered in the Commission's proposal for a new programme of Community action in the field of public health."
"What I am proposing is that this commitment should now be implemented urgently as regards transport and health."
"Some people will say that this methodology is not yet ready to be implemented."
"I would counter that very strongly."
"While this methodology, like all methodology, is still evolving there is more than enough knowledge to start implementing now."
"We need to be very clear about that."
"The other part of my report focuses on promoting cycling and walking within the bounds of subsidiarity."
"I make a number of proposals which would help to promote those modes of transport in the EU."
"But I want to finish by coming back to an amendment that I notice that the PSE has tabled to the report which will have the effect of delaying the start of the health impact assessment until 2004."
"I regret that amendment since the methodologies exist for starting this process now."
"There is really no need to wait three years until the Commission comes up simply with proposals."
"For that reason, I will be making an oral amendment, which I understand has been agreed to by the PSE, to change the year 2004 to 2003."
"I hope very much that the other groups will accept that too."
"Action in this field is urgent. Until we are prepared to give health concerns a major place in transport strategy, our children will go on paying for our inaction with their health, and increasingly with their lives."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, transport issues have to do with public health, among other things."
"Transport users have accidents, suffer the stress of gridlock and, as local residents, are exposed to traffic noise and exhaust fumes and many other hazards, not only in urban but also in rural areas. In some cases, they affect an entire Member State, as we are witnessing in Austria, my own country, where major problems are caused by transit traffic."
"It is sensible, therefore - indeed, it is essential - to analyse and evaluate the impact of transport on public health and draw appropriate conclusions."
"Against this background, we owe a debt of gratitude to the rapporteur, Mrs Caroline Lucas, for this own-initiative report."
"We must also thank her for her willingness to work with all the groups - particularly the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - in seeking sensible compromise solutions."
"The text which I assume we will adopt by a fairly large majority tomorrow is both ambitious and modest, and therefore deserves to be taken seriously."
"We want the Commission to carry out professional impact assessments and to use the scientific data as a basis for appropriate legislative initiatives wherever - but only if - these initiatives are necessary."
"If, indeed, it proves possible to implement some points by the end of 2003, which is one of the proposals set forth in the oral amendment by Mrs Petersen, we should welcome this step."
"We will be delighted to give it our support."
"We look forward with interest to the work of the Commission and our Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for a sound report and for the valuable cooperation we have enjoyed during its preparation."
"Those of us in my political group have really helped ensure that we shall be able to obtain a good final product."
"Efficient transport is crucial to our economy, especially in the case of regions far from the centre of the EU."
"At the same time, those of us who are dependent upon both passenger and freight transport must be entitled to communicate without such communication' s damaging public health through air pollution and noise."
"We must therefore make efforts to integrate public health considerations into transport, and we must apply that part of the Treaty which states that we must have a high level of health protection in all the EU' s policies."
"We support the proposal in favour of health impact assessments for transport projects and policies."
"There are many good examples given, which we can use in our continued work."
"I would also call upon the Commission to do the same."
"Cyclists and pedestrians must be able to proceed safely and quickly."
"Cars must be designed in such a way that, in the event of their colliding with passengers, they cause minimal injury."
"Moreover, we must multiply the good examples of cycle paths and pedestrianised precincts to be found in municipalities and regions throughout the EU."
"These are concepts we must make use of when we draw up our policy."
"I also wish to support the draft oral compromise tabled by the rapporteur."
"I hope we shall obtain a good result."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The vote on this report will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"The debate is closed."
"Labour cost index"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0461/2001) by Mr Mayol i Raynal, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation concerning the labour cost index (COM(2001) 418 - C5-0348/2001 - 2001/0166(COD))."
"Mr Mayol i Raynal has the floor."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, it is my duty to present to the House a proposal for a regulation concerning the labour-cost index."
"This proposal is based on Article 285 of the EC Treaty, a new provision introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"In particular, this article lays down that the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251, shall adopt measures for the production of statistics where necessary for the performance of the activities of the Community."
"Article 285 goes on to stipulate that Community statistics are to be compiled in accordance with the principles of impartiality, reliability, objectivity, scientific independence, cost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality and that their compilation must not entail excessive burdens on economic operators."
"The framework here is one of codecision procedure, and the European Central Bank has requested that this statistical instrument, this labour-cost index, be an indicator to be taken into account when drafting the monetary policy."
"The Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) meeting on 29 September 2000, adopted an action plan on the statistical requirements of the economic and monetary Union, which includes a project to draw up provisional statistics on labour costs."
"I ask that this project be presented at the earliest possible date."
"At the present time we already have an index of labour costs."
"The index was created during the 1990s by the Statistical Programme Committee, but it has no legal basis, and the way in which it is calculated leaves a lot to be desired in terms of how recent the figures are, its coverage and comparability."
"The underlying notion of the European Central Bank' s request and the Commission' s proposal is that the cost of labour is one of the causes of inflation."
"The European institutions responsible for economic, employment and monetary policy therefore need to have regular reliable indicators of labour costs."
"This opinion is debatable and I also believe that it is shared by one committee within the Commission and rejected by another."
"As far as low pay is concerned, the argument against the aforesaid opinion is that several Member States have a minimum wage which is increased in response to rises in the cost of living and not vice versa."
"Nonetheless, it is useful for the European Union to have a macroeconomic indicator of labour costs, which can be a particularly valuable tool for management and labour representatives in their negotiations on the formulation of collective agreements, etc."
"The aim of the proposal is to establish a common framework for the production, transmission and evaluation of comparable labour-cost indices."
"That is the objective of Article 1. These costs are defined as the total quarterly costs incurred by the employer in the employment of labour (Article 2)."
"The data must be broken down by economic categories."
"Four indices will be established: an index relating to total labour costs, another index showing labour costs, excluding bonuses, which are not paid regularly, then an index of wages and salaries and, lastly, an index of the combined amount of social security contributions plus taxes paid by employers less the subsidies they receive as compensation for direct labour costs."
"On this last point, it should be noted that it is often the government which sets the level of these contributions and that it cannot therefore be claimed that inflation is fuelled by pay rises alone."
"The data for the labour-cost index are to be compiled on a quarterly basis (Article 5(1)) and must be supplied in index form within 70 days of the end of the reference period (Article 6(1))."
"Transition periods may not extend more than two years from the date of entry into force of the regulation (Article 9(1))."
"In implementing the regulation, including the adoption of decisions on derogations from its provisions, the Commission is to be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee."
"Here are a few points to consider."
"Analysis of labour costs is undoubtedly an important factor, as I have said, in terms of the macroeconomic perspective."
"It may, however, raise some questions."
"This index will ultimately have to be refined through the creation of a separate index for total cost excluding expenditure on vocational training for which the employer is responsible."
"There is also the possibility, for which provision is made in an amendment tabled by my group, of taking hourly productivity into account and of postponing the first deadline for the submission of an assessment report until 31 December 2003, in order to permit an analysis based on a period of operation which takes account of a possible transition period."
"For technical reasons, this matter was not raised in committee, and so we were compelled to table this amendment belatedly."
"Please excuse me, but I realise that my time has run out. I am not used to these timed reports and have exceeded my allotted slot by one minute and eleven seconds."
"At such a late hour, I appreciate that this is a reprehensible abuse of your tolerance, and for this I apologise again."
"Mr President, generally, when we have to deal here with proposals on the compilation of statistics, the Members of this House are not particularly enraptured - as is apparent this evening - because they regard it as a technical matter which is essentially of little concern to politicians."
"Our electors are surely unlikely to be interested either in the work and effort we devote to these proposals."
"I am often the rapporteur on proposals concerning the compiling of statistics by Eurostat, and I am forever preaching to my fellow Members that ill-informed citizens or politicians - yes, even female politicians - will misjudge situations and take unwise decisions, and that is dangerous."
"When it comes to statistics, there are certainly some people who delight in citing the quotation about there being three kinds of lies - lies, damned lies and statistics - on the grounds that quoting statistics is the most devious form of lying."
"Be that as it may, we still must not forget that reliable and comparable statistics are a necessity."
"Eurostat does excellent work in this domain and will continue to do so, provided that we politicians furnish it with a legal base and the financial resources it requires to perform its task."
"Having said this, now that we all have the single currency in our pockets, I should like to emphasise the need to have statistics on labour costs at our disposal, because they are part of the indispensable information that makes it possible to evaluate what is actually happening on the ground in terms of inflation within the euro area, to evaluate developments that are crucial to the stability of our currency, which is now the currency of all our countries apart from the three that have not adopted it."
"It is wrong to say - and I disagree with the rapporteur here - that the cost of labour is not a source of inflation, because it is simply not true that increases in labour costs are always justified by the rising cost of living or by improvements in the productivity of the workforce."
"Think of what is happening in Germany, where, contrary to all common sense, the trade unions are demanding pay rises which would threaten thousands of jobs and increase inflation at a time when the largest Member State of the European Union is already causing us enough concern over its compliance or non-compliance with the Stability Pact."
"Mr Solbes can tell us something of what went on in the Council of Ministers, because many people believe that the Stability Pact has already died a natural death."
"This is why every effort must be made to ensure that we obtain as quickly as possible a common framework for the production, communication and evaluation of comparable labour-cost indices of the sort that will result from this proposed regulation, which must be adopted as soon as possible."
"My group, by the way, does not agree with the amendments tabled by the rapporteur on behalf of his group, because he is asking for things that are impracticable and counterproductive - and this, incidentally, is also the view of the Commission and Eurostat."
"We shall therefore reject these amendments."
"Mr President, your generosity is appreciated although as I am not an economist, nor a statistician, nor a liar I hope, I think I will be quite brief."
"What strikes me about me about the Commission's statement is that in a zone as large as the EMU, labour costs are generally considered as the main potential source of inflation."
"That is an overstatement of the situation."
"I accept, of course, that rises in prices and labour prices and labour costs can impact on inflation, but clearly in our Member State economies, where increasingly wage rates are negotiated through national agreements and are linked to productivity, and have all kinds of other factors built into any increases that employees get, the likelihood of labour costs being the driving force behind inflation to my mind is untrue."
"That is not to say that it is not a factor."
"What is a significant factor, however, is the operation of the market itself."
"I have personal experience of this in Ireland where prices on the housing market have simply exploded."
"Houses that were being sold five years ago for IEP 80 000 are now selling for IEP 250 000 Irish Pounds."
"This is extraordinary and wage rises had nothing whatsoever to do with it."
"It had to do with market demand, growth in the economy, etc."
"In fact probably, indirect taxation as part of government policy in relation to spending has a greater impact on inflation."
"Having said all that, this is a useful tool for the European Union to develop."
"It is important in order to manage the euro and the European monetary zone."
"It is inadequate in some respects because large areas of income are excluded."
"Professional fees for example are not included in this labour cost index and we all know the extent to which professional fees are virtually uncontrollable."
"These bodies set their own fees by and large, certainly in the Republic of Ireland."
"Also the issue of costs for education and training should be factored in, because obviously this is a cost, or should be a cost, in most cases to employers."
"So this is a useful tool and we should proceed with it."
"We need to review the position within a year or two to see how it is working to see what else might be factored in."
"And I would just ask the Commission to bear in mind that if it really believes that labour costs are the main potential factor for driving up inflation it will be making bad policy decisions."
"Thank you very much, Mr President, many thanks also to the rapporteur, Mr Mayol i Raynal, and to all the speakers who are present here this evening to discuss an important, albeit statistical issue, which simply concerns the definition of labour cost indexes, which will enable us to better understand what is happening in Europe, how we can compete more effectively, and which are a crucial factor for defining monetary policy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you have opened a debate which is of certain interest, but which is not exactly a debate on the proposal for a regulation that we presented."
"I would say that the concern that some of you have expressed about the interrelationship between salaries and inflation, which could be a debate for another occasion, has little to do with what the text of the preamble to the proposal for a regulation actually says."
"This states that a set of statistics, of which the labour cost indexes form an essential part, is an aspect that is crucial to understanding inflationist processes and the dynamic of the labour market."
"I would say that this statement is hard to refute."
"Clearly, we could go into the other issue in greater detail."
"With regard to the debate itself, I shall simply refer to the two concerns expressed by Mr Mayol i Raynal."
"To what extent, on the one hand, can indexes be drawn up in the future which do not take account of training costs and which exclude this type of cost?"
"Clearly, here we have a purely technical problem, to do with the cost/benefit ratio."
"These total costs are quite insignificant."
"Ultimately, they affect less than 2% of total costs and, nevertheless, calculating these training costs would have or would lead to a very significant cost in terms of compiling the statistics as a whole."
"For this reason, until we have better information that enables us to do so at a lower cost, we are not in favour of adopting this approach."
"Nor are we in favour of not drafting the report that is planned for the end of 2002."
"I fully understand the arguments put forward by Mr Mayol i Raynal to the effect that we will still be in a transitional period and not all of the regulation will apply 100%."
"The truth, however, is that we will already have a certain amount of experience in implementing the regulation and, furthermore, we will be able to more clearly highlight its shortcomings and problems."
"If the aim of the report is to understand the difficulties of implementing the regulation and adopting the measures necessary for this implementation to take place as efficiently as possible, we believe that maintaining the year 2002 as the target date is still correct. Nevertheless, if Parliament wishes to have additional information at a later date on the implementation of the regulation, it is fully within its rights to request it and Eurostat and I, personally, will be happy to provide it."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is all I have to say."
"Thank you for your cooperation in approving this regulation, which is important in statistical terms and also important to defining the future of monetary policy."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.13 p.m.)"
"Mr President, Members of the House need no telling how useful to us the publication Recent and Forthcoming Work in Committee is. It gives us a way to plan forward."
"A week ago I was asked by a colleague who works as an advisor to the Scottish Parliament if there was anyway I could help her with the problem of foreseeing business coming forward in the European Parliament in order that committees of that other parliament should be aware of our work and able to plan in relation to it."
"I said that there was a marvellous publication and I would get it for her."
"My staff asked for it in Parliament this week and I asked the Parliament office in Edinburgh if they could provide it."
"I was informed that this is a rare work of which Members of Parliament get one copy each and which may not be copied for anyone else, and no further copies can be obtained."
"In these days of transparency in the conduct of our business, it seems to me that is a provision which ought to be re-examined."
"This very useful publication should be made widely available."
"A second point: Yesterday, we approved minutes which drew attention to Mrs Doyle's statement of Thursday, 7 February, that in respect of the Watson report the PPE-ED Group by mistake failed to vote in favour of the habeas corpus amendment."
"Had they not made that mistake because of a late change in numbering, that amendment would have been carried in Parliament."
"This is a momentous fact which I hope will be drawn to the attention of Commissioner Vitorino, the President-in-Office of the Council and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi as chair of the relevant committee of this House."
"We have taken note of your second point, Mr MacCormick."
"With regard to the first point, I believe that the President of Parliament intends to give one of the Vice-Presidents responsibility for supervising relations with the citizens and for transparency and communication between Parliament and the citizens."
"It has not yet been decided which Vice-President but I think he or she may be the person you should contact regarding the matter you have raised."
"Socrates Programme"
"The next item is the report (A5-0021/2002) by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the implementation of the Socrates programme [2000/2315(INI)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first thing that must be said is that Socrates is a success story."
"Education was successful under Erasmus, but I think that, embedded in the Socrates programme, it has fared even better."
"That is one positive finding in this evaluation of the second stage of the European Union programme on general education."
"Socrates takes account of the concept of lifelong learning and supports mobility at all stages of learning, of students and teachers alike."
"To put it one way, Socrates is there for us from the cradle to the grave."
"The Commission has taken precautions and measures, one step at a time, to improve the content of the programme."
"I welcome ongoing efforts to speed up procedures and cut red tape."
"Red tape is inevitable in a government programme at any level, but red tape should not be an obstacle to this sort of education programme and should not obstruct its objectives."
"The Commission has taken account of this premise on numerous counts."
"I shall come shortly to the areas in which it has not."
"As rapporteur on both the introduction of the first phase and the implementation of the current second stage of the Socrates programme, I am satisfied how well it has developed."
"The figures for the first half of the programme speak for themselves."
"In 31 countries - that is, the 15 Member States, the candidate countries and the members of the European Economic Area - 2 000 universities, 40 000 university lecturers and more than 460 000 students took part in further education exchanges under Erasmus alone."
"Comenius, the section for schools, funded 15 000 schools with over 2 million pupils."
"I think we really are reaching our citizens here and I think it really is worth our while to continue and, if possible, build up this programme even more."
"This being so, the increase in the multiannual budget from the original figure of EUR 850 million to a current EUR 933 million - achieved by Parliament during all-night sittings - was the right thing to do."
"But, to be honest, it is not enough."
"If new candidate countries join in 2004 - the programme runs until 2007 - then this programme needs to be built up."
"And if the Council of Ministers refuses to do so, then all I can say is that its declarations at the summits are nothing more than hot air and I think the Commissioner should point out as much to the ministers at forthcoming Council meetings."
"Of course, I also have a few criticisms to make."
"Several initiatives still have room for improvement when it comes to the nitty-gritty."
"First, the Commission should improve and speed up cooperation with national agencies even more."
"Centralisation has huge advantages but requires effective information management."
"The Symmetry system developed by the Commission will clearly facilitate the flow of information to and from the national agencies here."
"But at the same time, we can - and it makes sense to - link up with the Youth and Leonardo da Vinci programmes."
"Symmetry therefore needs to be introduced as quickly as possible."
"Secondly, I would point out that an overwhelming number of national agencies gave me to understand that the Commission is helpful at all stages."
"But the time taken to prepare new contracts has resulted in disgraceful delays in payments, especially under Comenius."
"Such obstacles must be removed because hold-ups and delays are a source of frustration to committed participants."
"Especially in schools, where a great deal of extra effort goes into setting up projects."
"I know of schools where the teachers running the project are smiled upon by their colleagues."
"They do it in their spare time and do not get paid a penny more."
"Thirdly, I also expect something to be done about creating joint actions, especially with the other programmes I mentioned."
"Fourthly, I also call on the Commission to adopt the premise: the smaller the sum, the less red tape."
"I think we could follow the example set by the Commission with the partnership agreements, that is, to deal with applications under 20 000 differently, without the mound of paperwork needed for larger sums."
"I also think that the cofinancing requirement should be dropped below EUR 20 000."
"The fundamental contribution of Socrates to a European education area has been applauded repeatedly and is beyond question."
"We should not forget that Socrates is the heartbeat of a European society of knowledge and learning and what worries me is that transnational, that is, intergovernmental cooperation on education might displace the Community approach."
"However, the Bologna and Prague declarations were in favour of these supposedly faster methods."
"We must not forget that the means and ends of the so-called open method of cooperation with the Member States on education would have been more or less unthinkable without the positive experience gained from Socrates."
"To sacrifice Community education objectives to short-term transnational cooperation would be an unspeakable step backwards."
"To close, we need to bear two further points in mind."
"First, Socrates is an important, decisive European programme, because it educates people in Europe and is the European answer to the education prospects of the future."
"Secondly, the open method of intergovernmental cooperation must not be allowed to undermine the importance of the Community approach."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Socrates, together with a number of other programmes, really is the European Union programme which builds Europe from the bottom up because, as Doris Pack has already told us, this programme allows generations of young people to experience Europe for themselves and gain a European perspective which stays with them for the rest of their personal and professional lives."
"That is why it is vital for Parliament to take the Council and Commission to task during these procedures and, of course, to make its own contribution."
"I should therefore like to address two points on which I would be grateful for the backing of other committees, especially the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The first point is the question of decentralisation."
"It has proven its worth, but the national agencies have a counterpart in Brussels; in future, this role will be filled by the executive agencies."
"We will need to work with these executive agencies as well as we have worked, thankfully, with the national agencies."
"So I urge the Commission and the Committee on Budgetary Control to create the conditions for such cooperation during consultations concerning these executive agencies."
"My second point is the question of financial control."
"We also need the support of the Committee on Budgetary Control if we really are to achieve the objective of awarding small sums in aid without incurring high administrative costs."
"The Commission should be given the necessary support here through Parliament in general and the Committee on Budgetary Control in particular."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have heard a great deal of praise for the Socrates programme and I have no wish to go over it all again."
"I should just like to point out that around 40% of the 376 million people living in the European Union are under 30 years old, making them one of the biggest target groups of the Socrates programme, as well as Grundtvig, Minerva, Media Plus and other such programmes."
"So the programme has the chance to make its mark over coming years by promoting mobility, intercultural education and educational diversity."
"It is on the right track for improvement, as we can see from the second stage and as we have just heard."
"But the weaknesses in the system also need to be pointed out."
"They include delays in preparing contracts between the Commission and the national agencies, which keep addressing the problems and which keep being hampered during implementation by delays."
"The same applies to delays in paying out assistance, because when only small sums are involved, the beneficiaries need to receive them as quickly as possible and the pre-financing stage needs to be shortened because, in addition to doing the work, they generally have to pre-finance the projects as well."
"Mrs Pack is also quite right to call for a so-called fast-track procedure to speed up the programme and do away with cumbersome applications and cumbersome formalities for amounts under EUR 20 000."
"We should also consider if we really need the extra burden of cofinancing when only small amounts are involved."
"We must force cooperation with other Community programmes because we want programmes to run in parallel rather than in series, so that we can make use of available resources."
"The Commission's follow-up reports should also take account of the participants' follow-up reports."
"Because what is important to us is the outcome of these programmes."
"What impact do they have, for example, on teacher training?"
"What positive experiences do pupils or students take away with them?"
"All this is important if we are to be able to pursue or refine the programme."
"I think we have the right to expect results."
"As for the financing, we fought hard to set it on its feet."
"I agree with Mrs Pack; if we enlarge in 2004, we must increase the funding, otherwise this programme will be doomed to failure."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I elaborate upon the report on the implementation of the Socrates Programme, I should like to congratulate Mrs Pack on the sound work she has done."
"We have heard all the figures and it is impressive."
"The Socrates I Programme, which ran from 1995 until 1999, was very successful, yet also met with the necessary criticism."
"The students and teachers involved admitted wholeheartedly that the experience gathered had been very useful and that the programme had made a practical contribution towards European citizenship."
"However, the criticism mainly centred around the procedures being overly bureaucratic and insufficiently transparent, around payments being long overdue and around too little being done with the results."
"So how are things being done this time round?"
"The Socrates II Programme, that runs until 2006, has now been underway for more than 18 months, and although an interim evaluation report has not yet been published, there are already indications that a great deal has improved."
"The relationship between the Commission and the national bureaux appears to have become considerably more flexible, and the administrative procedures have been simplified in places."
"Nevertheless, I should like to make some observations."
"The procedures, certainly those for the smaller projects, still put potential participants off on account of their laboriousness."
"And according to my sources, contracts are sent out late on a regular basis, and payments are overdue."
"This is unacceptable to my group."
"As a result of this, projects run into financial difficulty, and that certainly does nothing to promote the EU' s credibility."
"Furthermore, cooperation with other European programmes still appears to be inadequate, which is also a significant shortcoming."
"The Socrates Programme must be managed efficiently, and this also includes coordination with other European programmes."
"I should therefore like to urge the Commission to devote special attention to these points."
"The Socrates Programme is too valuable an instrument for promoting the mobility of pupils, students and teachers to be allowed to go under due to administrative and financial stumbling blocks."
"It is an excellent way of promoting knowledge of other European languages and cultures in order to achieve a harmonious Europe, which is something we all want."
"In my view, this programme should be given a freer rein, financially too, but, Commissioner, I am jumping the gun a little bit, given the position of my own Finance Minister."
"Mr President, I very much welcome the establishment of the second phase of Socrates and thank Mrs Pack for her excellent work."
"We have undoubtedly seen increased cooperation in the field of European education combined with a new commitment to life-long learning and that is heartening."
"In Wales, my own nation, and indeed the whole of the UK, there is a problem in encouraging the acquisition of language skills across the board."
"ERASMUS has gone a long way to improving this and I would like to see an increase in the figure of 460 000 participating students a year."
"Such exchanges make a distinct commitment to better linguistic skills, but also promote cultural cooperation."
"The Commission must continue to do its utmost to ensure that the application procedure is more user-friendly and I agree with comments by other speakers that at the moment the administrative side of the programme makes it difficult for participants."
"There has been a real administrative burden on the applicants throughout this programme, particularly under the COMENIUS scheme which needs to be addressed urgently."
"Regardless of how successful this programme is, it must always be as open as possible for those wishing to participate."
"Mr President, the Socrates programme is not just a system of educational exchanges."
"It is a tool for moulding young people and imposing a certain educational model."
"The basic problem of education, by which I mean a general curriculum for young people, falls outside the scope of the programme."
"On the contrary, its purpose is to manipulate pupils, students and teachers in order to establish the European one-way system and make it easier to subjugate young people to the policy of the European Union, to the rules of the market economy and to so-called new working conditions."
"The European education area is a front for converging education systems by tailoring them to the requirements of big business and the last thing that does is to improve education overall."
"Even educational exchanges and the system for providing lessons operate as a lever in this direction."
"The first thing we need to do, if we really want to improve education systems, is to stop the European Union from interfering."
"In the final analysis, this is a matter for the grass-roots movement."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Pack on her report on the Socrates programme, which has provided me with the starting point for a number of observations."
"We can certainly say that the main objective of developing European citizenship and, in particular, of improving the quality of the educational systems, has been fully achieved."
"Evidence of this are the considerable benefits derived from the programme in terms of increased cultural awareness and the overcoming of cultural prejudice and stereotypical concepts and, following on from this, the language skills acquired by those receiving Socrates grants."
"Despite that, the analysis revealed a number of weak points such as the integration of the Socrates programme with the Comenius, Lingua and Leonardo da Vinci programmes, which will require considerable adjustment and greater coordination and consolidation."
"Something which I feel demands a great deal of reflection is the financial support given to the successful applicants for Socrates grants: the appropriation is insufficient to support the students because of a quantitative grant distribution requirement that has resulted in the available sums being too small."
"Indeed, the situations in the Member States differ widely in the face of a global reduction in the size of the grants allocated to each student, while the parental contribution is tending to increase."
"As the report has already pointed out, this trend clearly generates the danger of growing inequalities between students."
"In this regard, the basic resources provided need to be sufficient to enable students to be independent and live without relying heavily on support from their families, considering that study grants should not be differentiated according to the country of residence of the students or the country which they visit under the project."
"This financial discrimination would make the programme available only to a group of individuals who can count on parental support."
"A further highly negative aspect of the allocation of the grants is the bureaucratic financing procedure, which is currently seriously behind schedule. This must of necessity be rectified."
"Mr President, education, education, education - the British Prime Minister once said this was his priority."
"I have some doubts about that and I really wonder whether this is our priority in Europe."
"Certainly not if you look at what we spend on it."
"In Europe we spend EUR 2.5 billion each year on olives, we spent less than EUR 2 billion over six years on the Socrates Programme."
"The rapporteur even had to fight to get a separate debate on education on our agenda this morning."
"For the single market to flourish and for Europe to flourish we need an educated and mobile workforce, confident about crossing national boundaries."
"The Socrates Programme is important for that and so making it more efficient as Ms Pack's report urges is really very important."
"Linguistic skills are certainly important for labour mobility."
"We all know that those students who participate in the Socrates Programme benefit tremendously from it; sadly, not enough students do."
"For students from my own country there is always an imbalance between the number of Continental students wanting to go to the United Kingdom and the very limited number of British students prepared are willing to go to Continental countries."
"What is the reason for that?"
"It is very clear - the lack of linguistic skills among students in Britain."
"We must send a message to the British Government that they should reverse their appalling decision of the last few weeks to allow secondary students in Britain not to learn any foreign language at all."
"That is certainly not the way to ensure that Europe will flourish or that Britain will get the best benefits from its membership of the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Socrates programme is a good example of action that relates closely to the people and which has an important European value-added element."
"We have also had some experience of it in Finland, which became involved in the programme while EU membership was still being negotiated."
"We on the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport hope that the current applicant countries will take full advantage of the opportunities the programme offers."
"The Centre for International Mobility, which administers the programme in Finland, recently published a study on the experiences of foreign exchange students."
"We are very pleased that Finland is of interest as a destination."
"Every year we receive more than 3 000 foreign students."
"As the report may have universal applicability I will summarise it briefly. The respondents stressed the importance of study in a foreign country, above all with regard to personal and social growth."
"The courses of study were also reasonably successful."
"The exchange students completed an average of thirty-three study weeks during the academic year."
"Finland earned special praise for the excellent facilities in its universities and colleges, particularly computers and libraries, as well as for the study guidance provided and student halls of residence."
"From the point of view of the mobility of the workforce it is interesting that the students said they were now more willing to consider a possible career in Finland."
"This was especially true of students from Central Europe: southern Europeans were not very interested in working in a Nordic country."
"The report under discussion pays particular attention to the processing of applications and the flow of payments."
"Although there have been improvements in these areas problems still remain."
"The report states that unwarranted delays in the payment of grants hamper the implementation of programmes and bring Community institutions into disrepute."
"With regard to this, I would, if I may, draw everyone' s attention to Parliament' s role as a provider of guidelines."
"While, on the one hand, we insist on greater efficiency and flexibility, we might, on the other hand, be increasing bureaucracy and making it take longer to deal with matters."
"For example, the Commission used to make a lump-sum payment to the Technical Assistance Office to cover payment of grants."
"Now it has to fill out as many as one thousand eight hundred separate payment orders."
"This obviously has an impact on the speed of the process."
"Furthermore, the implementation of the programmes in the Member States must be subjected to assessment by an external auditor."
"Therefore, a small rural university in Finland, for example, has to embark on a costly procedure for the sake, let us say, of two minor projects, even though, under our laws, the State Audit Office will perform the same task in any case."
"To prevent malpractice and error we should establish good administrative practice and not just devise ever more complicated control systems."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner. We and those responsible, all deserve a pat on the back for this marvellous programme."
"Allow me to start with what has become a rather lovely tradition, that is, by scattering roses over the rapporteur; well done, Doris!"
"We agree with the criticisms and I shall not enumerate them again; perhaps I should but one minute does not give me enough time."
"What is my brief here?"
"Obviously to canvass for this marvellous programme."
"It is not a glossy brochure, it is grass-roots policy in the flesh, it is a European answer to numerous questions."
"But the answers which Socrates gives are not quite enough."
"Socrates does not resolve any fundamental problems."
"Socrates helps, it airs political questions and brings them to the public's attention, but does not absolve the Member States of responsibility."
"I would gladly hear more from our Member States on this, not just on Socrates, but on their responsibility, on what education means for Europe."
"I would be glad to engage in a public debate on a European area of education with the people in charge of education."
"Do you know what we have achieved with Socrates, quite apart from the tangible results?"
"The names of old Europeans are being used: Comenius, Erasmus, Grundtvig - these old names trip off the lips of young people as easily as the words to a rap song."
"We really have achieved what we set out to do."
"Doris Pack said that Socrates is there for us from the cradle to the grave."
"I would therefore like to see us start a bit earlier, not at school age, but with infants."
"Because, as everyone has said, learning foreign languages is so incredibly important, it is of immense importance to all of us and we know that it starts in the nursery."
"Perhaps our next step should be in the direction of the kindergarten."
"Mr President, from a quantitative and operational point of view, certainly, the Socrates programme has progressed well and Commissioner Reding is one of the people we have to thank for that."
"We have also heard a great many favourable comments from the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, who should not detract from her report by turning the House into a sort of football field and giving yellow cards to speakers with whom she disagrees."
"I think that every view expressed here is useful on an issue as tricky as education in Europe."
"I should like to point out, first, the importance of increasing Community funding and participation, and secondly, the need to streamline the programme and heed the views of those who take part in it."
"With Erasmus in particular, there is a risk, while it is good to give children a chance to study abroad, of disrupting undergraduate syllabuses."
"When asked, many of the children who have taken part will say, it was a good experience but there are a lot of unanswered questions in undergraduate education overall."
"Lastly, I should like to point out that this programme is by its very nature a programme of freedom, freedom of movement of students and freedom of movement of ideas and knowledge."
"We need to see a large question mark here, because it also extends to countries outside the European Union, especially Turkey; a large question mark because there are tens of thousands of children and young people, like the children in schools who cannot study in their mother tongue, Kurdish."
"We must not forget this, we must not turn a blind eye, we need to make this programme a programme of overall freedom."
"May I first of all acknowledge the value and potential of Socrates and in so doing thank the rapporteur for her work."
"I welcome the report which is positive."
"Its adoption will lead to a more effective and consumer-friendly application of the programmes."
"The rapporteur is to be complimented on her efforts to take on board the experiences of those directly involved and I particularly wish to acknowledge the fact that the views of the Irish agency, Largos, are reflected in the text."
"I fully agree on the need to simplify the administrative procedures and to make the programmes more accessible and relevant to national agencies and participants, in particular the proposal to develop the Symmetry information management system."
"The rapporteur's proposal for regular progress reports on joint actions will lead to ongoing evaluation, thus ensuring maximum value in respect of funding and, more importantly, greater effectiveness of the programmes themselves."
"I compliment the many voluntary participants and, in particular, the teachers without whose involvement the programmes could not succeed."
"I have met many of them and have experienced at first hand their resourcefulness and dedication."
"All in all, Socrates is addressing in a unique and effective way the need for a greater intra-community action in the field of education thus leading to a greater understanding and sharing of Europe's diverse culture."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first to express my heartfelt thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, and indeed to Parliament as a whole. Parliament has proved a committed partner throughout this common enterprise of establishing educational programmes and setting the Europe of education on track."
"Its support has been invaluable. We would not be where we are now if Parliament had not lent a hand."
"Thank you all again."
"Mrs Pack, I should also like to thank you and the other Members who have taken the floor today for your positive assessment of the youth programmes."
"They exemplify the kind of Europe we are aspiring to, a Europe where authority is not exercised from the top down but from the bottom up."
"This is actually starting to happen."
"Hundreds of thousands of young people have been able to study in another country. Hundreds of thousands of teaching groups are working with teaching groups in another country, and hundreds of thousands of teachers are on the road."
"That is great!"
"I fully agree with those who believe that, apart from occasional minor problems, this splendid programme is working very well and should be developed further."
"I also agree with those who maintain that there are financial risks involved, and that the grants are too small."
"I have to tell you that I often meet Erasmus students."
"I have not yet come across a single unhappy one."
"They all say that given a second chance, they would do it all again."
"However, they also tell me that the grants are too small."
"We are aware of this and very much hope that the Finance Ministers will increase the resources available, so we can pass the increase on to students. It would then be possible to bridge the gap between social classes able to pay for travel and those unable to do so."
"I am entirely on your side."
"Consequently I trust you will support me in the future, as we press for increased financial resources for these programmes, particularly in the context of enlargement of the Union."
"As the House must be aware, we are already working with potential new Member States to ensure they are fully integrated into our educational programmes. Nonetheless, costs are bound to increase dramatically once these states become part of the Union."
"Additional resources will therefore be required if the awards are not to become even smaller. We shall have to fight for these, and I am confident Parliament will be on my side."
"I should now like to turn to the issues that the speakers have raised."
"Parliament does recognise that improvements have taken place as regards monitoring and evaluation."
"We are currently implementing a programme to evaluate Socrates II, and the results will be used as a basis for the Commission' s proposals for new initiatives to replace Socrates."
"I can assure the Chairman that the committee will be kept abreast of research and its assessment."
"Then there is the issue of the relationship between the Commission and national agencies, that is, decentralisation."
"You will be aware that we have striven to put the links between the Commission and these agencies on a sound footing, and efforts to bring about an improvement are ongoing."
"All those involved have referred to administrative burdens."
"We have endeavoured to simplify the administration of the programme and make it more democratic, as you have also recognised."
"We have adjusted the Erasmus institutional contract to reduce by about 50% the number of contracts that beneficiaries have to sign."
"My services are also considering the feasibility of amending Socrates decisions, as Mrs Pack suggests. The aim is to avoid increasing the bureaucratic burden, particularly for schools involved in small projects."
"This will be achieved, Mrs Pack, with Parliament' s help of course."
"Once again, I appeal to Members to lend us a hand because progress is much faster once the House takes these issues to heart."
"There is only one minor area where I am unable to respond positively."
"You have suggested doing away with cofinancing for small projects."
"I would very much like to, but integral financing would contravene the Community financial rules adopted recently and endorsed by Parliament."
"A radical reform of these rules would be required before going any further. Parliament would have to give an opinion as to whether it wished to go down that road."
"Regarding the payment contract delays, things are now much better."
"We have not yet cleared the backlog, but the year 2001 will be an improvement on 2000, and 2002 will in turn be an improvement on 2001."
"The new procedures are now in place."
"We have brought committee meetings forward and simplified the legal base to finance the candidate countries."
"I should like to say a few words on Symmetry."
"An effective data management system is urgently required and we are making progress, despite the problems experienced at the outset."
"Following a call to tender, a contractor was appointed in 2001."
"Symmetry will be developed in 2002 and 2003."
"Delivery is planned for August 2003."
"Lastly, there are the Joint Actions."
"You are quite right, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to have plenty of these."
"2001 was an introductory year involving a limited number of issues of common interest to Socrates, Leonardo and Youth."
"The 2002 call for proposals will take place in April and the topics chosen are social integration of target groups, active citizenship amongst the young, local guidance networks, formal and informal training. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you will appreciate that we are taking Parliament' s proposals very much to heart."
"This is not just to keep Members happy, but quite simply because the House is right. Parliament is quite properly inspired by its wish to improve the citizens' Europe, a Europe whose young people are the cornerstone in the building of the new continent we are all engaged in constructing - a Europe where it is good to be alive."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Culture 2000 Programme"
"The next item is the report (A5-0018/2002) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the implementation of the 'Culture 2000' programme [2000/2317(INI)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the implementation of the Culture 2000 programme has been a constant concern of the parliamentary committee of which I am a member."
"My colleagues and I have attempted, on the one hand, to monitor the various fronts on which the programme is being developed and the methodology or methodologies that have been adopted for its implementation; on the other hand, we have sought to make soundings amongst our electors and amongst European cultural agents and operators in general, so as to gauge the reactions provoked by the programme and, most importantly, so that we can assess its results."
"This legislature is now almost halfway through and the framework programme has also already reached almost half of its intended duration."
"The Commission will soon have to revise it, particularly in view of the financial shortcomings it has experienced from the very beginning, which are being felt more and more and which the President has just mentioned."
"It is also becoming necessary for all of us to start thinking about 'post-Culture 2000' , in other words, about the programme that will follow the current one and which will have to take account of its successes and failures."
"The report that I am presenting reflects the deeply and widely held opinion of all the members of the parliamentary committee who voted for it."
"Since this is a follow-up report, your rapporteur deliberately sought to promote and stimulate the tabling of amendments, because these would be likely to add further issues relevant to the study."
"Consequently, almost all of the amendments tabled were incorporated into the text."
"The report therefore reflects the many different shades of opinion that were expressed in the parliamentary committee and very accurately conveys the reactions of our electors."
"A report of this nature cannot fail to reaffirm the high-minded objectives of Culture 2000 and its role in the construction of European citizenship and in the defence of cultural diversity and of linguistic pluralism."
"It must also reaffirm the inspirational and high-minded principles which the Programme has obeyed since its conception, which cannot, for any reason, be ignored at the implementation stage."
"Both these principles and those objectives must be seen as fundamental building blocks for European integration and for the development of the democratic citizenship that all citizens of the Union enjoy."
"Since these have been carefully considered, approved and signed up to, not only by this House, but also by the Council and the Commission, there is no reason for these positions to be changed."
"These are lines of cultural policy that are of importance to all Member States and, with the prospect of enlargement, to all Europeans."
"They are about constructing the European cultural area as an area crucial to freedom and to freedoms."
"Lastly, Mr President, I should like to ask Commissioner Reding to view this report as a tool which could help the Commission to more effectively undertake the tasks entrusted to it in this field; its present tasks, now that the Programme has reached its halfway stage, and its future tasks, as long as the experience it has gained - as I said - can lead to an even better programme following on from Culture 2000."
"This House' s vote will therefore mark an important milestone in cooperation between Parliament and the Commission."
"The Culture 2000 programme will also provide the helping hand which the Commissioner mentioned a few moments ago with regard to the Socrates Programme."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Graça Moura for having taken so much time and trouble in his effort to pinpoint Parliament's political guidelines, which also underlie this programme, in the implementation of the programme."
"For example, how does this programme give our citizens improved access to and participation in culture?"
"What actions involve our fellow citizens?"
"The huge administrative costs and the criteria for handling the programme cannot conceal the programme's original objectives, nor should they call them into question."
"Having read the report, we must state, loud and clear, exactly what we expect of a European cultural policy, especially in the run up to enlargement and the forthcoming convention."
"If you talk to artists today, they are all worried that culture will get buried under the convention, under the debate on subsidiarity."
"I hope it does not and we shall fight to see that it does not."
"How can the mechanics of the programme be improved, so that it becomes a real cultural tool which meets the requirements of artists and citizens alike?"
"Should the programme support the arts sector or work for the good of society?"
"Given the current situation, these are the questions we need to ask when we think of the future."
"Needless to say, this, too, is a programme which needs to be put on a better financial footing if we are to avoid creating frustration rather than satisfaction."
"I do not want to anticipate the debate on the follow-up programme post-2004, but even Mr Graça Moura addressed this point because it is already well under way at the Commission, and the report calls on us to start giving it serious thought so as to avoid leaving the field open, including at the convention, to the enemies of any form of culture policy work at EU level."
"We should all remember that a European cultural policy which respects our citizens' differences and cultural traditions goes straight to the heart of the political debate. In other words, it is the only way of giving Europe a soul."
"Mr President, the procedure we are dealing with, the control of a programme throughout its execution, is normal in any Parliament."
"For this reason, I think that Mr Graça Moura' s report is very appropriate. I will say straight away that it deserves the approval of the Socialist Group."
"After the conciliation procedure, which has been mentioned previously, I expressed my annoyance with the Council given its intransigence in relation to accepting the financing we requested."
"This means that a programme that directly affects what we call the heart of Europe and which replaces other programmes that in the last few years have been most enthusiastically received by the most dynamic and youngest citizens of the European Union, has been allocated little more than EUR 33 million per year, an amount so small within the already modest Community budget that it disappoints those of us who see the European Union as something more than solely a vehicle for agricultural and structural spending."
"On this basis, we should remember two circumstances: the first is that the Culture 2000 programme exists alongside other resolutions from this Parliament which should produce guidelines for its implementation."
"I would cite as a particular example the Ruffolo report in which, amongst other things, the Commission is urged to set up a European observatory to monitor cultural cooperation or a three-year cultural cooperation plan."
"The Commission should therefore adopt a dynamic approach to Culture 2000, incorporating Parliament' s guidelines year after year."
"My second observation: the years remaining in this programme will coincide almost precisely with a working period, initiated at the Nice Council, which we have come to call a 'constituent' period."
"Whether there is a Constitution at the end of this or not, it is clear that the desire to increase the links between European communities and to awaken in each citizen a feeling of belonging to the Community cultural space is amongst the main objectives of the Convention."
"Is there a sufficient constituent basis amongst European communities?"
"Is there any cultural identity between them?"
"Many of us think that the constituent basis should be European culture, following Bruckmanns' s idea, that is to say, a common behaviour, a similar attitude to life, shared ideals, common artistic and cultural patrimony, and so on."
"Therefore, the political centre of gravity at this time should be more than just currency, more than the CFSP, even, but the linking of citizens to the Community idea and the search for and protection of a European culture."
"EUR 33 million is a very paltry sum to finance the only European cultural programme to be implemented during this period, but we can console ourselves, Mr President, with the thought that the conclusions of this report will contribute to the improvement of its functioning."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Culture 2000 programme is ideal for promoting European cultural cooperation."
"As mentioned a moment ago, it will inject feeling and soul into Europe."
"I should therefore like to thank Mr Graça Moura for his initiative in drawing up an interim balance sheet."
"This is very useful."
"It has become a sound report on which I should like to make a brief comment."
"Culture 2000 has become an unwieldy programme since it aims to cover the entire field of our cultural heritage and, as I understand it, this has created great difficulty for the Commission, certainly in the first year."
"And although there is some improvement, the complaints keep flooding in."
"As mentioned before, red tape puts many potential participants off and, especially in small, often innovative projects set up - as, of course, is often the case in the cultural sector - by inexperienced participants who have nonetheless taken the plunge, there is very often the risk that they will be rejected in the first round on purely formal grounds, which is counterproductive."
"The criteria are often unclear, and even national bureaux struggle to make sense of them."
"In my opinion, all of us together must think very carefully about what we want to achieve in future with cultural policy, and we must set priorities for our instruments."
"I should like to add this to the agenda, so that we can also have an impact on the Convention."
"In conclusion, I should like to say something about finances."
"As I have already indicated, I completely agree that the budget is small."
"But irrespective of whether the financial means are sufficient, I should like to note that they need to be managed efficiently, for a large proportion is not being spent at the moment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner. Roy Perry mentioned the sum spent on olives each year during the previous debate on education, and EUR 167 million over five years is a pittance for culture."
"As an actress that is nothing new to me."
"It is all too familiar."
"What a pity we cannot change and improve on this."
"My thanks to the rapporteur, especially for his willingness to engage in an open dialogue with us shadow rapporteurs."
"He really was there to discuss and take everything on board."
"We have two major problems."
"One is the material direction we want to take in the future, the questions we are asking now."
"That is not anticipating the debate, as Mrs Pack just said; the debate needs to be held now, if we need new ideas and want to format a new programme in 2004 for 2005, provided it is still running."
"The other problem area is administration, bureaucratic expenditure, overly vague selection criteria and implementation methods which are shouting out to be modified."
"These details are all contained in the report."
"I want to canvass in public for this Culture 2000 programme even now."
"Culture and cultural programmes are the soul of Europe, as everyone has said."
"You do realise that art and culture have an exponential effect on our integration policy and if we lose these partners along our common way, then our numbers shall dwindle and our strength in this fight, which we really do want to join forces on, will be sapped."
"The Sunday papers are full of articles swearing allegiance to culture, but nothing ever comes of it."
"I am already fed up with saying the same things, but we must keep on saying them."
"It is not just the Culture Ministers; the Finance Ministers also have a responsibility."
"Everyone in Europe has to find a place in society."
"Everyone is searching, perhaps from the cradle to the grave, to quote Mrs Pack."
"Everyone wants to feel at home in our European society, to recognise themselves in the reflection of European society which art and culture offer."
"If we cannot manage this, we shall not mange to root out conflicts, perhaps even as they arise, and we have a joint responsibility to do so."
"Parliament is fighting the good fight, the Commission is fighting the good fight."
"If we cannot get the Council on board, it is we who shall be left holding the baby!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems that the Council - incidentally, the Council is not with us - has engineered a kind of Barcelona for culture. By that I mean that objectives are identified, indicators established and evaluations requested."
"Is that not actually the situation we find ourselves in when we draw up a mid-term evaluation report on Culture 2000 and realise that several problems have still to be resolved?"
"There are plenty of problems."
"Culture 2000 could certainly be criticised for lack of transparency, difficulties over selection, in short, for everything related to method."
"Nonetheless, it is abundantly clear that method is not the only issue at stake in Culture 2000. We seem to have reached a turning point."
"The difficulties we have come up against in Culture 2000 - and when I say we, I am referring to both Parliament and the Commission - have arisen because we are now required to progress, to move on rather than set up yet another programme."
"Previously we had several small programmes; we now have a single large one."
"What then did we find now we have a single large programme?"
"We found that in the ten years following Maastricht we have indeed succeeded in putting in place some 2 500 projects involving 12 000 operators. The other side of the coin, however, is that between 1996 and 2000, 8 000 projects involving 40 000 operators were rejected."
"It is abundantly clear that demand far exceeds what we can supply, and that the problem confronting us is not merely one of method."
"We must therefore seek other solutions beyond how best to see this programme through to its conclusion."
"Last week, I was surprised - pleasantly surprised, that is - when I heard the Culture Minister speaking for the presidency and calling for the implementation of Article 151."
"Article 151 of the Maastricht Treaty should indeed be implemented, but if you study the text of that article it appears to be an incentive."
"Fostering, support and encouragement are certainly called for."
"More is probably needed."
"Bear in mind that we are also discussing education today, and we know that education is forging ahead precisely because we moved beyond providing encouragement."
"We now take decisions. Perhaps when the Convention meets and discussions on a new approach and redrafting a number of key texts are held, Article 151 should be reviewed from a perspective other than its mere implementation."
"Obviously, there is more to all this than the problems we are confronted with in connection with Culture 2000 and culture in general and which are budgetary in nature."
"The budget is not simply a cash register; there is the issue of unanimity as against qualified majority."
"Matters of principle need to be discussed."
"Referring back to what previous speakers said on the size of projects, citizenship, promotion of citizenship, encouragement and support for creativity, clearly, both parties should be involved."
"Nonetheless, each should retain its particular approach whilst working together."
"What should the role of Member States be?"
"What should their initiatives involve?"
"What should the European Union do?"
"These, Commissioner, are the reasons why I wanted to propose that we move towards a Barcelona for culture."
"Madam President, I would firstly like to make an observation with regard to all the issues we deal with in the parliamentary committee which I belong to, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"Less than 1% of the Community budget is dedicated to all of these areas, which leads me to believe that they are not one of Parliament' s greatest priorities, given that such a small proportion of the budget is dedicated to them."
"We hope that this situation will change in the near future."
"Secondly, I would like to say that just a few months ago I attended a meeting, in the Círculo de Bellas Artes in Madrid, attended by cultural leaders from the Member States, such as the directors of national museums, and I am sorry to say that they were all fairly disgruntled with the Culture 2000 programme."
"Many of them said that they thought it was a backward step in relation to the previous programmes, Ariadna and Raphael, and that given the expenditure on the bureaucratic formalities necessary to request financial assistance, that assistance did not pay at the end of the day."
"Generally speaking, they expressed the feeling of being somewhat deceived."
"I feel that we need to try to distribute the available funds so as to create more support than discontent, and I feel that this is very important for the image of culture at the European level."
"I think it is important that we simplify bureaucracy, because everyone agrees that this was a great obstacle."
"We also need to make sure that there are no delays in payments, because many beneficiaries cannot cope with such delays."
"It is also important for us to ensure that projects are not rejected for purely formal reasons, and that we have to provide opportunities for small structures, another issue on which there were complaints."
"Madam President, hand on heart, fellow members of the European institutions: do you really believe that European competition law, specifications for the height of tractor seats or directives liberalising the electricity market make hearts leap at the thought of European integration?"
"Surely we need something else the people in our Member States can identify with."
"Cultural exchanges and cultural life can bring about a plethora of positive results, far more than a disputed regulation can."
"The cultural heritage and cultural diversity of Europe should have been mainstreamed in Community policy since the Maastricht Treaty, ever since the word culture appeared in the Treaties. So much for the theory."
"In practice, the Member States jealously guard their national and regional cultural sovereignty."
"The Council insists on the principle of unanimity on cultural affairs, tiresome conciliation procedures are the order of the day and low-level agreements and infuriating delays the consequence - witness Culture 2000."
"The budget is and always has been derisory."
"At 0.04% all in, cultural expenditure represents a sliver rather than a slice of the European budget."
"It is soul-destroying for artists to know that there is a 90% probability of their application being rejected - however convincing their idea - because fewer than 10% of applications stand a chance of being rubberstamped."
"And it is not much fun for us Members of the European Parliament to keep dashing hopes as we turn down applicants by the dozen."
"No one wants to rob the Member States of their authority but a bit more openness would not go amiss."
"Unfortunately, it is not even to be found in the practical implementation of Culture 2000."
"As we have already said, crippling bureaucracy and delays with payments, which are ruinous for organisers, make life unnecessarily difficult for applicants, to mention just two of the criticisms."
"In the final analysis, what we also lack is a consistent material concept which answers the question: exactly what is the purpose of the aid?"
"To stage major events to reach as many people as possible in one go?"
"Or to give as many artists as possible the opportunity to work in other countries?"
"Mainstream culture has a much easier time of it."
"But the way to people's hearts is to support less established artists, networks and private initiatives."
"That is what creates European added value."
"The European Union is the most powerful economic area in the world."
"We gladly brag about that with undisguised pride."
"But the European Union is also a cultural area of immeasurable diversity."
"We should be making broad strokes, not fiddling about at the edges, and not just with Culture 2000."
"Madam President, last year with the European Parliament' s Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, I had the opportunity to visit Cracow in Poland."
"We learned a great deal from that visit, not least that the applicant countries will make a tremendous contribution to the cultural life and vitality of Europe."
"We asked a question of one of the professors at the Cultural Institute in Cracow: Is there a distinctive European culture The reply summed it up neatly: He said he often visited America, and clearly we share a western culture with the United States, but nonetheless when he went there was something missing and that was the historic environment."
"He said that in city like Cracow you can see, touch, feel history and culture all around."
"I can certainly see why as a citizen of that city he made that point."
"So I endorse Mr Graça Moura's comment that it was regrettable that the historic environment was not included in the forum on cultural cooperation last year."
"We must never neglect the historic environment in all our countries."
"I simply endorse the rapporteurs call to include our Mediterranean neighbours, our Islamic neighbours; we must cooperate with the Islamic countries."
"In particular we must remember that Europe today is a multicultural society."
"We must rejoice in that and we must make sure that our programme contains significant elements to deal with that."
"There has been comment today, some of them fair criticisms, about difficulties in administration, but I want to cite a success story."
"I was delighted in my own constituency of Portsmouth that a grant of EUR 150 000 was given to a consortium of museums, including Portsmouth's D-Day Museum, dedicated to peace across Europe."
"That is a project that certainly has been very successful and they are delighted to have received European support."
"We must monitor projects very carefully."
"That is one I am sure that will pass with flying colours."
"If we want more money for culture in Europe, let us think seriously about a European lottery to get the money for it."
"Madam President, during the previous debate on the European Socrates programme, we welcomed broad participation by our citizens, especially our young citizens, thereby bringing the European concept into the public eye throughout Europe."
"A great deal has been said about funding for and bureaucratic obstacles to the cultural agenda, but I should like to direct your attention to the question of the concept and, more importantly, to the question of what next?"
"I am very grateful to Mr Graça Moura for conducting the discussion on the future concept for Culture 2000 so openly in his report and express my support to him for doing so."
"My question is, is it right, given that we have so little money, to promote big projects first and foremost."
"Surely we should also be prepared to integrate small networks, which can inject momentum, and exponential momentum at that, into the concept for the follow-up programme?"
"That is what I am in favour of and I should like us to put proper funding in place and, at the same time, develop the programme so that there is less red tape and more opportunity for smaller groups to participate."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Culture 2000 programme - as this good report establishes very graphically - does not only make clear the increasing need for culture, but also makes a contribution towards the creation of a unitary cultural area."
"The report, though, shows just as clearly that this programme is marked by a disparity between the wealth of its objectives on the one hand and the astonishing poverty of its budget on the other."
"The rapporteur is right to highlight the explicit recognition of culture as an economic factor and also as a factor in social integration and citizenship."
"As with so many other programmes, for example, within the regional policy framework - which is not to excuse it - it cannot but be noted that the first two years were characterised by the late appearance of calls for proposals."
"Indeed, I will at this point use the same words as the rapporteur, who speaks of 'chaotic programme management' , in these first two years."
"At the end of the day, Culture 2000's low level of implementation during its first year of operation can be attributed to that and to lengthy and cumbersome internal procedures."
"This is where, in my view, the Commission has to make real efforts to shorten the cycle of the projects and guarantee the programme's continuity."
"In conclusion, I would like to pick out from this report's Explanatory Statement a question that particularly interests me as a regional politician and put it to the Commission. It is this: How can the necessary complementarity and coordination be established between Culture 2000 and the resources of the Structural Funds allocated to culture in the Member States?"
"That might be an interesting angle, and one to which we might give some thought."
"Madam President, I should first like to thank Mr Graça Moura and his team for all their efforts to make that splendid idea of a Europe of culture, a Europe with historical roots and a Europe anchored in the soul of its citizens become a reality."
"The programme was set up on 14 February 2000 and has therefore just celebrated its second birthday."
"It is still in its infancy but enough experience has already been gained to provide the basis for an initial assessment."
"It emerges from this report that there are a number of points on which Parliament agrees with the Commission, even though we do not always explain conclusions regarding the current programme in the same way."
"In addition, I have made a note of some useful guidelines for the future and I would like to thank Parliament for these."
"In the first place, it has emerged that Culture 2000 is a difficult programme to manage."
"This is certainly the case and must be recognised. Further, as you have stated, there is a mismatch between the number of objectives agreed and the level of the budget."
"I am sure the House recalls the battle Parliament had to fight, not against Ministers for Culture but against Ministers in charge of budgets. The latter did not wish to award funds to culture."
"How can one hope to manage a thousand fine ideas, all perfectly feasible in the field, when there is only enough funding for three?"
"That particular circle cannot be squared, and unfortunately this is the situation we are in regarding this project."
"I have to say to all those who are concerned that we have not spent the money, that the money certainly has been well spent, down to the last euro. There is nothing left in the kitty."
"The reason for this is that if we did not spend what little we do have available, requests for additional funding could not be justified."
"All that could be spent has been spent, and we have still fallen far short of satisfying all the needs identified by the world of culture. I am not referring to a wish list, but to genuine needs."
"You are doubtless also aware that there is scope for the programme to cater for a wide range of new beneficiaries, as soon as they are in a position to develop cultural actions and to set up a project."
"To give you an example, ladies and gentlemen, in the context of a single call for proposals, a dance company might find itself competing with a chamber of commerce or a tourist office."
"That is what openness is all about, that is what is happening in the field."
"One should perhaps consider whether to continue in this way or restrict the opportunities for involvement."
"It is also worth recalling that between 2000 and 2001 the programme was extended to a further nine countries."
"Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia participated in it for the first time."
"Sixty cultural operators from these countries were chosen to be organisers or joint organisers in 2001. This represents 12% of the total."
"Clearly therefore, enlargement really is happening at cultural level."
"These are not fine words. It is what is actually happening in the field."
"Slovenia was added to the list this year, bringing the number of participating countries to 28."
"I should emphasise that the countries joining us do not represent a problem. On the contrary, they enrich us a great deal."
"I always ask cultural operators from the existing Member States to extend the hand of friendship and cooperation to potential partners in accession countries, so they can experience for themselves what the Europe of cultural cooperation is all about."
"I should also like to point out the efforts made by the Commission to improve the management of the programme. These efforts have borne fruit, because the selection process is now swifter."
"The call for proposals for the year 2002 was published on 15 August 2001. It will therefore be possible to publish final selection results in early spring."
"The reason why this was not the case from the outset was merely that a significant delay was experienced in launching the programme. The delay was neither of the Commission' s making, nor of the European Parliament' s."
"The need for firmer guidelines and better focusing on objectives has also been highlighted."
"You are quite right."
"I believe that things have been firmed up and criteria set and published for the next three years, from 2002 to the end of the programme."
"We were indeed forced to adjust our approach in formulating calls for proposals, whilst remaining in line with the decisions in the framework programme. This was because of the management problems I referred to and because of the increased number of new participants in the programme."
"Initial results of this new approach show that priority issues, whilst they retain their priority, only represent 48% of all projects under Action I, and 58% of the total for Action II."
"Prioritising did not therefore exclude other types of Community finance, and the scope for cooperation was not curtailed. In fact the opposite proved the case."
"We witnessed the emergence of new operators and new beneficiaries. This is essential to develop and energise a European area of cultural cooperation, and to breathe life into it."
"I believe we are all agreed that in principle at least there should be no acquired rights, so the same recipients continue receiving subsidies. We would like a changeover."
"If that is indeed our wish and we act accordingly, we must accept the consequences."
"We observed that several of your concerns mirror those voiced by the operators on the occasion of their Forum on 21 and 22 November 2001."
"The operators expressed reservations concerning retaining priorities by artistic domain."
"We therefore propose to work together on new approaches for the future."
"The Chairman of the Committee on Culture and the rapporteur also called for better communication regarding the programme and the projects supported."
"I am pleased to inform you that the new culture portal will be launched in a few weeks' time, at the next informal meeting of Culture Ministers. We fully intend to develop different methods of communication regarding the programme."
"A newsletter will be launched and you should start receiving it shortly. I should also like to inform the Chairman of the Committee on Culture that I intend to wait on the committee to present the new portal myself."
"I shall also personally present it to the Ministers for Culture in the near future. All selection results will, of course, be made available on the Internet too."
"As regards suggestions for the future, I should first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, for encouraging us to look to the future. If things are not to everyone' s satisfaction at present, we should not focus on criticising the past."
"In my view, there is scope for considerable debate for example on how best to focus on objectives, and on the need to ensure genuine European added value. There is also the issue of how culture has a bearing on all other Community policies, including those policies whose implementation is solely within the competence of the Member States."
"Madam President, I should like to emphasise something I hope is very clear, namely that the cultural dimension is not isolated and is not enshrined solely in the Culture 2000 programme."
"We are not concerned with supporting culture in isolation, rather with developing a mentality which will permeate all the European Union' s actions, regardless of their classification: financial, cultural, or economic."
"We are engaged in creating a genuine common cultural area, as Mr Graça Moura states in the preamble. We hope to imbue all the actions supported with a sense of Europe as well as a sense of culture."
"Supporting culture does not mean merely supporting a few players in that area. What it means is supporting the legacy inherited by Europeans, educating, becoming involved with the people, and that is the basis of our programmes."
"If we do manage to build a Europe where the citizens understand that they certainly have a strong culture but that their neighbours do as well, then we will indeed have succeeded."
"I would like to say, in conclusion, regarding relations with third countries, that President Prodi has made it quite clear that we need to open up Europe. We have opened our continent up to neighbouring countries and are in the process of opening it up to the candidate states."
"Nonetheless, it is also necessary to build bridges to other continents."
"The work has begun by means of specific programmes notably those aimed at North Africa."
"I have in mind the Euro-Mediterranean project. That involves a considerable commitment in the areas of education, youth and culture."
"All this is crucial if we are to establish the dialogue and mutual respect so essential to the smooth functioning of a well-balanced society."
"Thank you, Commissioner Reding."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Youth Programme"
"The next item is a report (A5-0019/2002) by Mrs Gröner on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport on the implementation of the Youth programme [2000/2316(INI)]."
". (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the unique thing about the Youth Programme is that it really is open to all young people and, at an age when characters are formed, facilitates direct European experiences to do that, and gives their lives the European dimension."
"The European Youth Programme was adopted on 13 April 2000 and runs for seven years up to 2006."
"It is aimed at young people of between 15 and 25 years of age as well as at people involved in the youth work field and is funded with EUR 520 million."
"Thirty countries take part in the programme - the Member States, and also Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and the candidate countries with the exception of Turkey and Malta."
"Its management is highly decentralised, so that 70% is spent via the national agencies."
"In 2000, 10 029 projects, costing something over EUR 80 million, were financed, enabling 103 784 participants to be involved, which corresponds to an implementation rate of 98.5%, which is an excellent quota, bearing in mind the late start to the programme."
"As we had wished, it was possible, in the various actions, to achieve balanced allocation of resources between youth exchange and voluntary service."
"We would, though, like the Commission to give us even clearer and sounder figures for the five action areas when the more detailed report is forthcoming."
"Action 1 - Youth for Europe - covers meetings of groups of young people and youth exchange, and Action 2 - European voluntary service - is aimed at young people who go to another country for between six and twelve months to do voluntary work."
"Action 3 comprises initiatives in the field of youth work, Action 4 supports initiatives that transcend the boundaries of Socrates and Leonardo."
"In 2000, there were no projects in Action 5, which deals with support measures."
"Over and over again, in the first year of the programme, we heard complaints about the length of time it took to process applications."
"As a rule, it took four to five months from the date the application was made for the centrally-managed projects to grant funds."
"Thankfully, the Commission picked up on our criticism in the course of the procedure and arranged for things to be speeded up."
"I hope that we will continue to work well with the Commission in this area in order to guarantee the participants in the projects speedy and unbureaucratic procedures."
"There were also start-up problems in the distribution of the appropriations for the programme to the national agencies."
"I hope that the funds advanced do not give rise to further incidental costs and make matters too difficult for the projects."
"It is extremely difficult to carry out a gender-specific assessment of the programme."
"I would like us to get more precise data from the Commission and for them to take care to work towards gender balance in the participants, in order, above all, that young women, including those from groups of disadvantaged young people, do not lose out."
"One of Parliament's priorities was to involve disadvantaged young people in the programme to a greater extent."
"According to the Commission, 50% of the centrally-managed projects were able to include disadvantaged young people."
"This was more difficult in the decentralised projects."
"There is a need for further work here."
"There is also a need to improve the way national agencies share experience with each other."
"The involvement of the candidate countries was accompanied by some difficulties, with the legal basis being adopted rather late in the day and the granting of visas often being problematic."
"It is my plea, as a matter of urgency, for participants from the candidate countries to receive visas automatically, in an unbureaucratic way and without charge."
"Overall administration costs in the first year were very high, and this was because the Commission had met the costs for two years in advance."
"I think that is acceptable."
"We also welcomed the objective of involving smaller organisations without international experience, so that young people who are not members of organisations can also have better access to the programme."
"We intend to be continually on the ball about this."
"It is because I believe that our successes need to be sold better and with vigour that I suggest that we mount a week-long campaign in order to present the programme to the public."
"Let me say in conclusion that the Member States must not cut back on their own youth exchange programmes."
"They must introduce the European dimension into their national policies to a greater extent."
"We are getting encouraging indications from the process of consultation on the White Paper and I hope that the Youth Programme's new impetus for Europe's young people will give us the core of this new youth policy."
". (DE) Madam President, I was unfortunately prevented from being here this morning and will therefore sum up our position on the Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000 programmes."
"The rationale behind the choice of these programmes can be traced back to the decisive consideration that the programmes in question are surely the Community's most important support programmes in the fields of education, youth, and European culture."
"Being aware of the importance of these specific areas, Parliament has, moreover, let itself be guided by the allocation of substantial funding and the recent extension into 2006."
"Nor should we forget the legislative processes initiated by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"We explicitly welcome the formation of an evaluation group, whose objective must be to closely supervise Parliament's implementation of Community programmes."
"We welcome the initiative taken in forming the evaluation group as well as that to extend this control machinery on the basis of new instruments and appropriate structures."
"We also emphasise that it is heavy demand from within the Member States that has led to the Socrates, Youth, and Culture 2000 programmes being allocated additional resources."
"We had to take note of the fact that the programmes' low level of implementation during 2000 was attributable to lengthy and cumbersome internal procedures."
"Parliament therefore expects the Commission to guarantee more efficient implementation, not least in order to help Europe's credibility in the eyes of its citizens and taxpayers."
"It is with concern that we observe bottlenecks, especially within the centralised management framework."
"Here of all places, attention should be paid to the utilisation of financial assets."
"It is a significant step in the right direction to further decentralise the administration of the programme, yet, thinking in terms of a united Europe, we must not forget that, as regards the determining of the programmes' political orientation, the sole competence of the institutions must be guaranteed."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europeans travel across their continent without border controls, paying with the same money, and carrying passports of the same colour."
"That there is a European identity over and above all national differences has never been a matter of dispute."
"The wonderful thing is, though, that more and more Europeans are experiencing this in their daily lives."
"The European youth and education programmes, of which this Youth programme is one, have played a great part in this success."
"As the rapporteur has just said, it is one of the Community's most important support programmes, being the only one open to all young people without reference to their working or educational situation."
"We have already heard that over 10 000 projects, with over 100 000 participants, were financed in 2000 alone."
"We see this success as considerable, as we are talking here only about the first year of implementation."
"Good news like this should not, of course, have a detrimental effect on the Member States' national youth programmes, which could perhaps take the Youth programme's success as a pretext for cutting back on their own resources."
"I will therefore reiterate that the Youth programme was created in order to support and supplement the Member States' actions, rather than to discharge the Member States from their obligations."
"Quite on the contrary, the countries participating in the programme should make it easier for young people with an interest in the programme to take part in it, by reducing the administrative expenditure and, as the report was right to observe, granting the participants visas, where necessary, automatically and free of charge."
"One of this programme's important objectives is the greater involvement of disadvantaged young people, for whom, according to the Commission, 50% of the centrally-managed projects were intended."
"Short-term voluntary service, which was created especially for disadvantaged young people, has, however, not yet been made use of to a satisfactory extent, and the objective set of 20% of these resources was not attained."
"I see that, though, as appropriate."
"It is appropriate in terms of the programme's resources, rated at just about EUR 80 million, and of the relatively high administrative costs of EUR 12 million, and the Commission should succeed in achieving this objective."
"I take the view that such high administrative costs are defensible if new sources of participants are actually found and disadvantaged young people are brought into the programme to an appreciable degree."
"Madam President, may I congratulate the rapporteur on her report and the Commissioner and the Commission services for creating a real new framework here for contact between the youth of Europe and the rest of the world."
"There are numerous positive points, but I should like to comment on what I think is one of the problems."
"The Youth programme is very mean towards a particularly vulnerable group of young people in Europe. I refer to young immigrants."
"By ignoring their specific needs, by overlooking the additional problems which they face and by failing to dedicate special actions to their social integration, it is in effect slamming the door in their face."
"And yet it is the young immigrants now at the heart of Europe who, with all the other young people, are building the future of Europe."
"We therefore need special support for these vulnerable groups if we are to avoid ghettos and exclusion and ensure they become productive and creative."
"Whereas, I see the risk here of the programme's favouring groups of more privileged young people who are drip-fed on state benefits."
"I should also like the Commissioner to go beyond the Youth programme and, instead of focusing on young people over 18 years old, to spare a thought for the fact that their formative years are during childhood."
"There are tens of millions - the figure is somewhere in the region of 60 million - children under 18 years of age in Europe and we should be looking at how a whole series of their rights are trampled underfoot at that tender age."
"Serious exploitation and myriad dangers jeopardise their formative, cultural and educational years."
"I think we need a dynamic European policy on children, we need someone to speak out on their behalf and effectively defend their material interests."
"Given that the UN is convening a summit in May to discuss reforming the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a summit which the European Parliament has asked to attend, it would be an excellent idea if the Commissioner were to take the initiative on a new, integrated and uniform policy on children and young people at European level."
"Mr President, I welcome Mrs Gröner's report very much."
"Despite a belated start, the YOUTH programme has proved to be an invaluable programme."
"Why is this programme valuable?"
"It is important because one of its main objectives is to include a higher proportion of disadvantaged young people: individuals, groups, or organisations, which otherwise would have no access at all to any kind of European funding."
"There has been some criticism, of course, concerning the high administrative costs, as the programme comprises so many small projects, which are naturally therefore more expensive to administer."
"I have been fortunate to have worked closely with a disadvantaged youth group from Wales, my own nation, who received funding under the programme."
"The young people involved gained so much and to see them speaking here in Brussels, some of whom were previously young offenders, highlighted to me the importance of this programme."
"The inclusion of worthwhile projects with disadvantaged youth groups, I assure you, is worth every penny of the expenditure."
"We must safeguard the programme and protect its main objectives of targeting disadvantaged young people."
"Madam President, it might be opportune to recall that the arts and languages of the various European countries were providing tangible evidence of mankind' s genius long before the Commission came into being."
"Fostering such abundance is indeed one of the Commission' s less controversial duties. The Gröner report is on the right lines."
"However, there are grounds for criticising the programmes we are debating today for two different sets of reasons."
"The first of these is of a technical nature and is also contained in the various reports before us today. It concerns the programmes' lack of transparency and their unwieldy nature."
"The application documents have driven everyone who sent for them to distraction."
"Maybe the documents are, in fact, some new form of art the Commission is nurturing."
"The main effect of streamlining procedures would be to do away with subsidies to intermediary bodies. These bodies aim to help artists and students to benefit from the much vaunted European funds but some of them are actually chaired by Members of the House."
"I have no wish to make any false assumptions."
"Nonetheless, blurring responsibilities in this way is most undesirable."
"The second set of critical comments is of a political nature and concerns the thinly disguised intention of using these programmes as a basis to develop propaganda aimed at turning the younger citizens of our Member States into an a-national sub-species of 'homo-europeus' ."
"Madam President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Gröner on her excellent work, and also the Commission and, in particular, the Commissioner, for the initiative of this White Paper, which I think in itself is a great success."
"However, the time has come for us to make a real effort to ensure it is applied in all Member States, given that to not implement it would mean that we would not be able to profit from all the money we have invested in the preparation of this White Paper, which would be truly regrettable."
"We should not forget that young people are our future, the future of Europe and of a large part of the world, and this project is trying to bring the youth of more than thirty countries closer together."
"Therefore, we cannot allow the success of this programme to be tarnished by the excessively long periods needed to authorise projects or by delays in payments, although on this point I have to say that I was delighted to hear Mrs Gröner say that this problem is being solved during the course of the programme."
"We must make sure that Commission reports are clear and coherent, and, more than anything, that each year there is an annual report that covers all the National Youth Agencies."
"Additionally, administrative costs should not be too high and, lastly, I would like to ask the national governments for assistance in granting visas to those youths from outside the European Union who want to participate in these programmes."
"Madam President, I should first like to express my appreciation of the work done by Lissy Gröner."
"She has always been a standard bearer for the young in the House, pressing for full commitment to a genuine policy for youth."
"Incidentally, in no way can youth policy be likened to propaganda. It is, in fact, the polar opposite."
"The Youth programme encourages people to get to know each other, it promotes additional languages, cultures, and freedom of expression. In so doing, the programme helps to foster fundamental values such as tolerance, diversity and solidarity."
"These are the foundations on which the citizens' Europe must be built."
"Every year we make it possible for hundreds of thousands of young people to work together, to interact with their peers and with other cultures, and to commit themselves to helping those in greatest need to improve their lot in society. This is indeed civilising work, not mere propaganda"
"I would now like to deal with the various issues that the speakers have raised."
"We have endeavoured to improve the management of the programme and to make it easier to participate."
"A number of Members have, in fact, recognised the effort made in recent years and months."
"We have already succeeded in reducing the time it takes to come to a decision."
"I do not claim that things are perfect, but they are far better than they were at the outset. I can assure you that we will persevere to ensure that simplified administrative procedures and shorter decision-making processes become the norm."
"A number of speakers highlighted the significance of opening this programme up to disadvantaged youngsters."
"I was delighted to hear Members refer to specific cases illustrating how disadvantaged youngsters have benefited from the programmes. The programmes helped participants to develop as persons and integrate into society."
"This good work will, of course, continue."
"You will be aware that 50% of the centralised projects are open to these young people."
"We shall do our best to ensure that the remaining projects become more accessible to them in the future."
"In this connection, I should mention that the priorities, namely combating racism and xenophobia, are to be strengthened in 2002."
"These priorities will be taken into account both at country level by those countries involved in the programme and at the level of activities involving third countries, especially in the Mediterranean area."
"It has been shown that youth exchanges and dialogue help to nip problems in the bud so they do not develop further."
"A willingness to be receptive to others and try to understand them is the basis of a harmonious society."
"Then there is the issue of girls."
"We most certainly want the Youth programmes to reach out to girls too."
"I can assure you here and now that we are close to equality and that the programme is open to almost 50% of girls."
"The Euromed Youth programme is still causing concern, due to low female participation."
"At the beginning of the year I met with the Youth Ministers of the Maghreb countries and made it abundantly clear that we hope to see at least 50% female participation there as well."
"The reason is that we are trying to help build a harmonious society in those countries also, and the 'feminine influence' tends to promote peace."
"It is therefore essential to ensure female participation in the Youth programmes to attain the desired results."
"Madam President, you are doubtless aware that the Youth policy was totally transformed following large-scale consultation with hundreds of thousands of young people in all Member States. Young people were given an opportunity to express what they expect of Europe, and they were listened to."
"Their ideas have been incorporated into the White Paper on Youth. This direct exchange of views with young people is set to continue in 2002."
"A series of meetings is planned. An electronic portal is also in place, so young people can access information on Europe."
"In conclusion, I should like to inform the House that the Euromed Youth II programme has just been launched."
"EUR 14 million is allocated to it for the period 2002-2004, which represents a 40% increase in available funds."
"This is very significant, because we need to foster links with countries in the southern Mediterranean and in northern Africa in order to promote better understanding and to ensure that immigrants to Europe from those areas provide solutions rather than creating additional difficulties."
"In the same spirit, the intercultural dialogue is to be extended to include the countries of south-eastern Europe and the Community of Independent States."
"In addition, further programmes have been launched with enlargement in mind. They aim to facilitate more youth exchanges in border regions in the future."
"Thank you, Commissioner Reding."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Vote"
"Mr President, I would like to say that a compromise between the Parliament and the Council is reflected by six compromise amendments, Amendments 7 to 12, which modify the recommendation for second reading as voted on the 24th of January and the Commission can accept the six compromise amendments."
"Chairman, as indicated last night, the question of a rapid implementation of the EU top level domain was part and parcel of the compromise which was reached between the three institutions."
"We heard last night the statement by Commissioner Liikanen, which was part of this package."
"There is still outstanding the statement by the Council, which I think the Presidency has received, so I would be grateful if you could read out to the House the statement from the Council."
"Mr President, this morning, just three hours ago, the ETA terrorist organisation tried to murder Ester Cabezudo, a Socialist councillor from the Portugalete Local Council, and her bodyguard."
"Fortunately, the attempt was unsuccessful and it seems that both individuals are now out of danger."
"Last week, the ETA terrorist organisation tried to murder the 25 year-old former leader of the Socialist Youth Organisation in the Basque Country."
"They did not succeed in this case either, but the young man' s left leg had to be amputated."
"I would ask the Presidency, on behalf of this House, to show its sympathy with regard to these events, its condemnation of them and its solidarity with the victims."
"The terrorists did not achieve their objectives, but the outcome is no less serious than if they had done so."
"I am grateful for being given the floor."
"That is very democratic behaviour."
"In the European Parliament everybody enjoys freedom of expression, whereas in the Spanish Parliament this is not possible."
"Firstly I would like to express my profound solidarity and sympathy for all victims of the current conflict in the Basque country."
"May I ask my Spanish colleagues to assure me that at this very moment people are not being tortured in Spanish police headquarters? ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"That concludes the vote."
"Report MacCormick (A5-0032/2002)"
"Mr President, everyone is aware that parliamentary immunity was not instituted to safeguard the personal interests of elected representatives. It is provided to serve the greater good, namely democratic institutions."
"Its purpose is to ensure the latter' s independence from executive, legislative and media powers."
"Elected assemblies must therefore give careful consideration to all events and proceedings taking place in the run-up to elections."
"I am pleased this was the case regarding the request to lift the parliamentary immunity of certain colleagues, one of whom is standing in the French presidential election."
"- (FR) We voted for the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Charles Pasqua, accused, with Jean-Charles Marchiani, of illegal arms trading, influence peddling and illegal campaign financing."
"The courts are looking into the financing of the list he headed in the elections to the European Parliament and the 'Demain la France' movement, which appear to contain sums of unknown origin exceeding the legal ceiling."
"Amongst his fellow candidates was a 'housewife' residing in Gabon and also an African Elf oil emirate, at the heart of the African casino and gaming networks, who appear to have provided a 'contribution' of FRF 7.5 million."
"It is not the place of Members of Parliament to stand in for the courts, nor to pass judgment on the substance of the case."
"However, it is their responsibility to waive an immunity that would prevent the courts from carrying out their investigation independently and from finding out the truth of the matter, all the more so since this is a matter which deals with the election to the European Parliament."
"Do we want to add, to a Berlusconi mixed up in a multitude of scandals and a Chirac taking advantage of his presidential status to escape the law, a Pasqua who is 'immune' from any suspicion of illegal financing from African business deals?"
"Italian judges are calling for a new 'clean hands' operation; European judges are calling for a European power of investigation and a coordination of their resources to fight against money laundering and financial crimes."
"To refuse them the freedom to conduct an investigation into a Member of Parliament would be to create a Europe of impunity."
"Report MacCormick (A5-0033/2002)"
"- (FR) We voted for the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Jean-Charles Marchiani, accused, along with Charles Pasqua, of serious crimes - the illegal sale of arms to Cameroon, to the Congo, to Angola, illegal campaign financing from the sale of arms and influence peddling."
"Messrs Falcone, Attali, Mitterrand, Sulitzer, and others who have been indicted in the same scandal, have either been held for questioning, are being investigated or on bail."
"The judges cannot use these measures in this case due to the immunity of Marchiani and Pasqua, who are taking advantage of this fact to hold up the investigation."
"It is not the place of Members of Parliament to stand in for the courts, nor to pass judgment on the substance of the case, nor the investigation."
"However, it is their task to waive an immunity that would prevent the courts from carrying out their investigation."
"To refuse them the freedom to do this would reveal the true nature of this so-called 'desire for transparency' , meaning that an MEP is above the laws that apply to all citizens in his country."
"If a majority of so-called 'committed European' MEPs protect these so-called 'separatists' , so often implicated in Franco-African scandals, from the law, it is because, in fact, despite all the speeches they may make, they all share a certain idea of Europe: one where tax havens, arms dealers and oil companies reign supreme, a political world that is poisoned by money, and a contempt for justice and for the sovereignty of the African peoples, the front-line victims of this 'arms for oil' trafficking."
"Recommendation for second reading Flesch (A5-0027/2002)"
"Mr President, this document provides for the establishment of the '.eu' domain for use as the country code in URLs."
"Last night, it was as if I were watching a television programme on a huge television screen displaying these new '.eu' codes together with the customary national country codes '.it' , '.de' , '.be' and '.es' and so on, and it came to me that it would be a good idea to suggest to the rapporteur, Mrs Flesch, next time she documents this proposal, that the codes attached to the current URLs of the countries making up the European Union should be replaced with the '.eu' code, thus avoiding the national and European codes being in use concurrently."
"Just as we have a single currency, we could also have a single URL."
"Report Buitenweg/Costa Neves (A5-0057/2002)"
"- (FR) I would like to make three comments with regard to the financing of the Convention that will prepare for the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference. Firstly, the representatives from the Member States have succeeded in putting together a complicated arrangement, when it could have been much simpler; secondly, this complexity will backfire on them; and thirdly, it will be so much harder to implement because essential expenditure has visibly not been included."
"First and foremost, the interests of simplicity and logic dictate that, to finance the Convention, Member States should have created a fund financed directly from their own contributions and controlled by themselves: the Convention is, in effect, a unique body, set up outside the Treaties as part of an intergovernmental process in preparation for an Intergovernmental Conference."
"Instead of this, they have formulated a complicated procedure, under the terms of which funds are partly financed by the Community institutions, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, pursuant to an 'interinstitutional agreement' that gives the aforementioned the right to examine Convention expenditure."
"For example, Article No 20 of the basic decision states that discharge of the Fund' s expenditure can only be granted by the Member States after the three institutions have given their assent; Article No 6 of the agreement states that these institutions should be regularly informed of the implementation of expenditure;"
"This complicated arrangement gives the institutions a means of influencing the Convention' s expenditure, and therefore the way in which it functions and, lastly, its decisions, There is no doubt at all that this power, if used effectively, will be used against the Member States."
"Finally, there will be plenty of opportunities for conflict, for it already seems that the total budget for the Convention (EUR 10.5 million for the first ten months), has been underestimated."
"In fact, the working conditions of the various parliamentary representatives - the European Parliament, the national parliaments of the Member States and the national parliaments of the candidate countries, are quite unequal, and this three-speed system, in which the European Parliament is disproportionately privileged, will, in all fairness, prove untenable."
"We therefore need to provide additional resources to the other two categories, or at least to the third."
"Report Mayol i Raynal (A5-0461/2001)"
"Mr President, I was very disappointed to have to vote against the report at the end."
"And on behalf of my group I must say we were very disappointed to have to take that negative position because we have supported many of the positive aspects of the report."
"In particular, as we look to move forward and create a new environment for the creation of new jobs and new opportunities for people within the European Union, we believe that going back over old policies which have failed and rejuvenating them under a new name will not work."
"Paragraph 29 was the main reason why we had to vote against this report."
"Paragraph 29 calls for coordination or harmonisation of taxes in the European Union, in particular with regard to the business environment."
"There has been empirical evidence to prove that reducing business taxation, reducing the cost of labour, increases employment opportunities, increases real jobs with real incomes and also can lead to greater social benefits because of increased taxation delivery."
"That is why we believe this is the wrong method to move forward and one that should be ignored."
"Mr President, Mr Mayol i Raynal' s report concerns the labour cost index; it is extremely important that this is standardised throughout Europe."
"This important regulation divides the labour cost index into four categories."
"Article 4 of the regulation stipulates that employers' social contributions and taxes paid by employers should be indicated as a single total."
"No, Mr President! The Pensioners' Party is opposed to this labour cost index."
"Taxes are one thing and pension contributions are another."
"We need to know how much a worker' s pension affects labour costs and how much they are affected by taxes."
"If we do not distinguish between the two we will never resolve the issue of pensions."
"It is a good idea to know how much European workers earn, because it will enable us to measure wage disparities."
"This is the reason why we voted for this regulation."
"However, its very title reveals its true colours: wages themselves are considered to be costs."
"Costs for whom, exactly?"
"For society?"
"For the workers themselves, in terms of health, for example?"
"No, of course not. The costs are those borne by the bosses."
"Or to be more precise and not to beat about the bush, the obstacle to their profits."
"From here, it is only a very small step to state that certain workers cost too much."
"To truly take into account all of the costs borne by companies, we also need to add up the bosses' salaries and the expenditure that is borne by society as a whole: direct or indirect government aid to companies and payments to shareholders."
"For our part, we would like to make use of this information in order to fight for the total harmonisation of wages at the European level."
". (IT) Of course, I welcome the content of Mr Mayol i Raynal' s report, which I voted for, just as, moreover, after the Ecofin Council request in September 2000, I welcome the Commission' s intention to establish, at last, a labour cost index whose validity and usefulness are supported by a legal basis and recognised throughout the Union."
"That said, I wonder what the Commission will do with the future data and what its actual significance will be."
"In particular, I have reservations regarding one part of the Commission' s text, which states that labour costs are a potential source of inflation."
"The rapporteur himself raises this concern too, for if there is any question to be posed in that regard it is whether a mere four categories are sufficient to provide all the elements necessary to achieve the complex figure we want."
"We are all aware of the significance, within a production category, of the labour cost per product unit, linked as it is to the extent to which machines are used and, therefore, of the importance of geographical location."
"Again: we need to be able to ascertain whether any areas that might be penalised by higher labour costs per product unit benefit from State aid or the Structural Funds, and then monitor this data to verify whether it increases over time or remains the same."
"This would make it possible to assess the effects of cohesion policies, in some cases, and the effects merely of choices taken freely by entrepreneurs in response to opportunities, in others."
"Lastly, we need to consider, in addition to trade tariffs and external inflation factors, the effects of the taxation and related policies of each country."
"This is because - and we share the rapporteur' s view - we believe that there is no country in the Union whose wage negotiation mechanisms appear, at first glance, to generate a labour cost whose index causes the cost of living to rise."
"The truth is that wage negotiation mechanisms ceased some years ago to serve the purpose of furthering the distribution of wealth and, in some cases, do not even succeed in fully offsetting the effects of inflation retrospectively."
"To sum up, these are the analyses to be made if, as the Commission advocates, indeed, we want to provide social partners with more refined tools for negotiating wage agreements."
"However, it is some consolation to think that social partners already have the results of the aforementioned analyses available for their practical studies."
"Resolution on Barcelona European Council"
"Mr President, paragraph 15 - which I support - of this document on the Council of Ministers Summit in Barcelona, Spain, calls for the burdens on labour resulting from taxes and social security to be reduced."
"I agree, for I feel that we will not be able to satisfy the need for secure pensions paid regularly and on time if we do not create more jobs and reduce labour costs."
"I would like to take this opportunity to add that the Pensioners' Party and I personally call urgently for the reduction in the cost of labour to go hand-in-hand with proper administration of pension funds and for a higher proportion of contributions, which are currently paid into the Member States' budgets, to be channelled instead into the pension funds freely chosen by workers from among the many funds that I hope will soon be set up in Europe, including a single European pension fund open to everybody."
", in writing. (SV) We voted in favour of paragraph 29 because we believe that tax coordination is necessary for combating harmful tax competition."
"Moreover, we believe it would be an advantage if there were to be tax convergence on company profits."
"However, we are undecided about increased convergence of value-added tax."
"The Lisbon decisions do not constitute a coherent strategy but form two different strategies which have barely been patched together into one and the same decision guidance document."
"The one strategy is about strengthening Europe' s industries of the future by promoting cutting-edge technologies and boosting the power of research-based innovation in European industry."
"The second strategy is about producing full employment, social integration and lifelong education for all."
"It was a laudable attempt to bring about a social compromise, but it has not been implemented in actual policy, and it is now ever clearer that certain governments and political parties in the Member States wish to enter upon a new course."
"The Bullmann report is aimed at retaining a policy of synthesis and compromise."
"The amendments adopted here today mean, however, that Parliament now concurs with those governments which are proposing a clear change of course."
"In spite of the fact that we acknowledge the rapporteur' s efforts to defend important social objectives and that we have supported many of his proposals, we believe that the report as a whole has acquired a clear right-wing bias and indicates a path of development that will create major problems for ordinary people around Europe."
"We are also concerned that, in preparing for the Barcelona Summit, the Commission, the Council and Parliament have done so little to take account of the candidate countries' needs and interests."
"We have therefore voted against the report in its altered form."
". The UK Conservative Delegation vote today reflected our considerable reservations about this report, and not just because of its mentions of the importance of tax co-ordination and the wonders of the single currency."
"One central task facing Member States is the full implementation of the Lisbon Council conclusions in terms of stimulating employment, essentially by boosting the competitiveness of their economies, their companies and their people."
"We strongly believe in social inclusion."
"Despite acceptance of some of our amendments, in our view this report implies that social inclusion generates full employment."
"We believe it is the other way round."
"During the Portuguese Presidency, in March 2000, ministers decided on a vast operation to liberalise and privatise public services, to the detriment of employment, social cohesion, regional planning and the quality of services provided to users."
"Today, the Bullmann report once again proposes to accelerate this process with the Barcelona Council in mind."
"At a time when the British railway network is on the brink of collapse and Enron has gone bankrupt, pursuing this approach does not correspond to a rational argument but rather to purely ideological motives; in other words the quest for short-term profits for a minority of shareholders and parasites."
"The Barcelona European Council, under pressure from Blair and Berlusconi, will be one further stage in this move towards greater flexibility in the labour market and the liberalisation of the public services, notably in the energy and gas sectors."
"We would like to respond to an offensive against the market by meeting our citizens' needs."
"And there can be no middle way here."
"This is why we voted against the Bullmann report."
"We voted against certain points in Mr Bullmann' s report on the European Council' s Spring Summit 2002, the Lisbon process and the direction to be followed in future."
"We are basically well-disposed towards the European Union."
"Through European integration, cross-border problems can be solved more effectively than they would be if they were only to be tackled within each Member State."
"Such problems may relate, for example, to the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management."
"As Liberals, we also believe, however, in the subsidiarity principle."
"Every political decision should be made as close to those affected by the decision as is possible and appropriate."
"Those issues which are not clearly of a cross-border nature, or those cases in which there are clear differences between different countries or regions should therefore be dealt with at local, regional or national level."
"The EU should concern itself with those issues it is best qualified to deal with."
"Social and employment policies are areas we believe are best addressed within each country, region or municipality."
"The EU should only have limited competence within these areas."
"Each Member State should have full responsibility for its social security systems and the right to make its own decisions about them."
"To quote examples, neither child care nor employment policy is harmonised at EU level."
"These issues are not of a directly cross-border nature."
"Moreover, there are major differences between national and local opinions on what may be considered the best policy."
"Nor are all these issues best dealt with through political decisions."
"For example, high growth and sound competition are more important for employment than political measures."
"That would not, however, prevent the EU' s Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere."
"Closely linked to social and employment policy is, of course, the tax burden."
"We are therefore also voting against European coordination in the area of tax."
"Taxes should be decided upon as close to the people as possible."
"Social issues, equality, sustainable development and increased employment are important issues."
"We wholeheartedly support many of the ideas - though far from all of them - presented in Mr Bullmann' s report, but at national or local level."
"- (NL) In March 2000, the Lisbon Summit took a thoughtless decision."
"The justified ambition to achieve social security for everyone was not translated into a fairer distribution of existing work by means of a general cut in working hours, early retirement and an increase in public services, but into a desire to achieve yet more economic growth for private businesses instead."
"This growth and the competition with the two other economic superpowers means that existing public services in the field of public transport, energy supply, postal services and telecommunications, again have to be taken over by large international concerns."
"This is a disastrous route because it makes our people dependent on competition, and as soon as Europe loses this competitive battle, it will plunge our continent into a deep economic crisis."
"Moreover, privatisation leads to our democratically elected parliamentarians having less say and to pressure being exerted to save on labour costs."
"This is why the idea of a 'social Europe' , as backed by some advocates of the Lisbon decisions, will not get off the ground; a 'Europe of capital' will emerge instead."
"Unfortunately, the Bullman report continues on this wrong path of confusing 'social' with 'capital' but, according to the Right, this is not yet taking things far enough."
"This is, for me, a reason to vote against."
"- (SV) I have voted against the report because, in paragraph 29, Parliament calls for 'European tax coordination where it is necessary to meet the Treaty objectives' and urges the Commission and the Council to 'foster the process of convergence of VAT ... and of taxes on business income' ."
"The Swedish Christian Democratic Party is against depriving the national parliaments - in Sweden' s case, the riksdag - of the right to make decisions about people' s taxes."
"If, instead, the EU starts making the decisions on tax, then the national parliaments and the Member States will be deprived of one of their most basic areas of competence."
"Instead, policy will be centralised at European level and in Brussels, ever further from the people."
"Demanding accountability will be a less clear and straightforward issue, and elected representatives will be more distant from the citizens who elect them and provide them with their mandates."
"Politics will become more anonymous and inaccessible."
"The EU will then become not only a project of cooperation but also a State - without, however, consisting of a common people, which is the necessary emotional basis and prerequisite for long-term cohesion."
"I have voted against the Bullmann report because it one-sidedly advocates liberalisation and welcomes the Stability and Growth Pact and the result of the Doha Summit."
"Most seriously of all, however, it does not recognise the need for a balance between the environment-related economic and social indicators and the fact that the Council meeting in Gothenburg established a strategy for sustainable development by adding an environmental dimension to the existing Lisbon process."
"Particularly in view of the worryingly few pronouncements made by the Spanish Presidency on the environmental dimension, for example prior to the annual assessment of sustainable economic development and social cohesion, I regret the fact that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has not produced an opinion on the report and that the views expressed by the Committee at the Barcelona Summit have therefore been framed in the form of a separate resolution."
"The head of the EU' s environment agency (EEA), Domingo Jiménez-Beltran, thinks that the Commission's report to the Barcelona Summit contains no environmental survey and that interesting facts and analyses concerning the state of the environment in the EU are not accessible to the decision-makers."
"Report Karas (A5-0031/2002)"
"Mr President, Mr Karas' document - a report on the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and their economic consequences for Europe - is a document we have debated, and put to the vote as well, of course - and I too voted for the motion - but with which I am slightly uncomfortable."
"Why is this matter the subject of so much debate, particularly in this important Chamber where it is usual for a great many people to listen to me, as you can see, including Mr Dell' Utri and Mr Fiori, who, as always, are among those who are listening most carefully to my explanations of vote?"
"I am sure they will agree with me that it would have been better not to have talked about the economic consequences of the terrorist attacks at all."
"It would be better never to talk about the consequences of terrorist acts, for in discussing them we increase their effect and unwittingly further the designs of the perpetrators of the acts."
"The recession in the 2001 economic cycle was not only made worse by the fall in world demand and by the consequences for every sector of the attacks on the USA, but also by a policy of applying the Stability Pact strictly and the obsession with nominal convergence."
"In practice, we have ignored the issues that affect European citizens' living standards and quality of life, such as investment in production, particularly public investment, the maintenance of wage increases that are in line with and boost productivity, the profound inequalities in income distribution, high unemployment and poverty."
"These objectives have suffered as a result of the inflexibility of the monetary policy underpinning the euro and which will, in the long term, lead to greater difficulties or an unwanted increase in flexibility in other areas, specifically in employment contracts and labour in general."
"It should therefore come as no surprise that a report which is supposed to address the ways in which we can support the sectors directly affected by the attacks of 11 September ultimately turns out to be a reaffirmation of the prevailing dogma. It states that, in Barcelona, we need to step up the liberalisations and reforms of the labour market and blindly comply with the objectives outlined in the Stability Pact without taking account of the problems of the stage in the cycle that we have now reached."
"The report does, however, raise two positive issues: it states that companies must not use 11 September as an excuse to make employees redundant and insists that the European Central Bank should reduce its key interest rate."
"Nevertheless, in view of its initial ideas, we can only vote against this report."
"Report Blak (A5-0024/2002)"
"Mr President, like many other Members, I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 1999 financial year, not least because I firmly endorse recital D of this document, which states that the Member States and the Council are responsible for the effective use of resources."
"With this statement, the report is saying that we have no control over how the Community' s funds are spent."
"The European Union spends its budget on improving the living conditions of the European citizens, but who verifies whether this expenditure actually serves any purpose?"
"The Member States! What does this mean?"
"If the Member States are in control of everything, what are we doing here in Brussels adopting directives and regulations and, most importantly, spending money when we have no control over how it is used?"
"An intelligent statement then, recital D!"
"Sustainable development strategy"
"- (ES) We voted for this resolution because, amongst other things, it calls upon the Barcelona Council to take the decisions of the Gothenburg Council on a sustainable development strategy and the annual assessment by the EU on this strategy into consideration, whilst pointing out that the next 'Rio+10' conference in Johannesburg offers a crucial opportunity to fully defend the principles of sustainable development on a worldwide scale."
"It indicates that the environmental pillar of sustainable development should be as important as the social and economic pillars, in addition to referring to various issues which expand on the need to include environmental policy in the EU' s other policies."
"With regard to Amendment No 10, which refers to the concern at the unsustainable nature of several water management programmes, specifically the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, we voted for all its points, although in the end only part of it was approved."
"I have voted in favour of the report."
"It is extremely positive that the fifth part of Amendment No 27, which emphasises that it is research on adult stem cells that is to be given priority within biotechnology, has been adopted."
"In other words, the deeply controversial research on embryo stem cells, about which ethical questions have been raised, is to be given a secondary role, which is something I welcome."
"Embryo stem cell research is prohibited in many Member States."
"All the major Christian churches, especially the Roman Catholic Church in its ethical teaching, reject methods that use fertilised embryos - future persons with all their genetic make-up - for research purposes."
"The project it is planned to carry out in Spain would involve using Community funds to subsidise continued and unsustainable over-consumption of water for intensive agriculture and mass tourism."
"The project is in danger of affecting areas bordering on the delta of the River Ebros, which are very valuable in terms of their bio-diversity in general and bird life in particular."
"The project has also met with very well-founded criticism from a large part of the research community in Spain."
"Against that background, I believe that the Community' s structural funds should instead support alternatives such as sustainable planning for water treatment in towns, the modernisation of irrigation methods, the integrated treatment of ground and surface water etc. I would therefore depart from the position adopted by the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats."

"International Criminal Court"
"- (FR) We are being asked today to give our opinion on the proposal for the establishment of an international criminal court."
"The principle of an international court, independent of any State, which is able to judge both States and the torturers of colonial wars, the putschists of Latin America, those guilty of genocide in Rwanda and the Balkans or even the murderers of the Palestinian people, is just."
"The impunity enjoyed by all of the aforementioned should cease and we support the struggle being led by the democratic and progressive movements on this issue."
"We should be able to judge the crimes of the past and provide the tools to be able to judge those of the future."
"It is important that the peoples of the world take up this issue."
"However, within the current framework, which is hostage to the post-11 September attack on freedom, this court risks becoming, at best, an instrument without power or resources, and, at worst, an institution manipulated by the powerful few, being able to take action against all those who question the established order."
"This worst case scenario is to be feared because the judges will not be at all independent of the States that appoint them."
"This is why we will not be voting for this proposal."
"This is a very complex issue, which needs to be studied with the utmost seriousness."
"An international judicial body which prosecutes crimes against humanity must be totally independent, of which there is no guarantee in the case of the ICC, because it is closely tied to the United Nations Security Council."
"This means that we cannot discount the risk of its being used as a political instrument by the 'winners' against the 'losers' , an instrument of the law of the 'strongest' ."
"Let us remember the unacceptable example of the 'ad hoc' Court established for the former Yugoslavia."
"Furthermore, the planned sanctions must not represent a step backwards in relation to the achievements and progress in civilisational terms that have been made, such as, for example, the abolition of life imprisonment, which has long been the case in Portugal."
"We would also need to consider whether the ICC is the most effective way of ensuring that the crimes provided for in its status do not go unpunished, and whether the ICC complies with the appropriate rules with regard to the principles of criminal law and the prerogatives of national legal systems in dealing with the same crimes."
"We feel that this is not the case."
"Lastly, I feel bound to criticise the proposal, contained in this resolution, for the revision of the Geneva Conventions on the status of prisoners of war, at a time when we are seeing the USA thoroughly violate these conventions."
"Hence my vote against the report."
". As a party we have said in the National Parliament that we are in favour of a court in principle, but the problems lie in the details."
"This is essentially the American position as well."
"Their principal problem (and it affects us as well since we contribute more UN peacemakers than any other country) is that the provisions regarding what is known as ""command responsibility"" are so loosely drawn that the crimes of individual soldiers or groups of soldiers could result in military and political leaders up the chain being indicted for actions which they did not plan, participate in or even have foreknowledge of."
"The Americans have constantly referred to the risk of malicious prosecution and we support their concerns."
"That is one reason why Conservatives voted against it in April of last year, and that remains our position."
"It is, therefore, not a question of being 'Little Englanders' but of countries with real international responsibilities being careful of what they sign."
"Clinton signed at the last moment but made a (public) declaration recommending that his successor should not present the treaty to the Senate for ratification."
"Bush has said he will not do that and there is virtually zero support for it in the Senate anyway."
"There is also the problem of Paragraph a) in the composite resolution which suggests that terrorists who commit war crimes and crimes against humanity can be tried under the Court's provisions."
"This is vigorously disputed by many legal experts (including the House of Commons Library) and governments, some of whom made sure at Rome that terrorist acts were not specifically included in the Statute."
"I would refer you to the ratification declaration by the French government which states that ""The Government of the French Republic considers that the term '""armed conflict"" in Article 8 paragraphs 2 (b) and (c), in and of itself and in its context refers to a situation of a kind which does not include the commission of ordinary crimes, including acts of terrorism, whether collective or isolated."""
"The British government made a similar declaration in June 1999 hoping that a way could be found to get agreement on the inclusion of terrorist acts in the future."
"After September 11, it is obviously more difficult to say that everyone except terrorists should be covered by its provisions."
"To say that they can be covered is one way of trying to square the circle, but it is a contested interpretation to say the least."
"There is also the problem raised by Tories like Douglas Hurd in the Lords regarding the problems it might pose for the settlement of international disputes, although that concern is mitigated to some extent by the residual power of the UN Security Council to prevent a prosecution in the interests of international peace and security."
"Democratic rights in Turkey"
"Despite its considerable shortcomings, we voted for the joint resolution simply to make it clear that we support whatever can be done to fight for democracy in Turkey, for the recognition of the rights of the Kurdish people, specifically their language, and to prevent further attacks on political parties and defenceless communities."
"The resolution should go further, however, as the statement by our group does, a statement with which I fully agree."
"The reason why I have not carried over my support to the joint resolution is its enormous limitations."
"In fact, it does not even mention the need for a general amnesty for all political prisoners, although it calls for the release of students, and removes the option of sending a delegation to Turkey on 1 March 2002 with the aim of obtaining objective information on the trial of the HADEP."
"Nor does it insist on the need for the release of Leyla Zana and the former Members of Parliament of Kurdish origin who were sentenced to 15 years in prison, despite the request from the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, himself, for a new trial for these prisoners and despite the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights to this effect."
". (EL) The bid to ban the HADEP party in Turkey and the court case against it, starting in Ankara tomorrow, are just one example of how fundamental democratic rights are being violated in Turkey, where any political activity has to be sanctioned by the military regime."
"Obviously, one of the reasons it is being prosecuted and will probably be outlawed is because there is every likelihood of its winning a large number of seats in parliament at the next elections."
"It is, in principle, a good thing that the European Parliament intends to call on the Turkish government to stop persecuting this party."
"But we should not forget that it is not the only political party being persecuted."
"Other parties have been banned or are in the process of being banned."
"According to Article 96 of the law on political parties in Turkey, any party with the word 'Communist' in its name is banned."
"That is why the newly-founded Communist Party of Greece was warned by the Turkish judicial authorities that it would be banned unless it changed its name, with party members subsequently being arrested during the course of their political activities and attacks on their offices."
"There are still thousands of political prisoners being held in wretched conditions, mainly in F-type solitary confinement cells. It was because of this that political prisoners went on hunger strike and many of them and many of the relatives and partners supporting them have since died."
"And the hunger strike to the death which started on 20 October 2000 still continues, with dozens already dead."
"We demand that the European Parliament join with the Turkish democrats in calling for political parties to be allowed to go about their business, for freedom of expression to be introduced and, more generally, for democratic rights and freedoms to be respected and that it call for political prisoners to be released and for the so-called F-type cells to be abolished or for the proposal made by Turkish law societies and other social bodies for three cells to be joined together, now referred to as the 'three doors, three locks' proposal, to be accepted"
"Obviously a lot of people, including in this Chamber, deliberately talk of progress in Turkey, knowing that, to all intents and purposes, there is no progress or that, in certain sectors, things have got worse."
"They want no change to the status quo, so that it is easier for them to exploit Turkey's market, its cheap labour and its geopolitical position."
"Nor do they explain why there are still insurmountable obstacles to the Kurdish culture and language, why more than 10 000 political prisoners are languishing in gaol in what we know to be wretched conditions, why political parties which oppose the policies of the Turkish regime are being banned or are threatened with being banned, why democratic freedom fighters are being arrested and murdered on a daily basis and why the 'democratic' Republic of Turkey is still being run by its army."
"We stand by the people of Turkey in their struggle to establish democracy and progress."
"We denounce the efforts being made to muzzle them and the support being given to the regime by those looking to their own imperialist interests."
"- (NL) In a democratic state, political and ethnic minorities have rights, too."
"This is still not the case in Turkey."
"Everyone has to bow to the dominant language and culture and to the majority view concerning the lack of rights of ethnic minorities in that country."
"Anyone who talks a different language, hoists a different flag or forms a party which achieves particularly good results in a specific part of the country is accused of separatism, and residents of regions where a minority forms the majority have suffered much destruction and repression."
"An ethnic massacre in the past, the one targeted at Armenians in 1915, is still being denied, maybe because the Turkish authorities want to retain the option of doing something similar in the future."
"The Turkish state does recognise other new states in Europe, including Bosnia-Herzegovina, Lithuania or Slovakia, but is extremely anxious about the modest requests for self-government and cultural rights of a very large minority people in its own country."
"For many years, systematic attempts have been made to keep Kurdish parliamentarians outside the Turkish parliament by introducing a 10% election threshold and a ban on political parties."
"It is therefore important for a European Parliament majority to make it clear to Turkey that it will never acquire a place within the European Union as long as ethnic inequality and repression continue to exist."
"Report Gahrton (A5-0028/2002)"
"Mr President, I voted for the motion and welcome this document on the European Union' s relations with the South Caucasus - which, as we know, is made up of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia - which states that the inhabitants of these three states feel European."
"This gives me great pleasure and I hope that, in future, these three states will also join the great family of the European Union, but it pains me to read in item 2 of the explanatory statement that the people of the southern Caucasus states live on one dollar per day."
"Although I am sure that the people of the Caucasus put this dollar a day to good use, I feel that it is too little and, of course, the pensioners and elderly people of the Caucasus, who, I am sure, live on even less than the average of a dollar a day, come to mind."
"I therefore call upon the European Union to do more for the inhabitants of the southern Caucasus who feel European."
"- (DA) Members of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in the European Parliament are abstaining from voting in favour of the report on the situation in the South Caucasus."
"We support Amendment No 2 from Mr Duff and others which urgently calls upon Turkey and Armenia to cooperate in resolving their historic disagreements with a view to improving their cultural, economic and diplomatic links."
"- (SV) I have voted in favour of the report."
"It is with great satisfaction that I note that Amendment No 12 was rejected."
"The result of the vote was 391 against, 96 in favour and 15 abstentions."
"It was aimed at removing the clear and insistent exhortation in paragraph 15, in which the European Parliament 'reiterates in this respect the position in its resolution of 18 June 1987 recognising the genocide upon Armenians in 1915 and calls upon Turkey to create a basis for reconciliation' ."
"From having been a core Armenian area up until 1915, the north-eastern part of Turkey has now been almost emptied of all its Armenian population."
"In the interests of its own future, there is no other way for Turkey to proceed than to acknowledge the genocide and to seek reconciliation with, and provide compensation to, the Armenian population and those in the vicinity of Armenia."
"Only in that way can Turkey as a country and the Turks as a people avoid being haunted by their own history."
"The politicians and people of Turkey have a lot to learn from the way in which Germany and the German people acted following the extermination of the Jews in the Holocaust of the Second World War."
"I would like to believe that the Turks are prepared to embark upon that path."
"It is definitely in Turkey' s own interests to endeavour to become a European state based on human rights with full respect for religious freedom and the rights of minorities."
"Report Lucas (A5-0014/2002)"
"Mr President, I am sure that, like me, you were pleased to see that Mrs Lucas' report seeks to increase the use of the bicycle as a mode of transport, for it is a clean, non-polluting mode of transport which is good for the health of those who use it, even if they are not called Coppi, Bartali, Merckx or Gimondi."
"I have to say that we are assisted in this by many of our town mayors, for they ensure that the buses are always full of people during the rush hour and thus discourage the citizens from using buses and encourage them to travel by bicycle instead, for the cost of public transport is always exorbitant."
"Thus, the citizens and workers prefer bicycles, which cost nothing to ride, to public transport."
"I therefore hope that the mayors of these towns will continue to promote the use of the bicycle in this way."
"- (NL) For years, it was a matter of course only to see the benefits of the continual increase in traffic."
"It was good for individual freedom and good for the economy."
"Attention was devoted only to promoting traffic safety, so as to restrict the number of fatal accidents."
"These accidents were considered to be the only drawback."
"We now know that air pollution and noise also adversely affect many who do not drive very often, that professional drivers suffer from a lack of normal physical activity and that many pedestrians and cyclists become the victims of the increase in motorised traffic."
"The rapporteur is right to draw attention to this issue, and seeks the solution in the form of a 'health assessment' for all transport projects and transport measures."
"I have backed her in this right from the word go."
"I regret the fact that she is not being taken entirely seriously, particularly by representatives of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, and that this group has claimed that the European Union does not really have a role to play in this area."
"It is time we did away with the misconception that only the promotion of economic growth and large-scale projects is important."
"In order to survive in a society that has undergone massive change, mainly due to technical progress, human beings and the environment need more protection."
"Report Pack (A5-0021/2002)"
"Mr President, last night I dreamt of the great Greek philosopher, Socrates, whose name has been given to the Socrates programme admirably outlined by Mrs Pack. I voted for the report."
"However, in this dream, Socrates seemed very angry, very upset and very annoyed, and he said to me: 'What is this programme you have given me?"
"Why have you named this programme after me?"
"I deserve a more important programme."
"And above all,' said Socrates, 'I am not saying I want poison to be administered to others as it was to me, but I want a programme bearing my name to concern itself, not just with young people, but with the elderly too."
"I was prevented from becoming a pensioner by being forced to drink hemlock, the poison I was given in prison."
"I would have loved to be able to grow old and become a pensioner and go sightseeing around Europe!"
"But you are not interested in the elderly."
"Tomorrow morning, tell them what I have said in your explanation of vote.'"
"This is what I have done."
"Report Graça Moura (A5-0018/2002)"
"Mr President, this is an extremely important document outlining the progress of the 'Culture' programme over its first two years of operation - 2000 and 2001. Parliament adopted this report with a view to facilitating all European Union actions seeking to improve the culture of the European citizens."
"I know that culture is an extremely important investment, even though it is not tangible, even though it is not a road or a house."
"I am therefore genuinely pleased to discover that this programme is running very well, despite a few technical hitches, which will be resolved in its next three years of operation."
"I will therefore always persist in calling for more funds to be spent on improving the culture of the European citizens."
"Report Gröner (A5-0019/2002)"
"No, Mr President, I am not, on the other hand, a supporter of the 'Youth' programme."
"I voted for the motion because I would never want it to be said that a representative of the Pensioners' Party, of the elderly, that is, is against young people."
"I am for young people: if we were not young once, we would never have been able to grow old."
"However, I am opposed to one point of this report, or rather, to what I learned on reading page 13 thereof, namely that the young people of the candidate countries have had difficulties in obtaining visas from some of the Member States of the European Union."
"Oh no - that is not acceptable."
"It is imperative that we do something and I am sure that Commissioner Reding, who is listening to me even though she is not here - I am sure she is in her office watching the monitor and will hear why I voted for the motion - will investigate the matter and ensure that, in future, no young person from the candidate countries who applies to enter our European Union will be refused a visa for this purpose or have its issue delayed."
"That concludes voting time."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.11)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 28 February 2002."
"We now move to the order of business."
"The final draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 7 March under Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"Wednesday:"
"I have received a request from the Socialist Group to bring forward to Tuesday the report by Mr Trentin (A5-0062/2002) on the broad economic policy guidelines currently scheduled for Wednesday."
"Mr President, this proposal is based on your wise counsel, on your proposal that Parliament should organise debates that are comprehensible."
"And the logical thing would be, if we are holding a debate on budgetary guidelines, to also debate the broad guidelines for economic policy."
"However, in the current situation, it seems that the debate on the Trentin report has been squeezed in and I believe it would make much more sense to hold it on Tuesday."
"This is the only reason, Mr President."
"Mr President, I really did not understand that."
"I really do crave your indulgence."
"The outcome, according to the translation, was that the subject is going to be debated on Wednesday, but, if I understand rightly, it is meant to be debated on Tuesday."
"Could we perhaps clarify this again?"
"It was not, in any case, entirely clear in the German translation."
"The request is to move it from Wednesday to Tuesday."
"Mr President, the reason for this request is not a political reason, to do with any one group."
"The President, as Mr Poettering well knows, since he was with me in the seminar that he invited us to, insists that we should hold comprehensible debates."
"Well, if we are going to hold a debate on the Union's budget, the obvious thing is also to debate the broad guidelines for economic policy."
"That is the only reason."
"There is nothing else behind this proposal."
"I hope Mr Poettering does not have a cold, since he is well wrapped up at the moment."
"I hope he is feeling alright."
"Mr President, for the sake of clarifying the proceedings, let me say that our group is very committed on the issue of Chechnya, and if, today, we support the motion to remove the topic from the agenda for this week's part-session, that does not mean that we are not going to continue to be committed on the issue."
"We want first to await the visit of a parliamentary delegation to Moscow and then return to this topic in an in-depth debate in May at the latest."
"I would like to make that explicit today."
"We remain committed on this issue and our attention is entirely focused on Chechnya."
"If, then, we are in favour of removing this topic from the agenda for this sitting, that does not mean that our commitment to the issue is any the less."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank you for calling me two weeks ago, on the third day of my hunger strike for Chechnya."
"This is now the 18th day of my hunger strike."
"I think that the reasons that Mr Poettering has just given do not hold water."
"I think that Parliament is being held hostage to a few Stalinists, who always take a strong line with those who are weak and are weak in the face of those who are strong."
"We would like to withdraw the resolution on Chechnya from the agenda because the delegation to Russia is due to visit Moscow in April to meet the Russian members of the delegation."
"I think that the delegation must go there armed with an extremely clear and strong position on an issue which has been dragging on for two and a half years, during which time 150 000 people have died and 400 000 refugees have been created out of a population of one million."
"I therefore urge my Socialist friends, and I do have some, not just Mr Sakellariou, and my friends in the Group of the European People's Party not to indefinitely prolong a tragedy that is very much a tragedy of the present and the past but not necessarily of the future."
"Mr President, I want to tell Mr Poettering that I am in absolute agreement with the proposal he has made."
"I do think that, if we want to have a proper debate on Chechnya, we must not have it as a matter of urgency with one or two minutes available, but in the context of a statement on this issue by the Council and the Commission, so we could have a serious discussion about it."
"Apart from that, I do not wish to respond to the constant attacks by Mr Dupuis and his crowd, such as, for example, Mr Pannella and the rest of them."
"Mr President, in my opinion, saying that there are other ways to deal with a matter besides holding a topical and urgent debate is a fundamental problem, for every time we say this - and who knows why - the committees responsible do nothing at all."
"I feel that it is very important that this topical and urgent debate, already agreed on previously by the groups, be held in this particular part-session, in which, not least, a number of initiatives on Chechnya are being presented by different groups, and concurrently with which 400-500 people are on a hunger strike for Chechnya."
"Moreover, I do not feel that this decision to hold a topical and urgent debate now means that we will have another opportunity to discuss the matter in a month or so."
"If that were the case, we might perhaps be able to agree to the debate being cancelled now, but, I am sad to say, according to past precedent, that is extremely unlikely, which is why I strongly urge the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to fulfil their undertaking given last week."
"Mr President, on a point of order I would have appreciated being given the floor before you called the vote."
"It is extraordinary that the plenary part-session should allow these appalling ethnic clashes last week in Gujerat to pass unremarked."
"They are one of the worst examples of ethnic violence, certainly in India, for a considerable time."
"They raise very worrying issues about India as a secular state."
"They also raise side issues which could affect Kashmir."
"It is quite extraordinary that Parliament has refused to take the opportunity to mark its views on this issue."
"It is quite extraordinary that we are debating clementines rather than ethnic violence in India, given the huge importance of that subject."
"I should like to inform the House that Mr Balfe is now a member of the group of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats with effect from 6 March 2002."
"I would like to raise a point of order in relation to your announcement that Mr Balfe has joined the EPP Group."
"Rule 17 of our Rules of Procedure provides that 'when a Member changes political groups he shall retain, for the remainder of his two and a half year term of office, any seat he holds in the Bureau or the College of Quaestors'."
"Clearly, on the basis of this Rule, Mr Balfe is entitled to retain his seat in the College of Quaestors, even though it says nothing about changing political groups twice in the space of two months."
"However, Mr President, Mr Balfe stood in the election as an Independent."
"I did not vote for him, but many Members of my Group did in the belief that, while he stood as an Independent, he was still committed to socialist principles."
"In view of his recent and unexpected conversion to the Conservative cause, could I ask Mr Balfe, through you, Mr President, whether it would not be more appropriate for him to do the decent thing - which would be to resign from the College of Quaestors and stand again as a British Conservative?"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, on a point of order, can we assume from that intervention that all the other Members of the British Labour Delegation believe in socialist principles?"
"(Laughter and applause)"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I am always pleased when my fellow graduates from the London School of Economics get up to make clever speeches."
"I would point out that I am here in this group to assist Mr Blair, whose main allies in Europe, according to the Labour Party press, are Mr Aznar and Mr Berlusconi."
"I will be able to help Mr Blair far more from this group than I could from the other group!"
"And anybody who imagines that I have been putting forward socialist principles in the Socialist Group for the last two or three years has clearly not listened closely to the nuances of my position."
"I stood as an Independent and I am still an Independent - as everyone who has had to deal with me realises!"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I would like to respond to Mr Perry's challenge and confirm that all the Labour members in the European Parliament are committed to socialist principles!"
"Mr President, I would like to draw attention to a matter which is of direct relevance to this House, namely the situation of near anarchy that exists around the entrances to the Channel Tunnel at present at the freight depot."
"Since Saturday night, rail freight has been prevented completely from going through the tunnel."
"This is a direct consequence of the activities of illegal migrants coming out of Sangatte."
"The tunnel was closed last Wednesday."
"It has been effectively put on quarter-time since November 2001."
"This is affecting jobs in the UK and elsewhere."
"It is affecting businesses."
"Nobody seems to care about what is happening here."
"The authorities in France are not doing anything; the Commission is not taking action."
"I have asked the Commission to address this situation."
"What about the single market and the free movement of goods between France and the United Kingdom?"
"No-one seems to care."
"This is a matter which requires immediate attention."
"We discussed this during the previous part-session."
"I will contact the Council and the Commission in light of your remarks here today."
". (DE) Mr President, I had announced my intention of attending the session on 20 March, in order to make a formal protest against this session, which had been arranged at short notice."
"When such a session was arranged in December following the Laeken Summit, we were told this was not a precedent but an exception because of Laeken's importance."
"Now I see that evidently such an additional plenary session is to be interpolated after every meeting of the Council."
"That, at any rate, is the impression I get, and I wish to protest against it, as I see in it a systematic dislocation of the rhythm of the sessions decided on by the plenary, with the Thursday afternoon programmes being eroded at the same time."
"First the debate after the matters of urgency was abolished, and then the vote after the matters of urgency as well. I see this as a systematic dislocation of the rhythm of the sessions and I ask that it be changed, or that it be clarified for the remainder of the year whether we now want to hold such a session after every summit, as then the remaining mini-plenaries in Brussels could be done away with and everything sorted out by being deferred to the week after the summit in question."
"Mr Posselt, we can view the availability of Prime Minister Aznar after Barcelona as a problem or we can view it as a political opportunity."
"It is my belief that the Conference of Presidents clearly indicated a will to seize the political opportunity, to have a politicians' debate at the earliest available moment after Barcelona."
"Therefore we agreed that we would hold a special session on 20 March."
"I think that is sensible and I commend it to the House."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"Today's Spanish press widely reports the adoption last week of a memorial in the House of Representatives and Senate of the State of Idaho, in the United States."
"They unanimously approved a joint memorial which calls for peace in the Basque country."
"The Idaho legislature - and I quote: - ""stands with the Basques in opposing all violence in the Basque Country and calling for the immediate convocation of a process [between the governments of Spain and France] to bring about lasting peace (...) this memorial expresses Idaho's support of the right of the Basques to self-determination."""
"Mr President, I am sorry to draw your attention back to more prosaic matters, but politics can also be affected by matters of organisation."
"I would point out that, for the first time, the September Parliamentary part-session is going to coincide with the Council of Europe meeting and, as a result, many of the Members have already been refused hotel accommodation."
"I would ask you, Mr President, to discuss the organisation of this part-session with your colleagues or else many Members will not be able to stay long enough in Strasbourg to follow the work and attend the sittings."
"Thank you for that early and timely reminder of what a crowded space Strasbourg will be for the September part-session."
"We are assured by the city authorities that they will assist us in every way to minimise the inconvenience."
"But I suggest you follow the example of Mrs Napoletano and book early."
"Mr President, at the weekend I was disastrously misquoted in a German newspaper."
"Had I really said the things that were printed, I would have made myself liable to prosecution."
"Checks have been made, and have established that the newspaper certainly did not act out of malice."
"The error is due to a circuitous chain of communication, which itself results from Parliament being walled off to an exaggerated degree."
"Mr Kuckelkorn wrote to you as long ago as 17 January to point out the problems brought in its train by Parliament's alleged need for security, which has been taken to the point of absurdity after 11 September, and he counselled common sense."
"With others of my fellow MEPs, I associated myself with this letter by signing it."
"To date we have received no reply."
"It may be that translating it is taking time."
"So, today, with the help of immediate interpreting, I ask you directly: When will we stop caging MEPs for their protection from their immediate surroundings and from the public?"
"I understand that the matter is currently before the College of Quaestors."
"I will look into it myself and either try to have an interim reply for you or the final substantive reply, as soon as that is possible."
"Just to confirm, President, that it is on the agenda this week and we will no doubt communicate directly with Mrs Gebhardt."
"Mr President, in this connection, I should like to point out that the College of Quaestors decides on these matters, and that these matters also have political implications."
"I find it disquieting, however, that the College of Quaestors is now largely made up of PPE-DE members."
"Mr President, the College of Quaestors seeks to be neutral in terms of expressing political opinions and I can assure you that it will continue to be so."
"Mr President, the slaughter unleashed by the Sharon government on the Palestinian people leaves no room whatsoever for optimism as to the outcome of this conflict."
"The purpose of Israel's escalating its attacks appears to be to overturn all previous agreements between Israel and Palestine and wipe out the Palestinian authority and its leader."
"Last week was the bloodiest since the second intifada began."
"The dead number over one hundred Palestinians and thirty-five Israelis."
"The climax to the bloodshed came during the last twenty-four hours;"
"Israel did not let up in its merciless attack from the air, sea and land, flattening the headquarters of Yasser Arafat."
"Palestine is on fire from one end to the other, blood is flowing and there is no end to the mourning."
"We call for international protection for the Palestinian people, for the genocide to stop at once and for the UN resolutions and the agreements on creating an independent Palestinian state to be respected."
"Mr President, I would like to point out that, just when we are going to debate and vote on the 'Women and fundamentalism' report by Mrs Izquierdo Rojo - and if we do nothing to prevent it - a thirty-year-old Nigerian woman, accused of adultery, will be put to death by stoning."
"On the 18th of this month - and I repeat, if we do nothing to prevent it - we will once again see barbaric television pictures of a person buried up to their waist and then stoned to death."
"This is an unjust, discriminatory and savage way of applying the Sharia, the Islamic law."
"I would therefore ask you to address the appropriate representations, pressure and initiatives to the Nigerian government and the President of Nigeria in order to prevent this murder and safeguard the fundamental rights of Nigerian women."
"I have already been in direct correspondence with the President of Nigeria about the most recent case and voiced Parliament's concern."
"I rise as a member of the Mashrek Delegation, to mention to the House that since the last part-session there has been an announcement by His Majesty, the King of Bahrain, that the national parliament, which was suspended in 1975, will at last be reconvened later this year."
"I wonder if you, Mr President, would write to send fraternal greetings and to say that this Parliament looks forward to establishing direct contact with it at an appropriate time."
"Meanwhile, to share with colleagues another piece of news about that, I am sure that everyone would be delighted to hear that, in these very first elections in October, women will be entitled to stand for the first time."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to ask the Commission and the Council - and subsequently, Parliament - to issue an opinion at this part-session on a fact that has only recently been brought to our attention."
"As you are no doubt aware, this weekend the New York Times revealed that the Pentagon has a secret plan to authorise the use of atomic weapons against an 'axis of evil', which has been considerably extended on this occasion to include countries such as China and Russia."
"This constitutes one of the most unprecedented, irresponsible strategic about-turns since Hiroshima and Nagasaki, an almost inconceivable fact, which has, nonetheless, been confirmed by the American authorities."
"That is why we believe the European Union must react very firmly, at the required level, in response to this absolutely unacceptable shift by world's leading military power, the only country, in fact, that has ever dared to use nuclear weapons."
"Mr President, I also read the American newspapers this week, particularly those published at the weekend."
"Ten thousand Cubans have demanded, in accordance with the Cuban constitution, a referendum on democracy in Cuba."
"This is a quite extraordinary piece of news that was not reported in Europe, but has been covered in the American press."
"I urge the President and the European Parliament to seize this opportunity, which demands our attention."
"I wonder how the Cuban government will respond to this, but I urge the President to encourage this initiative to bring an end to a forty-year dictatorship in Cuba by sending a telegram on behalf of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I should like to raise the same point as Mr Wurtz, that is, the new American programme to develop nuclear weapons, and to point out that this is not merely the next stage in the nuclear weapons competition, with incalculable consequences for mankind."
"The intention is to change the traditional perception of nuclear weapons, with the very real possibility of their being used in a first strike."
"Similarly, countries which have no nuclear weapons of their own are being threatened with nuclear attack and the Pentagon report even suggests that conventional weapon systems should be given a nuclear capability."
"Those who call themselves the guardians of civilisation are proving once again to be barbarians and the most dangerous terrorists of all."
"If the nations of the world do not stop them in time, our planet may well cease to exist."
"To those colleagues who have raised questions about US policy, I remind you that our debate on Wednesday morning with the Spanish Foreign Minister and President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Piqué I Camps, will deal with transatlantic relations and will, I am sure, raise our priority concerns in foreign policy."
"The next item is the Commission statement on world governance, following the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre and the World Economic Forum in New York."
"Mr President, one in five world citizens is denied access to clean drinking water, basic education and basic health care."
"The neo-liberal model has not provided any answers in these areas, nor has it made the world a safer, or more sustainable, place."
"We are now looking for an alternative, not as a blueprint, but as a line of thought and action, in order to give shape to our ideals of social justice and security for everyone."
"Porto Alegre and the World Forum in New York were both venues where at least the sense of urgency and the necessity to act in a more socially responsible way were on the agenda."
"Porto Alegre appears to be more original, more up-to-the-minute and more creative, and also involves civil society."
"It could serve as a good model for Prime Minister Aznar to promote social dialogue within Europe, which is what Belgium did."
"We, as Socialists, are convinced that globalisation offers enormous scope for poor countries and excluded groups to gain access and to combat social exclusion."
"Free trade should then, though, be coupled with rules and with supervision - by regional competition authorities - of concentrations of power that have grown far too big."
"Protecting and supporting weaker regions and drastically opening up richer markets to developing countries fit in well within this framework of rules."
"What does not, however, fit in well is protecting the strongest by introducing a network of social supervision of transnational businesses, although such a network would in itself be a good idea."
"Neither is there any room for unilateral action by transnational businesses or superpowers such as the United States or for a unilateral focus on a new arms race at the expense of public provisions including education and health care."
"Failure to honour the pledge to halve poverty by 2015 does not fit into this framework either."
"However, this framework does offer room for fair trade with rules, democratic supervision of the global rules and social and good behaviour of transnational businesses."
"It has room for respect for human values and societies in preference to commercial interests."
"It allows for a modern and open world, and interest in, and respect for, each other's differences on the basis of a common, recognised rule of law."
"This rule of law comprises the right to an opportunity to shape one's own life."
"I should now like to return to the subject of Monterrey and the Spanish Presidency's failure to translate the specific agreements of our Ministers for Development and Cooperation last week into an agreement to take practical steps towards achieving a contribution of 0.7% of GNP."
"It is not acceptable that we should first act as a satellite to the United States, which puts money and its own values first, before closing the poverty gap."
"We want broad-based security, worldwide, and demand that the pledge to ensure that by 2015 all boys and girls can attend school while being healthy and well-fed, be honoured."
"We, as Socialists, demand in the European Parliament that the Spanish Presidency honour this pledge."
"This is our contribution to world peace, and this is how we want to translate the lessons of Porto Alegre and New York in this world into a new role for Europe."
"Six months on from the tragic events of 11 September, now must be the time to reassert the need for effective global governance."
"While I welcome the Commissioner's statement, I regret the fact that the Commission's work has not been more balanced - recognising, for example, that there is a dark side to globalisation, too - and has not been more ambitious."
"Why did the Commission not take up Mr Verhofstadt's suggestion that we should have a G8 not based on wealth and composed of the richest nations, but based on population and composed of the world's major regional bodies, thereby involving the African Union, Mercosur, the South Asian Area of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and so on?"
"Globalism has led to a world of interconnected communities."
"Technology and language learning have transformed our ability to communicate."
"Trade and investment have changed our economic perspectives and vastly increased our wealth."
"Travel has opened up new horizons and new opportunities for human contact."
"And yet all this has not come without a cost, because criminals have organised themselves into global networks; humankind's damage to our natural environment threatens the future viability of life on our planet; and powerlessness and alienation are restricting opportunities for far too many to develop their own abilities and to improve the lot of themselves and their families."
"History, Mr President, suggests that if the world were truly a global village, many more would be shocked by the misery of the poor."
"Of 6 billion human beings, half are living on less than EUR 2 per day and 800 million are going to sleep hungry every night."
"I say, therefore, to our friends on the Right that yes, the market economy, if intelligently regulated, is the most powerful instrument known to mankind to lift people out of poverty."
"That we have not yet learned to use it properly, however, is shown by financial crises, by environmental degradation and by the continued spread of preventable disease."
"Moreover, our failure to reach 0.7% of GDP in development aid is depriving the poor of EUR 100 billion per annum."
"I say to the Left that we need to reform our trade policies because aid and debt relief for developing countries without access to our markets can be nothing more than a palliative."
"To the Greens I would say that access to scientific progress is also important."
"It is the key to better nutrition, to improved health and life expectancy and to rising living standards."
"We must not starve the developing world of the benefits of innovation."
"The challenge to humankind is to establish effective instruments of international government."
"The United Nations, the international financial institutions, NATO, etc. have not succeeded as much as they should."
"Yet, in the European Union we may have a model for wider global governance."
"We need from our current leaders vision and commitment such as that shown by the founders of the Union."
"It involves the self-confidence to engage with the world economic forum, the world social forum and others and the self-confidence to say to our friends in the United States that their legitimate sense of vulnerability after 11 September should not lead them in a unilateralist direction - whether in matters relating to military or economic security, the environment or fighting crime."
"Global problems require global solutions."
"Mr President, the title of the World Economic Forum in Davos/New York was 'Leadership in difficult times', and that of the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre was 'Another world is possible'."
"People said that the former was a forum for a ruling class with no mandate, a sort of shadow cabinet for the globalised economy, and that Porto Alegre was nothing more, indeed, than a colourful, inconclusive jamboree."
"I, however, feel that, this year, some small degree of rapprochement was achieved."
"The world's leaders felt less sure of themselves and included subjects such as debt, poverty and sustainable development in their debates."
"The 51 000 people who took part in the Porto Alegre forum want to do more than just protest and are drawing up proposals in an attempt to influence decisions."
"This rapprochement, this loss of confidence in one-dimensional, pre-established solutions - and I would like to say here to Mr Watson that we Greens are not blinkered but are in favour of innovation - should be a major opportunity for an initiative from the European Parliament and the European Union in general."
"We are the only supranational directly elected legislative house in existence."
"The European Union is the only example of potentially innovative governance."
"Well then, the European Union must address both the 51 000 Porto Alegre protesters and the exclusive Davos club."
"As a Union, we must take an innovative, non-conformist approach to at least three issues."
"The first is the issue of sustainable development."
"The Johannesburg Summit is approaching: we are not satisfied with the initiatives the Commission is pursuing in this regard and we are concerned by the fact that sustainable development will not be discussed at all at Barcelona, or only very indirectly."
"The second is the age-old, pitiful question of development aid."
"It is very sad that we will not be going to Monterrey with a unified European Union position, and we are concerned - and displeased - by the failure to improve on the probable 0.4% of GDP in development aid."
"That is not the way to consolidate global governance."
"The third and final question is democracy."
"We know that there are entire States which are controlled by multinationals and that politics is yielding increasingly to pressure from the business world, and the Bush Administration is a daily testimony to this."
"As Europeans, how can we find another way?"
"I believe it is our duty to do so."
"Mr President, I welcome this debate because I believe that Porto Alegre requires a firm response from the European Union."
"First of all, many people attending the world forum expect the European Union to cut its ties with the ultra-liberal model that provides a structure for the current form of globalisation."
"At the same time, however, Mr Aznar, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, summed up his profession of faith for Europe in three meaningful words, which are - and I quote - 'liberalisation, privatisation and competition'."
"We are still a long way from the requirement of sustainable development, from the requirement of promoting human abilities, in both the north and the south."
"Clearly, a consensus reached by the Fifteen to this effect at the forthcoming Barcelona Summit would constitute the most negative signal that the European Union could give to those I call 'the people of Porto Alegre'."
"We can obviously disregard them and prefer to believe, like the President of Sun Micro Systems at the World Economic Forum in New York, that globalisation is a good thing and that nothing needs to be changed."
"I doubt, however, that he will be proved correct over time."
"Every era has provided such examples of short-sighted policies pursued by the ruling classes, who are too convinced of their beliefs and interests to allow a rebellious division to emerge that challenges its dogmas and status."
"We are all familiar with the episode in history where Louis XVI, King of France, wrote 'nothing to report' in his personal diary on the page dated 14 July 1789."
"I hope that the European Union will demonstrate rather more insight."
"Porto Alegre is also focusing the European Union's attention on its responsibilities, in the face of the heightened and dangerous unilateralism of America under President George W. Bush."
"We cannot, firstly, expect the whole world to express its solidarity when one falls victim to a savage act of violence, and then, secondly, act according to one's own agenda, and disregard every rule, principle and scruple."
"In a globalised world, the more powerful one is, the more responsibilities one has towards others and towards the planet."
"Ignore these responsibilities and globalisation becomes a minefield."
"I believe that the European Union's primary duty is, in fact, to combat this very real danger."
"Yet, when it comes to its relations with the United States, one often has the impression that Europe is scared of its own shadow."
"For instance, on 8 February 2002 in Casares, the Fifteen had only just declared their clear position on the situation in the Middle East, when its major allies in Washington pathetically changed their stance a mere two weeks later."
"We must deal with this in a mature fashion; in other words, act independently and responsibly."
"This is what some of those who are legitimately challenging a predatory and inhuman system still expect of Europe."
"This year, at last, Porto Alegre firmly expressed a third demand which, despite the fact that its primary target is a military superpower, also concerns the European Union and its Member States."
"We cannot allow war to once again become a way to solve the world's problems."
"We do not always know how war begins to become a part of everyday life, but we all know what it can lead to."
"From this point of view, I refer to what I said at the opening of today's sitting on the incredible revelation in the New York Times regarding the existence of a secret plan at the Pentagon to authorise the use of atomic weapons."
"This extremely serious strategic about-turn goes hand-in-hand with the already exaggerated increase of the US military budget, an increase equivalent to the total amount of official development assistance of all the OECD countries."
"Mr President, Europe must respond, not by attempting to imitate the model, but by working openly with its fellow citizens on bringing to life the now emblematic slogan of Porto Alegre: 'another world is possible'."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that Porto Alegre and the initiatives which preceded it have revealed only the tip of an iceberg."
"It is a very complex subject which it would be impossible to analyse here, but I would like to focus on what is, in my opinion, the most interesting aspect."
"I feel that, after the collapse of the socialist model in Eastern Europe, we are witnessing the beginning of another collapse, the collapse of unbridled neo-capitalism - which does not take account of the new factors troubling modern society."
"The initiatives of the Porto Alegre protesters do not, indeed, take the same approach as certain - nonetheless useful - initiatives being pursued by the Commission: rather, they are essentially opposed to a vision of life which does not take account of the fact that these two models - both relics from the nineteenth century - have become obsolete and failed and that our Europe, our world, must now search for a third way which does take certain factors into account."
"Nowadays, technology leads to unemployment, whereas once upon a time it created employment."
"Nowadays, we research ways of making life easier for certain neo-capitalist classes, for example by liberalising energy, but we do not study how to resolve the problems of the southern hemisphere."
"Now, the axis of history has shifted, and after 50 years of war between east and west, we are currently experiencing a world crisis revolving around north-south relations."
"Therefore, if we are to take heed of the message of the Porto Alegre protesters, we must restore the dreams, values and points of reference to Europe, and, above all, we must endow it once again with an awareness of how complex our society is and the ability to find the most modern solution, the most modern way forward for our society between two models which are both limited and inappropriate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, for several hundred million people, the world is still a very unpleasant place to be, full of woe, hunger and unspeakable suffering."
"Without the globalisation of the past 20 years, the exponential increase in the movement of people and capital for commercial purposes, it would have been an even worse place to live."
"One billion two hundred thousand people live below the poverty threshold - which, I would point out, is a mere USD 1 a day - and I feel that this is the matter weighing on the civil and political consciences of all of us here, and it is right that it should."
"Development aid has been mentioned, and that is all well and good."
"A dollar a day is what a cow lives on in Europe: I repeat, every cow in Europe receives one dollar a day."
"Well then, provided that the aid has a greater effect than it has done in the past, I feel that it is right to discuss increasing the contributions of the individual wealthy States to 0.7% of GDP for aid."
"However, in my opinion, there is something else we must do first, and that is to open up our borders to goods from the poorest countries."
"Commissioner, you mentioned the 'Everything but arms' initiative, and rightly so."
"I would remind you and all the Members, however, that, for products such as rice and bananas - to put it plainly - the barriers will not be removed until 2004 and 2009 respectively."
"I would point out that, at Doha, the United States and Europe decreed in the WTO that the barriers should not be removed for two sectors which are fundamental for the developing countries: textiles and agriculture."
"These are precisely the sectors that are in need of liberalisation."
"I understand what Mr Watson is saying: as I see it, we should avoid a one-dimensional solution or solutions, but I do feel, nevertheless, that there is so much to do in terms of liberalising trade to help the poorest countries that it may well be there that we should focus our efforts initially."
"In 2000, Sub-Saharan Africa received EUR 14 billion of aid from those same countries whose customs duties cost those countries, those communities and those people EUR 20 billion of trade opportunities."
"In my opinion, that is the initial action Europe should take, and it must take it even before increasing development aid."
"Commissioner, you mentioned Tobin tax."
"I am glad to say that, as you are quite aware, Tobin tax is impossible to implement and, even if this were not so, we must not forget that trade is stimulated by lowering tariffs, not raising them, and that capital investments in developing countries increase when taxes are removed, not when additional taxes are applied."
"These countries need fresh investment, just as they need legal infrastructures, the legal infrastructures of the rule of law; this was pointed out in an excellent book by Hernando De Soto, a South American economist who explains that the greatest problem of the poor and developing countries is that their assets are dead capital: capital which is prevented by the absence of the rule of law from being used for the welfare of the people, economic growth, development or, where desired, redistribution of wealth."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that Europe must find solutions to these issues, not shift the debate away from them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Fidel Castro said that opposing globalisation is akin to questioning the force of gravity - both are futile."
"Globalisation is certainly the direction that history is moving in."
"In an increasingly interdependent world, we can do nothing but support this development which is the only thing that will eventually enable us to create a fairer world, a world where there is more solidarity, a less dangerous world."
"The problem is that globalisation in its current form can not bring this about."
"It is asymmetric, limited to a few rare sectors, such as transport, communication and finance and in fact only concerns the OECD countries plus a dozen more or less developing countries, whereas the majority of third world countries remain under-developed."
"Two-thirds of world trade is carried out between the countries of the 'triad', which also absorb the majority of direct foreign investments."
"The remainder goes to a few large countries, such as China, India, Brazil and sometimes a few others."
"The majority of the 190 countries of the world are not party to either world trade or international investments."
"The multinationals are, in fact, not interested in the great majority of developing countries and are particularly disinterested in the least developed countries. However, their integration in the world economy requires, by necessity, more investment and the transfer of technology to allow endogenous development."
"Such endogenous development sometimes demands protection for emerging industries or services."
"All the developed countries have experienced periods of protectionism, although protectionism is, in the long run, detrimental to development."
"The opening up of markets of developing countries and their integration into a truly global economy must be carried out in a strictly ordered manner."
"First of all, we need internal consolidation in each country, followed by a gradual opening up to the global market."
"Globalisation, liberalisation and deregulation are not synonymous."
"Liberalisation calls for new rules - and I agree with Mr Watson on this point - it calls for better rules, particularly for international financial fluctuations."
"During the second half of the twentieth century, world manufacturing increased six-fold and global trade increased twenty-fold, showing that international trade is necessary for development."
"Mr President, I see that I am running out of time."
"I would like to end by emphasising the world's main concern, namely that of finding a solution to the problem of third world debt."
"If we do not find a solution for this persistent problem, we will never achieve sustainable development."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the situation highlighted by the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, in a country as extraordinary as Brazil, has contributed to undermining a determinist concept of globalisation - the ultraliberal capitalist concept - in which the will of individuals and of peoples, as expressed by the political, social and democratic institutions, is submitted and subordinated to a supposed rationality which, in practice, tends to widen the gulf between the rich and the poor and between opulence and poverty."
"It is we Europeans who should be concerned about this new reality, and we cannot play down the social demonstrations that express this concern, which, disgracefully, Mr Aznar has just done with regard to the demonstration that is due to take place this week in Barcelona."
"The countries of the Union already form the greatest economic power in the world, but on its path to becoming a universal political body, the Union must not express its economic power by dominating the sectarian and blind ultraliberal market or by simply imitating the military hegemony of the United States, and these are temptations into which some European Prime Ministers are falling."
"What we should be doing instead is defending the values and the social and democratic achievements that form the best part of our history, and we should maintain a presence in the world as a factor for peace and for progress, in an action which, as Commissioner Solbes knows, must be a great deal more ambitious than the action presented today by the Commission."
"We must put forward a concept of global relations that inspires the forthcoming constitution of the European Union."
"Mr President, the second world forum at Porto Alegre revealed the peaceful nature, first and foremost, of this movement, and its political nature."
"I would remind many of the Members that, in the 1970s, the feminist movement used to be described as a social jamboree whereas it was actually highly political in nature."
"One of the striking things about this movement is precisely the involvement of many women and young people."
"Secondly, I feel that there is cause for concern in the fact that, after the initial reactions to 11 September, American politicians seem to be light-years away from that heightened state of general awareness that had appeared to make them more open to the world in respect of a number of issues such as the environment, Kyoto, food safety, trade, arms issues and also the form of action to be taken to fight terrorism, which has proved to be chiefly military."
"I feel that we must convince American society, and American politicians too, that this line will not get them anywhere: that is Europe's mission."
"Apart from anything else, it is surprising that no United States congressman attended the forum. We must persuade them to be more open."
"Thirdly, I feel that Commissioner Solbes is right to say that the 'Everything but arms' initiative is not enough and I believe there is another question to be raised, in addition to that of the opening up of trade."
"We cannot continue to be so racist in our treatment of these countries."
"We must start to take into consideration the fact that agriculture is more than just an export for them too: it is part of their market, their environment and their way of living and provides their food."
"I do not think we will get very far if we do not change our approach."
"Europe has the potential to do a great deal, but those Members may be right who say that it needs to carry out a considerable amount of self-analysis: not only in terms of what it fails to give as regards development aid, but what it fails to give by refusing to change its policies too."
"Commissioner, in the same vein as my fellow Members, I would like to draw some comparisons between New York and Porto Alegre."
"At the same time as a weak and unimaginative summit was being held in New York, attended by financiers and decision-makers, the so-called winners, in short, all kinds of wealthy people, three lively forums were being held, for the second time, in Porto Alegre which was the true alternative to Davos. The three forums were attended by people from towns, from civil society and by parliamentarians, who cast a critical eye over the whole world."
"On the one hand, therefore, everyone in New York was shedding crocodile tears over the attacks of 11 September, not so much because of the unfortunate people who lost their lives but because of the resultant economic downturn. On the other hand, in Brazil, everyone was genuinely turning their attention to the real risks of terrorism and the poverty-stricken situation of poor countries to try to find helpful solutions."
"If I have to mention some of the highlights, ladies and gentlemen, I would choose a debt tribunal, which is lending support throughout the crisis in Argentina, which outlined the extent of the devastating effects caused by the structural adjustment policies and the burden of debt."
"This is a subject to which Europe should give greater attention."
"Europe must assist the countries of the South in making their voice heard at the UN, so that the interests of debt-ravaged countries are finally taken into account, and not simply the interests of the creditor countries."
"We are still waiting for the European Union to unilaterally abolish the debts of the countries of the south."
"This would be a strong signal, which would be meaningful."
"Commissioner, I believe that you could send this signal."
"Most importantly, I attended the parliamentary forum for the second year running and was pleased to see that many Members of the European Parliament had travelled to Porto Alegre to build up this global network of parliamentarians who support social movements."
"The more of us who gather from different political and geographical backgrounds, the better we can convey the message of the people; the more of us who already have the legitimate right to universal suffrage, the easier we can influence governments that are all too often more concerned about taking up a seat at a New York-style Davos Summit than about understanding the legitimate ideas of the world's population."
"Rest assured, then, that we returned inspired by our discussions and by the contacts we made at the social forum."
"We shall therefore continue to press the Commission and the Council on challenging subjects such as the feasibility of the Tobin-style tax, the overwhelming responsibilities of the rich countries in the area of climate change, the right of the Palestinian and the Israeli people to live in freedom and in dignity, the right of everyone to a basic aspect of safety, food safety, which is the right to sufficient food and to have access to drinking water."
"Mr President, I think that, at Porto Alegre, we witnessed the emergence of a global civil society that had already begun to express its views in Seattle and on other occasions."
"It is essentially a civil society that is challenging current forms of globalisation and the forces that dominate it."
"I do not believe, however, that we can describe the majority in this movement as anti-globalisation."
"Quite the opposite. This is a movement that aspires to a different kind of globalisation, which is beginning to create a globalisation of solidarity and which is calling for a globalisation of rights."
"Secondly, this movement is diverse and, as previous speakers have said, we can make ironic comments as to its diversity, as we have done with other social movements."
"Ultimately, however, it is diverse because society throughout the world is diverse and this may be exactly why it is interesting in comparison to Davos, where one has the impression that the approaches taken are somewhat unilateral."
"It is diverse, but it increasingly expresses a convergence of views which are taking shape in the form of a number of common aspirations. These include an environmental aspiration versus the risk of the blind destruction of natural resources, the biosphere, biodiversity; an aspiration for north-south solidarity versus growing inequality in development; a social aspiration when faced with the submission of all economic and social life to a solely market-driven and financial logic, as well as an aspiration for democracy and transparency towards international institutions which play an increasingly important role in global affairs."
"Europe must lend support to this emerging civil society, to this movement, in order to put forward its ideas."
"After the events of 11 September, we were told that nothing would ever be the same again."
"And we thought that the belief would take hold that we should use the same energy and the same force to combat unbalanced development in today's world that we used to combat the terrorist groups."
"Unfortunately, as you have said, many industrialised countries, including some Members of the European Union, will arrive in Monterey empty-handed - full of promises to finally respect their commitments - but without any new instruments."
"That is why I believe that we must look carefully at the new proposals."
"Let us take, for example, the taxation of international financial transactions. Professor Span of Frankfurt University, a former IMF consultant, has presented a study to the German government."
"I think that the committee which examined it should consider the possibilities which, according to this expert, would enable us to organise redistribution from a Tobin-type tax, which would make it possible to begin to finance access, throughout the world, to global state assets, the right to water, the right to clean energy for all, the right to education, the right to a future."
"I think that we should encourage the idea of global cohesion funds, as we do within the Union when we welcome countries lagging behind in their development."
"We do not simply tell them to participate in a larger market."
"We tell them to participate in a common undertaking."
"The vision of competition alone cannot prevail."
"There must also be the vision of 'living together', of solidarity between rich regions and poorer regions, and of access for everyone to a number of fundamental rights."
"This is what the European Union should be promoting, as well as a multi-polar world. We should help Mercosur to be a democratic entity and more independent of the United States, and establish this regulation for citizens in view of the risks of the abolition of civil societies crushed by sheer market forces."
"Mr President, although we held a very interesting debate, it was still somewhat one-sided, to my mind."
"Reference was made repeatedly to both New York and Porto Alegre."
"In my opinion, both forums are one-sided."
"If you only had ears for what was said at New York, then too much attention would go to the Enrons of this world, to the detriment of the poor."
"If, on the other hand, you were to focus on what has been said at Porto Alegre, the economy would soon grind to a halt, for people would then forget to conduct business and that not everything can be solved with Tobin Taxes and magic potions of this kind."
"That is simply impossible."
"The majority in this House has therefore repeatedly rejected the Tobin Taxes."
"This is why we are pleased with the Commission's conclusions on this score."
"So are there no problems at all?"
"There are, but we should not overlook the fact that governance in the countries themselves forms one of the crucial problems."
"At the moment, we have two examples to illustrate this."
"One is Afghanistan, where we noticed that the Taliban did not particularly contribute to the development of that country, or their environment."
"But in Zimbabwe, where elections are currently being held, Mr Mugabe does not contribute to the development of his country either."
"It is, of course, impossible to expect the international community to rectify the errors of the Taliban and Mugabe overnight."
"That is a big problem."
"Unfortunately, the majority of the leaders in this world are still dictators or quasi-dictators, and it saddens me that this is sometimes overlooked."
"If, therefore, local government fails to deliver the goods, if the rule of law in a specific country is not respected, then it is simply impossible to expect economic development."
"This is absolutely out of the question, and anyone who thinks differently believes in fairy tales, in my view."
"In this connection, quite a few fairy tales have been told here, not by everyone, of course, but by quite a few."
"Well, if you accept that, then you can also appreciate the restrictions that are simply inherent in international governance."
"National governance must be in order, including our own national governance and our European governance."
"This is why so much is riding on Barcelona."
"If we achieve good results there, we will enhance our contribution."
"This does not mean that things will automatically improve globally, but it does mean that we can, at any rate, make our contribution."
"It is in this light that we should see this, and miracle remedies such as the Tobin Tax would not be effective, because we would then be automatically funding the Mugabes of this world, which would be totally unacceptable and a waste of taxpayers' money."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers this afternoon for their contributions."
"I will try to make a few comments, which must be general, on the various contributions which have been made today because we cannot go into more detail given the time available."
"Firstly, I think we all agree that the current model we are following is creating a drift towards totally unacceptable unilateral models."
"We must insist on this point."
"Globalisation has rules which absolutely must be respected; otherwise, any globalisation process is obviously doomed to failure, and unilateral movements will have serious problems promoting the advantages of globalisation."
"Secondly, the process of globalisation - I think we all agree - has brought benefits to economic development; the problem is that it also has drawbacks and consequently our work does not consist - or should not consist - of attacking globalisation, but of attacking a certain model of globalisation or the negative aspects of a certain model of globalisation."
"When the Commission analysed these issues - which is the reason why I have jointly presented its three reports - it reached the conclusion that the concept of globalisation must include, as a minimum, the elements which relate to the existence of an international financial system which works efficiently, development aid systems and the elements relating to the environment and sustainable development."
"Having heard your comments, I am going to refer to each of these issues: firstly, development aid."
"We all agree that we should concentrate on the fight against poverty as a fundamental element of development aid and that the problem of development aid is not only a problem of quantity but also of quality."
"In this respect, I am completely in favour of the ideas for improving governance in some of these countries, which is a key element in improving the functioning of that development aid."
"Nevertheless, improving the quality of development aid must not lead us to forget its quantity, and we must acknowledge that it is still insufficient."
"It is true that we may run the risk of the Commission's relatively pragmatic proposal of reaching a minimum of 0.33% for the countries of the Union by 2006 not being accepted."
"In any event, other third countries do not accept this proposal."
"We are forgetting an issue which is fundamental to the whole process of future development: capital investment."
"Direct investments are playing a fundamental role in the whole process of development, and elements such as governance play a key and fundamental role in it, as do - as some of you have said - all the elements relating to better transfers of technology and any other element which allows for more appropriate development in these countries."
"I would like to make a very specific comment on debt: it is true that the European Union has made a fundamental effort in relation to the cancelling of ACP countries' debts."
"At the moment, the Union's contribution has been greater than EUR 1 000 million and therefore the initial objective is heading in the right direction."
"Is this sufficient?"
"Possibly not."
"We probably have to consider more ambitious elements."
"In our report on globalisation we consider what are the possible systems for finding more resources with a view to dealing with the development processes."
"I absolutely agree with those people who have said that the solutions must not be simplistic."
"Unfortunately, we have not found any one single solution which would solve all the problems."
"The Commission believes that, on the aspects relating to globalisation, support for development and the environment, we must move ahead together and at the same time, without forgetting one fundamental approach: the one stemming from the Doha commitments."
"Trade plays a fundamental role, as does the transfer of investments, in development aid, and it must be carried out in a more equitable way in the future."
"For the negotiation stemming from Doha it is not only essential to defend our points of view as the European Union, but the developing countries must also defend theirs."
"Therefore, as well as the 'Everything but arms' initiative, the Commission has proposed technical aid initiatives for these countries, so that they can better defend their interests and ultimately achieve a fairer system."
"All the elements combined will allow us to improve, but in a few years time we will continue to discuss the necessary challenges of globalisation."
"We must implement an approach which leads towards a fairer society, although that is a long-term objective."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0051/2002) by Mr Andreasen, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on a new framework for cooperation on activities concerning the information and communication policy of the European Union."
"Mr President, the European Union faces great challenges over the next few years, challenges which all demand greater involvement on the part of the public."
"With a view to enhancing knowledge and understanding of what the EU really stands for and what it does, the EU must therefore develop a new information and communication strategy for its citizens."
"The objective of such a policy must be to see information and communication from the citizen's point of view and, in this connection, two factors must be taken into consideration. Firstly, people do not, in general, distinguish between the institutions of the EU: the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"Secondly, people want to receive their information from the sources closest to them, including those that are physically closest. Therefore, the key messages in this report are those relating to coordination and decentralisation."
"What is required is coordination between the institutions where information to citizens and communication with citizens is concerned, together with the highest possible degree of decentralisation in all information and communication activities of the European institutions."
"It is very gratifying that the Commission and Parliament have resumed and strengthened their cooperation in the Interinstitutional Group on Information and, when the group meets tomorrow, we can also feel very pleased that the Council is participating for the first time in this important coordination of the work."
"When it comes to decentralisation, it is important that the Member States participate more actively in the work."
"Decentralisation means that the tasks of providing information are delegated to the representations in the Member States, together with the responsibility for these and the necessary financial resources. In this way, the tasks are carried out as close to the people as possible and in the manner required by the people in the particular country, region or local community."
"At present, far too much information about the EU is provided in too general a form with, for example, the same brochure being translated into 11 languages."
"However, people in Lapland and Sicily may not necessarily have the same requirements, in terms either of the content of the information or in the way they receive it."
"Coordination is understood as overall high-level planning, that is to say at the level of the Interinstitutional Group on Information."
"In the report, the European Parliament asks that the Commission draw up an annual report on activities as a whole - including those that take place in the respective Directorates-General, for there is apparently no one who has an overview of what happens there."
"This report concerns the frameworks for information and communication."
"In a few months' time, the Commission will be producing another statement on the content."
"Where the frameworks, or tools, are concerned, we know that more than 60% of people want to receive their information from the television."
"We must therefore consider whether we should create a European Union TV channel dealing with European Union politics."
"The 'C-SPAN' model from the United States, 'BBC Parliament' in Britain and the German parliamentary channel, 'Phoenix', as well as DK4 in Denmark are various models that can be considered at European Union level."
"The Commission and Parliament have combined in setting up a service called 'Europe Direct', through which people can very quickly obtain answers via the Internet or over the telephone about where they should apply in order to obtain the information they require."
"This is a service that has already been very well received by the people of Europe. It is a splendid initiative."
"When we turn to the content of this policy, we must also proceed on the basis of what people want, and what they want is information about those matters close to their everyday lives, such as food safety, employment, the environment, traffic, human genetics and so on."
"We must be very careful about preventing any propaganda from the institutions of the European Union."
"Information must be as reliable, unbiased and pluralist as possible, and those who provide it must be accountable. Where pluralism is concerned, people could, of course, be made aware of points of view other than those of the institutions by means of Internet links from European institution web sites to the web sites of Eurosceptics, NGOs and others."
"It will cost money to turn this report into a reality."
"We would ask the Commission how much."
"On the other hand, the task is enormously important for democracy and, at present, the information budget in the EU is approximately a quarter of a euro per person per year."
"It is a small amount, given the task concerned, especially in comparison with the amounts spent in the Member States on information provided by national and local authorities."
"I have many people to thank for assisting in the preparation of this report: officials of the Commission, Parliament and the Council, many experts and a large number of NGOs but, first and foremost of course, my colleagues in the Interinstitutional Group on Information and in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"Many thanks."
". (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgets has for some years been closely following the Commission's public relations, and I think that it has succeeded, by means of various instruments that budgetary law, thank God, puts at our disposal, in making a distinct improvement in the information policy of the Commission and of all the European institutions."
"This shows us on the Committee on Budgets that we are, on the whole, definitely on the right road as far as the Commission's information policy is concerned."
"At the same time, though, we also have to strike a critical balance."
"Looking at the great need for public information occasioned by the introduction of the euro, being aware also of how much money the European Union made available for this purpose, and, still repeatedly reading surveys that show that many citizens feel themselves to be badly or inadequately informed or not informed at all, questions have to be asked about the effectiveness of our information policies."
"We will have a great common task on our hands in the coming months and years."
"We on the Committee on Budgets will also be very closely monitoring the process of accustoming the public to the fact that this European Union of ours is going to grow, that it will have more members, and that we will have new challenges to face together."
"Hence the request by the Committee on Budgets - and I know that Mr Andreasen and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport will not let us down - that it is together that we should press on with this change in strategy that we began together many years ago, so that the European Union's information policy may do what it claims to do and satisfy the public demand for objective information about current problems and developments in Europe."
"Everything else, I think, can adequately be dealt with via Parliament's groups and individual Members."
"They, too, can safeguard Europe's diversity;"
"I do not believe that to be a task for the Commission."
"Mr President, first of all, I start from the premise that information equals power; and, quite frankly, we need to empower our citizens."
"Let me also congratulate Mr Andreasen on an excellent and innovative report, looking at the problems, but, I believe, bringing fresh and new solutions."
"May I thank him for his support and may I also thank the LIBE Committee for its support for my opinion which it voted upon and adopted unanimously."
"It is a sad reflection for me that I did not gain that same support from my own Group within the Culture Committee, for various reasons which I hope will become obvious at some point in the debate."
"Let me turn to Mr Andreasen's report."
"The implementation of existing policies and future development of the European Union needs to be based on active and informed participation of its citizens."
"I particularly welcome moves to coordinate the information activities of the institutions and as far as possible provide information in a one-stop shop so that it is not necessary for citizens to understand the institutional structure of the Union in order to obtain the information they require."
"Another key aspect of information policy of the EU institutions is access to documents, and as I repeatedly noted in connection with the adoption of Regulation No 1049/2001 on public access to documents of the institutions, documents - and I stress this - cannot be separated from the information contained in them."
"It therefore follows that the information and communication policy of the institutions should be coordinated with the activities for the implementation of the aforementioned Regulation."
"It is therefore sad that we fail to grasp the political opportunity to have the interinstitutional group on information which is responsible for cooperation on information activities working and taking on board the activities in Article 15 of Regulation 1049/2001."
"I hope we will revisit this and take this wonderful opportunity to combine the information policies, transparency and access to documents."
"Mr President, the PPE-DE Group is in full agreement with the rapporteur, Mr Andreasen, on what we regard as an excellent report."
"The communication from the Commission calls for cooperation, and that is the key word: there has to be cooperation in communication."
"We will be proposing a very slight amendment suggesting that the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee should be allowed to sit as observers on the proposed institutional group."
"We all know the present dire state of citizens' knowledge about the organisation and policies of the EU."
"Eurobarometer showed that only 6% of EU citizens thought they knew a lot about the EU."
"83% said that they know a little, or even very little."
"This influences the low and declining turnout in European Parliament elections - down to 49% at the last election."
"That is a problem for democracies all over the world, and not least the United States of America, but it is a real problem for the EU as well."
"When the people of Ireland rejected the Treaty of Nice in the recent referendum, the most telling slogan was: ""If you don't know, vote no""."
"That was precisely what the people did."
"I would be the first to admit that my own country, the United Kingdom, is probably one of the worst examples."
"According to Eurobarometer again, we are bottom of the list in terms of knowledge, but not surprisingly top of the list in having reservations and objections to the EU."
"Mr Andreasen is absolutely right to say that the EU must concentrate on factual information."
"Diverse and balanced information must be free of propaganda; but the people of all countries are crying out for information and explanation of what the EU is doing."
"According to Eurobarometer 66%, that is two out of every three European citizens, want more information."
"That has to be within proper cost constraints but again, as has already been said, at present we are spending just 25 cents per annum - for English ears, that is 15 pence per citizen per year."
"Citizens will also judge us more by what we do than what we say."
"This report calls on the Council of Ministers to be more open in its decision process."
"Its secrecy does a profound disservice to Europe."
"We in Parliament need to ask ourselves whether we are getting value for money."
"We are always delighted to see visitors in this Parliament, but 43% of our budget goes on the Visitors Service."
"Are we really getting value for money?"
"We certainly need to target the media and information formers."
"We need to be more positive about Euronews."
"We should also not neglect radio as a good way of getting information."
"IT is properly addressed in the report."
"All I would say is that the EU has created a stable and prosperous continent."
"Half of Europe is queuing up to join the EU and yet 48% of present citizens wonder whether it is a good thing."
"This report is not before time."
"It must not be allowed to gather dust."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Andreasen, not only on the timeliness and necessity of his report, but for the quality of his work which has impressed us very much."
"This report supplements, strengthens and, in a positive sense, counterbalances the communications which we have received from the Commission since Commissioner Vitorino took up this post."
"I am sure that the Commissioner will agree with me that the Andreasen report comes at a very appropriate time to improve the future communication which the Commission is going to present to us in June."
"At the moment, without wishing to be over-optimistic, I believe that we can say that the information and communication machinery of the European institutions is well-oiled, the defects have been detected and the instruments fine-tuned."
"What we must do is act according to the guidelines indicated in the Commission's documents which have now been so wonderfully complemented by the Andreasen report."
"Commissioner, I did want to mention a worrying aspect on which I agree with the rapporteur: the budgetary forecasts for the coming years show a decreasing trend in this area."
"And, while it is true that the euro campaign has turned out to be very successful and that its entry into circulation is a great boost, there are other great challenges such as institutional reform and enlargement, which will still demand a great effort over the coming years."
"And I therefore believe that both the Commission, which is responsible for preparing the draft budget, and Parliament, as the budgetary authority, should be very attentive to these needs."
"Mr President, information and communication are key elements for the success of European construction and I believe that we must communicate the idea that the Union is a community of values, a legal and political entity which has no historical precedent, which defines a new concept of transnational citizenship, to every corner of the Fifteen countries and all future Member States."
"This is the message we must communicate and, if we manage to deliver it to its destination, we will make Europe a principal player which is respected on the world stage."
"There is no doubt that Mr Andreasen's report is an excellent contribution to this task."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Andreasen on his excellent report, which provides an opportunity to consider the development of our new information policy."
"The report that you have just discussed directly mirrors the work that the Commission is doing to urge all the institutions to draw up a global information policy of the European Union."
"The Commission can see that its work is being supported and it welcomes this."
"I would like, in response to the Andreasen report and to the debate that has just taken place, to present the broad objectives of our strategy, and then to elaborate on some aspects of its implementation."
"In addition to the framework for interinstitutional co-operation set out in the communication of 27 June 2001, the Commission is now considering what should be appropriate objectives for a genuine information and communication policy of the European Union."
"Interinstitutional co-operation is not an end in itself, as the Andreasen report quite rightly stresses, but must essentially enable us to develop a better understanding of the citizen and of the existence and role of the European Union as it stands."
"In order to achieve this, we need to do more than just disseminate factual information."
"It seems to me that our aim must be to develop a genuine communication policy that will enable us to enter into dialogue with the general public in the Member States."
"I also think that a genuine global information and communication policy of the European Union should also attempt to increase citizens' involvement in European debates."
"These questions encourage us to be aware of the European Union's need to have better control of its own image, which involves drawing up its own set of messages."
"This should be able to be adapted to its various information activities, whether they are urgent or specific."
"As the rapporteur points out, these messages must be changed according to the local situation or specific concerns of the people."
"This involves defining targeted local information which is as credible as possible."
"The Commission fully supports the principles mentioned by Mr Andreasen, the first of which is decentralisation."
"This must not only apply to the implementation of the strategy, but also to the adaptation of messages to the requirements of the various sectors of the public, whether this involves adaptation to different national situations in the 15 Member States or adapting messages to the various target groups of the information and communication policy."
"This also, however, requires our institutions to be better coordinated and to have better guidance."
"In this respect, I fully support the rapporteur's idea to strengthen the coordinating and guidance role of the Interinstitutional Group on Information, chaired on behalf of Parliament by Vice-President Vidal-Quadras Roca, whom I would like to acknowledge and thank for the comments he has made on the efforts to co-operate with the Commission."
"My second point concerns interinstitutional cooperation."
"This should eventually develop into a multi-annual action programme, providing better prospects for our work on information and communication."
"The Commission can only welcome your proposal to organise a debate, to be held every year in Parliament and in which the Council takes part, on the information and communication policy. I also welcome the fact that the Council has decided to take part in the meetings of the Interinstitutional Group on Information."
"I hope that other bodies will also participate in the work of the IGI, as observers."
"My third point relates to partnership with civil society."
"As you quite rightly point out, if we wish to strengthen this partnership, we must make more rational use of the networks and relays that we have established with the Member States at national, regional and local level."
"As you can see, it is useful and necessary to think about the strategy itself, but this must go hand in hand with improving the organisation of our resources, and this is why the Commission is currently in the process of assessing the real ability of the tools that we have available."
"It goes without saying that the coherence of our message depends on there being greater synergy between our various resources."
"The rapporteur stresses the need to establish common European Union Houses in the candidate countries as well as in all the Member States."
"As you know, the policy of the Commission is to do exactly this."
"Your idea to develop a 'one-stop-shop' in each country for European citizens is very much in line with the concerns of the Commission."
"In this connection, the Commission is interested in achieving greater coordination, which you have been hoping and praying for, between the institutions and the Member States, which should bring about greater complementarity between their respective activities."
"In the same respect, the Commission is also seeking to create greater synergy between the networks and relays and the external offices and the representations of our institutions, which you refer to as 'European Union Houses'."
"I think that, today, this coordination is already a reality on the ground."
"Furthermore, to respond to your concern regarding the visibility of these 'common Houses', the Commission is considering ways of making information from the European Union more easily recognisable by its recipients."
"In addition to drawing up common themes and messages, should the European Union not seek to develop its own identity using a logo or a unique way of conveying its image through its various channels; a branding of some sort?"
"My final point is that you are right to stress the need to develop a more global and more systematic audio-visual policy as a prime source of information and communication for the European Union."
"First of all, if I may, I would like to stress that the responsibility for this falls to the Member States themselves."
"The Council itself acknowledged this."
"The Commission will also carry out an in-depth assessment of this area in order to bring its partnerships into line with all national, regional and local audio-visual media."
"As far as Europe by Satellite is concerned, the Commission has always seen this as a leading source of interinstitutional information, which it will strive to develop in line with the budget provided."
"With regard to the budget, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we are currently bringing an end to the campaign on the euro, which will free up some financial resources."
"In the future, I believe that we should agree on the priorities for the forthcoming years; the future of Europe will certainly be one of them, and globalisation, as well as the continuation of the campaign on enlargement."
"I hope to be able to count on the support of the European Parliament in establishing the budgetary priorities that are required to fulfil the new tasks of the information and communication policy of the European Union."
"The Commission also takes careful note of your desire to discuss setting up a European public television channel, the specific aim of which is to provide the public with continuous, relevant information on the initiatives and work of the European Union."
"The Commission will do all it can to present you with an initial analysis on the feasibility of this project by the end of the year."
"To sum up, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this venture that we are embarking upon together is of enormous scope, but it is also very exciting."
"The Commission welcomes the political will and the awareness that is driving our institutions today."
"This shared political will will enable us to develop a coherent and global information and communication strategy of the European Union that will benefit our citizens."
"I welcome the excellent spirit of cooperation that prevails as we go about drawing up our new information strategy."
"There will be a further communication on this strategy, due to be adopted by the Commission towards the end of June."
"It is a pleasure for me, following the debate that will be held tomorrow within the interinstitutional group - a debate which will be a brainstorming session on the essential priorities of the substance of the information and communication policy - to return to present our conclusions to you at Parliament's part-session in July."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0070/2002) by Lord Inglewood, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the application of international accounting standards (COM(2001) 0080 - C5-0061/2001 - 2001/0044(COD))."
", rapporteur."
"Mr President, in the aftermath of the Enron scandal, it is tempting simply to say that these proposals for the introduction of international accounting standards into the Community are an idea whose time has come."
"But it is wrong to see it simply in those terms, because there is more to it than that."
"If Europe is to match the United States economically, we need to create a single capital market; otherwise borrowing will also be more expensive here, which in turn inevitably favours the United States."
"One of the over-riding imperatives of Europe's economy must be to compete in the global market, and this change is a necessary precondition to that end."
"In its consideration of these proposals by the Legal Affairs Committee, a very wide-ranging rewording of the text has been carried out which I understand is acceptable to both the Commission and the Council and which also meets the concerns of the committee."
"I therefore hope that if Parliament as a whole agrees, we may be able to deal with this proposal in a single reading, which will in turn convey a significant message around the globe."
"In particular, some important elements have been introduced and a number should be mentioned."
"These include the following: firstly, following President Prodi's statement to Parliament last month about the comitology aspects of the Lamfalussy proposal, the Commission has agreed that the relevant and appropriate principles contained in it will be applied pari passu in this instance."
"I would therefore be extremely grateful if the Commissioner will be able to confirm this to the House now, since it is an important and crucial point to Members."
"Secondly, in the special case of European Community companies filing their accounts in U.S. GAAP on a regulated exchange in a third country, they will be able to defer implementation of the relevant provisions of this Regulation until 2007 as opposed to 2005."
"Thirdly, it has been clarified that the agreed international accounting standards will be published in their legally binding form in the Official Journal in all the official languages."
"Fourthly, this proposal expressly excludes the mandatory application of international accounting standards as far as SMEs are concerned."
"It is of course open to Member States to apply them nationally, but that is a matter for them and not for us."
"In any event, as a result, I understand, of a Community initiative, the International Accounting Standards Council is going to consider the whole question of accounting issues and SMEs, which of course is something which is entirely separate from what we are discussing now."
"It is also important to explain to the House that this Regulation is in any event contained within the parameters of the existing European Community accounting code and that the standards themselves can only be adopted by the International Accounting Standards Committee after a rigorous and transparent process agreed by the IASC in its own properly adopted and legally enforceable constitution."
"It should also be made quite clear that the Commission plays an important role - as do the Member States' standard setters - in the formulation of the standards according to the IASC's due process procedures."
"In addition, a wide range of affected sectors in Europe have a formal relationship with the Commission in this regard through EFRAG, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, which has been established for this purpose."
"As I said in my opening remarks, in the aftermath of the Enron collapse in the United States, this proposal is timely because it is highly unlikely that such a debacle could have occurred under this approach to accounting standards, which is purposive or teleological as opposed to prescriptive."
"But of course, in itself, that is insufficient to avoid fraud and misfeasance."
"Proper enforcement, as is always the case with all legislation, is essential; and elements to achieve that are distinct from but obviously associated with standard setting."
"In a world where accounting standards generally register low on the Richter scale of political newsworthiness, they have a much higher profile now than is normal."
"For Europe to pass this legislation and apply international accounting standards would be a major step towards establishing a worldwide set of accounting rules and, what is more, a set of worldwide rules in the establishment and creation of which Europe will play an important part."
"Mr President, this is the prize."
"It is now, I believe, within our grasp."
"If we in Parliament support this proposal, it will mean that Parliament is seen to be serious about business and commerce, and it will show the world that Europe means business about business. And that is the goal of the financial services action plan."
"Mr President, if, in the plenary sitting, our fellow MEPs follow our vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and adopt this proposal practically unanimously, and if all others stand by their agreements, I believe that we can conclude this proposal at first reading, which is nothing short of a small miracle."
"There were many bottlenecks, most of which, fortunately, we managed to resolve."
"For example, we managed to arrange for the approved standards to be translated into each of the official languages and to be published."
"The proposal was totally unacceptable on this score."
"If we can put this right, this will constitute a huge step forward."
"In addition, as Lord Inglewood has already mentioned, thanks to various other amendments, we also managed to delineate, and better stipulate, the way in which comitology was to be applied."
"Time constraints prevent me from elaborating upon other improvements, but I concur with what the rapporteur of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has said in this connection."
"I would like to confine myself to asking the Commission the following. Small and medium-sized businesses do not yet know whether, and when, their national governments will extend the scope of this Regulation to include them."
"They feel a little neglected."
"However, I am of the view that it is certainly not a pointless exercise, immediately following the Council's approval, to devote attention, in an organised manner, to the implications of the various options which the Member States can take by applying Article 5 and thus making an attempt to achieve coordination."
"In the absence of the harmonisation of taxation legislation, it is certainly useful, in my view, to enter into consultation about the new relationship, which is to be established in various Member States, between yearly accounts law, company law and tax law and to find out whether some of these issues could be coordinated at European level."
"Could the Commission tell me whether it intends, with these issues in mind, to set up an SME consultation, and to start a debate to find out whether European initiatives are necessary?"
"Secondly, I should like to appeal to the Commission to ensure that, if accountancy law is to be changed, this is done in such a way as to take the interests of the SMEs into consideration in an appropriate manner."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to start by thanking both the rapporteurs most warmly for the way that their approach to this topic, one that has thrown up many problems in this House, has been marked by a great willingness to compromise."
"The Commission's original proposal aimed, more or less, at the transfer of all the competences for IAS rules outside this House in the guise of a general authorisation, thus letting decisions be taken by other institutions and private international bodies."
"This was something about which many in this House had great misgivings."
"I am, then, very happy that it has been possible to travel along the track laid down by the von Wogau report in the form of proposals on the Lamfalussy reports, and find here a solution and a genuine compromise which, on the one hand, makes use of the opportunities offered by IASs, whilst on the other, though, the maintenance of Parliament's rights is also guaranteed."
"I can only say that I welcome that inordinately."
"I also wish the Commissioner the best of luck on his forthcoming trip to America and his talks with the Securities and Exchange Commission on how the Americans use IASs."
"It would be a great relief to our enterprises, and also a great step forward, if he were to succeed in getting the Americans, too, to accept IASs."
"Such occurrences as Flow Tech, Holzmann, or, most recently in America, Enron, make one thing clear, one thing that I will give the Commissioner to think about on the journey: I believe that even if we decide on IASs in this form, there is still a very great deal left to be done in the auditing field."
"I do not believe it can be right that there should be a few major international firms that, on the one hand, do highly intensive consultancy work and, on the other, themselves audit what they have advised the enterprise to do."
"I think that what is necessary here - and this is one of the lessons that, for example, the Bush administration in America has learned - is further legislation to ensure that consultants do not audit and that auditors cannot be consultants to the same company."
"My plea to the Commission is that they do some thinking along these lines and approach Parliament with early and definite proposals, so that the financial markets really do improve and become safer."
"Mr President, from the previous interventions of the rapporteur and the draftsperson of the opinion, and the intervention by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the European People's Party, it appears that there is a degree of unanimity which the Socialist Group shares."
"We believe that the Commission's proposal is appropriate and that Mr Inglewood's report goes into detail on certain aspects, in particular the reference to the commitology procedure and the explicit reference to the commitments made by the President of the Commission during last February in relation to the participation of Parliament in the development of the legislation on the financial markets."
"Secondly, as Mr Lehne has said, the adoption of international accounting standards by the Community involves a second part, the negotiation with the competent authorities in the United States - not with the government of the United States, but above all with the Securities and Exchanges Commission - of standards which prevent European companies from having to conform to dual accounting requirements in order to operate in Europe and in North American markets."
"Mr Inglewood has introduced a series of amendments which, in our opinion, are aimed at improving the text of the directive, within the framework of the spirit of cooperation between this Parliament and the Commission."
"As Mr Inglewood has said, our hope is that an agreement can be reached soon between the Commission, the Council and Parliament so that the directive can be adopted very quickly without having to go to conciliation."
"In principle, therefore, the Socialist Group will vote in favour of all the amendments."
"We have certain difficulties in relation to some amendments and we will still have to examine whether they are compatible with our position and, above all, we await the Commission's opinion with regard to certain aspects of them."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the draftsman for the consensus that they have drawn together."
"When this report first appeared it seemed to cover a small technical matter, but this is in fact a small technical matter with the ability to make a huge difference."
"It is of great importance, as has already been said, to the financial services action plan and to the better functioning of the internal market."
"As Lord Inglewood has already said, it is a proposal that, politically speaking, has come at the right moment."
"The collapse of a corporate giant like Enron and the reverberations of such a collapse for employees, for small investors, for pensioners, convince us that, if there is a way of helping prevent such misery for some of our citizens, then we should of course pursue it."
"These international accounting standards seem to hold out such a promise, both within and beyond the European Union."
"I hope that is so."
"I hope also, as other speakers have said, that the system involving a regulatory committee - a technical committee set up within our institutions - will provide the openness and, most importantly, the democratic accountability that this Parliament seeks."
"Our society, our citizens, have a huge stake in the success and health of our large corporations."
"It is clearly our duty to ensure that the standards by which they are governed or regulated attain the best levels of corporate governance."
"This report is an important step in achieving that and I can assure the rapporteur that he will have the full support of the ELDR Group in this House."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor on this subject, which is of the highest importance, even though it may not attract publicly the attention which it deserves."
"I should like to start by thanking Parliament for the interest it has shown in this report, and in particular the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and its rapporteur, Lord Inglewood, and also Mrs Thyssen, for their excellent work."
"Rapid progress has been made and I hope that the present proposal may be adopted in a single reading; several Members have already referred to that possibility; and the Commission hopes that indeed will be the case."
"If we succeed in this it will give a strong political signal that the European Union is not only serious about achieving an integrated capital market by the year 2005, as requested by the European Council in Lisbon two years ago, but also ready to lead on the development of international accounting standards."
"Comparable, transparent financial reporting is an essential building block for the realisation of integrated, competitive and attractive EU capital markets to complement the single currency and so strengthen the European economy."
"That will also show, in particular in our relationship with the United States, how determined we are about the way we want to see things develop in future."
"It should pave the way for the United States to accept international accounting standards for listing purposes."
"I shall certainly be pressing the case when I visit Washington in the second half of May."
"After the collapse of Enron, concern has grown, certainly in the United States but also in Europe, about the quality of financial reporting by listed companies."
"One must of course avoid knock-on effects that might lead to a loss of confidence among investors, shareholders and other stakeholders, including employees, in the functioning of our capital markets."
"Long before Enron started to make headlines in the press, Europe made the choice of international accounting standards of high quality with the potential to become truly global standards."
"High-quality accounting standards are the bedrock of good financial reporting and the principles-based approach of IAS will ensure that accounts reflect economic reality, thus restoring investors' confidence that things are really the way they look."
"The aim of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to minimise detailed rules and exemptions will defeat a culture that boils down to ""where does it say that I cannot?"", one which the many thousands of pages of rules-based standards of the U.S. GAAP have fostered."
"IAS will also provide the relevant and reliable information which investors and other stakeholders need to make meaningful cross-border and cross-sector comparisons throughout the European Union."
"Listed European companies have long been awaiting the signal which this Parliament is now ready to give, and for EU companies it clearly means that things have started in earnest and that they must start preparing a switch-over to international accounting standards without wasting any time."
"This major achievement also demonstrates that our institutions can work closely together when the time comes to deliver, and I greatly welcome this."
"In this respect, and in response to the remarks made by Lord Inglewood and Mrs Thyssen and also, I believe, by Mr Lehne, may I underline that the commitments undertaken by the Commission on 5 February, 2002 in President Romano Prodi's declaration to this Parliament on the implementation of financial services legislation fully apply to the present proposals as well."
"That is the case and will remain so."
"Those commitments apply as well to the present proposal and a clear reference to this is made in Amendment No 4 as adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on 26 February 2002."
"The Commission can accept all the amendments adopted unanimously by the Legal Affairs Committee, notwithstanding the repeal of Amendment No 6, which amounts more or less to the repetition of a recital."
"Before I conclude, may I reply to three specific points made this evening."
"Firstly, on languages, it is indeed important that the IAS endorsed by the European Union are made available in all official languages - at the moment 11, but pretty soon 19 - and then become part of Community law."
"Secondly, with regard to SMEs, a point raised in particular by Mrs Thyssen, the Commission will engage in a debate about the accounting requirements for small and medium enterprises in the context of the modernisation of the accounting directives, for which the Commission will officially present a proposal before the summer."
"Lastly, there is the question of the consequences of the Enron debacle."
"I am planning to engage in a debate about the consequences of that debacle for auditing and we are, at present, discussing with Member States a document on auditor independence which I am sure Mr Lehne will be interested to read."
"As soon it is available we will make it available to Members of this Parliament."
"In conclusion, Mr President, a strong vote in favour of this proposal would constitute a major contribution to international and European harmonisation in the accounting field by promoting a single set of accounting standards, namely the IAS."
"Adopting IAS for Europe would offer increased comparability of financial information to investors and shareholders and would contribute to a return of confidence in the efficiency and effectiveness of our financial markets."
"It is an opportunity for European leadership which I am sure Parliament will want to seize, as do the Commission and Council."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at noon."
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0058/2002) by Mr Ferber, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 97/67/EC with regard to the further opening to competition of Community postal services (14091/1/2001 - C5-0642/2001 - 2000/0139(COD))."
". (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yet again - but not at quite as late an hour as otherwise in Parliament - we are able to debate the further development of postal services in the European Union."
"In recent years - one might almost say decades, when I think back to when the Commission presented the first Green Paper on the further development of postal services - we have in fact managed, step by step, to open up the European Union's markets in postal services."
"The path we took together in the past was a good one for the public as users of postal services, but also for the service providers, who were enabled to develop themselves as competitive enterprises."
"We are here today to debate, and come to a decision about, the Council's Common Position of last October."
"At First Reading, we very intensively grappled with the Commission proposal on the development of postal services, and were able to convince the Council of the rightness of our arguments on many points."
"I would just like to point out that the deletion of the definition of special services, including express services, was Parliament's idea and was taken over by the Council, and that the retention of price and weight limits for outgoing mail in the Council text was something Parliament had demanded, and thus a great success for us."
"I would also like to enter on Parliament's credit side the fact that we were able essentially to get our way on special tariffs, cross-subsidies and the further timetable."
"The greatest controversy in recent weeks and months has, of course, been about the weight and price limits."
"I think that the Council has found a fair compromise between the Commission proposal and the outcome of First Reading in Parliament."
"The Commission had proposed 50 grammes, Parliament 150 grammes, and the Council decided in favour of the mean value, that is, 100 grammes."
"I think that is a fair compromise towards further opening up postal services."
"In committee, we very intensively grappled with the Council Common Position."
"I think, across all group lines, we achieved a good result, which amounts to this: Further liberalisation of the post will not be delayed."
"I hope that my proposal, as adopted in committee, will be confirmed by the plenary on Wednesday, and, as things stand, there is no conciliation procedure, which means the markets have a clear road ahead, as do the national legislatures to transpose the European norms."
"I wish at this juncture to express my gratitude to the Belgian Presidency of the Council, under whose aegis this compromise has been achieved; to the Spanish Presidency of the Council, which has worked very constructively with me in order to reach a solution which obviates the need for a conciliation procedure, and of course, to the Commission and to you, Commissioner Bolkestein."
"I think that the achievement of our very intensive discussions over recent weeks and months has been that the Commission has guided onto a sensible track Parliament's justified concerns and the political possibilities in the Council."
"I think it makes sense for us, as with telecommunications, to be informed on a two-yearly basis how the postal sector as a whole appears to be developing."
"It was a matter of great concern to my fellow Members, and I, as rapporteur, am very glad to take it up, that we should closely follow what happens in this sector, which is of course an important part of all our lives, for everyone is happy if, as is to be hoped, he gets agreeable post and not just bills."
"It is important that the maintenance of postal services should be safeguarded throughout the European Union, in remote and rural areas, rather than just taking the pickings of an interesting market, so that all citizens may have full access in the long term to postal services."
"We must constantly remind ourselves of this, to which we want to commit the Commission, by obliging them to submit to us a report on the subject every other year."
"I also attach great importance to our desire to be involved when the post is developed further."
"The Commission will be carrying out a study in 2006."
"That is going to be stated in the directive, and our concern is that we be involved in the run-up to it, when the issues and topics to be considered and studied are to be worked out."
"For that, too, many thanks to the Commission, for its readiness to go down this road together with Parliament."
"I think we are on the right road, and I hope that, at the end of this decade, the postal services will have achieved their objective of being competitive enterprises providing their services for the benefit of Europe's citizens."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Ferber for a job extremely well done, for his patience and good will and for his willingness to work with all sides of the European Parliament and with the Council and the Commission."
"Thanks to Mr Ferber's hard work, we have what I think is a first class result with what appeared to be an exceptionally tricky issue."
"When the debate started and during the first reading, we all saw huge problems in store, with major differences between the various political persuasions in the House."
"The vote, in committee at least a few days ago, demonstrated that a large majority in the European Parliament agreed with the positions put forward just now by the rapporteur."
"What we were looking to do was to reconcile two needs: first, the need to safeguard the universal service, a universal service in island regions, in mountain regions and in remote regions of the European Union and, secondly, the need for a free, competitive market, the need to guarantee a single market in this sector by widening consumer choice."
"And I think that, in the end, we managed to find a creative way of reconciling these two needs."
"So we have a good result, both for those worried about losing the universal service and for those who wanted to advance the single market and widen consumer choices."
"And of course, in doing so, we have carried out the instructions of earlier European Councils, such as the Lisbon Council, which talked of the need to push ahead and extend the market in the postal services sector."
"I think that the three amendments proposed by our committee improve things still further and are, I believe, acceptable both to the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, for all his work and, indeed, thank the Commissioner for his work."
"Some of you might find that a little surprising, as it is well known that Commissioner Bolkestein and I have not seen eye to eye on this matter all of the time."
"However, what we have from the Council is the result of some good work all round."
"I want to highlight what we as a Parliament asked for in the first reading and what we actually got."
"We asked for controlled and gradual liberalisation."
"Did the Council agree with that?"
"Yes, they did."
"We asked for codecision for the European Parliament for any future steps to full liberalisation."
"Did we get that?"
"Yes, we did."
"We asked for special services to be taken out of the directive."
"Did they agree with that?"
"Yes, they did."
"We also asked for the universal service to be guaranteed."
"Did they give us that?"
"Yes, they did."
"The one thing they did not give us was the starting point of 150 grammes for that controlled and gradual liberalisation."
"As the rapporteur said, they came up with a compromise of 100 and then 50 grammes."
"That is not bad going for a European Parliament to put five demands to the Council, get four of them in full and half of the other."
"Therefore, I would like to make those people who wish to stick to the 150 gramme level aware of what their actions will lead to should they pursue that particular policy."
"If we go for 150 grammes it will lead to a failure of the agreement."
"The Council common position will unravel, and collapse."
"All our gains, including codecision on future moves will be lost and the Commission will then move in under Article 80 - as I am sure they are keen to do - and give us full liberalisation sooner rather than later."
"If ever there was a classic case of cutting off your nose to spite your face, it is that of those people advocating 150 grammes."
"Finally, through this Chamber I wish to make a plea to Postcomm, the British postal regulator."
"You now have an opportunity, through this directive, to end your self-declared war on the British Post Office and the British people."
"We have all been impressed by your macho image, clearly learned from watching too many World Wrestling Federation bouts."
"But Europe has showed you how to maintain a viable post office offering a universal service of excellent quality at an affordable price."
"So for God's sake, Postcomm, get off the battlements and see sense!"
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, partly for the fact that he referred to the Belgian Presidency."
"I am proud that someone from my group, Rik Daems, thanks to his negotiating skills, managed to get this common position on paper at the time, which was certainly not an easy task."
"It is a very even-handed position, in my view."
"Mr Simpson too has already referred to it."
"There may still be other people out there who believe that the postal services should remain a national government monopoly."
"I am not one of them."
"There may be people who believe that public services should not be a topic of discussion."
"I am certainly not one of them either."
"The common position is somewhere in between."
"It takes account of the wishes of the customers, the people who use the postal services, which is what should be our priority, in my view."
"We must ensure that postal companies are able and obliged to carry out this task."
"We have received agreement from fifteen Member States and fifteen postal services."
"This is very important."
"This means that we will be able to modernise services of this kind very rapidly, and that we can ensure that they become first-rate businesses, if they are not so already."
"There are also people who want to go faster or slower than the common position, or those who want more grammes, etc. This is not wise, in my view."
"As Mr Simpson said before: if we now loosen the string, the entire package will unravel and collapse, which would be a bad outcome."
"We must prevent this happening at all costs."
"Our group will therefore adopt the three amendments tabled by the rapporteur, but not the others."
"The proposal that is now before us provides postal companies with the opportunity to become modern businesses within a realistic timeframe, by no later than 2009, with a clearly defined set of tasks and with transparent accounts, businesses that put the interests of their customers before their own and fulfil a social function at the same time."
"This role is, I believe, crucial in sparsely populated and remote areas and helps the weaker in our society."
"We also provide a directive in which each Member State and each postal service can acquit itself of this task."
"In my opinion, if we follow the rapporteur and if we manage - as I believe we shall - to obtain the endorsement of the Council and the Commission, we will have created something which is very valuable and in which we can take pride."
"Mr President, we think that the revision of the postal directive is untenable, from the point of view of the general interest of European citizens, and it would be politically irresponsible to take a vote for it today."
"Why? Because we all know the social role fulfilled by the postal service in poorer urban areas and in rural or outlying areas."
"And we know, we all understand perfectly well - a six year-old child could work this out - that reducing the scope of reserved services undermines the ability of operators to make financial adjustments, which are the basis of solidarity."
"This solidarity also enables the necessary modernisation to be undertaken so that high quality services can be provided for all."
"Will we soon be telling taxpayers that they will have to put money in the kitty to finance universal service, as they do in the Netherlands?"
"After this vote, are we going to show our support for post office closures or our support for the postal workers who are going to be laid off?"
"Are we going to take part in these demonstrations after voting on this position? Certainly not."
"We cannot accept a common position today that is still too similar to the position adopted at first reading. There is nothing new in the debate."
"I have not heard anyone say that the price of a stamp has gone down in Sweden."
"I have not heard anyone say that there has been compensation for the jobs that have been lost at traditional operators. I have not heard anyone say that the new operators are considering introducing a single price for the European postage stamp."
"There is absolutely nothing new here."
"We are still waiting for the Commission to provide the evaluations that were planned in 1997 and that have been called for in two resolutions adopted by Parliament and in the report by Mr Ferber."
"I urge my fellow Members?"
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, after the postal services market was opened up to competition - a process that began in 1997 - the Commission put forward new proposals in 2000 with the aim of achieving deregulation by 2003 and with a view to bringing about full liberalisation by 2009."
"I would reiterate that the Commission proposed, in particular, to reduce the weight and price limits, from 350g to 50g and from five to two and a half times the basic standard tariff, to establish special services with high added value which would be open to competition, the gradual liberalisation of outgoing cross-border mail and direct mail, and to set specific deadlines for full liberalisation."
"At first reading, a large majority of the European Parliament refused to fully support the Commission."
"Parliament proposed that reductions in the weight and price limits should not go below 150g and four times the basic standard tariff; it rejected liberalisation of cross-border mail and direct mail; it dismissed special services, put back the final deadline for liberalisation and lastly, requested a comprehensive impact study."
"The position of the Council of Ministers - regardless of what a number of Members are saying - differs considerably from the compromise reached by a majority in the European Parliament."
"Although the compromise also abandons the idea of creating special services - a move I welcome - it takes up the Commission's original proposals on reducing the thresholds and, despite the fact that numbers evened out with the announcement of the deadline, I feel that the compromise will put full liberalisation of the sector at risk."
"It is therefore hard for me to understand why what we saw in a negative light yesterday is now something we regard positively."
"The Council and the Commission have not taken Parliament's opinion into account. They are introducing a significant new stage into the liberalisation of the postal sector."
"Mr Ferber's report - whose work I would also like to commend - as adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, falls in line with the Council's position, although, admittedly, several amendments have been added, which I believe to be quite inadequate and which will certainly not require conciliation."
"As expressed in the minority opinion of Members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities in the parliamentary committee, no guarantees have been given on social and economic consequences or on social cohesion."
"Contrary to the spirit and the text of the Langen report, no serious, transparent and pluralist preliminary study has been undertaken."
"Important issues such as conditions of access to networks of new operators or conditions for the financing of universal service remain ill defined."
"I must say that these proposals cause me, as they do my fellow Member, Mrs Flautre, a great deal of concern as to the effects they might have on working conditions, jobs and the quality of services provided with equal access for all, in other words, on the very future of public services."
"My group will therefore demand that the Council's common position be rejected by a roll-call vote and, furthermore, will propose introducing a specific amendment for a study to be undertaken."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this week we will vote on the proposal by the Council of Ministers to pursue the opening of the postal sector to competition, which will bring about the swift removal of the monopoly by 2003."
"As reiterated in a petition signed by French postal workers, we would like to point out that, the monopoly on the postal system in France has enabled us to build up a high quality public service that is valued by all. A comprehensive service is provided throughout France with 90 000 postmen and 17 000 post offices, whilst prices are some of the lowest available, thanks to tariff equalisation."
"In all European countries, the public postal service is experiencing the same effects as a result of liberalisation."
"As regards closures, for instance, 400 post offices closed last year in Belgium, half of the 1 600 post offices in the Netherlands closed down, 30 000 jobs were lost in England, tariffs were increased for people in Sweden."
"In France, the effects of liberalisation will also be felt, the quality of service is falling and workers who have left are not being replaced."
"Several post offices were closed last summer; 4 000 workers on private-law contracts working for the postal service had inferior conditions of employment compared to existing permanent members of staff."
"In 2002, 12 800 employees are due to retire, approximately 2 000 workers need to be recruited, which equates to 10 000 job cuts."
"This ideological aim corresponds to a short-term economic interpretation of the internal market."
"There are numerous examples of the failings of alternative systems such as deteriorating quality, an increase in tariffs, even that the service can no longer be provided."
"The harmful effect on users is therefore more serious than what you could envisage happening in State monopolies."
"We refuse to allow a model of social and territorial cohesion based on equal citizenship to disappear, even if the situation still has some way to go before it is perfect."
"We refuse to sacrifice a quality service simply in order to open up markets to capitalists, especially since we do not know whether or not they will be European."
"We must take urgent action, and I am pleased to hear that some Members are prepared to ignore instructions from above and even that these instructions are becoming increasingly vague."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must therefore vote to reject this common position, which means, for some of us, having the courage to meet our commitments and for others to respect the diversity and a model that we want to maintain on the basis of satisfactory experience."
"As two final points, I must remind those who claim and who fear that, if the common position is rejected, the Commission will use Article 86, which bizarrely enables civil servants to pass legislation directly."
"Having failed itself, is the Commission in a position to point the finger at others' faults?"
"Despite renewed promises, the impact studies are unofficial, biased and incomplete."
"Even the Court of Justice could find fault with them."
"And if it risked using Article 86 anyhow, the Convention would have to redefine Europe's objectives with full background knowledge of the situation."
"With this situation in mind, we ask you to reject the draft directive, which would speed up the deterioration of public service."
"Mr President, the common position reached by the Council on 15 October 2001 on the opening to competition of Community postal services, is a good compromise, so we are told by the rapporteur and the governments. This includes the French socialist government, which urges us all to approve it."
"We, however, think that this text has been based on a series of ambiguities which may be masking many dangers."
"First of all, the French Secretary of State responsible for this matter, Mr Piret, claims that less than 10% of the postal service's turnover will be open to competition by 2009, whereas Commissioner Bolkestein estimates that 50% of the European market will be open to competition by 2006."
"Who is correct?"
"Of course, Mr Piret is talking about France and Mr Bolkestein about the European Union, but even so, the huge difference between the two figures leads us to believe that there is a misunderstanding somewhere or that we are being kept in the dark."
"The second ambiguity is we are told that the new directive will enable the market to be opened in a gradual and controlled fashion."
"However, if we look closely at the proposed arrangements, we might have some doubts over the quality of this control."
"The intermediate stage, which is 1 January 2006, when the weight of mail still not open to competition will be brought down from 100g to 50g, or halved, will be an automatic stage that has already been decided in the document before us. This will happen even though a comprehensive or appropriate impact study has not been carried out."
"In these circumstances, there is a risk that the prospective impact study, which is due to start in 2006, will conclude that the essential decisions have already been taken, that they are already behind us and, once again, we will have taken an unsteady step forward without knowing exactly when and how we have passed the major milestones."
"This will almost be a further example of the Monnet method, but on a smaller scale."
"To sum up, we are in favour of opening the market to competition, provided this would enable us to refine the postal services, but we do not want to throw out the baby with the bathwater."
"We do not want to take the risk of a poorly controlled opening of the market destroying the universal service, which would spell further disaster for the user, especially in a country such as France, where extensive rural areas could see their postal service deteriorate."
"That is why we believe that the 2006 stage must not be automatic, but that a comprehensive and thorough impact study must be carried out beforehand. We also require clarification of the public service obligations to impose on all operators."
"And, even better, we hope that it is acknowledged, Mr President, that all public services are the overall responsibility of each Member State and that these will have a free hand in the ultimate organisation of their postal service."
"Mr President, as well as congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work now and, particularly, at first reading, we must congratulate the European institutions in general, who have succeeded in doing a good job on this issue."
"As we all remember, we started off from positions very far apart, opposing positions in some cases, and we - Parliament, Council and Commission - succeeded in reaching a compromise which we feel will be genuinely capable of catering for even the most radical demands, which some of the Members have upheld this evening, while satisfying a further, absolutely imperative demand which we endorse and support, namely the need to liberalise the public services in the interests of the citizens and consumers, and this is not a whim or part of a general liberalisation trend."
"The purpose of liberalisation is to improve the quality of the services provided to the consumer, the user."
"Clearly, there are some services which require particular attention and this is one of them."
"We have been very careful with this sector: we have introduced more stages, more steps into the process and have achieved a genuinely satisfactory result."
"We are convinced, it is our hope, that this text - which we hope will not need any form of conciliation - will become a clear, unambiguous legislative point of reference."
"There are no grey areas and, even if the letter were to prove at all ambiguous, the substance is clear, Commissioner, and we call upon and expect the Commission to abide by the text in its work."
"We likewise call upon the other Directorates-General and your other colleagues to follow the line taken by the text, particularly the members of the Directorate-General for Competition, who will deal with disputes that are still pending and some of the problems left over from the past in the light of this development, in the light of what we decide today."
"Henceforth, the path we must take is clear: we expect you all to follow it with due care and commitment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the first paragraph of the preamble to the common position under debate reiterates that the main objective of the Community policy on postal services is to combine the gradual, controlled liberalisation of the market in postal services with a guaranteed universal service."
"Coming as I do from a country with a great many small islands and numerous mountain areas in the hinterland, I have every right and am justified, I think, in being anxious about the repercussions opening up this market will have on the quality of the universal service."
"However, this anxiety should have been allayed, we feel, by optimistic results from the study ordered by the Commission."
"Are there in fact any such optimistic results for the 'difficult countries', including my own?"
"In the end, instead of the required ex ante examination of the situation, we now have an ex post evaluation once the first steps have been taken, but at least that will allow us to determine what steps to take next."
"So we must pay close attention to and take particular care with this process which, at this stage at least, has to be dealt with as a mandatory process under Article 80 of the Treaty."
"To ensure we do not contradict ourselves, we must bear in mind that Directive 96/67, which is currently being amended, guarantees European citizens and companies a quality universal postal service without discrimination, at both national and European level."
"It does not make sense to move heaven and earth so that our cohesion policy can continue to be efficient while, at the same time, jeopardising the future of a village post office which is the village's lifeline."
"Heralded as 'a stage further in the opening of postal services to competition', the Council wants the European Parliament to approve a directive which constitutes another step towards doing away with the public postal service."
"The policy of the national governments and the European institutions is a reactionary policy that is harmful both to users and to workers of this sector, which is faced with further job losses."
"We reject the Council's draft text, which serves the interests of private companies that will share between themselves the profitable sectors of the postal services and leave the public sector with the scraps that are incapable of properly fulfilling social needs."
"We also reject the compromise amendments that are designed to mask the hypocrisy and our capitulation before private interests."
"We would like to reiterate that postal services must remain a public service, to which everyone has access under the same conditions, whatever their location and whatever their social situation."
"We are against a two-tiered postal system, we are against private profit gained from users and we call for a stop to opening up the postal service to private providers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the postal issue is a protracted and sensitive one."
"Many strive towards freer market conditions, while others were very apprehensive about the disintegration of the social dimension offered by the postal services."
"This contrast was so marked that it proved impossible to strike a compromise that was acceptable to both parties."
"Like other services, postal services came into being in order to meet a social need."
"Under the influence of all kinds of developments, especially of a technological nature, these needs have changed."
"The advent of new communication services constituted keen competition for the traditional postal companies."
"The effects of these developments are felt in both companies as a whole and among their staff."
"I believe that, with a healthy dose of business acumen, the companies are capable of absorbing these blows. The mechanisation and automation of post-handling services are a case in point."
"Things are not so easy for the staff of postal companies."
"Nobody can deny that both developments - competition and technological changes - adversely affect employment."
"We have to acknowledge this."
"However, always mindful of what really matters, we do believe that society-oriented services do pay off."
"In my opinion, the social dimension is useful as a guide for continuing to provide market-oriented services, even in areas where it is less evident."
"However, we should remain aware of the fact that the responsibility for this and for the conditions under which this is done lies with the Member States."
"This is positive."
"After all, the situation is quite different in the different Member States."
"In order to guarantee adequate services for each Member State and region, it is useful for Member States to apply a licensing system with the option of using performance criteria."
"Time will tell whether the present common position can guarantee an adequate level of services across the regions."
"A thorough, broad-based assessment will need to provide the decisive answer."
"Based on that assessment, this discussion will need to be followed up at a later stage."
"In summary, I am of the view that the present common position, including the amendment by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, can be considered an even-handed position on the market development of the postal services."
"Our delegation will support it accordingly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament's major political groups reached a compromise within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the Council's common position on opening the Union's postal services to competition and I congratulate Mr Ferber on this achievement."
"The postal system is a service of general interest as well as an economic activity."
"The performance of the postal services contributes to the performance of the national economies and certain sectors, particularly banking, insurance or distance selling."
"At a time when we are setting up, in tandem with the single currency, the internal market of financial services, where we are trying to provide a favourable framework for e-commerce in Europe, we cannot ignore the demands from these sectors to improve services and reduce the costs of postal services."
"A certain degree of competition, along with increased demands for quality services, encourages transparency of costs and contributes to the competitiveness of consumer or user activities of the postal services by giving them potential openings."
"I am, however, firmly against all types of full liberalisation, as the services of general economic interest play a role in the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the European Union."
"The European Charter of Fundamental Rights acknowledges the principle of access to the service of general economic interest as laid down in national legislation and practices."
"The importance of access to postal services is not the same in a country with 17 000 post offices and in a country that has barely one thousand."
"We must therefore guarantee that the opening up to competition will not have any negative consequences on the access to postal services in the most isolated or most remote regions."
"In other words, I think that the modernisation of the postal services under the guise of competition is now required in order to develop these services and, more broadly speaking, for the competitiveness of our businesses."
"This liberalisation must, however, be gradual and controlled in order to preserve adaptability, economic viability and guaranteed access to the universal postal service throughout the Union's territory."
"I think that the compromise before us brings together both these aims and that is why I will vote in favour of it tomorrow."
"Mr President, Commissioner, having reached the common position, we must welcome the fact that Parliament's first democratic expression has led to a situation where the Commission and the Council are upholding some of its proposals, such as the special services, the gradual opening up of the market with a review by Parliament in 2009, and even the keeping of direct mail within the public service sector."
"We must, however, note that two things are lacking today and we are dealing with one of those rare liberalisation directives which makes no specific mention of them."
"The first thing is the financing of universal service."
"As soon as exclusive rights and the reserved sector are opened up and inevitably become smaller, we no longer know how universal postal service will be financed."
"And this is no small matter."
"The second point is the conditions of network access."
"Do we know whether the networks of the French postal system are available to the German postal system and its major competitors and vice versa?"
"This is also one of those rare liberalisation directives which fails to specify this aspect in a detailed manner."
"I would like to express my regret that the Commission and also Parliament did not want to thoroughly debate these issues."
"The Commission says it wants transparency across the board and yet, it is refusing to undertake an evaluation of what has been happening, particularly in Sweden and in Holland, where a scaled-down market has registered an increase in prices for the ordinary consumer."
"The Commission refuses to accept the truth about these costs and the truth is that providing a service to everyone in Greece is not the same thing as providing a service in the Netherlands."
"In short, they have demonised the debate and pretended that conciliation is a bad thing."
"I think that we could have seen this debate through to the end in order to achieve a more balanced position."
"Mr President, with regard to the common position, I will just say that, like a number of the previous speakers, I endorse all that the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, said."
"I do not feel that this is a negative compromise, which, as such, would not content anybody, but a positive compromise, particularly in terms of the guarantees that it succeeds in providing: guarantees that liberalisation will be carried out gradually and in a responsible manner, without sacrificing the need for universal services in any way; clear guidelines for the processes of reorganising production and services too, aimed particularly at guaranteeing consumers high quality services at increasingly lower yet still competitive costs."
"I do feel, however, that the difficulty will now be preventing the Commission distorting the meaning of the text when it interprets and applies it, thus upsetting the balance reached and, worst of all, violating Parliament's decision-making rights."
"This will be a particular problem when it comes to Community competition rules and the Commission departments which ensure that these rules are adhered to."
"The infringement procedures instigated against the Italian State and the Belgian postal service appear to disregard not just the precedence taken by special legislation over general legislation but also the base regulation, that this directive makes more explicit, banning the indiscriminate liberalisation of what are known as special or value added services, to which the specific price and weight limits introduced in the directive apply without variation."
"This also concerns the Commission's attitude to terminal dues, as referred to in the Reims II agreement ."
"It would also appear that the Commission is rather behind schedule in proposing to regulate access, pursuant to Article 11 of the old directive, and this delay must be made good without upsetting the balances achieved between operators on the basis of mutual commitments so that private individuals can enjoy the benefits without having to bear the burdens."
"Mr President, the post and the postal services are indeed not just any old commodity and not any old service; they are, rather a very sensitive article, one that also needs to be handled with care."
"In the first round, the Commission did not, I think, comply with this request which had been addressed by Parliament, and the Common Position with the Council is, I think, a good compromise, which does justice to both the public interest and also to the interests of the people and employees it affects."
"Faced with the scepticism that has been expressed, we also need to articulate clearly what we are voting on this week."
"It is only from 2006 onwards that things will get exciting."
"We then want the Commission to inform us how the universal service is to be financed."
"There is no blank cheque; instead we are getting a study."
"There is no automatic behaviour here; instead we want to know in the most exact terms - for that is the crucial thing - whether, as for example Mr Mastorakis put it, people in rural areas on islands are to continue to get a good postal service."
"That will be the case only in 2006."
"I thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, as I think he has brought the various Parliamentary interests and the Council together, so that this week, I believe, we can manage to get a good majority for a good compromise."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament's position at first reading of the draft directive on the opening of postal services to competition was decisive. In fact, the Council accepted four out of the five basic principles we put forward."
"Our only demand not to be accepted was that of bringing down the weight limit of normal post from 150 grammes to 100 grammes. We should not forget, however, that the weight limit proposed by the Commission was 50 grammes."
"What is the most important aspect of this discussion?"
"To my mind, it is to maintain the security of postal services as universal services, which all Europeans citizens have the right to use, regardless of where they live."
"It is also essential that the postal services continue to fulfil the irreplaceable social role that they have traditionally played, whilst being able to remain competitive and to provide increasingly up-to-date services."
"What is the issue here?"
"The issue is that by the end of this year, it will be possible to end the monopoly of postal services that has hitherto been allowed to exist, and unless we are able to reach a common position between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, in 2003 the Commission, using a different legal basis, will be able to treat this problem as a case of competition within the internal market, which falls within the competence of the Commission alone."
"The proposal we are now discussing is, then, under the current circumstances, the safest one."
"Not only is the common position reasonable and accepted by the companies responsible for postal services in our countries, but it also makes any new liberalisation dependent on co-decision by the Council and Parliament."
"We suggest that we vote in favour of the Ferber report with the amendments that we adopted in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"Mr President, this subject has been debated in many places over many years and is of great importance, and I therefore welcome the fact that many speakers have given their opinion on it."
"I am fully aware that I do not need to re-emphasise the importance of postal services for the European economy and its citizens."
"I would like, however, to reaffirm the need to make progress with the social reform that has been initiated and to move forward towards the accomplishment of the internal market for postal services."
"In this context, I am happy that the in-depth debates held in the European Parliament and the Council are about to bring appropriate solutions to the key challenges which have been widely discussed."
"I am grateful to the institutions of the European Union for together planning a road map for supporting the ongoing modernisation of the postal sector whilst maintaining the asset of the universal postal service."
"May I, in particular, praise the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, and also the shadow rapporteur, Mr Simpson, whom I thank in particular for the kind words which he addressed to me."
"I should like to thank both the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur for their support and their constructive attitudes which have greatly contributed to making all this possible."
"Steering such a difficult dossier was a challenge which they have successfully met thanks to the support of their colleagues."
"The common position reached in Council sets out a clear path for a gradual and controlled implementation of the internal market for postal services."
"It provides for sufficient time for all the market players to be prepared, and for guaranteeing that the universal service is maintained."
"The Belgian Presidency - Mr Sterckx referred to the presidency of the country of which he is a citizen- the Belgian presidency has found a good compromise which successfully meets a triple challenge: firstly, to reconcile divided Member States around a common approach; secondly, to largely reflect the European Parliament's position from the first reading - Mr Simpson enumerated the five points of which he said four-and-a-half were achieved by Parliament; and thirdly to gain wide endorsement from the industry stakeholders, including unanimous support from the 15 incumbent postal operators."
"If I may say so, Mr President, the European Parliament can indeed be proud of its significant impact on the common position."
"Let me mention four points."
"Firstly, the definition of special services was deleted, as mentioned by Mr Simpson."
"Secondly, the timetable and weight limits were significantly modified to meet the demand for a more gradual and controlled approach."
"Thirdly, derogations will be possible concerning liberalisation of outgoing cross-border correspondence to the extent necessary to ensure the provision of the universal service."
"Fourthly, the European Parliament will be involved before any subsequent decisive step, confirming, if appropriate, the full accomplishment of the internal market in the year 2009, or determining any other step in the light of the results of a dedicated study."
"It would therefore seem that Parliament has significantly influenced the common position, and congratulations on that accomplishment are due."
"Furthermore, the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur have managed to maintain this widely supported compromise."
"They have succeeded in strengthening the common position by updating its monitoring and controlling provisions in order to ensure that the stakeholders will be kept properly informed and fully involved during the process."
"The Commission supports the demand from a majority of Members of this Parliament for regular reports on the application of this directive."
"I certainly appreciate their wish to be kept informed of developments."
"A similar process has proved to be successful in other sectors, such as telecoms and transport, as Mr Sterckx pointed out."
"This demand from Parliament is not only legitimate but also beneficial, since it ensures that the next codecision procedure can be as successful as this one in gathering wide support among the stakeholders for such an important Community policy."
"The Commission also appreciates Parliament's improvements to the accuracy of the common position drafting."
"In this spirit the Commission can accept, and I can personally support, all the compromise amendments worked out during this second reading to further strengthen the common position."
"This concerns Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3."
"On the other hand - and in the same spirit - it will be no surprise that the Commission is not able to support other amendments which diverge from the largely supported approach of the common position."
"This concerns the remaining proposed amendments to that common position."
"Finally, with regard to the proposed legislative resolution ""asking the Commission to involve all the relevant actors in the sector as well as the European Parliament and Council as closely as possible in the preparation, implementation and follow-up of the prospective study"", I have already covered that point."
"I should like to state again my best intention to meet this wish of the European Parliament when the time comes, using the most appropriate means and in full respect of the applicable agreements between the Commission and Parliament on follow-up procedures for European Parliament resolutions."
"In conclusion, I should like again sincerely to thank this Parliament for its attitude on this report."
"The expected result, thanks to the contribution of all who have been involved in its preparation, is good for the postal market as a whole and will, I trust, give a lift to the Barcelona Summit which is to take place in a few days time when it reviews progress on our ambition to become the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world by the year 2010."
"This report demonstrates in a clear and practical way that European institutions can transform their commitments into action."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken on Wednesday at noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0054/2002) by Mrs Paciotti, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the regulations and general conditions for the performance of the duties of the European data protection supervisor (COM(2001) 411 - C5-0384/2001 - 2001/2150(ACI))."
"Mr President, the decision we are debating today is - or at least I hope it is - the last document we need to be able to set up a European authority which guarantees the practical protection of the European citizens' privacy, including in respect of the Community institutions and bodies."
"Article 286 of the Treaty of Amsterdam stipulated that this would happen as of 1999."
"We are behind schedule and we must therefore avoid further delays."
"I am glad to say that European Parliament and Council Regulation No 45/2001 was adopted at first reading following intense combined endeavours, and it set out the principles and rules, in line with those laid down by Community directives for the Member States, for the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies."
"The regulation also set up an independent supervisory authority in the shape of the European Data Protection Supervisor, to be assisted by an Assistant Supervisor, who will oversee the implementation of the regulation."
"It established their roles and responsibilities - inquiries, advice and consultancy, regulation, settlement of disputes - and the procedures for their appointment."
"Only two points were not fixed by the regulation and are still to be settled: the remuneration to be paid to the Supervisor and his Assistant, and where the office will be located."
"On the matter of remuneration, since the full independence of the Supervisor's office is to be guaranteed in respect of his function of monitoring all the Community institutions and bodies, it appears quite correct to propose that the Supervisor should receive the same remuneration as the Ombudsman or a judge at the European Court of Justice."
"In the case of the Assistant Supervisor, who will be appointed by the same procedure and for the same period as the Supervisor, and will have the additional responsibility of deputising for the Supervisor should the latter be absent or prevented from carrying out his duties, it is proposed that the remuneration payable should be the same as that of the Registrar of the Court of Justice."
"As regards the location of the office, as the majority of the personal data processing services of the Community institutions and bodies are located in Brussels, it is proposed that the Supervisor's office should also be located there."
"After the debate in committee, a number of amendments were adopted which I do not endorse, such as those raising doubts about financial coverage, which have since become obsolete following the adoption of the budget."
"Other amendments, however, refer to the adoption of another major regulation, Regulation No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents."
"Since these amendments introduce recitals and not additional provisions, which would be unacceptable due to the lack of a legal base, I feel I can support them."
"The adoption during the course of the same year of these two major regulations confirms that, in Europe, the culture of personal data protection and the culture of the transparency of public activities are developing alongside each other rather than conflicting."
"Both are in opposition, however, to the authoritarian, bureaucratic culture which, on the one hand, fails to respect the privacy of individual citizens, and, on the other, has the gall to keep the administrative procedures and activities of public bodies confidential."
"I feel that the adoption of this decision will fill a significant gap in the system protecting the European citizens' fundamental right to the protection of personal data, which is now enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"We find ourselves in a bit of an awkward situation."
"Officially, we are assessing the statute of the European data protection Supervisor here, and there are some observations to be made in this respect, which I will do in a moment."
"However, many of us actually want to discuss the brief and working method of the Supervisor but, as already stated, this decision has already been made, and I fear that we simply suffered from a collective lapse of concentration when that happened."
"We are now lumbered with a body which employs fifteen people and which is assisted by another twenty people who work internally in the different institutions."
"This is quite a significant number, considering that this body only supervises the EU's data which the European Union has at its disposal for the first pillar."
"For precisely those sensitive areas which one would expect to generate a great deal of work, such as Europol and Schengen, do not fall within the remit of this Supervisor."
"I therefore seriously wonder what all these people, 35 in total, will be doing all day, whether creating this bureaucratic employment will promote employment, transparency and openness towards the citizens, and also how cooperation with the Ombudsman will work."
"In my view, there is a real risk that a kind of rivalry will exist between the Ombudsman and this Supervisor, because their tasks overlap."
"Furthermore, what is the purpose of using tax money to set up a new separate institution which caters for such a restricted set of tasks?"
"However, as already stated, we can only talk about the statute of the Supervisor and his assistant today, a role which I also question."
"In my view, the fact that a Supervisor is accorded the same status as the Ombudsman is neither here nor there, but to give his assistant the same special status is both costly and difficult to justify."
"The assistant simply belongs in the organisational chart."
"The Commission has underlined the analogy with the Ombudsman at every opportunity, but the Ombudsman has no assistant and has no other official who will be paid as handsomely as the assistant to this Supervisor."
"Since, of course, the Ombudsman and Supervisor will subsequently need to be independent, the official positions will simply need to fall within the remit of the budgetary authorities and not be laid down in a statute."
"I hope that we can at least get this right."
"I can only endorse what my colleague Mrs Buitenweg has said, on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee."
"I have to say that it is rather disappointing that the two opinions from the committees have been largely ignored in the Committee of Citizens' Freedoms."
"It is important that we say here and now that the mere fact that we strongly approve of the principles of protecting data and that we want to move forward, and also the fact that this needs to be done quickly, does not absolve us from the job of scrutinising this proposal properly."
"Normally, as he knows, I am very supportive of what Mr Bolkestein does, but in this case I do not feel that the Commission has in any way justified to us the salary and status of the staff that it proposes to administer this work."
"I very much echo what Mrs Buitenweg has said."
"If this goes through as proposed, to carry out the task that we have set down here, we will be appointing someone who is substantially higher graded and better paid than someone running a major Community institution such as the Trade Mark Protection Office in Alicante - a major autonomous institution."
"As Mrs Buitenweg said, we do not yet know how many staff will be engaged in this process."
"I asked the Commission to give me more details about the establishment, the organisation, and the responsibilities and particularly the role of the assistant."
"Yet the Commission is proposing that we should appoint an assistant on the basis of someone who manages 1 000 staff in the European Court of Justice - now that does not make sense."
"Frankly, I have to say to Mr Bolkestein, if this goes through tomorrow - and I hope that we will actually have the opportunity to discuss in more detail and look at some amendments that you will accept - the fact we have come in at the end of the process has made it very difficult for those of us who want change to put forward acceptable amendments."
"If this goes through, you will have got off pretty lightly and I hope you will give us assurances, firstly that you will properly justify this grade and position, and secondly, that we will be scrutinising every move you make when you put it in place, to make sure that it is done properly."
"Mr President, first of all may I say that I have much sympathy with the remarks that have just been passed by Mr Harbour."
"He has spoken very clearly and I am sure that Commissioner Bolkestein has listened carefully to what he had to say."
"I take this, however, from a slightly different tack."
"The position of the Data Protection Supervisor is of enormous importance."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights which I helped to prepare states that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her and the Amsterdam Treaty called for the establishment of an independent supervisor by 1 January, 1999."
"This deadline is, of course, well past and our main priority, therefore, is to create this post as soon as we possibly can."
"The urgency of the matter should not in itself be an excuse for us to rush it through without proper discussion."
"Indeed, the salary of both the Data Protection Supervisor and his assistant has resulted in numerous discussions within our committees."
"Many people, myself included, were unhappy about the unreasonably high salary of the supervisor, which will of course be comparable to that of the Ombudsman."
"But I contrast this discussion with the kind which one might have in a national parliament where, frankly, the issue itself is of such dramatic importance to the establishment of this role that it ought perhaps to be dealt with not in this particular plenary but elsewhere."
"We are not as flexible as I would like."
"Most of the matters relating to the post have already been laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and published in the Official Journal."
"I know that the Secretariat has also declared a number of the amendments to be out of order for various reasons and this has caused concern among many colleagues."
"Internal politics has also been a feature of this debate."
"It is unfortunate, that there is no single data protection instrument for all the pillars."
"As a member of the Future of Europe Convention, I do hope, indeed I might even anticipate, that at the conclusion of the work that we shall be doing, it may well be that the protection of the private citizen and the interests of the private citizen, both in terms of the work of the Ombudsman - which I highly value and respect - and also in connection with data protection issues, will be spelled out very clearly as something in need of development in the future."
"I hope, therefore, that whatever we decide - and I do hope that we decide to proceed with this post when we vote on this week - we will return to the matter and at an appropriate moment, perhaps, during discussion of the next Treaty or before then, we will look at ways of endorsing the position of citizens and making sure their relationship with institutions in Europe is a properly balanced one."
"Mr President, it is precisely because I am concerned with internal affairs policy that I observe that the European Data Protection Supervisor plays a most important role in the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"It is he who creates public trust in the institutions of the European Union."
"He must work where the majority of the institutions are permanently based, that is, in Brussels - if that is the point at issue."
"If he works elsewhere, the impression is created that he is of only negligible significance."
"If the public get the impression that the Data Protection Supervisor is nothing more than a paper tiger, they will not trust the European Union."
"If they have no confidence in the way their data is protected, our internal affairs policy will never enjoy the public approval it needs for freedom, security and justice to be allowed to grow."
"That, though, is our objective."
"We want internal affairs policy to have a European added value, which will be achieved only if the citizens put their trust in us."
"It is for that reason that we, and, in particular, the Commission, must show them that we take data protection seriously and that it is not in a merely symbolic sense that we are putting it centre stage."
"Mr President, let me say one thing at the outset, namely that I am no great friend of ombudsmen."
"I still feel that we, as elected members of Parliament, should be the primary ombudsmen of the people of Europe."
"Why do we need a Data Protection Supervisor?"
"My esteemed fellow MEP, Timothy Kirkhope, justified it on the basis of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and by reference to data protection's significance."
"I do not believe that one can argue in this way, as we would next need a family ombudsman, a women's ombudsman and a children's ombudsman as well."
"All these groups have an important place in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"In Schleswig-Holstein, the province of the Federal Republic of Germany from which I come, we have developed a veritable abomination; we even have a bicycle ombudsman."
"Anyone, though, who believes that cyclists come off better out of this, even in the planning of the budget, is, as we say, barking up the wrong tree."
"No, data protection really is important, and the reason why it is so to us is that we parliamentarians find monitoring difficult - even the monitoring of the Commission, and especially of what goes on within it - and so, of course, we need an auxiliary person in this field."
"He or she, as Mr Ceyhun rightly said, must be based in Brussels, where he or she is to carry on the work of monitoring."
"Let us move on to remuneration."
"No matter how important the position may be, I really cannot see that an ombudsman, who is to monitor this data, should, in salary terms, be on the same footing as a judge at the European Court of Justice."
"Why that should be the case completely eludes me."
"A judge at the Court of Justice occupies a significantly superior and more important position."
"The judges are, in any case, the guardians of our treaties."
"Why, then, should we pay a data protection supervisor as much as a judge at the ECJ?"
"I think that in this respect our yardsticks of value have shifted a bit over the years, and they need to be put back in order."
"We should rather think about bringing the Ombudsman back to the right pay level instead of going straight ahead with allocating too much to the next position."
"On this point, I appeal for a bit more of a sense of reality."
"Mr President, the Commission has argued that the right of access to documents and the right to privacy are both legitimate rights and that when they both enter into consideration, a balance has to be struck."
"However, the idea of striking a balance between them on a case-by-case basis whenever a name is mentioned misrepresents the nature both of dealing with openness in the public sector and the right to privacy."
"The principle of openness means that public bodies should take decisions as openly as possible and is now defined in the public access regulation."
"That regulation provides for exceptions to access."
"The point of this exception is that a public body may, in carrying out its public duties, come into possession of information about the private and family life of individuals."
"However, there is nothing in Article 286 of the EC Treaty or in the Data Protection Directive to suggest that data protection rules should be applied as a general principle of confidentiality in public administrations so as to require a public balancing exercise whenever a document mentions a name."
"Such an over-interpretation would damage not only the right of public access to documents, but also the genuine purpose of data protection and the performance of the duties of the Data Protection Supervisor."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we should emphasise the fact that the protection of personal data is essential to ensuring that every individual's rights, fundamental freedoms and right to privacy are respected, throughout the European Community."
"This proposal is intended to respond, as has already been said, to two fundamental issues: the performance of the duties of this European data protection supervisor, which have already been laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 45/2001; in other words, the issue of the pay of the European supervisor and deputy supervisor and the issue of where they are to be based."
"With regard to the location, I agree with those who have said that it does not make sense to have it anywhere but Brussels, for the reasons that have already been stated and which I shall not repeat."
"There are, however, other issues which, perhaps due to the highly technical and abstract nature of the regulation, still remain open and which should be responded to."
"For example, provisions on procedural aspects and on the way in which the authority should exercise its powers of investigation should be included here."
"Furthermore, it is to be regretted that there is no instrument for data protection that could apply to all the Community pillars."
"The duties of this supervisor will be limited to the first pillar, but Europol and Schengen - for which data protection instruments are also planned, with the creation in 2000 of a joint secretariat - are currently excluded from the post's scope."
"This means that very little data of a more sensitive nature will fall within the scope of this European supervisor's mandate, which gives legitimacy to the criticism of those who say that the pay package is probably excessive for a post with such limited duties."
"I sincerely hope that in the near future, the current structure and organisation of this European Data Protection Supervisor can be adapted to also include, under the responsibility of a single European authority, supervisory authorities within the European organs created on the basis of Titles V and VI of the EU Treaty, in order to prevent the unnecessary duplication of functions and resources."
"At the same time, it would be good to alleviate the risk of a possible duplication of some functions between the Ombudsman and this European authority, with a view to optimising the use of Community resources."
"Mr President, the aim of this draft decision is to ensure the full implementation of Article 286 of the Amsterdam Treaty and of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies, adopted under codecision procedure on 18 December 2000."
"Before going any further may I stress that the regulation we are now debating was adopted by this Parliament in codecision in a single reading, so it is a little late for some Members of this Parliament to complain about the contents of this regulation, for example where it stipulates that there should be an assistant regulator in this area."
"It is a little late to start complaining about that, but today we are dealing with other issues and, therefore, I should like to continue my contribution to this debate by saying that it concerns the place of data protection in relation to the right of citizens to transparent administration."
"Some Members who have spoken tonight have expressed concern that this initiative might impede, or even reverse, the significant progress made towards achieving the greatest possible transparency in Community administration."
"I must assure these Members that the principle of transparency, and in particular the principle of public access to documents as enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty, in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, is applicable to the Community institutions and bodies and in particular to the European Data Protection Supervisor."
"On the other hand neither of these two principles - data protection on the one hand and public access to documents on the other - has absolute force or takes precedence over the other."
"The Human Rights Convention as interpreted in the case law of the Strasbourg courts and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union require that a balance should be struck in specific cases in order to reconcile the various interests at issue."
"Any attempt to change this by putting an artificially narrow interpretation on the field of application of the fundamental rights governing data protection by denying the representatives of the new body to be set up the institutional status they need to assert their independence, would be on shaky ground."
"The European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg has built up a body of case law on the interpretation of the scope of protection of private and family life which cannot and should not be called into question by this decision."
"In accordance with this case law the professional life of individuals - employees and employers alike - is not excluded from the field of application of data protection."
"Amendment No 1 would introduce an unacceptable ambiguity in this respect."
"The status of the European Data Protection Supervisor and his deputy, who together form a sort of mini-committee, must, above all, ensure their independence in the Community institutional context beyond the mere budgetary aspects."
"The Ombudsman is a good Community-level reference, given his role in monitoring administrative procedures."
"At national level - I should like to say in particular to Mr Harbour but also to others - a judge or even a chief justice is often taken as the reference."
"The draft decision takes account of the two references."
"Any reduction in the status of the deputy would mean loss of independence without any corresponding budgetary savings."
"Amendments Nos 10, 11, 13 and 14 are not sufficiently precise to determine the level of remuneration of the President and his deputy."
"Amendments Nos 12 and 16 contain excellent ideas but the present decision's legal base of Article 43, Regulation 45/2001, is not sufficiently large to carry them."
"Amendments Nos 9 and 15 refer to parts only of the evidence and need redrafting with a view to achieving more balance."
"Parliament and the other institutions concerned have a great responsibility towards the citizens of Europe to ensure that the data protection system, including the supervision provided for in the Treaty as long ago as 1999, is put in place as soon as possible."
"With that in mind the Commission intends to be very flexible with regard to the amendments accepted in the Civil Liberties Commission in the tripartite dialogue with a view to establishing a final text of the decision by agreement between the three institutions."
"It also hopes that the Council, which has already expressed its agreement with the Commission proposal, may be able to act likewise."
"I feel I should raise a point of order in relation to what the Commissioner has just said."
"He referred to a number of texts on the definition of privacy and he referred to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the protection of privacy and family life."
"As the rapporteur on the Regulation on Access to Documents, I feel it only right to point out that in the judgment of 16 February 2000, the European Court of Human Rights confirmed its earlier case law, that it is data relating to the private life of an individual that falls within the scope of Article 8."
"The preamble to the Data Protection Convention and recitals to the Data Protection Directive also make clear that their purpose is to protect the fundamental right of privacy, not to restrict the information available to citizens about public activities."
"If the Commission pursues the line indicated tonight, it is on a collision course with Parliament."
"Mr Cashman, whether that is strictly a point of order or not I am not prepared to rule at the moment."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0046/2002) by Mrs Malmström, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the European Commission's legislative and work programme (amendment of Rule 57 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure) (2001/2110(REG))."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Malmström, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, not only for having familiarised herself with these difficult processes but also for having conducted the negotiations on the subject with the Commission with the rigour, prudence, but also the friendliness that they call for."
"I believe that this result will, both for the Commission and the other institutions have a calming effect on procedures which, over and over again, have led in the short or long term to disputes that might well have been unnecessary."
"For us, this result makes it possible to make debate on the Commission's annual work programme more political, getting away from listing individual projects somewhat in the manner of a book-keeper, indeed, it makes it possible for us to set out at the start of the year, what we see as the European Union's most important projects in the coming year."
"One might say that this procedure and the preparation for it make this annual work programme interactive."
"I believe that this represents a move forward in terms of the reliability and predictability of the processes we are considering."
"As Mrs Malmström has rightly emphasised, this result also makes demands of us ourselves, for we really must refrain from constantly repeating what we wanted already, and must instead actually limit our deliberations to a period of one year."
"It is also necessary for us to become more closely involved than before in the actual planning of the half-year presidencies, which may go against our own priorities."
"Involvement in the preparation of the legislative programme is important to us also because we still do not possess the right of initiative in the European legislative process."
"On that, let me say something about my personal assessment of the position. Our spontaneous reaction when the Commission's sole right of initiative is called into question is always a cool one."
"Above all, the Commission itself reacts understandably with great reserve on that point."
"Despite that, we must of course consider whether we should raise the issue anew, perhaps within the framework of the Convention's discussions, for it is the case that the European Union's great acquis communautaire, consisting of some 10 000 instruments, can be amended only on the Commission's proposal."
"I will say here that I doubt whether that satisfies the requirements of a democracy."
"To that extent the decision we are drawing up today, is also a crutch, helping Parliament to move towards enhanced involvement in initiatives."
"Mr President, my group will support Mrs Malmström's proposals, and I would also like to offer her our congratulations for the hard work she has put in for more than nine months and in negotiating intensely with the Commission."
"Parliament and the Commission have long recognised that legislative planning is a matter of common concern."
"The Commission has the right of initiative."
"My group does not seek to change that."
"We have the right to call upon the Commission to make proposals already given to us in the Treaty."
"It has the right of initiative."
"We are a parliament that is master of its own timetable, unlike some national parliaments."
"We both therefore have an interest in reaching an understanding on the legislative programme coming up in any given year so as to plan our work, so as to exchange views on priorities, so as to reach agreement and convergence as much as possible."
"That has long been the case, but the actual procedures by which we have done it have not always been working satisfactorily, and I welcome this updating and rationalisation that has been put forward."
"Given the number of times that we will be discussing and looking at the following year's programme in the different fora over a year, my one fear is that, if we are not self-disciplined, we will spend an enormous amount of time looking at what will come up well over a year ahead, without being very concrete."
"We must be self-disciplined and make sure that problem does not arise."
"There is a ghost missing from this feast, namely the Council, and the role of the Council presidency."
"Council presidencies often present a programme to Parliament as if they were assuming executive office."
"Council presidents must remember that they are not taking over executive office when they become president of the Council."
"They are merely chairing the body which is the co-legislative body with Parliament for a short period of six months, with an inherited agenda."
"We must make sure that this legislative planning works without upsetting the whole balance of the system by delivering it in the wrong way."
"I too would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Malmström on this report."
"It is an important proposal because it introduces a more formal structure into the process of Parliament's scrutiny of the Commission's legislative programme, which is, after all, a very important component of one of our most important functions - that is to say, scrutinising and holding the Commission to account."
"Following what the Commission is up to is always slightly difficult unless one is a true initiate of the workings of the European political system."
"Most people are not, and so to introduce a more formal structure into this process is, in my view, a very desirable development because it should assist those outside the circle of initiates, by providing as it does a series of markers for the cycle of the year's business."
"Ignorance of the way in which the European Union works, coupled with the failure of national parliaments to oversee and scrutinise European matters properly, are two of the great weaknesses in the European political structure as it has developed."
"Now, while it is for national parliaments themselves to determine their own agendas, I as a Member of the British second Chamber as well as a Member of this House feel that the formal structuring of the way that the European Parliament scrutinises what the Commission is doing may well be a very useful template for scrutiny by national parliaments and at the same time for disseminating accurate facts about what is going on at European level, to the benefit of all our citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you warmly for offering me the opportunity to participate in this debate on the reform of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure and specifically the proposed revision of Rule 57, which takes up the agreement we have reached between the Commission and Parliament in relation to the methods for presenting our legislative and working programmes."
"The contacts we have maintained throughout these months have allowed us to reach a solution for structuring a constructive dialogue on this issue, which is important."
"The text which the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposes including in an annex to European Parliament's Rules of Procedure respects the institutional role of the Commission and Parliament and honours the mutual commitments we have made over the last two and a half years."
"I would firstly like to thank Mrs Malmström for her cooperation and constructive work - which has not always been easy, but the results of which have made it all worthwhile - in our debates and discussions, and that of the whole of the Parliament's team and the representatives of the various political groups, since I believe that this has allowed us to achieve a proposal which I hope will be beneficial to the functioning of the European institutions."
"The College of Commissioners has held in-depth debates on this matter and has agreed that the right of initiative laid down in the Treaties must be retained in its current form, with the collegial responsibility of the Commission."
"Furthermore, Parliament must be informed on time, and not only informed, but it must also be in a position to be able to contribute its ideas and suggestions on the best definition of Community policies."
"In this respect, I believe that the agreement, which I am not going to explain, since Mrs Malmström has done so magnificently, includes the ideal procedure for combining these elements."
"As for Mr Corbett's point, it is true; we should consider how we can involve the Council in this process."
"We will have to seek a formula which, of course, must be acceptable to the Council."
"In any event, we in the Commission hope that this structured dialogue can focus our attention, as Mrs Malmström rightly said, on the political and strategic aspects in relation to the broad approaches of our action, with realism, as the new President of the European Parliament, Mr Cox, has also said on a previous occasion."
"The Prodi Commission fully shares this objective and we want to prevent this process from becoming a mere bureaucratic accounting operation, which should not stop us from applying the relevant rigour, and the debates should be accompanied by general approaches and political considerations which, as has been said previously, can be turned into concrete proposals and political approaches."
"I hope that, by means of this dialogue, we will discuss our political priorities for 2003, in order to define concrete courses of action for the enlarged Europe."
"In any event, the Commission, as it has been doing since 1999 when it came to office, will fully comply with the agreements with this Parliament and we hope that the trust and cooperation between the two institutions will lead to the better functioning of the institutions and that, furthermore, when the time comes we can also seek a formula to incorporate the Council as well."
"Congratulations once again to Mrs Malmström."
"The discussions have been long but the final result has made it worthwhile."
"In any event, we will soon find out, because within a couple of months a first round of participations by all the Commissioners will begin - by means of the specialised committees - in relation to our future projects for next year."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon."
"I declare closed the 2001-2002 session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 9.15 p.m.)"
"Opening of the session"
"I declare open the annual session of the European Parliament for the year 2002-2003."
"I have received a request for a topical and urgent debate on the Council's proposal to change the legal basis for the European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation (?EC) No 218/92 on administrative cooperation in the field of indirect taxation (VAT) [C5-0103/2002 - 2000/0147(COD)]."
"Mr President, two years ago the Commission presented two proposed modifications, one of the sixth directive and the other of the Regulation on administrative cooperation."
"The aim of both was to end the discrimination suffered by European companies in comparison with those of third countries, particularly American ones, in terms of the provision of services."
"This discrimination is due to the fact that companies from outside the Union do not pay value-added tax when they provide electronic services, while European companies are obliged to pay it."
"Since this is an urgent issue, Parliament produced two reports very quickly."
"At the moment, the Council are asking us for a change to the legal basis exclusively for the Regulation on administrative cooperation."
"I am not going to expand on this issue, but I wish to say they are two different things."
"The Committee believes that we should not proceed with the change of legal basis, but that the issue should be studied with the greatest urgency, in order to put an end to this discrimination and, furthermore, as Parliament has requested, in order to facilitate the use of electronic means for identifying clients, putting an end to the costs which are faced in particular by small and medium-sized businesses."
"I would therefore advise the House to accept the Council's request in relation to the urgency procedure, and not accept the change of legal basis in relation to this issue."
"It is one thing to deny a material request and quite another to deny it an urgency procedure so that these two proposals can be implemented very quickly."
"Mr President, the information on the vote on request for urgent procedure on administrative cooperation was not supplied to me in due time, or rather, it was not delivered at all, and, for that reason, I am unable to vote in favour of it."
"Mr Ilgenfritz, I appreciate your request."
"However, I can tell you that Parliament's services have been trying to get the translation since last night."
"If you insist, we shall have to postpone the vote until the relevant document has been distributed in every language."
"Last night, I attended the coordinators' meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"It is unfortunate that the chair, Mrs Randzio-Plath, is not here today."
"Otherwise, I am certain that she would have told you that the meeting of coordinators last night decided to advise against urgent procedure."
"The reason for that is that the Council would like to decide on this matter before 1 July, which leaves us plenty of time, even if we do not decide on urgent procedure today."
"It can be discussed reasonably quickly, but there is no need at all for urgent procedure."
"It is, indeed, correct that the legal basis still causes some difficulty, but we can discuss this in due course."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs therefore advises against urgent procedure."
"Mr President, I want to raise a point of order on a very serious matter dealing with Scotch whisky."
"A year ago, this Parliament selected two whiskies to be put on sale to Members of Parliament, to visitors and to people visiting our shops in Brussels and Strasbourg with Parliament's own label and own brand placed on the bottles."
"The College of Quaestors has agreed all of the conditions necessary for having these whiskies placed on sale in our shops, yet the Administration is still blocking their sale in our shops."
"This is a serious matter because it raises the question of who runs this Parliament - the Members or the Administration?"
"I would ask you, Mr President, to intervene in this matter to ensure that the request of the College of Quaestors taken on behalf of the Members is carried out and that these branded whiskies are placed on sale in our shops."
"Thank you very much, Mr Stevenson."
"May I assure you that the Quaestors will look into the matter tomorrow on the basis of what you have just said."
"Mr President, yesterday, in one of the Palestinian refugee camps, Ariel Sharon's troops killed twenty-two people."
"I do not know whether to feel horror or shame at the Israeli Government's treatment of the Palestinians, which reminds me of the treatment the Jews themselves received in Europe 60 years ago."
"I believe this must end and that the President of Parliament should lodge a protest and condemn such acts."
"Thank you very much, Mr Nogueira Román."
"Your comments have, of course, been noted and will be examined by the relevant parliamentary committees."
"Mr President, on the issue which Mr Nogueira has just mentioned, I would like to refer to an issue which affects this House even more directly."
"As the House knows, a few days ago a special representative of the European Union - the institution to which this Parliament belongs - Mr Moratinos, was detained against his will for some minutes at the residence of President Arafat, due to the bombing of that residence by Israeli troops."
"Mr President, I would ask you to communicate this Parliament's indignation to the Spanish Presidency of the Council at this blatant aggression against a diplomatic representative of the European Union in the fulfilment of his duties, while he was in Palestine with the President of the Palestinian Authority, something which the Israeli authorities had prior knowledge of, as the honourable Members and the President know."
"Thank you."
"You may be sure that your comments will be passed to the proper authorities."
"Mr President, yesterday the Group of the Party of European Socialists requested the deletion of Chechnya from the subjects for topical and urgent debate on the basis that it is an urgent subject of major importance, to be dealt with when the time comes, which I hope it will."
"Today, the political position of Parliament on a very serious, extremely important situation that cannot be resolved is being presented as a point of order."
"Naturally, we are all sorry that Mr Moratinos was present when these events took place."
"We are all aware of the situation in the Middle East, which deserves an in-depth discussion, not just a point of order and request to the President."
"I therefore invite you, Mr President, to ask that a debate take place, if necessary, but not this type of attitude asking the presidency to do things that, under other circumstances, we do not want Parliament to do."
"Mr President, having listened to the speeches by the two honourable Members on the crime being perpetrated in the Middle East against the Palestinian people, I totally agree."
"My problem is that, at some point - and I would suggest immediately - we need to stop making declarations and verbal accusations and do something and the first thing we need to do - and do at once - is to cut all funding from the European Union to Israel and all supply lines, because there appears to be a fairly dense network of supply lines between Israel and the countries and arms industries of the European Union."
"So an end to hypocrisy!"
"We must do something to put an end to this heinous crime."
"As I am sure you understand, this is not the time for an in-depth debate on the problem in the Middle East."
"Your comment has been noted and I thank you for it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the budget process looks a bit different this year than previously."
"We are on the way towards an activity-based budget. Of course, we hope that, in the long term, this will lead to simplification and increased clarity, although this year we will be working with the old and the new methods in parallel."
"Another new feature is that all three institutions are producing political budget guidelines at roughly the same time."
"The Commission now produces an annual policy statement, and the Council makes decisions on guidelines."
"In my view, this should mean that we will obtain a better political dialogue on the priorities and that the Commission's preliminary draft budget can be based on deliberations by all three institutions, not just those of the Commission itself."
"This should naturally lead to a better budget process and to simplification."
"The greatest difference as far as the European Parliament is concerned is perhaps the increased emphasis now being placed on follow-up and implementation, for we cannot merely be content to pass decisions on a mass of figures in the budget which then just remain on paper."
"As a Parliament, we must also make sure that our ambitions and priorities are being realised."
"The wording of the guidelines which the committee is now submitting to the European Parliament is more precise in many cases than before."
"This applies to statements on the importance of ensuring that the budget is followed, as well as to decisions of the European Parliament or budgetary authority."
"It applies to the actual amounts involved, as well as to budgetary remarks, etc. However, on a number of occasions, the Committee on Budgets has had to point out that a number of remarks which the European Parliament made in various contexts did not, however, lead to the Commission's actually acting in accordance with the decisions made."
"On a number of occasions, we have also pointed out the importance of the amounts in the budget actually taking effect."
"Naturally, it is worrying when, year after year, the budget produces large surpluses which have to be paid back to the Member States because important work is not carried out."
"This is particularly serious in terms of areas to which political priority is given, such as regional policy assistance under the Structural Funds or aid to prioritised recipients in other parts of the world."
"We have already been warned that it will be proposed that the Member States receive early repayment of EUR 10 billion from the 2001 surplus."
"This is a tenth of the entire budget."
"This surplus arose primarily because the Structural Funds did not manage to implement their programmes."
"In our opinion, this must lead to greatly increased pressure on both the Commission and the Member States to take the problem of implementation seriously."
"In reality, this has to do with confidence in the EU as an institution."
"This has led to our attempting to introduce a somewhat different budget process."
"We are attempting to bring the committees on board in a quite different way than before, for example by means of hearings involving Commissioners and through each committee's checking its part of the budget and seeing how it is implemented."
"This will ensure that the entire European Parliament is involved in the budget process more actively than before."
"The budget debate will also be a little different."
"During the July session we shall have a debate which will largely be to do with implementation but which will take place at the same time as the debate on the mandate for the conciliation negotiations on the Council's first reading."
"In the Committee on Budgets we had a great many amendments, 129 to be precise."
"Here in the plenary sitting, the number has been considerably reduced, and the reason for this is of course that we have been able to compromise on a consensus approach towards the most important priorities."
"We are entirely agreed that the most important political priority is EU enlargement."
"For us, this means, in more concrete terms, the preparations we must now make if it is to be possible for this historic task to be carried out."
"Enlargement itself creates no problems for the 2003 budget, but we are still affected in various ways."
"We must begin the debate on the long-term effects of enlargement, and the European Parliament wants to be involved in this debate. The agreements now being made in negotiations with the Member States will affect the budget for a long time into the future."
"This is therefore a very important concern for the European Parliament too."
"We must also set in motion a debate on the principles of how we are to prepare for accession."
"This will apply to pre-accession aid under heading 7 and to our own costs in terms of administrative expenditure for preparing for the interpretation, translation, buildings and premises required because of enlargement."
"The urgent, and largest, problem is of course the administrative expenditure under heading 5."
"If nothing radical is done, we run the risk of hitting the budget ceiling as early as 2003 as well as a major risk of considerably exceeding the ceiling in 2004."
"We are therefore attempting to put pressure on the Secretaries-General of our institutions so that they really come up with practical proposals for co-operation and savings."
"If this does not succeed, we will have a discussion on either painful reprioritisations or the injection of completely new funds."
"I am convinced that no one in this Parliament wishes to jeopardise the enlargement timetable for reasons of this kind."
"Changes such as increased co-operation and rationalisation are, moreover, completely in line with the ideas for which we ourselves press when it comes to reforming the institutions of the Union, reforming the Commission, etc."
"Great emphasis will also be placed on the Union's role in terms of foreign policy and aid policy."
"Where these are concerned, we are this year in danger of further exacerbating the problem which dominated the debate last year, that is to say the fact that, on top of our traditional priorities, we constantly heap new tasks such as those involving the Balkans, Afghanistan, the Global Health Fund and the common foreign and security policy."
"In the end, it will become impossible to constantly squeeze in new tasks under the same budget ceilings, especially as the old tasks are often linked to practical undertakings involving recipients in other parts of the world."
"Even though we have not adopted a position on the Commission's proposal for a new flexibility instrument, it is quite clear that we welcome debate on this instrument or, alternatively, debate on a more planned use of the emergency reserve."
"I would also like to mention a couple of different areas where we are adopting a very aggressive approach."
"Regarding heading 3 - internal expenditure - there is now the opportunity, in the wake of the Barcelona process, to make considerably more active use of funds for trans-European networks, for the development of small enterprises, etc."
"I believe this is vital. We are also attempting to press for a situation in which the review of agricultural policy, the midterm review, really does lead to actual change."
"To conclude, I would like to thank my co-rapporteur, Mr Stenmarck."
"There is an unusually large number of Nordic rapporteurs this year, and the budget will also undergo its final reading during the Danish Presidency."
"In that spirit, I would like to remind you of what the then Chairman of the Court of Auditors, Mr Karlsson, said in his last speech before retiring."
"He said that the most important thing you can do with the EU budget is to make it simpler, more direct and clearer in the eyes of the people."
"I hope we are able to take these words to heart."
"Mr President, let me also begin by thanking my fellow rapporteur, Mr Färm, for his sound cooperation so far."
"There are three priorities in the guidelines for the administrative budget on which we now have to adopt a position."
"The first is enlargement."
"That is the most important priority and the greatest challenge for the entire EU, and it is therefore also the most important issue for which the European Parliament and the other institutions have to prepare."
"The second priority is institutional reforms, which will become vital in an enlarged EU which will soon comprise 25, rather than 15, Member States."
"Thirdly, it is about completing enlargement and the institutional reforms within the financial framework laid down in the financial perspective in Berlin in 1999."
"We must respect these limits and manage the EU's budget within them."
"Because we have a deficit in the region of EUR 130 million to EUR 140 million so far, we need a strategy for managing this."
"In the short term, it is entirely possible to deal with this."
"The solution will involve cutbacks in all the institutions."
"This is also the most important message I have the opportunity to convey at all my meetings and in all my contacts with the various institutions of the EU."
"It gives them the chance to set their priorities in a way that respects the fact that they themselves know best what can be done in their own areas."
"If they are unwilling to do this, we will have to set the priorities ourselves but the result may not be as good."
"In the longer term, more systematic changes are needed in the budget in order to cope with a constantly increasing deficit."
"We had an informal trialogue in Madrid just under a week ago."
"There is no doubt that, at least in terms of putting it into words, there is a broad understanding of the size of the problem in both the Commission and the Council."
"Despite this, the Commission is clearly prepared to look for the simplest possible solution, namely that of using the flexibility instrument to inject extra funds into heading 5."
"I must emphasise that this is a solution with an extraordinarily large number of drawbacks."
"For all of us who do not work within an anonymous Commission but instead have to meet our voters on a daily basis, it would in actual fact be impossible to look these voters in the eye and, at the same time, explain that the EU needs more money to employ more bureaucrats in Brussels."
"That would just not be on."
"With precisely this in mind, it is incredibly important that the European Parliament demonstrate firmness and consistency in its position and in encouraging all the institutions to contribute to budget reductions."
"Let me say a few words about the most important priorities in the report."
"When it comes to enlargement, a number of issues are particularly important."
"The first is language and the right of every Member of this Parliament to be treated in the same way as all the others."
"There are in fact only two options."
"Either we must all speak the same language or each of us must be allowed to speak our own language."
"If I, as a Swede, have the right to speak Swedish and a Portuguese Member has the right to speak Portuguese, then a Hungarian Member must be allowed to speak Hungarian and a Lithuanian to speak Lithuanian."
"The Committee on Budgets has backed what the Podestà Group calls controlled multilingualism."
"At the same time, we urge the working party to revise its proposal and produce its conclusions in time before the budget for 2003 has to be adopted."
"Enlargement will also entail the need for investment in buildings, offices and interpreting booths."
"All of this is particularly difficult as we are unaware of what the scope of enlargement will be."
"We will not be aware of this until the Copenhagen Summit in December."
"If enlargement is to begin to be implemented with ten countries in January 2004, we have an incredible amount to do in the space of only 21 months."
"In fact, we have even less time as the new Member States will be entitled to send observers immediately the agreements are signed."
"This means we might only have just under a year."
"A great deal remains to be done in this time."
"Therefore, everything that has to be done must also be given the absolute highest priority."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we want to keep to the timetable for enlargement - which we all do - 2003 will be essentially characterised by the need to make preparations for enlargement."
"That has already been underlined in this House."
"In the candidate countries, assuming that negotiations have been concluded, 2003 will see the referendums being held, and, in the Member States, the processes of ratifying the Accession Treaties will be in progress, the Convention will be presenting its recommendations on Europe's future in an enlarged EU and the European institutions, their personnel and structures, will be having to make very real preparations for the increased membership after 2004, from which date they will exercise their responsibilities on behalf of a good many more people and on behalf of more Member States."
"All three of the reports before us on priorities for 2003 are therefore right to highlight this essential task."
"I wish to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, for these conclusive reports, which also lay very definite emphasis on this."
"On 27 February, the Commission decided on its priorities and annual strategy for 2003."
"In it, we agreed on three priorities: firstly, preparation for enlargement; secondly, measures to enhance stability and security in the European Union and also outside it; and thirdly, on the priority to be accorded to the promotion of sustainable economic development."
"The President of the Commission has already had the opportunity to present this strategy to Parliament, and there will be a plenary debate on it in the next part-session, in order that we may also discuss together the consequences this will have on the programme of legislation."
"We are focusing today on issues of budget planning and on the effects that the setting of priorities will have on them."
"The maximum funding allocation for 2003 has been set by the Financial Plan at EUR 102 billion, precisely one third of which is laid down as being for structural assistance and for the principal support instruments that are at our disposal for the purpose of achieving the important objective of matching living conditions across regions, improving the employment situation, improved protection for the environment and the promotion of gender equality."
"Most of the resources will, on the other hand, accrue to the sphere of agricultural policy, subject to the creation of the relevant legal basis."
"We will of course be presenting the agricultural policy's mid-term balance sheet in 2002, which will be linked with further proposals for reform, although I believe it rather too optimistic to assume that these proposals for reform will take tangible form as soon as the 2003 Budget; Agriculture Ministers are simply not in the habit of deciding on agricultural reforms at that speed."
"In the context of the priorities set for 2003, therefore, new initiatives focus primarily on the policy areas of internal and foreign affairs."
"The Commission is proposing to make available an additional sum of approximately EUR 270 million in the coming year, that is, 2003, for these pressure points."
"Let me give the following as examples of what is proposed in the area of internal affairs policy: Firstly, redoubled efforts towards an integrated common civil protection strategy, for 11 September opened the eyes of all of us to how important this is as a task for the Community."
"Then new actions with additional resources in the area of the Refugee Fund and a programme from the area of sustainable development, and a programme for smart energy to continue previous support programmes in the energy sector with increased resources."
"In the foreign policy field, as has indeed been our experience from the very beginning of this parliamentary term, greater demands will again be made on us."
"We will have to continue our commitment in the Balkans, in order - among other things - not to put at risk the successes we have already achieved, and, as a European Union, we will be taking on new tasks."
"To be precise, I refer here to the police operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"It is the Commission's view that the international Police Task Force, at least as far as the operational costs of the joint operation are concerned, should be at least partly funded from the Community budget."
"That, again, is of course a new step."
"Mr Färm has pointed out, though, that it represents a new measure, but the Commission takes the view that it should also be seen to be a joint one."
"The Council conceded the highest priority in 2003 to the issue of how this operation should be financed, and I believe that all three institutions are agreed in principle, but we must of course also agree on the conditions, that is, on how the resources from the common foreign and security policy are to be provided."
"What, though, can of course very well happen with further measures for 2003 in the common foreign and security policy area is that the resources in category 4, that is, in the foreign policy budget, will be insufficient to cover further measures for civil crisis management, and so it is my urgent appeal to the budgetary authority that they speedily examine the Commission proposal on the creation of a new financial instrument."
"I think we should, in the coming months, as a matter of priority, discuss what ideas the budgetary authority have as regards further development of the budget line for the common foreign and security policy."
"On foreign policy, I would further like to mention that we have promised Afghanistan that we will make aid available for the reconstruction of the country."
"This year, in 2003, and in the years to come, the people who, for 20 years, have lived through war and suffered oppression by the Taliban, will be in urgent need of aid."
"This will continue to be a priority for the next few years."
"Still on foreign policy, I would like to mention that we - or so, at any rate, I hope - will, in 2003, be faced with a new task in respect of Cyprus."
"Any political solution that we manage to bring about there will of course need to be backed up by financial resources."
"Let me remind the House that the budget for assistance with preparations for enlargement includes only resources for the southern part of Cyprus and not for the northern part."
"This, too, will confront us with a new challenge."
"The Commission is also proposing, as overseas aid, to make a further contribution to the Global Health Fund."
"It takes the view that its commitment to support the Barcelona process in the Mediterranean region should be reinforced, in particular by more offers of funding for the development of the private sector."
"The Commission has therefore proposed to the Council the significant possibility of establishing a subsidiary of the European Investment Bank, and has already made provision in the Budget for a capital investment of EUR 25 million."
"To return to preparations for enlargement, these mean for the institutions of the European Community definite additional human resources and tangible administrative measures."
"Taking just one of the tasks as an example, the Commission must, starting from the first day of enlargement, audit State aid in the candidate states."
"We also, of course, want participation in the Structural Fund or in the Agricultural Fund to work virtually from day one, so that there is no excessive time lag."
"This means in real terms that administrative reconstruction must start as early as in the run-up to enlargement."
"The Commission is therefore proposing the creation of 500 non-permanent positions within itself."
"Why temporary staff?"
"We would welcome the option of, as early as 2003, appointing staff from the candidate countries to serve in the Commission."
"Of course, we have to bear in mind the constrained position in category 5, that is, the area of administrative expenditure."
"On that, the Commission is in complete agreement with Mr Stenmarck's report, and we have therefore included in our proposal the suggestion that staff should be made available for the new political priorities by means of reassignment, which makes it absolutely necessary - on which point, too, we agree completely with Mr Stenmarck - that the report submitted by the Secretaries-General, which is on the table, should be checked exhaustively to see where savings might be possible."
"The Commission has submitted the first such 'screening' and has nonetheless come to the conclusion that, in all probability, additional resources over and above category 5 will be required in 2003 in order to fund the measures in preparation for enlargement."
"I see the proposal that the flexibility reserve be used for this purpose as being wholly concordant with the wording of the interinstitutional agreement, dealing as it does with a temporary situation, that of no resources having been set aside in the Financial Plan for the European institutions to prepare themselves for enlargement."
"It is of course not acceptable to use the resources allocated to enlargement for that purpose in 2003."
"The Financial Plan does not permit it."
"I do think though that the peculiar situation in 2003 means that we should check closely whether the instrument of the flexibility reserve can be used in this way."
"One last word on the flexibility reserve: use will be made of it in any case, as, when dealing with the 2002 Budget last year, we had agreed that the last tranche from the specific restructuring programme for the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets would be made available in 2003."
"I think we are all aware that, just as in recent years, the European Budget will face fresh demands made on it in 2003, but I note - and this is something I would like to underline - that the priorities set out in Parliament's reports coincide to a marked degree with those set by the Commission."
"I am therefore working on the assumption that the budget procedure will again see us summoning up together the flexibility and willingness to compromise that we need in order to meet the challenges of 2003."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Parliament's rapporteur, Mr Färm, for his extremely cooperative and helpful approach to the budget this year."
"For the first time in my parliamentary career I can honestly say I am looking forward to working with the Committee on Budgets on this year's budget."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy fully supports the Commission's reforms, which have increased its effectiveness and efficiency of delivery in the field of foreign affairs."
"We have some concerns, however, for the 2003 budget."
"Firstly, as we take on more responsibilities and as the Council goes around the world promising support here there and everywhere, insufficient thought seems to be given to where we get the money from."
"If we are to maintain the ceilings as they are, the only ways we can pay for increased responsibilities are either through the increasing use of flexibility instruments - and we have reservations about that - or quite simply through cuts in other lines."
"How can we maintain long-term programmes of support for the poorest parts of the world if we are constantly robbing Peter to pay Paul?"
"We must try to address that question, or at least get the Council to address it."
"Secondly, we must have greater transparency in the budget, and that has to begin with this year's PDB."
"Far too much time is spent playing hide-and-seek, trying to work out what the Commission is actually proposing and why it is proposing to do it."
"It may be understandable to our budget junkies in the Committee on Budgets, but for us normal human beings most of it is incomprehensible."
"We cannot have cooperation between Parliament and the Commission unless we have greater transparency."
"Thirdly, we need to work harder still on implementation to make sure that we are spending the money and not just committing it, and that we are spending it in accordance with the priorities which are set out by Parliament during the budgetary procedure."
"Fourthly, we must have greater clarity in financing the CFSP - particularly the difference between administrative and operational expenditure."
"I would support the Commission's proposal on civilian crisis management and oppose the Council's clear intention of cutting Parliament and the Commission out of that."
"Finally, we must take more effective action in the field of small arms and light weapons; and if that is to be achieved, I believe it has to be moved into the first pillar."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there will again be elections to Parliament in 2004."
"European citizens, every one of them, will be wondering which piece of the cake they have got, and whether that cake had been fairly shared out."
"I take the view, as a representative of the Group of the European People's Party, that the cake that is being shared out is a big one, for the bigger the cake, the more fairly it can be shared out."
"When theorising about how the cake should be shared out, we should, then, always consider the way we support and promote those who bake it."
"As a matter of course, most of Europe's bakers of cakes are small and medium-sized enterprises, which produce the cake by the sweat of their brows."
"I believe that our most important future concern must be with those people who work in these enterprises, and, let me underline this, two thirds of workers are employed by these firms with fewer than 250 on the payroll."
"What is of the utmost importance to us in the political world, they produce 80% of taxes."
"I believe, then, that we must get started where we have the best chance of future success."
"We have all set ourselves the goal of becoming, in eight years' time, the highest-performing and most competitive region in the world."
"All I can say to that is that we urgently need to step on the gas if we are actually to achieve this objective, for our citizens' sake."
"We have had a few crises in recent years, such as, for example, the support given to the former Yugoslavia, the BSE crisis, and Afghanistan."
"Now a package arrives in this House that gives me a lot to think about; I mean the provisions of Basle II."
"In essence, the provisions of Basle II are quite right."
"We have to see to it that firms have sufficient equity and venture capital."
"If these conditions are incapable of being fulfilled, regulations cannot be enforced."
"If we want these provisions to be capable of being complied with - as we all do - then we need a Green Paper and a plan of action in good time, so that our small and medium-sized enterprises will again be able to pay their wages in 2005."
"In the event of Basle II entering into force without our having either a Green Paper or an action plan, then, in 2005, when it enters into force, there will be mass lay-offs and mass bankruptcies."
"We do not have much time left to us, and action is urgently needed."
"This applies especially to firms in the countries that want to join the EU; mention equity capital there, and you find that most firms do not have any at all, and that there, the borrowing of capital from outside sources, along with bank credit, prevail to the exclusion of all else."
"If a liquidity squeeze means that small and medium-sized banks are unable to make cash and its equivalent available, then big problems are coming our way."
"That we still have matters outstanding as regards a secure future was shown to us by 11 September."
"We must see to it that we press on with security of energy supply by means of the Synergy, Energy, and Altener programmes."
"We must look to research to make resources available for the post-2003 era."
"Training and continuing education will demand enormous effort of us with 'e-learning' and 'e-business'."
"The Trans-European Networks, too, are waiting to be made reality."
"We must also see to it that the European Union becomes more active in the WTO."
"We must ensure that its Parliamentary Assembly takes on a monitoring role as soon as possible, and we need financial resources for those parliamentary delegates from the least developed countries, who at present cannot even afford to travel to its meetings."
"We must engage in training and continuing education there, for these are people we must integrate."
"We have to show them how they too can make the cake as large as it can be."
"of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"(DA) Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I too should like to thank Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck for their work and willingness to cooperate."
"We are particularly delighted that Mr Färm has supported the committee's conclusions."
"Those of us in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are somewhat concerned to see the 2002 budget for our area down by 10% on that for 2001. We believe that the decisions taken in Lisbon with a view to creating the world's most competitive and dynamic economy by 2010, together with what will happen in this sphere in Barcelona at the end of the week, show that this is a high-priority area, and this must be reflected in the budget for 2003."
"We have noted that the Commission has this year attached importance to improving health and safety in the workplace, and we should like to see this too reflected in the budget for 2003."
"With regard to enlargement, it is important for us also to create funds for developing the social dialogue, or cooperation between the two sides of industry, in the candidate countries."
"This too is a high-priority area for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I should particularly like to say something about the agencies."
"We have four agencies, whose work we follow closely in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and we think it important to remember that the agencies are different and should be treated differently."
"They have different needs in terms of budgets."
"Enlargement will also be of significance to how they develop, and the agencies' tasks will change."
"That is something which needs to be considered carefully when we look at the budget for 2003."
"It is important that the agencies should be treated individually and not all lumped together."
"Moreover, we shall call upon other committees to cooperate more closely on how we are to look at the budgets for the agencies."
"Finally, it is our view that we should attach importance to how the individual budget items are used, and there are some areas in which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will monitor carefully whether the Commission is seeing that matters are implemented."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, from the point of view of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the most important aspect of the budget is the codecision issue."
"We need a decision by the Convention to the effect that agricultural policy is to be included in the full codecision procedure, so as to overcome the separation of compulsory and non-compulsory resources."
"We must reach the point where we have full competence as regards the budget, including in agricultural matters."
"When that has been achieved, we would like to be given the option of flexibility in the items in which the resources have not been used up."
"Although that is already what we expect of the 2003 budget, we of course know that we have to reckon with resistance on fundamental decisions."
"We take the view that the law of budgetary discipline has already cut back on the re-use of the compulsory resources or their use for other purposes, so that, if we increase outgoings, we have to have recourse to legislation, whilst the resources left over revert to the countries' Ministers of Finance."
"I can imagine that they would like that, but that can hardly be what Parliament intended."
"Secondly, it is always being said that a lot of money is being spent."
"I favour a thrifty budget, even in the agricultural sphere, but we must again point out that our EUR 20 billion puts us under the 1.27% ceiling."
"It is not advisable for a parliament to financially restrict itself in this way."
"Politics always has to do with money - I mean that in a positive sense - and hence it would be sensible, and, from Parliament's point of view, also in the Commission's interests, not to overdo the austerity policy on these countries."
"Thirdly, there is one point to which I would like to refer."
"You said, Mrs Schreyer, that preparations for enlargement need to be intensified; to date, EUR 30 million, which is hardly anything, has passed through the SAPARD programme framework."
"Here there has been no preparation, and that is highly regrettable."
"Let me again mention the proposal by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which was, however, taken up by the Committee on Budgets, and under which we are this year instigating an INPARD and a LEADER programme, as could have been done last year."
"Our intention with this is to facilitate the induction of the candidate countries into this bottom-up programme, so that they will be able to draw on the resources they need from the previous programmes after they have acceded."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am taking up this position on behalf of the Home Affairs Committee - we may well have the lowest outgoings in terms of the EU's overall expenditure, but, on the other hand, we have, since 11 September, been working in an area that should have a very important role to play."
"It is for this reason that I am very happy that both rapporteurs were very frank and that Mr Färm ended up by accepting our proposals and taking them on board."
"This also shows that, after 11 September, we are dealing with concepts such as the combating and prevention of terrorism in such a way that we are taking this matter very seriously and are making our readiness clear to strengthen our own European authorities in this field such as Europol and Eurojust, and our will to be successful through them in this area."
"My Committee saw as a second important point the theme of enlargement and the important issue of how we deal with borders in the first place."
"This was not just through a desire to reinforce borders."
"Of course, we do not want people to die at them - the Home Affairs Committee is very sensitive in matters concerning the combating of illegal immigration, and looks closely at what is actually achieved in this area and how effective is the form that the measures take."
"On that, there are naturally certain things that we expect of 2003."
"Yet, despite counter-terrorism and police efforts on the one hand and action taken by border guards on the other, there is one thing we do not want to forget under any circumstances, that, in a democracy consisting of 15 states, soon indeed to be 25, in the European Union, we also have an obligation to the people who travel to the European Union and live together with us."
"This has led us to make a number of proposals relating to integration policy."
"I am very grateful to my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets for their willingness to accept these proposals."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address just three issues, three key words, in our debate today on the guidelines for planning the 2003 Budget."
"Issue No 1: enlargement, which will of course play a larger part in 2003's Budget procedure than it has done in previous years."
"Looking closely, though, at how much pre-accession aid can drain away today - and we have heard a certain amount about this in agriculture - there are still things that must be done both by us and by the candidate countries."
"It is not enough to enable them to get the hang of the programmes and the management structures as well, and then require only 3500 posts up to 2008, all of which is described as 'enlargement costs'."
"I wish, though, also to appeal to my fellow Members of this House, and warn against using budgetary sleight-of-hand to take money intended for enlargement under category 8, shove it under category 7 and fund pre-accession aid from it."
"That is not the Commission's doing, but rather an amendment proposed by Members of this House. I would ask them, in that event, to be honest, go home and tell their own Ministers of Finance that we need the Financial Perspective to be revised, and that enlargement is underfunded."
"Using such tricks to try to fund enlargement is something I can only warn against."
"I wish to express my gratitude to the Commission for the position they have taken on this subject, which also expresses the view of the Group of the European People's Party."
"Issue No 2: foreign policy."
"I will keep this very brief, and tell you once and tell you clearly that I am slowly getting steamed up by the fact that a lunch for the European Union's Foreign Ministers costs us on average EUR 100 million."
"That is just not practicable in the long term."
"There is more to come."
"We are now suddenly supposed to take over further activities, whereas the Member States said months ago that they would finance them themselves."
"Let me mention only 'Amber Fox' as a key example."
"Now they are suddenly supposed to be funded by the Community budget, which is utterly extraordinary."
"Let the Council state which of the European Union's activities it can do without, and then funding can be provided on a serious basis."
"Issue No 3: agricultural policy."
"I think we do not need to use the Budget procedure to reinvent agricultural policy, but I do of course expect the Commission to submit its proposals on the Mid-Term Review in good time, so that we are in a position to incorporate whatever is of budgetary value into the framework of the 2003 Budget procedure."
"On that point, let me observe that, as the budgetary authority, our participatory roles in the rural development programmes and in the area of traditional income aid are different and that the Commission should please bear that in mind so that it can go ahead on time."
"Let me conclude by thanking Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck most warmly for their good cooperation."
"I am sure that we will be able, by the end of the year, to present a sound Budget."
"It should not be left to Parliament."
"I hope that it is not left to the Council either."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, let me, of course, start by thanking both our rapporteurs for the work they have done, which is outstanding."
"I would like to take today's debate on the guidelines as an opportunity to pause and do a sort of interim report."
"We have completed the first half of our parliamentary term, and when we recall the tasks that faced us at its outset, what had to be funded by the Budget, what was made available to us and what we allocated to others, we see that the world has, of course, changed a great deal."
"We have to deal with the problems of the world, which are not without their effects on us."
"Europe has closed ranks, and we stand alongside the world."
"We have taken on hitherto unmanageable tasks, and there are yet others for us to take on."
"The field of foreign policy has been mentioned: extensive aid for reconstruction in the Balkans, aid for Afghanistan and for the people persecuted and harassed there, the fight against the global scourge of AIDS, the disarmament measures that we need to reduce not only the number of landmines but also chemical and biological weapons, and also, for example sending a police task force to the Balkans to ensure that peace can enter there."
"The field of home affairs and judicial policy has, of course, see us agree, in the aftermath of the events of 11 September, to strengthen Europol and Eurojust and speed up their introduction; one of the Commission's new proposals is the expansion of civil protection in the event of emergencies."
"In the Convention, we are discussing cross-border structures and future developments."
"In the field of home affairs and judicial policy, we are discussing immigration and how to control it."
"Enlargement has been described as a problem area, and in it we have a number of things to sort out both internally and externally; whilst Mr Ferber says that there are calls to rethink the relationship between Categories 7 and 8, we must also note that, as opposed to the original estimates, on the basis of which we assumed that the first six States could be added as early as 2002, this position has of course changed, and that is something we have to be allowed to discuss."
"We, too, see of course that there is a lack of uptake, and, where too little is taken up, we must not heap up even more."
"Budgeting is not about demanding more; it is about making proper use of the taxpayers' available resources."
"There is a need, though, to take note of realities as well; everyone - including those Members of this House who even want to bake bigger cakes - has described the points we want to discuss together in order not to stage enlargement as a sort of cataclysm with the expectation of dramatic overnight change; rather, we have to prepare ourselves."
"We have to prepare the countries, and part of that involves, of course, our making appropriate provision and discussing it."
"The capacity for taking the right decisions presupposes that we talk about them."
"It is, in my opinion, irresponsible to simply stand up and say, for whatever simplistic reasons, that 'we cannot even think about that'."
"In the last few years, we have had to move reform of the Commission forward, but we also have internal problems that have to be discussed further."
"The combating of unemployment must not be forgotten; it is one of our central tasks, and one in which the cooperation procedure has of course enabled us to make progress already."
"We want to prevent social exclusion."
"We want to promote technological development and, to that end, to make promotional funds available for 'e-learning' and the new technologies."
"These great challenges, which have arisen in recent years, do not find us in a state of fear."
"We face this challenge with a confidence which we want to make visible."
"It is a good thing that this European Union of ours is working together, that we are increasingly trying to present a composite picture to the world we want to work with."
"We are not sitting here or standing up and simply calling for more money."
"We must look closely to find what options we have in this Budget."
"This is, of course, something that any serious housekeeper must do, but we must also highlight the fact that we have other things to do; if they are to work, if, on the one hand, the poor are not to be victims, if we want to help others who endure persecution, then we have to give some thought to how we treat each other."
"This is not a demand for more money on tap; it is about the purposeful use of money."
"We have to look carefully at where our money is being spent."
"Is the best possible use being made of it?"
"If not, then we must redirect it, and apart from that nothing should be declared to be unthinkable."
"It is not more money that we want, but its purposeful use, and we seek the resources that are needed for Europe to continue to develop in the way constantly, and rightly, called for in all their resolutions by members of the European People's Party."
"Mr President, I first wish to thank my Swedish colleagues, Göran Färm and Per Stenmarck, for their excellent reports."
"Strengthening the guidelines for budgetary procedure is the first step in the drafting of next year's budget."
"My group stresses the importance of strict budgetary discipline."
"This means that the budget should not include unnecessary appropriations and that economy should be a feature of financial management."
"Proper budgeting leads to a decrease in payment arrears and promotes the implementation of budgeted programmes."
"In this respect the figures in recent years have been disheartening."
"In the year 2000, EUR 8.5 billion in appropriations were unused, and last year the amount was as much as EUR 12 billion."
"The situation is therefore alarming."
"In no way does this reflect rigorous financial management: it is symptomatic of poor administration."
"The Commission is unable to implement those areas of policy that Parliament has held to be important and for which it has authorised appropriations."
"As a result, areas of policy are implemented unsatisfactorily, while at the same time the arrears - the unpaid commitments - grow."
"There is no such massive degree of underutilisation in the administration of any Member State's budget."
"For that reason our group not only supports budgetary discipline but is also strongly in favour of the Commission's programme of reform."
"This is lent additional weight by the recent so-called new disclosures in the Commission's administration."
"The matter of personal accountability must be clarified and the power of decision-making delegated downwards in the organisation."
"Accountability and result-oriented management are the key words here."
"There are special requirements associated with enlargement."
"The budget for 2003 may be the last one drafted for a Union of 15 Member States."
"In this regard our group also believes that the appropriations connected with enlargement are absolutely crucial."
"I wish the rapporteurs for the budget every success in their future work."
"Mr President, our group can support the guidelines at this stage, but will make a judgement on the overall budget later in the year, depending on the outcome of various policy debates that are of key concern to us."
"Firstly, the EU must be able to welcome new member states in the best possible circumstances, meaning that they must be able to fully benefit from the funds originally earmarked for them at Berlin by switching, if necessary, underspends from accession to pre-accession, depending on the pace of individual countries."
"Secondly, another matter related to enlargement is the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"Instead of getting into a heated debate about whether or not to give the new member states direct payments, would we not do better to concentrate our energies on reforming the common agricultural policy by encouraging integrated rural development schemes and sound environmental working practices suitable not only for the existing Member States but for our applicant countries too?"
"The third area of concern is the funds available in category 4 (external policy)."
"Every year we face new international crises and we want to help solve them."
"We have a duty to help solve them, but if this has to be done year after year without new money, then of course we will run out of money and will have to make difficult decisions such as cutting off aid to one poor area to help another, or spreading our aid so thinly that it does not have the desired effect anywhere."
"Surely this cannot be our aim."
"Also in this respect, we would like to know to what extent countries which receive aid will be encouraged and enabled to tender for contracts in public works and services themselves, so as to give long-term benefits to their economies."
"Mr President, the important area of focus in the draft budget for 2003 is enlargement."
"Our group supports the view that savings from the budgeted enlargement expenditure for 2002 and 2003 can be used to finance enlargement in later years."
"The rapporteurs think the important area of focus is the administrative reform of the Commission."
"We are prepared to allow those Eurocrats who cannot be made fit for work through retraining to retire prematurely."
"A sense of moderation will have to be observed when determining their pension benefits."
"I would also like to draw your attention to how the Commission has managed to get round the staffing ceilings by employing officials whose salaries are paid by Member States."
"There are 800 of them."
"It is our group's opinion that the rapporteurs do not insist forcefully enough on the clearance of the backlog of commitments that have not been forwarded for payment - the so-called RAL."
"From one year to the next, the gap between commitments and payments is allowed to grow."
"That means the Commission may well disregard implementation of the areas of focus specified by Parliament."
"Our group would like to see the Commission include the RAL question in the areas of focus in its preliminary draft and safeguard the implementation of programmes to a greater extent than is now the case, including the implementation of Structural Funds programmes."
"Our group sees immense problems with the margins in Section 4 of the budget."
"There are none."
"That is why the Commission must propose action in next year's draft budget to ensure the implementation of political areas of focus under Section 4."
"While a certain amendment calls for considerable financial support for Afghanistan's neighbouring countries, we should remember that all the former Soviet Republics, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan, are their presidents' dictatorships, where there is no respect for human rights."
"We also have to insist on democracy in those countries that are supposed to be our allies."
"Our group also considers important the reconstruction of the Palestinian areas in the wake of the havoc wreaked by Israel."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, on their work thus far."
"I feel that before us are two sound documents which identify precisely what the budgetary priorities should be for the coming financial year."
"Five political priorities have been identified: enlargement and preparation for enlargement, external assistance, internal security, reform of the institutions and reform of the Commission."
"I feel that we can all agree on these points, particularly in view of the imperative need to provide the Union with adequate financial instruments for it to be able to see its priorities through."
"In fact, to be honest, the growing battle against the Council and the Commission itself is not over which actions we should concentrate more on, namely combating terrorism and the reform of the institutions - which are indisputable priorities; the problem arises when Parliament and the Council have different views on how these actions should be financed, when the Council refuses even to contemplate revising the financial perspective, when we continue to treat the flexibility instrument as an instrument whose use can be planned from year to year."
"Clearly, there is something wrong!"
"In my opinion, this is the principal battle that Parliament will have to fight in the coming months, a battle in which we will have to succeed in presenting a united, fighting front."
"Then at horizontal level - to use a technical term - three particular needs have been identified: the need for further budgetary monitoring at technical and political level, for example by means of budgetary hearings; the need for the Commission to improve its spending capacity and, consequently, implementation considerably, in an attempt to prevent the creation of new RALs at source; lastly - what the rapporteur wanted to point out to the Commission and the Council - the fact that they are bound to consult the European Parliament on all initiatives with significant budgetary impact, particularly in the context of non-compulsory expenditure."
"On all three matters, I feel that the rapporteurs should be able to count on the support of us all."
"Mr President, I note with satisfaction that enlargement is now being given top priority."
"This is not a day too soon."
"After all, if the negotiations run as the European Commission has envisaged, 10 countries will be joining the European Union from 2004 onwards."
"The report by Mr Stenmarck, in particular, excels in terms of its clarity and effectiveness, and can count on our support."
"Mr Färm, too, is right to accord enlargement the prominence that it deserves."
"With regard to his report, I should like to comment on the recommendations pertaining to category 4."
"This section conveys an excessive tendency towards political influence at global level, under the pretext of safeguarding the Union's credibility in the world."
"Is the aid that is now being proposed for Afghanistan more than a fig-leaf for the half-hearted support to the United States, which, together with Great Britain, pulled the chestnuts out of the fire?"
"This is a politically and financially risky operation, for with economic assistance, which Mr Färm advocates, comes political support to the Middle East."
"The Union appears particularly sympathetic towards the Palestinians and not towards the Israeli citizens."
"For a start, the foul methods which Palestinian terrorists use to cause death and destruction are worrying."
"The counter attacks by the Sharon administration, however painful they are, are a response to this."
"Furthermore, there is reason for great concern with regard to the Commission's policy."
"How can the Commission make annual contributions to the Palestinian Authority to the tune of EUR 180 million, while corruption is at its highest?"
"By using racist and anti-Semitic language, the Palestinian schools teach hatred rather than reconciliation."
"How long can the Commission wash its hands of this?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I in turn congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, on their work."
"I also think that these are two good documents that will enable the budgetary procedure to run smoothly and that constitute a good working plan for Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"In particular, I would like to say a few words about the Stenmarck report, first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, and also to express my pleasure in seeing my idea accepted, that of increasing our use of the Internet and making this institution truly transparent by eventually broadcasting our debates, and even debates in our committees, in full on the Internet."
"The Secretary-General, who is present today, is familiar with this document."
"I think this is a step forward that we must follow through."
"Parliament is an institution which, let us say, is a symbol."
"It runs the risk of not being very visible, as, for security reasons, a subject we are very familiar with, access to our work itself is somewhat restricted, although we maintain the principle of public meetings."
"I therefore think it is important to use the Internet."
"However, let us say that I am a little surprised to see an amendment by the PPE-DE, I think, which is the new version of paragraph 15 stating that the administration of Parliament would be held in greater esteem if it were efficient, coherent and politically balanced."
"I find the concept of political balance very interesting as this basically means that employees must be chosen so as to maintain a balance between the groups."
"However, to my knowledge, for the past 20 years or so, the only transfers that have taken place have been between the two main groups and, as a result of this, at least one third of the Members of Parliament did not benefit from this."
"I think that the administration is fine as it is and that it does not need to be rebalanced by means of a system that, in Italy, we call the 'Cencelli' system, which, moreover, worked very well at the time of the last nominations."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the PPE-DE, I think that that is sufficient and that we are balanced enough as we are."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism believes that Parliament, as the budgetary authority, must be regularly informed about the execution underway for structural actions so that the alarm can be raised in terms of the application of the sunset clause."
"With regard to the application of the additionality principle, which is an extremely important issue, the Commission must establish the means for its verification and control on the ground."
"Halfway through the period of application of the funds, the Commission should inform Parliament about the evaluation of its compliance on the basis of objective criteria."
"Furthermore, we ask the Commission, by means of appropriate solutions, to support the idea that the structural allocation should be considered a spending objective."
"In relation to the budget line for the trans-European transport network we note that the level of budgetary implementation over recent years is satisfactory and we recommend giving priority to projects with a clear European added value, stressing the importance of the funding of projects which provide a rebalance between modes of transport."
"We in the European Parliament also urge the Member States to use the Structural Funds while paying more attention to transport infrastructures, in particular intermodal transport and less polluting forms of transport."
"Naturally, in the case of land transport, they must pay particular attention to the railways, from the point of view of respect for the environment."
"Commissioner, at this decisive point for the European Union, prior to enlargement, the Member States, with the support of the Commission, will have to achieve greater efficiency in the application of the Structural Funds with the cooperation of the regions and local groups they are destined for."
"Only in this way will we come closer to the economic and social cohesion which, together with political union, is the great objective of the European institutions and citizens."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Färm, who is a true friend of development."
"I look forward to working closely with him during the course of this year."
"In my contribution I should like to refer to paragraph 26 of the report, which states explicitly to the Commission, on behalf of this Parliament, that we are not satisfied that development aid is sufficiently focused on poverty eradication and that we need to build on the agreed benchmark system."
"Let me explain that for everyone's benefit."
"Two years ago Parliament voted a series of input targets on development aid to ensure that the large amount of spending that takes place through the regional budget lines was actually held to account and to insist that more be focused on social infrastructure, and in particular on basic health and education policies."
"The extent to which the Commission took action in this regard is questionable, particularly as Mrs Schreyer herself issued a so-called reservation, something that this Parliament does not recognise."
"Last year, therefore, when we undertook the same discussions, we had further and more intensive deliberations with both external relations Commissioners, Mr Patten and Mr Nielson, and agreed that a minimum of 35% of EU external assistance would be focused on social infrastructure, and in particular on basic health and education."
"I say to the Commissioner this morning and to this Parliament that we are relying on this being implemented this year within the budget and we will, as we say in this resolution, be looking to build on it next year."
"I would also like to say in relation to paragraph 33 that it is a matter not just of development aid to the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, but also of the funds to Asia, Latin America, the Mediterranean and other regions."
"All of it should be poverty-focused."
"The Commission has brought forward a development policy statement and it is time, through the budget, that it matched its words with deeds."
"Mr President, I would like to join those of my colleagues who have already thanked our two rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, for their very helpful contributions to our debates this morning."
"On the Commission, firstly, I would like to see us having an ongoing monitoring of the budget to follow up the work of our colleague Mr Costa Neves in last year's budget."
"I think this is particularly relevant as we have now changed the way in which the work programme of the Commission is formulated so as to have more input from our specialised committees."
"I fully support that particular point."
"Secondly, I would like to join with what our colleagues and in particular Mr Titley have said so far about foreign affairs expenditure."
"I guess it is the big spenders from the Foreign Affairs Committee who are seeing all these commitments being made and we in the Budgets Committee who are querying where the money is coming from."
"It seems to me that we need a priority-setting, forward-thinking agenda, which is why we are supporting the idea of a study, so that we in the Budgets Committee should have an idea where the money is coming from."
"Lastly, we would like to know if the reform of the institutions has continued."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner when we can expect a final decision on the early retirement scheme."
"Insofar as the Parliament budget is concerned, we support those colleagues who have criticised the Administration for trying to suppress the EP-rom study."
"We need a proper resource management discussion in this Parliament, and, particularly, we would like to see a coherent, effective and politically balanced Administration."
"The reason for that comment, Mr Dell'Alba, was precisely because there had been parachutages."
"There is an imbalance in the Administration and I would like to be sure that the Administration is seen from the outside as being effective and politically balanced."
"Secondly, insofar as the political groups are concerned, to ensure effective control of the Administration, we would like to see them strengthened."
"Lastly, in terms of enlargement, we would like to be sure that in interpretation we have controlled multilingualism; that in translation, we are looking at the aspects of teleworking; and, above all, in the buildings, that we do not take on any commitments to construct new buildings until we know they are absolutely essential."
"Mr President, I add my congratulations to the rapporteurs on the work that has been done but have one criticism to make on the guidelines in general, which is not necessarily the fault of the rapporteurs, but of the committee and the other committees."
"Guidelines should be just that and they should be concise."
"They should not form a volume on the scale of Great Expectations, which is what they invariably turn out to be."
"There are 41 paragraphs in Mr Färm's report, 34 paragraphs in Mr Stenmarck's report and another 38 amendments to vote on later on."
"That is my gripe."
"I would like to make a couple of points on each report."
"The first is on the Färm report."
"The problems highlighted concern categories 4 and 5 and I would like to bring to Members' and Parliament's attention the fact that these issues were raised with the Spanish presidency at the trialogue meeting to try and find some sort of solution."
"On category 4 the Commission has made proposals for a new flexibility instrument for humanitarian aid."
"I said then, and I say again now, that as far as the Council is concerned hell will freeze over before it agrees to a new flexibility instrument."
"What we did propose - and what may be negotiated with the Council - was to use existing humanitarian aid reserves and to find wording, without changing the legislation, to make sure we can use them for the problems we find ourselves with in category 4."
"Regarding category 5: how do we fit everything into the existing ceilings?"
"With great difficulty, unless we make some radical changes."
"The one thing we have asked the Council to do is to try and find an agreement on these two items during the July conciliation procedure."
"Rather than drag them out until the conciliation procedure in November or our second reading in December, it would be beneficial to everyone if we could resolve those two issues, in principle, in July."
"I now turn to Mr Stenmarck's report."
"One part relates to category 5, where the Committee on Budgets has created a working group to look at administration expenditure in all the institutions."
"The reason for doing this was to get some political commitment from the Council to do exactly the same thing or to do it with us."
"That has not yet been forthcoming, but we live in hope."
"For those Members who have seen the comments in our working documents, do not be too fearful of them."
"We are trying to look at things that people would not normally touch, but to at least stimulate some debate."
"Finally, the Stenmarck report touches on what Mr Elles has just mentioned, that is the reference in paragraph 15 to a politically balanced Administration in Parliament."
"Sometimes we vote on things which on reflection we regret."
"To have a comment asking for our Administration to be politically balanced would not give the right signals to the outside world."
"The term 'politically neutral' would be far more acceptable."
"I am one of those people who think that civil servants should be politically neutral."
"They should not wear political colours."
"I also believe that people in the civil service should win promotion because of their ability, not because of their political allegiance."
"A split vote has been asked for on that matter and I would ask all groups to consider carefully how they will vote."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate both rapporteurs."
"I wish them every success."
"I concur with the Commission in terms of the priorities."
"I share the views of others and particularly those of Mr Wynn, who said a moment ago that categories 4 and 5 will cause the greatest difficulties."
"As far as I am concerned, category 4 should not contain any holy cows."
"It must be possible to use money that has been budgeted, and we should not end up in a situation whereby we receive various claims in the course of the year on unused funding that was budgeted for a specific purpose for which it may not be used."
"I would therefore urge the Commission to assess the needs very carefully."
"The same applies to category 5."
"From the most recent trialogue meeting, I understand that there is a shortage of only 48 million."
"Given the total, this is a very small amount."
"I have seen a draft letter in this respect."
"The Commission should check with all institutions whether it is still possible to find an amount of around 48 million that can be saved elsewhere."
"If this is the case, we would remain within the financial perspectives and the flexibility instrument would not be needed for the time being, which means that it can be used in other areas."
"Mr President, it goes without saying that I can support the guidelines in general terms, but I would wish to observe that it is, in my view, to be welcomed that the EU is preparing well for the planned enlargement."
"We must not, though, overlook the fact that the costs of this should not mushroom, as explosive growth in cost would jeopardise Europe's stability and that of the euro."
"This would happen, for example, if enlargement were to increase the burden on the Member States' budgets still further."
"Support should also, of course, be given to agricultural reforms redirecting resources from the market promotion to rural development."
"A particular concern of mine continues to be the reinforcement of small and medium-sized businesses, and so I hope that Amendment No 5, which deals with this, will be adopted by a large majority, so as to prevent the implementation of Basle II having adverse effects on SMEs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, my group would like to congratulate both rapporteurs and vote in favour of their reports."
"As the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Terry Wynn, has said, our group also wants very specific budgetary guidelines and not a shopping list."
"The guidelines are a political message which we send to the Commission and the Council regarding the form we want the budget to take; the more specific the message is, the more chance there is of it being understood."
"For next year, the situation of categories 3, 4 and 5 is very worrying; we have already mentioned it: we are very close to the upper limit and in category 5 we are really above it."
"My group still defends the Berlin financial perspectives, but we accept the strictness of the figures, especially those referring to enlargement."
"Therefore, the Costa Neves report on the 2002 budget proposed real alternatives, in particular an improvement in the quality of budgetary execution both in the Commission and in the Member States, and we want to see results this year."
"Furthermore, we must stress that there is a lack of a genuine spirit of interinstitutional cooperation in the budgetary field."
"The budgetary procedure should not be a game in which some institutions seek to gain power at the expense of others."
"We will not achieve anything that way."
"The financial Regulation or the response to Parliament's demand that the legislative and budgetary procedures be updated are two clear examples of the fact that interinstitutional cooperation is still unsatisfactory."
"We expect a more positive response from the Commission and, in particular, the Council, in those two areas which are so important to our group and to the whole of Parliament."
"I would like to end by mentioning an example of the opposite: the good example of interinstitutional cooperation provided by the funding of the Convention's budget, on which the three institutions have come to an agreement in order to move ahead without conflict."
"Mr President, I suppose that the total absence of the Council must be a mark of respect so that we feel more comfortable during our own debates."
"Mr President, I will focus on the aspects relating to the financial perspectives."
"The 2002 budget has hardly begun to be implemented and we are already preparing for the launch of the 2003 budget and we can see that many of the problems of the last three financial years are reappearing, perhaps even in a more serious form."
"The financial perspectives are even less sufficient for the requirements."
"An exponential increase in activities is expected within a financial framework which has seen hardly any arithmetical growth."
"Ladies and gentlemen, on this issue, the great innovation of the 2003 procedure is that heading 5 - administrative expenses - is also bursting at the seams."
"In 1999, when we negotiated the current interinstitutional agreement, we managed to modify the figures in heading 5, but with perspectives which, as a result of shortsightedness, are now insufficient."
"The general forecasts, including those of the Council, exceed the ceiling of the financial perspectives by EUR 125 million, with the contribution of a growth of 9% for the budget of the Council, which will now ask for cuts, while criticising the bad execution of some policies."
"I would like to avoid cheap demagoguery, amongst other things, because there are no vast numbers of officials in Brussels, where the number of bureaucrats is less than those in the municipal authorities of Berlin, Stockholm or Madrid."
"Heading 4 - external policy - is still inevitably doomed to failure."
"Every year we have forced the flexibility instrument in order to implement external policy."
"Now we are attaching increasing importance to the fight against poverty, which is a great thing, but which is essentially, in the current context, a reflection of the bad conscience of the wealthy Europeans, but we are not implementing external policy."
"And that is an issue of enormous concern to me."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, heading 7 poses a serious problem which is very easy to understand."
"Heading 7 - pre-accession - since 2002 only had to assist the five countries which were not then Members."
"And now, Mr President, we have ten candidate countries which are sharing the money intended for five, without taking account of the fact that Malta and Cyprus, on a whim of the Council, come within heading 4."
"All of this should be reviewed, Mr President."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have been given the opportunity to speak on Section III of the 2003 budget, having monitored the report in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on behalf of my group, that of the European People's Party."
"I therefore want primarily to set out the concerns behind the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's amendments to this report by Mr Färm, whom I will take this opportunity of warmly thanking for his work."
"Today we are not discussing the 2003 budget, but the budget guidelines which express our fundamental thinking, and I am here to present that of my group in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"For a start, we want, in the first instance, resources from Chapters B1-1 to B1-4 to be capable of being carried over individually to the following year."
"In the long term, though, we also want compulsory and non-compulsory resources to be able to be carried over, something that presupposes Parliament's right of codecision in agricultural matters."
"Secondly, we have a further demand with regard to the increase in the flexibility reserves with a view to potential crises and emergencies."
"Thirdly, even though the majority on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted differently on this point, we are opposed to the introduction of the INPARD programme, which will lead only to a further fragmentation of the resources, demand for which on the part of the candidates for accession has been slack."
"A supplementary programme of this sort will, moreover, bring only additional bureaucracy in its train."
"Fourthly, and - for us - most importantly, the 2003 Budget is not to be used to prejudge the mid-term review of Agenda 2000."
"In this report, we do not want agricultural reform right now."
"What we need is a further development of European agricultural policy."
"The resolutions on Agenda 2000 are for us the binding foundation."
"The agricultural budget must not become a quarry for every kind of desirable commodity, but must set forth a reliable agricultural policy option."
"Mr President, 2003 will be a key year in terms of preparation for enlargement."
"Therefore, it is disappointing that the report on the other institutions does not really grasp this challenge and, I believe, has missed an opportunity to build on the reform agenda that Parliament had embarked upon in the last few years."
"I have three main issues I wish to touch briefly on."
"Firstly, I am concerned about the lack of perspective and the narrowness of the focus."
"There is far too much concentration on Parliament, and the other institutions do not appear to merit much comment."
"I understand that the rapporteur did not have an opportunity to visit Luxembourg before the vote in the Committee on Budgets; that might explain the lack of emphasis."
"I hope this is not seen as a negative message by them."
"Secondly, it is imperative that we iron out some of the contradictions and inconsistencies in the report."
"With reference to staffing, the report calls for a politically balanced Administration."
"This is a ludicrous statement and I completely disagree with what Mr Elles said earlier."
"My understanding of the Executive of this and of many other Parliaments across the world is that the Administration is generally neutral."
"I have grave concerns about what has been suggested and the implication that the Administration is not neutral or that it should not be, and I shudder to think of the consequences of this."
"Are we really going to ask the staff to tick a political affiliation box before they are appointed to a new job?"
"Even more fundamentally, this runs in direct contradiction to the emphasis that the Committee on Budgets has put in this report, on the staff appointment or promotion always being based on ability and merit."
"That is the principle I wholeheartedly support."
"Therefore, I would urge the rapporteur to distance himself from such negative statements."
"These sentiments, if carried, will be to the detriment of the standing of Parliament."
"Thirdly, with respect to the freelancing of translation and interpreters, I have no problems with improving efficiency and exploring ways to achieve this, but the statement we have here is an ideological standpoint with no evidence to support the assertion that freelance translation will be more cost-effective and of the quality required to meet Members' needs."
"This also runs in direct contradiction to the emphasis in the report on developing the Podestà report further with regard to the linguistic regime for enlargement."
"Speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group, we are interested in working in cooperation with the rapporteur at the next stage when we get to estimates, to strengthen the report and to achieve consensus in this key budget area."
"However, cooperation is only achievable if it is a two-way process."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate rapporteur Färm on his initial ideas."
"However, as the PPE-DE's shadow rapporteur for fisheries, I do regret that the Group of the Party of European Socialists has not decided to issue a report on the fisheries budget at this stage."
"I should still like to highlight a few salient points which will prove important in future discussions."
"The year 2002 was marked by the failure of the fisheries agreements with Morocco."
"As a result, less than EUR 200 million were set aside for the regions in Spain and Portugal."
"On that basis, it was decided to take 243 vessels out of circulation."
"For the 2003 budget, it is important to find out whether this is actually being done, whether this is being monitored and how the Commission reports to Parliament on that score."
"Why?"
"Because the 2003 fisheries budget will be based on this year's Green Paper and because the discussion about future fisheries policy will be concluded this year."
"It is very likely that the Green Paper will be a painful document, considering the situation of cod fishing in Scotland and the far-reaching implications of that."
"Some form of restructuring will be needed there."
"It is also important to find out how the programme in Spain and Portugal will be implemented in 2003."
"As a second point we also have, when we consider biodiversity, the problems in aquaculture."
"Here too, it will be necessary to examine the budget very closely and to assess to what extent it can be used for this purpose."
"This is also in anticipation of the discussion on the Green Paper and the implementation of existing programmes."
"On that basis, it is important for the Commission to take elements of this kind into consideration, to link the 2003 budget to the Green Paper and particularly to make political choices in that area, also with regard to the budget."
"This will be the PPE-DE's main issue and line of thought."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the two rapporteurs for their hard work."
"I would particularly like to congratulate Mr Färm on the part of the report which concerns internal policies, which includes a clear, explicit reference to policies for the elderly, who represent an increasingly significant proportion of our society."
"The report rightly focuses on both social integration and the importance of ensuring dynamic economic growth."
"However, I would like to draw your attention to and focus on a different matter."
"I refer to Argentina, a country which does not currently appear to be following the path of economic growth that we are but which merits a special effort on our part."
"Argentina's current situation raises disturbing questions regarding the future of the country, a land of immigration which, in the past, has absorbed thousands upon thousands of citizens from all over Europe."
"I feel that, not least in order to prevent the crisis spreading to the neighbouring countries, the European Union needs to give a specific sign of its commitment."
"I have tabled an amendment to that effect together with Mr Naranjo Escobar, which I hope the House will adopt."
"With regard to the Stenmarck report, I would like to thank its author for incorporating so accurately the sense of controlled multilingualism, that is the need to balance the requirement that all the Members should be able to express themselves in their own language with indisputable budgetary requirements."
"Lastly, one more point: there is a phrase which should perhaps be expressed differently."
"I refer to that part which states that the administration must be 'politically balanced'."
"In my opinion, the expression 'politically neutral' would certainly have been much more acceptable."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in view of the initial positions of the Council and the Commission, this budgetary procedure deals with the challenge of being capable of contributing to the historic task of enlargement and funding the reform of the working methods of our institutions."
"The reports by Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck reflect Parliament's concerns and priorities in relation to these issues and I therefore join in congratulating them on their excellent work."
"The budgetary guidelines must be based on elements which are of interest to the citizens: the objective of full employment and the Union's solidarity policies."
"And, before mentioning other aspects, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her expressed commitment for 2003 to fund the last stage of the structuring programme for the fishing fleets."
"The budget for 2003 faces difficulties similar to those of recent years and rather more serious in the field of administrative expenditure."
"Furthermore, the Union's commitments in external aid and the continuous demands of the security and defence policy must receive a budgetary response compatible with the rights of Parliament and the financial framework in force."
"In this respect, we must carefully analyse the Commission's proposal on the creation of a new budgetary mechanism to confront the implications of the crisis."
"In the field of management we may come across difficulties in payments, despite the fact that year after year we have a surplus."
"It is therefore necessary to have detailed knowledge of the final amount resulting from the non-execution of the spending commitments and, likewise, to know the evaluations necessary in the medium term of the multiannual commitments of policies funded by means of heading 3."
"This could provide us with a margin for flexibility in order to more efficiently adapt political priorities to the available resources."
"Finally, I would point out that the citizens have offered an historic example of confidence by accepting the euro without hesitation and they have shown us the way forward."
"The Union's budget must reflect this confidence and contribute to strengthening the policies of the States aimed at full employment, solidarity and economic growth."
"Mr President, I would just like to go over again a number of remarks made in the very interesting discussion on the priorities for the budget year 2003."
"First, the issue of the low take-up of resources in the last two years of the structural policy."
"Mr Puerta had called for the Commission to be constantly giving information about the use to which Structural Fund resources are put."
"Let me again point out that the Commission supplies information on this to the Committee on Budgets and to the Committee on Budgetary Control on a weekly basis."
"The Structural Fund stipulates that the Member States must be reimbursed in respect of the resources provided by them; if the implementation of the Structural Fund in the Member States is held up, we cannot of course carry out the refund."
"It is with regret that we note here that the new Structural Fund programmes have taken longer to implement than the Financial Perspective had originally envisaged."
"I see the consequence of that as being that the next Financial Perspective will require the Council's and Parliament's decisions to be produced earlier in order to guarantee better implementation."
"As regards the issue of bottlenecks in individual categories, I would just like to point out that the European budget for 2002 faces us with a situation which is out of the ordinary and will assuredly not continue in the coming years."
"The fact is that this year we are far, far below what financial planning estimated, to the tune of EUR 4.6 billion below it!"
"None of the Member States comes near matching us on budgetary discipline of that sort."
"Next year, then, we will need more resources for the Structural Fund, as the Member States are demanding that all the programmes should run for longer, something which should actually have been concluded a long time ago, and hence the situation will look rather different."
"It is, despite that, possible to state already that the Agricultural Policy will probably not require all the resources estimated."
"This means that economies are to be reckoned with."
"Budget technique does not, unfortunately, make it possible to use savings in any one sector to fund new foreign policy requirements or the preparation of the institutions for enlargement."
"Such a redirection is not possible, and the only means available to us is the flexibility instrument."
"With reference to enlargement, I would once again like to clarify that what financial planning provided for the financing of new Member States in 2003 was provided exclusively for that purpose."
"We cannot redirect that, and also reject the option of doing so, but we do have the flexibility instrument."
"Let me again point out that, as soon as enlargement is completed, new resources will be allocated to administration."
"It is only for the preparations that they have not been set aside."
"If enlargement is to be successfully handled, though, preparations for it will be of fundamental importance, and they must be made in 2003 by all the institutions - Parliament, the Council, the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Auditors, and by the Commission as well."
"We are not talking here about excessive sums of money, but in terms of amounts that would still leave room in the flexibility reserve for other measures."
"We should subject this instrument to serious testing in this respect."
"It is the citizens of the new Member States, above all, who are entitled to European institutions that are prepared and ready to make a success of enlargement."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:"
"A5-0077/2002 by Mr Turmes and Mr Rapkay on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives 96/92/EC and 98/30/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and natural gas (COM(2001) 125 - C5-0184/2001 - 2001/0077(COD));"
"A5-0074/2002 by Mr Mombaur on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity (COM(2001) 125 - C5-0185/2001 - 2001/0078(COD))."
"Mr President, I assume that the Commissioner with responsibility for these matters is in the building."
"Should we not perhaps wait half a minute until Mrs de Palacio is here to listen to us?"
"Mr Turmes, as you yourself can see, she is not here at the moment, and so I would like to ask Commissioner Schreyer to carry on representing the Commission here until Mrs de Palacio arrives."
"We cannot, though, have a break, as that would disrupt the timetable."
"Mr President, your reminder a moment ago to us to keep strictly to our speaking time leads me to make my fundamental observation and ask all of you in the Bureau to give consideration to how Parliament works."
"The law we are drafting will completely overhaul the market in energy, which is one of the key markets in Europe, one that is worth billions, and we allow each rapporteur to speak for just five minutes - five minutes in which we really cannot make any sensible points."
"That, then, we even have to divide up again between the two rapporteurs, because, strictly speaking, we have only one directive, but its two dossiers mean that there are two rapporteurs."
"The Commissioner, who is just entering the Chamber, will then have the opportunity to say something, provided it is something amusing!"
"There is no doubt about it, I do not begrudge her that, but our having to limit ourselves in political debate in such a way strikes me as positively catastrophic."
"I have just said that we are going to change the structures of the market."
"What we actually have in the European Union is not an internal market; rather, we have 15 submarkets which, in themselves, are more or less open, but which vary widely as to their degree of openness."
"That is still much more the case in the market for gas than in the market for electricity."
"If, though, we want to exploit the efficiency gains of an internal market, then what we need is not the addition of 15 submarkets, but an integrated, common, internal market."
"Efficiency gains to enable business - especially small and medium-sized enterprises - to improve its competitiveness, efficiency gains for consumers in terms of favourable prices, and efficiency gains for the environment, gained through the careful use of resources."
"The open market that we want is not a matter of 'laissez-faire' or of everyone doing as they please."
"We need rules for all the participants in this integrated market, rules that they can make sense of, rules that they can apply in a similar manner."
"We need, then, the access of all market participants to the networks and other system installations to be utterly transparent and free of discrimination, as otherwise distortions of competition will come into being."
"We therefore need a unitary regulatory framework, such as we do not as yet possess, the consequence of that being that we have a divided market and a system that in practice works virtually nowhere, with the possible exception of in one Member State in an island situation; it is not yet working anywhere else."
"We need a regulatory framework that sets objectives, lays down binding standards, and creates machinery and applicability across the board."
"Our problem is now that we have, of course, 15 different Member States, and the structures of these 15 Member States differ widely."
"The overall conditions of a country with 700 or more network operators are quite different from those of a Member State with only one network."
"What matters, though, is that the regulatory framework should have binding effect, with its application being monitored and with sanctions being imposed in the event of non-compliance."
"That is what is at stake, and, that being so, we must correct some of what the Commission originally proposed in its amending directive in order, on the one hand, that the objectives of the different systems in the Member States should be standardised, and, on the other, that their home-grown structures should remain compatible to some small degree."
"How the institutions and authorities in a Member State then guarantee that this happens is a matter for the Member State itself."
"All that is needed is for it to be clear and reliable for all participants in the market."
"So much for what we, as legislators, can actually regulate."
"I want to use the seconds remaining to me just to ask the Commission for something."
"It so happens that we currently have different conditions applying to electricity and gas respectively."
"On the whole, we produce electricity ourselves in the internal market."
"For gas, we are increasingly dependent on imports from third countries."
"I believe that, from the competition and competitiveness angle, we will have the important task of introducing competition among producers."
"I know this is a problematic issue, as the suppliers are generally from outside the EU, but this would be a task on which, as a whole, we would have to work together, as, without supply-side competition of this kind, we will never have more than restricted competition in the European market."
"Mr Rapkay, I share your unease about how much time we have to spend on such an important matter."
"I might take the liberty of pointing out, however, that it is the Conference of Presidents which draws up the agenda and not the Bureau."
"In my experience the great and the good spend much more time on so-called political matters than they do on things which have to do with real life."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to address cross-border trade in electricity."
"As the committee's rapporteur, may I say that the committee supports the Commission's proposal for a regulation."
"Cross-border trading must finally get underway so that producers can supply other Member States, enabling competition to be introduced between existing suppliers across the EU."
"There are five preconditions for this."
"Firstly, the networks which operate the transit flows need to have their costs reimbursed from a fund."
"Secondly, it will only work if the same conditions apply throughout Europe, that is if there is regulation."
"Thirdly, both producers and consumers have to pay into the fund."
"Fourthly, these producer payments need to be standardised in the Member States to avoid any party being at a competitive advantage."
"Fifthly, there must be no internal duties, so no payments by so-called importers and exporters - which are in any case an odd concept in an internal market - and there must be no distance-related tariffs."
"What counts here is physics and not the law."
"I should like to make three concluding comments on this issue."
"The place where the electricity is generated is significant."
"This depends on many factors."
"The committee will no doubt be flexible, even if additional so-called price signals, which meet the criteria that I have mentioned, are developed and applied."
"In Florence, the regulators, the networks and the Commission are of course reflecting on this."
"The committee is not proposing to change the competences in the comitology procedure or in the fora."
"Since this is codecision, however, we propose that the situation be reviewed after four years to ascertain whether the procedure advocated here meets the requirements of codecision."
"After all, the regulators in the Member States and the experts, for example the network operators, should be involved in a regulatory process."
"The regulation should not come into force before the directives which also legislate on changes in the electricity and gas markets."
"This brings me to my second subject."
"Here I should like to make a few comments not in my capacity as rapporteur but as a member of the committee, and specifically, Madam Vice-President, for you to take with you to Barcelona."
"Firstly, the Member of the Council which still only wants partial market opening - and we know exactly which one this is - is in contravention of the Treaties."
"I should like to make this absolutely clear here and it is also in the committee's motion for a resolution."
"These Treaties guarantee all EU citizens the freedom of establishment, the freedom to provide services and the freedom of movement of goods across the EU."
"These freedoms will only be implemented once all electricity and gas consumers are able to select their suppliers from across the EU."
"Only then will we have achieved conformity with the Treaties."
"Secondly, if a Member State wishes to treat all the households in its country equally - for example all those between Lille and the Pyrenees - it may do so; it is free to make that decision."
"However, it can invite tenders for the work and ask which competitor is the most suitable and best qualified for the job."
"A supply monopoly cannot be justified."
"This too violates current law."
"It lends credence to the suspicion that people are lining their pockets illegally."
"Perhaps I might make the following additional points on the reports."
"We support free choice for all consumers across the EU."
"We are in favour of all suppliers having access to the technical networks, which need to be managed in separate companies to prevent discrimination against certain types of supplier and to prevent abuse of dominant position within a company."
"We are in favour of having regulatory systems in the Member States to ensure that this is the case."
"So far - and here I fully agree with my fellow MEP, Mr Rapkay - this has not been satisfactorily resolved in any Member State."
"Like the Council I support a solution which takes account of the heterogeneity of the national network structures."
"Mr President, the Commission's proposals for fully liberalising the internal market in electricity and natural gas in the Member States of the European Union are, in our view, on the right track, which is why the rapporteurs, Mr Turmes, Mr Rapkei and Mr Mombaur, basically endorsed them."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs took the same position and unanimously approved my opinion and my amendments, almost all of which were included by the rapporteurs in their reports, for which I thank them."
"The prevailing view, I think, is that the liberalisation of the internal market in electricity and natural gas is: one, way behind schedule and is being systematically obstructed by monopoly interests on the part of the private sector, the trades union and the national governments, and not just in France; two, that there are huge differences from one country to another."
"For example, Great Britain has fully liberalised, while France is doing exactly the opposite and the same applies, unfortunately, to my own country; three, as a result of the foregoing, there are serious disruptions in the working of the internal market, competition is being distorted and, consequently, prices are being squeezed at the expense of competitiveness both in the energy production sector and between European companies and in the consumer sector and, four, this delay is hampering cross-border transactions on these markets."
"There is no single market, nor do I foresee one in the immediate future."
"The Lisbon objectives of a dynamic and competitive European Union with full employment depend on a competitive internal market in electricity and natural gas."
"And the proposed independent authorities and the abolition of state intervention, which uses pricing policy as a way of exercising social policy will help here somewhat."
"Instead of prices which undercut production costs and block competition, it is better to find other ways of exercising social policy, for example by reducing taxes."
"Finally, any delay in opening up these markets will deter private companies and foreign investment in the energy sector and in the European Union in general and will not therefore increase employment, which is supposed to be the ultimate objective."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market first and foremost studied the comitology procedure."
"This committee was of the opinion that it was preferable to include the annexes in the regulation and the directive so as to create clarity, and to safeguard public access to legislative documents."
"This appears all the more justified since the annexes contain a number of regulations which protect the end user."
"With regard to the gas directive, the great importance of effective and non-discriminatory access to natural gas production markets for all operators in the European energy industry should be underlined."
"By extending the principles of the internal energy market to countries which possess raw materials, producer countries can be developed and the internal market objectives met."
"The gradual and mutual harmonisation of legislation is crucial for the internal energy market to reach completion."
"A common minimum framework of standards must be available by means of which the regulatory bodies of the energy markets can be granted authority and given responsibility."
"In addition, I should like to underline that the sole purpose of gathering information on companies, both at Member State level and at Commission level, is solely to fulfil the tasks prescribed in this regulation and this directive."
"Since this information is partly confidential, restrictions on the distribution of the information obtained are urgently required."
"Finally, I should also like to draw your attention to the fact that the present directive amends a whole host of regulations in the existing directive, and it appears useful to me to seize this opportunity to publish a consolidated version."
"Mr President, the completion of the internal market in electricity and natural gas is a wonderful opportunity for further development in the European Union in terms of the economy, the environment and also society."
"For a long time now it has been clear that the energy issue plays a central role, above and beyond security of supply."
"It is inextricably linked to the fate of our generation and future generations."
"The rapporteurs recognised this and have extended the Commission proposal to make it more forward-looking."
"Slowly but surely, more and more people are realising that the future lies in renewable sources of energy."
"They are the only sources which will guarantee a clean and secure energy supply in the long term."
"That is why we need to lay down some ground rules for these renewable sources of energy."
"The most important point here is that the true cost of supplying all energy is reflected in its price."
"To achieve this, when energy is supplied from traditional nuclear and fossil fuel sources, the external costs for insurance and the subsequent costs in terms of pollutant emissions need to be internalised."
"We need undiscriminatory access to the networks for electricity and also for biogas."
"This is a new concept which has been accepted here for the first time."
"We need fair transmission charges for all sources of energy and in a free market we also need the primary energy sources to be labelled."
"We owe this to our consumers."
"I would even go so far as to say that it is not only bills that should be labelled; energy sources should also be disclosed in the energy supplier's promotional literature."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate our three fellow MEPs, Messrs Turmes, Rapkay and Mombaur on their sterling work."
"What is on today's agenda?"
"On today's agenda is a fresh step for Parliament in the process of total liberalisation."
"And after the successful first opening we have had, it is important to take that second step."
"We would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Commissioner and the Member States to ensure that this is achieved in Barcelona and that we do not try to frustrate the process, as we usually do - and you know which Member State I am referring to."
"As Mr Mombaur has already indicated the principal arguments, I will not elaborate on these any further."
"So what are the key points?"
"Firstly, we must ensure that a level playing field is established. In other words, we must remove obstacles and ensure that everyone is given equal opportunities."
"Secondly, we need to ensure that the role of the supervisors is framed in such a manner that we ultimately work towards a single European market."
"This is why Amendments Nos 53 and 130 to Article 6(1) of the directive are of prime importance."
"My group is keen to see these amendments adopted, because we can thereby ensure that we work towards this single European market."
"The third key point is that we can allow competition actually to take place, thus ensuring transparency and non-discrimination."
"After all, we have seen that the instrument of reciprocity does not work."
"The consumer must have free choice."
"My final point is this: it is of great strategic importance for us to start with an assemblage of information."
"We are keen to support the amendment that is now before us by Mr Westendorp, among others."
"We have nothing against the Mombaur report, but we struggle all the more with the report by Mr Turmes."
"Allow me to say at this stage that the PPE-DE Group will request a split vote for Amendment No 69 and will withdraw Amendment No 181, so that there will be no question of negotiated third-party access."
"For the rest, we have great difficulty with the Turmes report."
"In our view, it contains too many rules, too great an administrative burden and too little respect for the market economy."
"We also believe it is not right for responsibility to lie with industry and not with the supervisors or national States."
"I should like to note that liberalisation is not promoted in this way, but that new obstacles are raised, so that it is difficult for liberalisation to get off the ground."
"And this could never be the intention."
"Needless to say, we must carefully consider the environmental aspects."
"However, we should bear in mind that with regard to combined heat and power production and telecommunications, we can regulate many of the points on this topic in other directives too."
"We would therefore urge Mr Turmes to withdraw amendments in this area."
"Mr President, I too should like to thank the rapporteurs very much for all of their preparatory work."
"In my opinion, the debate or discussion about these directives and regulations has been a good example of how together we can get to grips with a complicated issue at least enough to know where we concur and where our views differ."
"Incidentally, I should like to recall that at the end of the eighties, when the Commission published its White Paper on the internal market, energy was not even mentioned, which shows that we are dealing with an extremely complicated matter here."
"At the time there were many who said, hands off, that is far too complicated, we in the electricity and gas industry understand this much better, let us deal with it."
"We chose another route and I believe that competition is indeed the right way forward."
"I am also in favour of our establishing unrestricted competition."
"Incidentally, if we did not do this, in the end the European Court of Justice would probably force us to change the way we do certain things, for example to recognise that the customer is the domestic customer and not a customer defined by us."
"You see the Treaty always carries more weight than any Parliament resolution."
"I should, however, also like to advocate that we not only deregulate, but also regulate."
"What we are doing here is actually regulated deregulation, if I am allowed to say that."
"But that is precisely what it is."
"We are not only opening up the market in gas and electricity, we are also setting the conditions - the environmental and social conditions - under which this will take place, or we are leaving it up to the Member States to do so by enacting their own regulations."
"I believe that these are two sides of the same coin."
"This is perhaps where we differ, Mr van Velzen, in our assessment of these directives. Neither do I regard this as complicating the process;"
"I think it is part of it. We need a market and we need regulated competition, but energy is also something to which the public has a right."
"Security of supply must be established and the environmental conditions must be set."
"This is an integral part of this directive."
"The opening up of the energy markets is also a fundamental prerequisite for the functioning of the Kyoto Protocol."
"Without competition and without an open market, we will not be able to have emissions trading in Europe."
"This is part of the Kyoto Protocol, which, after all, almost all of us wish to ratify."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all the Member States have decided to create a large market for electricity and gas."
"It is a good choice, but the problem lies in a single question: 'How are we going to create this market?'"
"The aim of the Commission's new directive is regulated competition."
"The main assessment criterion we should use is whether or not there is a balance between competition and regulation, that is, whether or not the fundamental rights to a public service, environmental quality and security of supply are taken into consideration."
"The goals of many of my fellow Members in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy remain within the proposals made by the Commission."
"Their sole objective is to speed up liberalisation and create a level playing field."
"Others have tried to pave the way for a regulation of general interest."
"Claude Turmes and Bernhard Rapkay have carried out significant work to this end."
"At the end of the day, however, there is an imbalance between the choice of effective competition and the requirements of society."
"This imbalance is unacceptable."
"That is the raison d'être of our strategic Amendment No 177 which aims to oblige the Member States to fulfil both their obligations regarding competition and increased, more effective obligations of general interest."
"We do not agree with the attitude of the French State which opposes the opening up of its domestic market while the French public operator is buying market shares elsewhere."
"However, the compromise it is asking for today, which consists of establishing freedom for non-domestic customers to choose their supplier, while being able to retain a reserved sector for domestic customers, is a good one, in particular if this means equal tariffs throughout national territory."
"Those in favour of the market have not presented any economic argument to justify the obligation to open the market to small customers at all costs, even though this could result in additional inconvenience and cost rather than freedom."
"Common sense would dictate that a principle of diversity be respected."
"With regard to the obligation on competition, strong pressure is being exerted in countries like France or Germany, where the traditional operators are powerful and well-established."
"The requirement for transparency is justified, as is the requirement to set up an independent regulatory body."
"However, ownership unbundling, or the separation of transport and distribution, amongst others, threatens to destroy effective groups."
"Making room for new players in the renewable energies market is justified."
"Attacking the nuclear industry and the national assets of our neighbours is not."
"I also find it shocking that certain advocates of competition are opposed to Community legislation in the field of market access."
"The TPA negotiated actually represents the closure of the German market."
"Others are demanding reciprocal market access, even though this contradicts the very notion of the large market and stirs up ill-feeling."
"On the contrary, we believe that the European Union, that is to say the Commission, the Council, Parliament, organised European civil society, must take on tasks of general interest and regulation duties."
"Otherwise simple competition would be dogged by increasing national conflict."
"Mr President, at the outset I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs for their tremendous work on this very important piece of legislation."
"Completion of the internal market in electricity and gas is something which will impact on each and every one of the 370 million consumers right across the European Union."
"As co-legislators in this area, we have a great responsibility to get things right and to ensure that the end result is one which brings about a fair deal for all."
"From an Irish perspective, I can inform colleagues that work is well under way to achieve this aim."
"Formal opening of the Irish electricity market has exceeded the requirements of Directive 96/62/EC."
"In fact, the Irish national authorities are already putting in place a model of market opening which has much to recommend it, separating as it does operation from ownership of the assets."
"This model effectively separates ownership interests from planning decisions, which helps overall efficiency."
"It may not be the model which suits every Member State, but it has clear advantages in a small state where certain economies of scale are required in order to deliver the lowest cost and the most efficient production to end-users."
"In conclusion, I believe that efficient, cheap and sustainable energy production is a key element in achieving our goal."
"The rapporteurs in the committee have done us proud in dealing with this complex and technical issue in a comprehensive and balanced manner and in working to a very demanding timetable in order to complete this very important dossier."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the good work carried out by the rapporteurs should enable Parliament to adopt a favourable position on the laborious attempt to achieve full liberalisation of the energy market in Europe, in the interest of businesses and consumers."
"In the very brief amount of time available to me, I would like to confirm our support for the more stringent measures proposed by the Commission - Article 86 of the Treaty - and push for a majority vote."
"There are countries such as France, which have a genuine conflict of interests in this sector."
"The French Government owns EDF so it has every reason to want to maintain the asymmetries in the market which allow EDF to go and take over market segments elsewhere, exploiting its monopoly position and the closed nature of the internal market."
"That is why I feel that we must go all the way and push for a majority vote at Barcelona too."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, first may I express my regret at the delays in working on this portfolio last year because the Commission declined to accept our advice of splitting the proposals into two separate proposals for gas and electricity. I also regret that the timetable has now been compressed from May to March because of the Council's desire to have this proposal before it at Barcelona."
"I hope this will not be a case of 'legislate in haste and repent at leisure'."
"We strongly support the aims of the directive and the regulation."
"The present situation is a flawed and inequitable market."
"French and German utilities are able to buy UK power companies, yet it is impossible to have reciprocal opportunities to buy into EDF or acquire whole companies."
"The German market is almost as difficult to enter, despite so-called full competition."
"This must change."
"I recognise that the step-by-step approach is a realistic one: first all non-domestic consumers then domestic later, as a progressive opening, is a more orderly process."
"I have to regret that one rapporteur has chosen to introduce too much detail in amendments and tried to over-elaborate some of the measures, for example, the question of the detail demanded on energy bills."
"This is an unnecessary amount of detail."
"Finally, I would like to commend the proposed amendments on establishing a committee of European energy regulators so as to improve cooperation and coordination in implementing the regulation on cross-border trading."
"Mr President, my thanks go to the rapporteurs: you have completed an enormous task."
"Although the Union was established as a single market, this market only functions in part."
"Many Member States have actually become expert at protecting their markets, monopolies and cartels."
"The Nordic countries have liberalised both the electricity and the telecommunications markets, and the consumer has benefited: prices are low."
"The large Member States, in particular, often pay little heed to jointly agreed rules, and the insistence on unanimity with regard to decisions is a shield behind which they withdraw."
"As the Commission has neither the authority nor the courage to intervene when there is malpractice, the market does not work."
"The situation harms solidarity and must end."
"Some, then, are for liberalisation while others are for maintaining the status quo."
"It is true we might ask whether market liberalism is justified from the point of view of public service obligations."
"However, we need common rules, which should also be monitored."
"The same lack of solidarity has prevailed in the telecommunications sector."
"Cross-border transmission tariffs and overload control are important matters."
"Only actual costs should apply for access to the network, and then competition is possible and the consumer benefits."
"My group is satisfied with the basic approach outlined in Mr Mombaur's report."
"Nevertheless, the Commission's scope for monitoring is not made sufficiently clear, and this awkward and unfair situation is likely to continue."
"We clearly highlighted this in the end in the framework legislation for the telecommunications sector, and it will benefit consumers in Europe."
"The Union must therefore be reformed in such a way that Member States cannot at the same time both prevent competition and muscle in on the situation in other countries, buying up local energy companies."
"Commissioner, I should like to bring three points to your attention."
"Firstly, electricity and gas are two different products."
"By lumping them together in one report, an artificial attempt is made to treat them in the same way, and the specific differences between these products are not sufficiently emphasised."
"Secondly, it is vital for long-term contracts for gas transport to be safeguarded, given the increase in demand for gas, partly as a result of the planned closure of nuclear plants, and given that important investments, for example in piping, which are indispensable to the EU's gas supply, are necessary."
"The gas supply is literally at stake here."
"Thirdly, the legislation put to the vote is diametrically opposed to the wish by industry to cut down on red-tape."
"Too many new obligations are being imposed."
"Second reading might provide an opportunity to change this."
"Mr President, underlying this report is the decision to liberalise the internal energy market through the privatisation of the public electricity and gas sectors that still exist in the European Union."
"Failing to heed negative experiences of similar processes, as in the case of California, for example, the report insists on the need to open up and liberalise these strategic sectors, and to make them more competitive in order to satisfy the interests of various economic groups, even with the knowledge that they are thereby endangering fundamental aspects of a universal public service: the right to the supply of high-quality energy at a reasonable price and the commitment to develop alternative and renewable forms of energy."
"Although these reports express some concern about universal access, minimum environmental rules, information and guaranteeing consumer choice and security of supply in every country, the fact is that taking the route towards the liberalisation and total opening up of the market will undermine these concerns."
"Consequently, we have, of course, voted against the report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as early as March 2000 the Lisbon Council advocated liberalisation of the gas and electricity sectors."
"The Commission tabled a comprehensive proposal to make this desire a reality."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy enriched this proposal by including other relevant points, stressing the need for greater emphasis on renewable sources of energy and the right of all suppliers to have unrestricted access to the network."
"The Committee also beefs up the role of the independent regulatory authorities and counters possible distortions of competition with provisions on ownership unbundling."
"I am in favour of these measures."
"I should particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 43 to the report."
"Here electricity providers are required to disclose to the final consumer the composition of the energy mix supplied in the bill and in advertising materials."
"This minimum information makes an essential contribution to creating transparency and provides a basis on which consumers can exercise their necessary freedom of choice in the completed internal market."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Europe, we have been working on the liberalisation of the energy market for some 15 years now."
"And directives in this respect were adopted as early as 1994 and 1995, but there are still Member States that keep their markets sealed from new suppliers, France naturally taking the crown, despite the fact that the Sun King has been long dead and buried."
"Transparent and non-discriminatory access to networks is necessary to break monopolies."
"In order to achieve this, it is sometimes necessary to take measures that do not appear liberal, such as prescribing fixed rates for transmissions for all users and producers, for this is absolutely vital to grant newcomers access to the market."
"I therefore hope that the Council in Barcelona will at long last take decisive action and will take liberalisation seriously, for it already agreed in Lisbon that Europe should become the world's most dynamic, competitive and knowledge-based economy."
"In order for this to happen, the liberalisation of energy is vital."
"Mr President, today we have to vote on speeding up the liberalisation of the energy sector."
"Following in the footsteps of air transport, telecommunications, rail transport and postal services, it is now the turn of the energy sector to suffer market dictatorship in the form of total openness to competition, in 2003 for electricity and 2004 for gas."
"All things considered, however, we cannot say that the opening up of public enterprise capital has been conclusive."
"The anticipated increase in productivity did not take place."
"For the user, the dismantling of public services has led to reduced security and quality of service and prices have risen by 30% for gas and 5% for electricity."
"As far as the workers are concerned, we have seen significant job losses: 300 000 have already been lost in this sector in Europe."
"The public have experienced increased inequality."
"Only a handful of shareholders and investors have benefited from deregulation."
"Today, however, we must promote a new energy policy; now, more than ever before, we must coordinate public services at European level."
"Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, liberalisation must bring benefits."
"I was pleased to see that the rapporteurs identified this as a key point."
"In our view, it is important that the benefits are not offset by new taxes and that we create a system which guarantees a sustainable and secure energy supply, in terms of both the environment and business management."
"Just as I will decide this lunchtime whether to eat a schnitzel or a salad, thus determining the energy supply for my personal energy balance, in the future I also want to take advantage of the free movement of goods to be able to decide whether to have solar power or hydroelectric power."
"But perhaps it will not only be a choice between one or the other; it would be nice if I could say, in the future I want to be able to use 50% solar power and 50% hydroelectric power in my private house or in my company."
"Here I attach the utmost importance to there being no cross-subsidisation."
"In particular, for instance, we do not want the final disposal of nuclear waste to be cross-subsidised from other sectors."
"We also want a universal service and compliance with public service and environmental obligations; this will of course be achieved through public calls for tender, so that good service is guaranteed and efficiency is central."
"An external certified body should be responsible for assessing quality in the electricity sector."
"In the future, you see, we also want renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy-saving measures to be focal points."
"In the future, there must not be any discrimination in the network price on the basis of quantity of electricity or method of generation."
"Nor should cross-subsidisation of any kind be admissible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are going to vote on three reports by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy which are crucial to the forthcoming Barcelona Summit."
"They are essential to compliance with the Lisbon objectives if we really want to build the most competitive economy in the world, and they are also essential to the liberalisation of the internal market."
"To sum up, they are of benefit to the consumers."
"It has been a complex subject. We have had to separate two directives - the one on gas and the one on electricity - and we have had to do a lot of work very quickly."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Turmes, Mr Rapkay and Mr Mombaur, because they have done a lot of very good work and have done so in record time."
"Because of the complexity of the subject, there have been attempts to postpone the vote which is going to take place tomorrow."
"As Chairman, I have done everything in my power so that we may vote on them before Barcelona."
"The credibility of the European Parliament was at stake and we did not want the European Parliament to be an easy pretext for possible failure."
"It is a crucial test for Barcelona and the European Parliament has been a match for the circumstances."
"Of course, we agree with the Members - in particular the French - on the desire to combine liberalisation with the need to maintain an efficient public service and I believe that all our work must follow that approach."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is not sufficient to privatise or liberalise unless we prevent possible dominant positions which significantly distort competition."
"If public monopolies are turned into private oligopolies, we will have achieved little."
"Therefore, it is essential not only to legally separate transmission from transport, but furthermore to make each one totally independent."
"That is the aim of my amendment."
"Mr President, the purpose of the amendments under consideration is to liberalise the market across the board, including distribution, including down to the final user."
"The stated aim is to encourage business activities in a sector which until recently, because it was under state control, was closed to the private sector."
"The transmission systems are, to all intents and purposes, administered by government agencies which only have to break even, while the private companies which use them will pitch their prices so that they can reap the maximum possible profit."
"This is just one example of the favours being done to the private sector. In Greece, the Public Power Corporation is forced to buy electricity at a loss from private companies, just so that they can enter the market."
"Liberalisation ignores social requirements, such as supplying electricity to islands and other inaccessible areas, and is causing obvious difficulties with long-term planning."
"The argument that prices are falling does not stand up, given that the fully liberalised markets in Germany and the United Kingdom charge consistently higher prices than the partially liberalised Greek market."
"The fact that the amendments increase the intervention of the European Commission is also a very serious matter."
"To sum up, the only ones who stand to gain from the new arrangements are the large monopolies, which will penetrate the markets still further, with the help of the regulation on cross-border transactions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that mention must be made of the good work carried out in preparation for this debate, especially in view of the decisions to be taken later on by the Council and the Commission, as well as Parliament's future input."
"We have witnessed the shattering of an illusion: the State, which, motivated by social ideals, should have achieved adequate regulation of basic services, has almost completely failed in its duty."
"The ideals of fairness, asceticism and non-profit making have fallen, unable to contend with such a weak market: this has led to abuse, an increase in wastage, privileges, bureaucracy and inequality and, at the same time, falling profits."
"As a result, we are turning back rapidly - it is to be hoped - to competition, to the market, to the prevailing interest of the consumer and also to the profit-making of private enterprise, which is no longer seen as a negative thing."
"Of course, some last strongholds remain: monopolies, oligopolies, dominating positions - as the previous speaker mentioned - and also the market, which has been controlled to a great extent by cartels on many occasions and continues to be so now."
"There are examples of this in Italy: we have two great structures, excessive, unjustified strongholds - ENEL and ENI - which have played a highly egotistical and, in some cases, parasitical role."
"We need to take appropriate action, not least to establish a direct relationship as regards both energy supply and the management thereof, with monitoring of transfers and measures and of the effectiveness of the product sold."
"I feel that this should be the subject of forthcoming European Union action."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the energy sector is not like other sectors, and that is why the discussion cannot be restricted to the question of opening up to competition and the associated timetable."
"Security of supply, territorial cohesion, network and interconnection development, plant renovation and public service obligations are all essential aspects that involve long-term investment without immediate profitability but which must be guaranteed, if we are to avoid replicating the California crisis."
"This sector must therefore be closely monitored and a balance maintained between market mechanisms and other imperatives and factors in market organisation."
"Some Members here advocate opening up to competition."
"However, when we look at the situation in the various countries, we see that the legislative framework is one thing and the reality of opening is another."
"Germany, for example, is in theory 100% open, but less than 3% of its electricity is imported."
"Perhaps it would be better to allow for opening to take place more slowly in order to be able to fulfil our commitments."
"From this perspective, the date of 1 January 2003 put forward by the Commission for opening with regard to all non-domestic customers is unrealistic and does not even allow time for countries to adopt transposing legislation, where necessary."
"That is why the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has suggested a period of 24 months after adoption of the directive."
"In addition to this, along the lines of Amendment No 177 which Mr Herzog has already mentioned, we have asked that the other factors in the organisation of the sector, public service obligation, security of supply, promotion of renewable energy sources, safety of installations and environmental protection be guaranteed operational at the time of opening."
"Lastly, with regard to domestic customers, households, we must take account of the fact that in some countries, equal tariffs are a key element of public services."
"Whether the customer lives in the country, in an isolated valley or in a town, they are charged the same price per kW/hour."
"This is considered part of equal access to public services."
"That is why we propose that those Member States who so wish be allowed to retain a sector which is not open to competition so that equal tariffs remain possible and equal access to public energy services continues to be a reality in our countries."
"I hope that the Council will take this into consideration."
"Mr President, a French-owned company is able to sell electricity to the British Prime Minister."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner when we are likely to see a situation when an English-owned company will be able to sell electricity to the French Prime Minister."
"Until that situation is reached, the idea of an internal market in energy is a political mirage."
"There has been a lot of comment about the pressure under which this debate is taking place."
"When the Commission's proposals first came out, it was the view of the British Government that they could be accepted as they stood."
"We have managed to bring in hundreds of amendments, which says a lot for the fertile imagination of Parliament."
"We make a bit of a rod for our own backs at times."
"By trying to bring in issues such as energy efficiency, renewable energy and social issues we complicate the matter further, these are better left for other types of legislation."
"I should like to make two points."
"On independent regulation, we regard this as essential if an internal market is to develop, because it provides the predictability and stability which consumers and new entrants need; but it should be for the Member State to reflect the different structures of national markets."
"On the question of third-party access to infrastructure, market entrants need to know that they can access infrastructure on the same terms as those that already exist."
"And they should be approved by the national regulator, rather than be the subject of one-sided negotiations between a monopoly infrastructure operator and a potential user."
"Mr President, reading the newspapers one would think that the European Council in Barcelona is going to settle every detail of this legislation."
"The press suggests that Barcelona will determine whether energy liberalisation takes place at all or not, and yet I do not see Mr Blair, Mr Aznar or other prime ministers here."
"This is an important point: the liberalisation of the energy sector, one of the last components of the single market yet to be subject to single-market disciplines, is a legislative process."
"We must assert our fundamental role in that legislative process."
"This legislation will go through to second reading well after the political pyrotechnics of Barcelona are long forgotten."
"It is essential, therefore, that at first reading we establish the principles of the legislation so that at second reading we can indeed push through a proper liberalising energy package."
"Mr Chichester referred earlier to the need to get the details right."
"He is absolutely correct."
"In that spirit I have two specific questions for the EPP-ED Group, which has been keen to promote itself as the liberal voice on this issue and yet, I fear, may be voting quite differently tomorrow."
"Firstly, will the EPP-ED Group support the amendment adopted in committee to make sure that nuclear decommissioning funds cannot be used as a cross-subsidy for electricity operators?"
"If not, it should explain why not, because of the risk of destroying the level playing field."
"Secondly, will it withdraw its own amendments, passed in committee, which insist on negotiated access?"
"If those amendments are retained the package will be severely undermined."
"I look forward to working with you in the vote tomorrow."
"This has been an excellent cross-party endeavour and on behalf of the ELDR Group I wholeheartedly support the result."
"Mr President, as usual, very sincerely meant congratulations to the three rapporteurs involved in this package."
"Liberalisation of gas and electricity is certainly part of the Lisbon Process, but this does not mean a free-for-all in the electricity and gas markets."
"Our concern must be for those we represent: customers both commercial and - the majority of us - domestic."
"We want the lowest prices possible for them in line with choice, and for choice you need information, including labelling about the source of electricity."
"You need reliability and no discrimination; you need help, particularly at domestic level, for energy efficiency measures; and you need strong emphasis on public service obligations."
"And I would like to emphasise that research and development should be a public service obligation, because in a free market research is one of the areas that is most at risk."
"We have amendments on subjects such as renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, and combined heat and power."
"This is relevant."
"We must have joined-up thinking, and there must be references in this directive to those areas which may be covered by other directives but which must also be mentioned here."
"We want joined-up thinking, and we expect confirmation from the Commission that those measures, as important as these directives, will be part of the programme in the immediate future."
"We hope, therefore, for some limited success at Barcelona to take forward in a responsible way not a free-for-all, but a controlled competitive market."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to say that I believe that the full realisation of the internal energy market is the most important economic measure to be dealt with at the Barcelona European Council."
"Therefore the vote on these reports in Parliament seems to me to be extremely timely and I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Westendorp, for the efforts he has made to make this possible."
"Secondly, I would like to point out our intended objectives with these reports."
"As Mr Linkohr has said quite rightly, this is something which may sound rather contradictory: a regulated deregulation, a regulated liberalisation, which is largely what makes up the European liberalisation model."
"This objective is based on providing the European economy with all the elements of a market, while guaranteeing our citizens a series of rights which we consider to be basic within the model of society, the balances, solidarities and cohesion we want to create."
"It is therefore a question of offering freedom of choice to industrial and commercial clients on specific dates, namely 2003 and 2004, respectively, for electricity and for gas and, for domestic users, from 2005."
"Consumers and producers must be able to access transport and distribution networks without discrimination and, to this end, the proposal provides for systems of transport and distribution which are separate - from a legal point of view - from the production and supply of gas and electricity."
"Charges for access to the network which are set, published and approved by the competent national regulatory authority."
"Each of the States of the Union will create an independent regulatory authority with a common minimum level of competences."
"The proposed regulation on the conditions for access to the network for the cross-border trade in electricity is intended to promote cross-border trade and overcome an unacceptable situation, as indicated by several speakers and the rapporteur, Mr Mombaur, which is that there are 15 different electricity markets."
"Therefore, it is a question of achieving the true objective of this proposal which, as pointed out by Mr Rapkay, is simply a European electricity and gas market."
"There is another series of necessary measures created specifically in response to the requests of the Stockholm European Council."
"Amongst them, the first report on the creation of the internal market in gas and electricity which clearly indicated the distortions caused by the differing degrees of openness and the differences between the structural measures adopted."
"In December 2001, the Commission also published a Communication on energy infrastructures which identifies the priority proposals and intends for the Member States to achieve an electrical interconnection equivalent to the minimum between now and 2005, that is to say, 10% of the capacity of installed production."
"With the aim of guaranteeing greater protection of the environment, the Commission will present two additional directives during this year and, in this respect, I would say to Mrs McNally that, before the end of the year, I hope to present a directive on behalf of the Commission intended to promote cogeneration and at the same time prevent certain fraudulent uses which we all know about and which in the end lead to greater expense and wastage of electricity."
"As I have said, this directive will promote suitable cogeneration within the European Union."
"Secondly, I also wish to present a framework directive on the energy efficiency of equipment and apparatus installed in all buildings, which supplements the directive on the energy efficiency of buildings."
"Mr President, I believe that, together with the directive on the promotion of electricity generated from renewable energy sources, the proposal on energy efficiency in buildings, the political commitment to guarantee the environmental aspects of our energy consumption, and the proposal on biofuels, we are making a real effort to combine the rules for the creation of the internal markets in energy and to improve their operation with the improvement in energy efficiency and the environmental aspects of energy in Europe."
"With regard to the directive and the Regulation we have presented, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Turmes and Mr Rapkay on their work as rapporteurs, which has been carried out rigorously and seriously, although we cannot accept certain specific aspects of certain amendments."
"However, in general we all agree with the spirit and objectives in terms of making these modifications to the current directives in force."
"I am pleased that Parliament - and specifically the two rapporteurs - is taking the approach contained in the Commission proposal, particularly with regard to the dates for opening up the market, the separation of the operators of the networks and the competences of the regulatory authorities, which are crucial elements in terms of the correct operation of the system."
"In general terms, the Commission is in favour of the amendments that have been tabled, the majority of which are acceptable, either totally - with some changes to their wording - or partially."
"I am not only talking about the amendments which improve the situation of consumers and the amendments relating to a better definition of the public service aspects (always taking account of subsidiarity aspects, of course), but also the amendments which formalise cooperation between regulatory bodies and those relating to the competences of the regulatory authorities."
"The Commission, however, has certain reservations with regard to the amendments relating to non-discriminatory access to the network, which is essential to guaranteeing fair competition in the gas and electricity sectors."
"We therefore propose certain measures in this context: to legally separate the operators of the networks - an approach accepted by Parliament - and to establish access to the network on the basis of previously published charges, thereby replacing access on a negotiated basis."
"I would like to thank Mr van Velzen who is going to withdraw the amendments relating to negotiated access, because I believe that is going to clarify the debate a lot and help us to reach a final agreement."
"Nor can the Commission accept the amendment dividing the proposal into two different texts for electricity and gas, bearing in mind the growing interdependence between the two markets and the fact that the majority of new electricity production will be based on production which uses gas as a fuel."
"The Commission believes that the amendment relating to the funds for dismantling the nuclear sector is of the greatest importance."
"The Commission is aware of the importance of guaranteeing availability of the funds at all times for future dismantling activities, not only for the purposes of the internal energy market, but also to ensure that those funds are specifically destined for those activities."
"These funds have a specific and perfectly stipulated objective, which must be respected at all costs."
"Therefore, and with a view to dealing with this issue appropriately, the Commission is committed to presenting a proposal in the coming months, before the conclusion of the negotiation of this directive and this Regulation in Parliament."
"This issue is closely related to the system of guarantees and securities in the field of the use and handling of nuclear energy."
"We must be extremely rigorous in terms of the availability of these funds, within the corresponding framework, and we are studying the best legal formula for producing a proposal in this regard."
"With regard to the Regulation, I would like to congratulate Mr Mombaur on his wonderful work."
"The Commission can support the majority of the amendments proposed, some with slight modifications."
"This is the case, for example, with the amendments which propose the creation of a consultative group of national regulatory authorities, and those which propose the establishment of specific rules for the so-called national interconnectors."
"Next I will mention the amendments which we find difficult to accept."
"Amendment No 19, for example, which proposes that the procedure of the Regulation Committee laid down in the Regulation should only be applicable for four years and that, after this period, Parliament and the Council should once again study the issue on the basis of the Commission proposal."
"I know that Parliament has considered this distinction clause in the context of the regulations on financial services and of the Lamfalussy report, but President Prodi, on 5 February, in his statement to this House, clearly said that that case could not set a precedent."
"Nevertheless, I can assure you that, in accordance with the agreement of the European Parliament and the Commission on the methods for applying comitology, the Commission will put all its efforts into ensuring the greatest possible transparency in it relations with Parliament in the context of the procedure laid down in the Regulation on access to the network for the cross-border trade in electricity."
"Amendments Nos 5, 6, 7, 16, 20, 22, 23, 24 and 25 seek to remove all the references in the Regulation to the regulatory authorities of the Member States, and suggest a more neutral expression such as 'competent authority'."
"I do not believe these amendments to be appropriate since the Commission's policy in this field is based on the principle that all States must designate one or several regulatory authorities, which are intended to play an essential role in the context of the implementation of the Regulation."
"Furthermore, accepting these amendments could be considered to be in contradiction with the creation of a consultative body made up of national regulatory authorities proposed in a series of amendments by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and supported by the Commission."
"However, the formula proposed by the Commission leaves an appropriate margin for subsidiarity so that each State can find the most suitable formula."
"The amendments relating to the treatment to be given to integrated generation in national charging systems are not acceptable either."
"This type of generation must be dealt with appropriately within the national charging systems, in accordance with the principles of non-discrimination and reflecting costs which appear in the Regulation, and, with regard to the most important case in practice, the electricity produced from renewable energy sources, and with the directive on it."
"It is not therefore appropriate to exempt integrated generators from the payment of certain charges in a general way, rather than by case-by-case treatment."
"There are three amendments which propose that the text of the regulation should stipulate that the harmonisation of charges for access to national networks must be limited to the charges applicable to producers and that those charges must be reduced."
"However, this is an overly restrictive provision."
"National charges should be harmonised on the global basis of the charging structure, bearing in mind the specific characteristics of the national networks."
"We cannot therefore accept this amendment either."
"We do not believe it appropriate to link the entry into force of the Regulation with that of the directive too strictly, as suggested in Amendment No 35."
"The promotion of cross-border trade is necessary in any event, regardless of the adoption of proposed amendments to the directive on electricity and gas currently in force."
"In conclusion, Mr President, the vote on these texts is of the greatest importance."
"Thanks to the support for the main approaches and the broad convergence between Parliament and the Commission on all the measures, I hope that the negotiations in Barcelona will give us new impetus and that then, as Mr Adam indicated earlier, the negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission will give full and total support to this regulated liberalisation in the electricity and gas sector, key elements for the creation of the internal market and therefore for the competitiveness of the European economy."
"Mr President, on a point of order, as one of the rapporteurs in the debate we have just had, I would like to say that the conditions in which this debate was held are ridiculous."
"When I started to speak, just three Members were in the Chamber and the Commissioner had not had the time to join us because this House is unable to set a clear time for the start of the debate."
"As the rapporteur I had just two-and-a-half minutes and my colleague, Mr Rapkay, also had two-and-a-half minutes, to explain a directive on the European market for electricity and gas."
"Now when we listen to the Commissioner's answers there is so much noise that it is almost impossible to hear her."
"Mr President, please organise the proceedings in such a way that we have dignity when we discuss this."
"On the question which you raise about the organisation of debates, we have had an extensive, informal discussion in the Conference of Presidents about trying to create more space for debate."
"This has to do with our voting procedures and so on."
"We will eventually also have the report by Mr Corbett, which will help in this regard."
"It is a priority to create more space for debate, I hope in the not too distant future."
"I can only say that I agree fully with the point you make about the dignity of the House."
"Whenever I have been in the Chair I have tried, to the best of my ability, to insist that the House listen to speakers in a dignified fashion appropriate to Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 12 noon today."
"The next item is the vote."
"Simplified procedure:"
"Proposal, on behalf of the Committee on Citizen's Freedoms and Rights; Justice and Home Affairs, for a Council regulation establishing a general framework for Community activities to facilitate the implementation of a European judicial area in civil matters (15532/2001 - C5-0021/0109 (CNS))"
"(Parliament approved the Commission proposal as amended)"
"Report (A5-0034/2002) by Encarnación Redondo Jiménez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on"
"the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3528/86 on the protection of the Community's forests against atmospheric pollution (COM(2001) 634 - C5-0551/2001 - 2001/0267(COD))"
"and"
"the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92 on the protection of the Community's forests against fire (COM(2001) 634 - C5-0552/2001 - 2001/0268(COD))"
"(In successive votes Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions)"
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0052/2002) by Marieke Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 on air carrier liability in the event of accidents (10794/1/2001 - C5-0641/2001 - 2000/0145(COD))"
"(The President declared the common position approved)"
"Report (A5-0070/2002) by Lord Inglewood, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the application of international accounting standards (COM(2001) 80 - C5-0061/2001 - 2001/0044(COD))"
"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, if the House follows my recommendation - which I hope it will - this will achieve an outcome that was agreed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and can be accepted by the Commission and the Council."
"The pattern of the voting list is slightly convoluted because the text is complicated and what is proposed deals with drafting points."
"I have endeavoured to be open about this and I know that the Socialist Group has had concerns."
"This morning I spoke with Mr Berenguer, the shadow rapporteur, who I believe can now confirm that he is content with what I am suggesting, i.e. that we should vote against the second half of Amendment No 3 and against Amendment No 6."
"If my suggestion is followed, it should lead to the adoption of this important text in a single reading."
"Mr President, I would like to confirm what Lord Inglewood said: the Group of the Party of European Socialists will vote against the second part of Amendment No 3 and against Amendment No 6."
"I believe that this would increase the coherence of the text."
"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Lord Inglewood on his excellent work."
"Mr President, I would like to table an oral amendment: I propose to replace the clause 'the European Data Protection Supervisor is bound by the objective of Regulation No 1049? with the clause 'the European Data Protection Supervisor is bound by Community law, including Regulation 1049?, and to replace the clause 'and by the provisions of the Treaty stating that decision-making in the Union shall be as open as possible? with 'and by the provisions of the Treaty relating to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms and stating that decision-making in the Union shall be as open as possible?."
"I hope there are no objections to this."
"Mr President, I propose that the vote on the legislative resolution be postponed."
"This is a decision covered by an interinstitutional agreement: Parliament, Commission and Council must all agree on it."
"Now, the text to be put to the vote today is different from that proposed by the Commission and, as far as I know, endorsed by the Council. I therefore call for the vote on the legislative resolution to be postponed so that we can see if the other institutions can accept our point of view or, in any case, so that we can attempt to achieve a common position."
"- (DA) We have voted against the report on the grounds that we are concerned here with a regulation and not a directive."
"Because of national differences and the circumstances of individual nations, there is a need for flexibility, something which could better have been brought about by means of a directive."
"Mr President, yesterday morning, during a television programme broadcast from Milan called 'Telelombardia', a pensioner, Lucia, telephoned me and told me that she had been robbed on her way back from withdrawing her pension, as she does at the end of every month, and that, because of what had happened to her, she did not know how she was going to survive the month."
"You may ask me what the connection is with Mrs Paciotti's report on data protection."
"Well then, reflecting on this matter, I said to myself, 'We must vote for the Paciotti report on data protection because data protection is extremely important, but when will we, at last, have protection of pensioners, especially poor pensioners who, when they go to withdraw their pensions, are the victims of delinquency and violence which, for them, are extremely harmful?"
"I hope that Mrs Paciotti will soon concern herself with pensioner protection as well as data protection."
"Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo, for an ingenious method of introducing your favourite subject."
"Report Färm (A5-0068/2002)"
"Mr President, there is always a great deal to say about the Commission's budget, as there is about Parliament and all the other institutions' budgets."
"However, I will restrict myself to saying that, although I voted for the motion, I hope that the Commission will set money aside for informing all the workers who live in the European Union and the candidate countries about their pension rights."
"In actual fact, a great many citizens are unfamiliar with the rules and laws of the State and do not know how to obtain all their rights."
"Furthermore, I hope that we will soon have a European television channel broadcasting the work of Parliament including what happens in this Chamber during explanations of vote such as this."
"I feel it would be extremely educational and very interesting."
"Judging by the guidelines contained in the Färm report, it does not look as if the 2003 budget is going to be very different to preceding budgets, which means that, once again, we will have a disputed budget for the sake of the Stability Pact."
"Despite the fact that year after year, new priorities give rise to greater needs, the policy that has been pursued consists of redistributing Community funds from old priorities to new ones and vice versa."
"Consequently, we are seeking to enlarge the European Union to a further 10 countries with the same amount of money and, if possible, even making some savings, which is not acceptable."
"The revision of the financial perspectives is absolutely essential to safeguarding the principle of economic and social cohesion, a genuinely distributive budget and the adequate financing of development and cooperation policy."
"This year, the rapporteur has given priority to enlargement, but has become bogged down in administrative issues without questioning the very limited proposals presented by the Commission for financing enlargement, without guaranteeing the transfers of appropriations to prepare for accession in 2002 and 2003, insisting instead on the priority of financing the communitarisation of the third pillar - justice and home affairs - supporting an increase in appropriations for Europol, for Eurojust and for the external borders, but ignoring fundamental social areas, specifically employment and improving living conditions."
"The rapporteur is concerned with budgetary implementation, specifically of the structural funds, but presents no solution, such as a clear commitment to making payments at levels that ensure proper implementation."
"He does not mention the reform of the common fisheries policy, when 2003 will be its first year of implementation - hence the proposal that we tabled - and opens the way to the co-financing of the common agricultural policy."
"He is vague on the financial needs of heading 4 - external policy - when the priorities are mounting up, in areas such as the Palestinian Territories, Timor, Afghanistan, Argentina, the Balkans, the Mediterranean and humanitarian aid, without any additional resources."
"The rapporteur wavers between the redistribution of appropriations and their increase without ever being clear."
"Hence our position against the report."
". (NL) The European Parliament is free to discuss anything, but a real parliament has the right of initiative and the last word in the forming of coalitions, in legislation and the budget."
"In the EU, a distinction is drawn between compulsory and non-compulsory expenses, and the extensive agricultural budget falls outside the parliamentary remit."
"Furthermore, by means of structural funds, money that originates from rich Member States is pumped back to the self-same rich States via the bureaucracy in Brussels."
"The Council always reduces the level of the budget artificially."
"Money for military ventures outside the EU territory and reparations for these wars in Serbia, Kosovo and Afghanistan is taken from previously committed funds."
"Members of various EP groups are right to criticise this intransparent course of affairs in which the electorate has no say."
"However, it is their colleagues in the Council and the Commission who are responsible for this crazy situation and who insist that everything stays exactly the same."
"The Committee on Budgets is now looking for resources to absorb the effects of the expected doubling of the number of official languages at the lowest possible cost, among other means, by using remote interpreters who are also required to translate into languages other than their mother tongues."
"Bad-quality translations and overburdened staff cannot solve this problem."
"According to paragraph 15 of Mr Stenmarck's report, Parliament regrets that the dispersion of Parliament's staff in three working places remains a major obstacle for improving the allocation of human resources and points out, in particular, that the need to maintain a number of posts in Luxembourg leads to unnecessary duplication in a number of services."
"Furthermore Parliament hopes, says the report, that the forthcoming enlargement will provide an opportunity to improve the allocation of posts between Brussels and Luxembourg."
"What is the meaning of this?"
"This paragraph clearly seeks to undermine the Edinburgh Agreement on the location of the seats of the individual European institutions, which stated that the seat of the General Secretariat of the European Parliament was Luxembourg."
"Parliament has no business, certainly not in a paragraph hidden away in a report on the budget, to call this decision into question either directly or indirectly."
"The only authority on this matter is, and remains, the European Council and, as far as I know, it is still abiding by its 1992 decision."
". (FR) Since part of paragraph 15 has been retained, I voted for the Stenmarck report on the European Parliament's preliminary draft estimates for 2003."
"This paragraph, inserted in committee following an amendment by a British Conservative Member, is a challenge to the integrity and impartiality of the European public service and an attack on Luxembourg, the workplace of the European Parliament."
"Those who show their aversion to the process of European integration should at least respect historical fact and the law as laid down by the Treaties."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.54 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0053/2002) by Georg Jarzembowski, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Community airports (COM(2001) 695 - C5-0667/2001 - 2001/0282(COD))."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, visitors in the gallery, we now turn to a Commission proposal to further reduce noise in and around airports."
"This proposal implements an agreement which was adopted at the ICAO Assembly in the autumn of last year and which applies throughout the world."
"Personally, of course, I have certain reservations about it because at the ICAO Assembly the entire system was changed."
"They abandoned the system of taking certain types of aircraft out of use altogether or suspending their use and moved over to a so-called 'balanced approach', whereby, instead of the aircraft being assessed, the noise situation at each individual airport is assessed and suitable restrictions are introduced."
"Apart from this general reservation - and after five years these provisions will be reviewed - we as a committee believe that we should implement the international agreements reached in Montreal, along with this approach of finding a balanced solution for each airport."
"This kind of noise protection, which will vary from airport to airport, at the same time makes it possible for us to repeal the hushkit regulation."
"We would have got into some difficulties with the USA and other third countries on account of this hushkit regulation, because from 1 April of this year the landing rights of these aircraft would automatically have been suspended."
"Thanks to the new balanced approach, which we have had since Montreal, we can do without the hushkit regulation and thus end the conflict with the USA, but here I also want to say loud and clear that the Americans should not forget to withdraw their Article 84 complaints if we withdraw our hushkit regulation."
"Because of the 1 April limit, we had to process the legislation quickly, and I have to say that our efforts have been very successful."
"There were some initial difficulties determining responsibility for the dossier with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, but we agreed that the Environment Committee would draft an opinion."
"We incorporated this in our report and held an informal trilogue procedure with the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, thus avoiding any dispute between the environment and transport areas in this House."
"I should like to thank the Vice-President and also the Council representatives very much for enabling the informal trilogue to reach a satisfactory conclusion."
"I should like to inform the House that there are two technical amendments which I will be tabling tomorrow, because in our haste we allowed two editorial errors to slip in. There are discrepancies between what we agreed with the Council and what the amendments actually say."
"But we will make the necessary corrections."
"On the substance, I should like to point out that we in Parliament have been successful on two central points."
"We have succeeded in changing the definition of the city airport."
"Until now airports have only been classified as city airports if there has been another alternative airport nearby."
"This has meant that there have been hardly any city airports."
"We have extended this definition by leaving out the alternative airport requirement."
"However, we did not get too carried away, so as to avoid a conflict with the Americans, and have said, city airports are airports as defined in Annex I. This can be amended by the Member States and the Commission in the committee procedure."
"This gives us the possibility of introducing more stringent rules on noise protection in particularly noisy areas and at particularly noisy airports."
"However, and here I turn to my socialist friends in this room, the general call to increase the limit from -5 EPNdB to -8 EPNdB would lead to a conflict with the USA and would also cause internal difficulties, because the Member States are not at all willing to accept more stringent standards, and at the moment the airports do not want these either."
"This means that we should actually stick to -5 here."
"In difficult situations we can use the definition of the city airport as a way out."
"That is why I urge the House not to support Amendments Nos 21 and 22 so as not to jeopardise the compromise with the Council."
"Secondly - and this is also for all of the environmentally-friendly Members of this House - we have obtained the Council's agreement that we already state now, in respect of the review in five years' time, that after these five years we should seek to establish a more stringent limit than -5."
"This means that we have sent out a clear signal that we want to take account of public sensitivities and public health."
"But the same public wants to go on holiday; the same public wants to fly to the European Parliament."
"We therefore need to reach a compromise between the interests of the people who want to fly and the interests of those who live near airports."
"I believe that we have found that compromise."
"I would earnestly request that tomorrow the whole House convincingly approve the measures that we negotiated with the Council with the help of the Commission's conciliation services, because then we can conclude this difficult issue - which is so important in terms of foreign policy - at first reading."
"Mr President, the topic of aircraft noise often gives rise to conflicts, conflicts between the European Union and the United States and conflicts among European Parliament committees."
"The solution to the conflict with the United States is very close."
"Tomorrow, the plenary session can simply end the conflict by accepting the compromise that was reached with the Council."
"As far as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is concerned, this will not pose a huge problem since the following four points have been resolved satisfactorily."
"First of all, the scope to designate airports as city airports has been widened."
"This helps combat noise pollution, since city airports are allowed to take more stringent measures."
"Secondly, the research obligations from Annex II have now been formulated in such a way as not to constitute an unnecessary barrier to measures."
"Thirdly, the possibility has been created to ban subsequent phases of aircraft after five years."
"Fourthly, the exemption regulation for developing countries is now restricted to a ten-year period."
"A total of 33 compromise amendments have been tabled, as a result of which most amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy can lapse."
"However, I only tabled the first two amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy by way of supplement."
"Environmental considerations, in particular, must be integrated in transport policy in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty."
"As rapporteur Jarzembowski remarked a moment ago, there were a few minor changes submitted, including oral additions to the amendments tabled and also the change to Amendment No 12, which have led us to achieve complete agreement."
"I recommend that the plenary session tomorrow support the compromise package, so that the legislative process can be concluded in one reading."
"This is important in order to solve a long, drawn-out conflict with the United States involving the Hushkits Regulation."
"Finally, as far as the conflict between EP committees is concerned, I have no choice but to conclude that this report has wrongly been designated to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"Fortunately, thanks to sound cooperation with Mr Jarzembowski, we have reached agreement with the Council."
"We will therefore leave this conflict for what it was."
"Could I, too, say to Mr Jarzembowski: all is well that ends well?"
"The fact that we eventually ended up singing from the same hymn sheet has given me enormous pleasure."
"Mr President, noise pollution around airports is always an emotive subject for the citizens who live near them, and Mr Jarzembowski who lives in Hamburg, knows this all too well."
"What can be done about this?"
"There are two types of measures."
"One, you can develop aircraft which emit low noise levels; you can regulate daytime and night-time operating; noise levels can be measured - measurements are hard facts - and certain types of aircraft can be banned."
"This is precisely what we have done: we have banned the noisy aircraft, the hushkits, and I was all for it."
"However, when all these measures have been taken, something else can be done, namely insulating and zoning."
"They are incredibly costly, very expensive indeed, not only to the government, for what the government spends is ultimately the expense of the citizens."
"This meant, therefore, that when the ban on aircraft created problems, we had to consider new measures."
"The Hushkits Regulation had to be scrapped."
"The Commissioner had no other choice."
"She started to negotiate with the Member States and a new idea was born, an idea which, at the moment, I am giving the benefit of the doubt."
"And why the benefit of the doubt?"
"If we consider the effects which the new measures that were agreed in ICAO context worldwide have had, not only on the European population but also on the populations in all other cities across the world, then I believe it was a useful exercise."
"I would like to thank Mr Blokland who managed to tighten a few aspects, and I am well-supported in this by the PPE-DE section of our group in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Adaptations have been made and refined, and, Mr President, I have to tell you that, if I could end each issue on this note, I would continue to be on very good terms with Mr Jarzembowski."
"And I wish you, Commissioner, every success."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly the rapporteur deserves our thanks for his consistent report and his committed efforts to reach compromises, the majority of which we will be supporting."
"However, I have to contradict him somewhat as regards the treatment of the Environment Committee - it may have been legally correct, but from a political point of view it was not exactly optimal."
"On the actual substance: a third of all European airports are currently suffering noise problems; the problems are continuing to increase and the air transport sector is continuing to grow."
"We have seen aircraft movements double in the last ten years and perhaps it will take even less time for them to double again, because flying is becoming part of everyday life."
"I only have to think of the low-cost airlines, enlargement towards the east and other issues; they will quickly lead this sector out of the slump that it has been experiencing because of September 11, and, in fact, the first signs of growth are already visible."
"The noise problems are increasing in our cities because there is more traffic, and in the conurbations population density is also on the increase."
"At the same time there is also an increased desire for a better quality of life, which means that people are less willing to tolerate additional noise pollution."
"That is why it certainly makes sense for us to make every effort to secure a proposal for a directive which is as effective as possible."
"It makes sense to conclude international agreements because this is of course a global industry."
"The ICAO agreement on the new chapter four was secured only after laborious negotiations, but of course it does not apply straight away, and that is why it is good that we are introducing these additional possibilities for placing operational restrictions on individual airports, which will enable stricter noise emission standards to be imposed."
"It is also important for us to adopt a higher profile in ICAO because more international agreements are on the horizon and we will also soon have to be prepared for further international conflicts."
"That is why it is really important for us to consider what we want to stand up for."
"I only have to think of the open sky agreements and the issues which will still be on the agenda in connection with subsidised aircraft from third countries."
"On the other hand, it does not actually make any sense - we are not in any trouble - to curtail the parliamentary procedure, because I think that in the USA they will recognise that parliamentary procedures take time."
"We see three points rather differently."
"Firstly, we want it spelt out even more clearly that in five years' time, after the review, moves will be made to increase the limit values; we want this laid down now along with the eight decibels."
"Secondly, the necessary operational restrictions should take effect as quickly as possible, more quickly in our view than the Commission has proposed - this is more a reflection of the result of the vote in my group than my own personal views."
"Thirdly, we should perhaps reopen the discussions on the city airports after all, although the compromise which has been reached with the Council and the Commission, as it were to extend the definition so that not only the original four but all of the airports in conurbations count if they handle internal Community traffic, seems to me personally to be right, and I think that my group will also support it in the end, even if it is after some debate."
"I should like to make two final points: work should continue to conclude international agreements on engines and we will be discussing noise again - specifically overall noise-handling - in the context of the slot regulation, which will be exciting."
"I am sure that we will achieve workable compromises in the next round."
"Once again many thanks to the rapporteur."
"Mr President, Commissioner, is what we have ideal?"
"I do not think so."
"However, in the current circumstances, this is the best we can commit to paper, in my view."
"It is always easy to draft a series of standards just for the European Union, making them so strict in the process that while we may be happy with them, they may make it impossible for the average company to operate."
"We had the choice."
"We held a debate on whether to opt for an international, global or European solution."
"Given the present circumstances, we made a sensible choice."
"Moreover, it is on the strength of what we said that this strict standard was copied internationally."
"If all Member States have accepted this standard within the ICAO, it seems necessary to me that we, as a Community institution, ensure that this standard becomes law in the Union."
"I, for one, support this principle, and I think that the rapporteurs, both those of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and those of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have done sterling work. As I belong to both these committees, I do not feel the ambivalence which some fellow MEPs do feel."
"I feel happy on both sides. This is also because the directive offers the necessary flexibility, since a system has been provided for which allows for an individual approach tailored to each airport, so that measures can be selected within a European framework."
"This, at least, guarantees a certain level of equality in the treatment of people who suffer from noise pollution. In the final analysis, this is the whole object of the exercise: to ensure that people are affected as little as possible and to reconcile - at least up to a certain degree - two aspects which are, in fact, irreconcilable."
"Although the review after five years will involve a tightening up of legislation, there is, in my opinion, no need to establish a limit at this stage."
"This would be very unwise, in my view, and it could, in fact, undermine the entire proposal, which would be a very bad development, for we need to move forward quickly."
"Parliament must, therefore, approve this proposal, so that there is a legislative document by 1 April, upon which we can withdraw the hushkits directive."
"For this we must take another look at Article 5(1), and we are in agreement on this."
"This is what we are planning to do, and I should like to ask the Commissioner whether she could not ensure that a uniform, Community method of measurement be established for this kind of noise, for that is still not available."
"In my view, you should draft a bill on how noise is measured, so that we can establish objectively how measurements are to be carried out, applicable to every airport uniformly."
"This initiative would also benefit the joint discussion on this issue."
"Mr President, I do not share the enthusiasm of the majority of our fellow Members for the result obtained with regard to this directive."
"In fact, I think that, as regards the noise reduction policy which concerns in particular those living near airports, this seems to be a step backwards."
"The proposal repeals the Council regulation that should have entered into force on 1 April 2002 preventing hushkit planes, old planes fitted with muffling devices, but whose overall performance was recognised as insufficient, from landing."
"This regulation is replaced by a directive based on an approach to noise management which is supposedly balanced, but which, in fact, restricts the margin for manoeuvre by the Member States with regard to combating noise pollution and prolongs the life of hushkit planes."
"The amendments proposed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy may well improve the original text."
"Nevertheless, we are still in a situation where the Member States who will not do anything to assist in combating noise pollution in the vicinity of their airports will in fact be practising a dumping policy which could increase over the next few years insofar as we are currently experiencing a significant rise in air traffic."
"In addition to this, the legislation allowing specific action to be taken is relatively complex and will therefore slow down initiatives."
"I would like to point out in this respect that, a few months ago, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favour of people living near Heathrow airport in London who were complaining of nocturnal noise, and the right to a healthy environment and the right to sleep were recognised as human rights."
"I therefore believe that in keeping with this decision of the Court of Human Rights, the Commission must quickly take a new initiative, a directive that not only restricts noise in the vicinity of airports, but lays down standards on noise exposure, thus allowing for harmony within the European Union."
"Mr President, I should like to thank my colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, for all his hard work."
"As Mr Jarzembowski has explained, it is extremely important that this directive repeals the original hushkit regulation within the timeframe laid down."
"Without doubt, having discussed the hushkit issue on and off since many of us were elected in 1999 and for many years before, it will come as a relief that this debate can reach a conclusion."
"It is worth reminding some of our colleagues that, when the agreement was reached between the EU and the US at the ICAO meeting in Montreal, all Member States were represented and agreed with the proposals that were put forward."
"The key to those proposals was to take the balanced approach."
"If we are to have any credibility it would be ludicrous if we in this Parliament then reneged on what has been agreed."
"Speaking as someone who has lived close to London Heathrow, the busiest international airport in the world, for 30 years, and acknowledging the prosperity and jobs which flow from a successful industry, I find it extremely disappointing that perhaps some Members would prefer to score party political points rather than take on board the broader picture of what is required."
"What would not be acceptable would be for any airport within the EU to be in a position to arbitrarily prevent or stop legitimate carriers from operating into and out of their airport."
"The decision has to be made at Member State level in order to ensure a uniform application of any rules laid down."
"However, if we are to improve congestion and noise pollution for the future, I suggest that Member States and local authorities take responsibility for proper land use planning and think carefully before using the aviation industry as a scapegoat for their failures."
"Finally, having read through the additional amendments, many of which have been retabled predominantly by the Committee on the Environment, I found it somewhat disappointing that those Members found it necessary to go along that path."
"I hope that they will think seriously about their actions and support the rapporteur when we vote on this report tomorrow."
"International agreements are the way forward and we should continue to build on the agreement which was reached in Montreal."
"Mr President, I have listened very carefully to the debate so far and I was very interested in what Mr Stercks and Mr Lannoye said."
"To understand properly much of what they have said, one must consider the history."
"For many years, there was no sign at all of ICAO taking any action to deal with the problem of growing aircraft noise so we in this Parliament took action."
"We introduced the hushkits regulation which suspended the use of aircraft not retrospectively fitted with noise suppressors - the hushkits starting in April 2002."
"Then suddenly, there was action."
"The Americans threatened legal action and sanctions and ICAO seemed to wake up."
"ICAO proposed new and better noise standards and guidance on sensible operating restrictions around airports."
"We are now asked though to rescind our regulation and to accept this new directive, which is quite clearly much watered-down, and to expect ICAO to agree on some new international standards as soon as possible."
"I will probably go along with this at the vote tomorrow because I agree that something is better than nothing, but we can only expect only some small improvements, and only potential improvement at that."
"I have to say that I am not convinced that there will be any real improvement at international level unless it is very slow as is the custom with ICAO."
"Therefore, if the Commission does finally get around to sending us a report in five years' time, we might just get a chance to see what this muddled arrangement has produced."
"I look forward to the report."
"I look forward to returning to the debate and I hope Mr Jarzembowski is happy with himself because I am not sure that I am."
"Who wants incredibly noisy aircraft in Europe?"
"Answer: the United States administration, both under Clinton and Bush."
"From 1 April next, they want to send old, incredibly noisy aircraft with silencers to Europe."
"Europe had already decided that these aircraft, fitted with a so-called hushkit, should be phased out after 1 April."
"However, the US Government, which sells high numbers of these hushkits to airline companies in developing countries, has lobbied hard and effectively."
"Instead of a general ban for the whole of Europe, the European Commission now wants each airport to document the fact that it does not want these noisy aircraft."
"Of course, if you really want to, you can still stop these wretched old things."
"But the result will be that an increasing number of these noisy old bangers will move to smaller airports."
"From London to Manchester, from Maastricht to Bierset."
"This is something I cannot endorse."
"Mr President, as an aside, I should like to inform you that the Irish have just won the first race at the Cheltenham festival."
"I thought you might be interested."
"My views on the present hushkit legislation are on the record."
"It was very questionably driven by design criteria and not performance criteria."
"So I welcome this adoption of an ICAO balanced approach to air traffic noise reduction as it amounts to a fundamental system change for the European Union."
"However, I have many reservations."
"This Commission proposal states that noise reduction efforts are now to be assessed on the basis of individual airports, with a view to imposing operating restrictions on aircraft."
"It has opted for the airport-based approach along the lines of ICAO Resolution A337."
"I support a package of measures for our larger and busier airports covering aspects such as land-use planning and management, operational restrictions and a ban on the noisier Chapter 3 aircraft."
"However, as others have said, the effectiveness or otherwise of this proposal as a means of reducing air traffic noise will only be known after the Commission has submitted its report on its findings in over five years' time."
"I would particularly like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, for his hard work and the close contact he has maintained with both the Presidency-in-Office and the Commission in an effort to find a way forward and - given the critical deadline of 1 April - to prevent a legislative vacuum from occurring."
"It is imperative for all of us in this House, if possible, to avoid a second reading."
"That said, it is extremely unsatisfactory for us, as legislators to have been asked to rush through such a technical piece of legislation."
"I am not happy about the whole procedure."
"I would, however, like to sound a note of caution."
"Although these proposals are very necessary and overdue in the context of the hushkits regulation and the US complaint and, indeed, the recent opinion of the Advocate General, the UK Government's position points out some flaws in the Commission's approach."
"So the 1 April deadline still looks rather ambitious."
"Mr President, this proposal by Mr Jarzembowski seeks to achieve two things: a uniform approach to what is a global problem, and also a solution to the conflict with the United States."
"Like most Members in this House, I give this proposal my support, but it is only qualified support."
"There are serious problems with the way in which it is being achieved and also with the nature of the compromise that is being achieved."
"I have serious problems with a system which relies on informal negotiations between individual Members of this House, the Council and the Commission."
"It restrains the role of the elected Members of this House to an undue degree."
"We must find some fast-track codecision procedure which can be used in these circumstances and fully respects the role of the Members of this House."
"Secondly, the people who suffer as a result of the noise levels from aircraft and the operation of airports are the people who live immediately in the vicinity, particularly those on flight paths."
"We will have to judge this proposal on whether or not their lives improve over the next five years."
"And while we have a proposal here that the Commission will report back to us in five years' time as to whether we are achieving what we set out to achieve, I hope that the Commission will come back here each year and tell us in what direction things are moving - whether the proposals are working, whether things are getting better or indeed in some cases getting worse - so that we can introduce corrective actions, rather than waiting for five years before beginning to take alternative steps."
"I realise that a number of amendments which are good amendments in their own right are going to be rejected here tomorrow, but the Commission and Council should bear in mind that they are being rejected in order to facilitate this agreement, not because we disagree with them."
"Mr President, Mrs de Palacio, pollution abatement is a noble but difficult struggle, a delicate balance between economic prosperity and human welfare."
"Nevertheless, health and the economy are inseparable companions in the long run."
"For that reason I too am pleased with the approach proposed by the Commission."
"Noise should be reduced where that is needed most."
"There is no real need for noise reduction at airports located a long way from where people live, so if a straitjacket were to apply in all situations there would be a slowdown in the economy for no good reason, and it is always the poor who are the first to suffer."
"I am also pleased that we were able to get the committee to approve some useful adjustments."
"It has to be made clear that the directive cannot apply to small aircraft, because nothing would be gained by banning them, although I am sure the radicals would like to protect deer and wild boars too from the sound of aircraft."
"Mr Jarzembowski has once again done a very professional job."
"He has had to negotiate with the Council and the Commission under heavy pressure."
"Not all my colleagues, however, have taken such a responsible view of the matter."
"There were many amendments tabled despite the fact that we are in danger of a trade dispute with the United States of America if we do not use this directive to quash the hushkit regulation before its entry into force."
"I strongly condemn the new US steel tariffs, but, in spite of that, Europe must not pick a quarrel."
"We, for our own part, can set a good example of how to manage trade policy. May President Bush learn a lesson from it."
"I believe we have found a good compromise, and we should proceed from that."
"The best way to bring down noise levels, however, is by an international agreement on a reduction in aircraft noise."
"A totally silent world is hardly possible nor even desirable."
"One day, though, a jumbo jet or the new and large - by European standards - Airbus will be emitting less noise than a flock of crows."
"There is no reason for us yet, however, to prescribe limits for the noise made by crows."
"Mr President, I am not going to insist on identifying the precedents which have led us to today's discussion, which I hope will lead to a positive result tomorrow, because we all know what has happened following the negative attitude of a series of Member States of the ICAO and we all want to make progress in the fight against noise at airports."
"We are also aware of the decision which the European Union adopted in relation to a certain type of modified aircraft which conforms to Chapter III and the circumstances which have led us to the current situation."
"What I wish to do first is to warmly thank Mr Jarzembowski for the wonderful work he has done on a very delicate issue and also Mr Blokland for the series of very positive amendments - in terms of the environment - which he has contributed to this Commission proposal."
"I believe that it is very important - and everybody here has said so - that today we find a solution, which, as Mr Sterckx said, and I agree with him, is not the ideal solution, but which at least represents a step forward and prevents further clashes with third countries."
"We must understand that we are part of a multilateral system; that, thanks to the decision of the European Union, things have moved on within the ICAO and the situation has improved and that we now have a proposal which offers us clear opportunities to improve the situation of airports in the future."
"I perfectly understand that we have many amendments and that, if we did not have international commitments which are binding of all of us, the honourable Members would probably like to support them."
"I would ask you tomorrow to bring that international agreement within our reach; that we may have a proposal which supports what the 15 countries of the Union have decided, voted for and supported within the ICAO."
"I would therefore like to thank Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Blokland and the two committees for their ambitious and at the same time realistic work and efforts, which show common sense and support for the decision of the 15 countries in the ICAO and therefore for the international decision."
"I believe that, after removing the requirement for an alternative airport, the definition of an urban airport hugely broadens the scope and this is positive."
"We could not reduce the number of movements to 30 000 since, amongst other things, it would contradict the limit laid down in the directive on environmental noise, which this very Parliament approved recently."
"I believe that the definition of the competent authority has improved and allows for the appropriate margins."
"I would also like to insist once again that we are not obliging any Member State to create a new body, but that the competent authority in each case will be defined and determined by the Member State in question, and it is therefore necessary that the State in question does define and determine it, and I would like to point out that we agree with Parliament that it is essential to make it clear that operative restrictions, according to the acoustic level, are based on methodologies described in the third edition of volume 1 of Annex XVI of the ICAO."
"This document has been agreed at international level and we would not accept any less rigorous document."
"It is also clear that, if the operative restrictions were not based on acoustic levels, but on the runway and the time, it would be difficult for us to refer to this Annex."
"With regard to the obligation to carry out analysis, the amount of information has been an issue on which a careful balance has been achieved: Article 5, paragraphs 1 and 2."
"On the one hand, we do not want to impose unnecessary burdens on airports or on the States of the Union, but, on the other hand, we must ensure that we have a suitable basis for decision making."
"Even in the event that an airport does not propose significant operative restrictions, we believe that it will be to their benefit to make as complete an analysis as possible in order to make decisions in full knowledge of the facts."
"We have studied very carefully the rhythm which the airports could impose with the withdrawal of aircraft from the fleets in question and we are convinced that this reference should be made according to movements."
"I believe that a minimum of five years is a very tough requirement and we could not therefore reduce this time period even further."
"With regard to the developing countries, the Commission has carried out a detailed study which has concluded that these countries have acted in a responsible way by reducing their fleets of Chapter II aircraft and we applaud this action."
"We must be fair towards these operators and I believe that the compromise amendment presented is a solution we can support."
"The Commission would also like to express its support for a general exemption applicable to genuinely exceptional services, for humanitarian reasons or maintenance work which cannot be carried out elsewhere for example."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the fact that decisions are taken in a coherent way throughout the Community is a fundamental step forwards."
"This means that we have the opportunity to replace the current patchwork of restrictions with prepared measures within a coherent framework of analysis, in such a way that similar solutions will be applied in European airports which have similar problems."
"I believe that we have an applicable directive which conforms to our international obligations and which, furthermore, will contribute to improving the quality of life of the citizens who live close to airports."
"In this respect, Mr President, I would like once again to thank the two rapporteurs and the honourable Members for their work and I am grateful for the cooperation and understanding of Parliament, which wanted to participate in this very difficult exercise of adopting legislation in record time, which allows us to prevent other types of problem in the international field."
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
"I hope that tomorrow the vote and the support of the honourable Members will allow us once and for all to resolve this issue which we have been dealing with for far too long."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0365/2001) by María Izquierdo Rojo, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on women and fundamentalism (2000/2174(INI))."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to welcome the fact that this House has accepted the proposal to produce a report on this issue, 'Women and fundamentalism', thereby allowing us to confront this serious problem and to hold this debate and the subsequent vote despite the difficulties involved and the current pressures."
"On behalf of the hundreds of millions of human beings whose rights are denied or restricted as a result of fundamentalist pressure, I would like to thank the European Parliament."
"Today the European Union must defend the universality of human rights in a globalised world in which fundamentalists represent serious threats to freedoms, human rights and peace."
"This report offers useful proposals which will help to combat them."
"The first of them, Mr President, is that we must not allow religious fundamentalism to become a taboo subject, since problems are not solved by ignoring them or covering them up, but by being aware of them and confronting them."
"Secondly, fundamentalism cannot be combated by means of fundamentalism under another guise; the history of humanity is awash with disasters of that type."
"On the contrary, fundamentalism is reduced by promoting and exercising democratic freedoms, promoting the emancipation of women, pluralism and ideological and cultural diversity, the promotion of openness and the acceptance of differences and social and economic well-being."
"Mr President, one of the key elements which has proved to assist in the fight against fundamentalism is modernity, in a plural and multicultural sense."
"There can be no social modernity without human modernity."
"The desire to modernise a society while denying women democracy ends in failure; hence our condemnation of partial modernisation processes on the part of leaders of States which want only to modernise economic and technology aspects, while maintaining the basic principles of obsolete patriarchal societies in tact."
"Women are currently the main bringers of social modernity."
"However, Mr President, there is no single model for the emancipated woman."
"Women's identity must be personal and individual, differing in terms of religion, tradition and culture."
"Stereotypes, dress, values, lifestyles and behaviour must be a question of personal free choice."
"Mr President, another of the key elements for preserving society from fundamentalism is secularisation or the separation of public affairs, which belong in the political sphere, from religious beliefs and convictions, which must be free and respected and which belong in the private individual sphere."
"The space occupied by religion in a social and political whole must involve a very broad range of possibilities."
"Mr President, the accusations being levelled against this report are unfair. It distinguishes and differentiates between fundamentalism and the normal practice of religion in a clear and respectful way, despite the fact that during the eras of certain religions in the past such a distinction has not existed."
"Mr President, we are facing a violation of human rights on an immense scale."
"Just in the case of women and at the present time, we can identify hundreds of the millions of people whose rights and freedoms are being restricted, violated and denied them."
"As a result of the time limits laid down in the Rules of Procedure, I have not been able to dwell on the death sentence by stoning imposed on Safiya Husseini, in Nigeria, nor on the Iranian women who are publicly flogged, nor those women, photographs of whose lynching I have seen, nor did I arrive in time to prevent the execution by stoning of Maryam Ayoubi last year."
"Despite the fact that the Iranian authorities had replied to the Commission that it had not stoned women for three years, the UN and Amnesty International have stated that that execution took place."
"Therefore, Mr President, I would like this report to be just a first step, followed by other specific parliamentary proposals, which will demonstrate, in each country and case by case, what a human life is worth in the European Union."
"Mr President, as draftsman for the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur on her exceptional report and for having the courage to tell the truth, however painful."
"We recently witnessed the collapse of the Taliban regime, which highlighted the tragic position of women in Afghanistan."
"We recently witnessed the trials and tribulations of Safiya Husaini, condemned to death by stoning by an Islamic court in Nigeria for having a baby out of wedlock."
"A similar verdict has been passed in Sudan."
"All these cases show just how topical this report is."
"They also turn the spotlight on the violation of women's fundamental freedoms and rights by fundamentalist, anti-democratic regimes centre stage in a most dramatic manner."
"What happened in Afghanistan with the rise of the Taliban is one very typical example."
"Women were deprived of their most basic human rights overnight."
"Like every other anti-democratic regime, the Taliban based their power on subjugating women and going back to their roots."
"Under these regimes, the sexual conduct, way of life and reproductive functions of women, even the way they dress, are generally controlled by religious leaders, allegedly abiding by scriptures and cultural traditions, while inhumane, violent and humiliating punishment, such as whipping and stoning, is the order of the day."
"We must not forget that about 5 000 women are murdered ever year by male members of their families for reasons of honour and that the perpetrators go unpunished."
"One hundred and thirty million women throughout the world have had their genitalia mutilated and that a further 2 million women a year are exposed to such practices."
"However, I should like to point out here that fundamentalism does not thrive just in developing countries; it also thrives in Europe."
"I think there is a serious problem in Poland."
"I have here an indictment signed by 100 public figures accusing the Catholic church of unacceptable interference and attempting to control women's reproductive functions."
"Mr President, as we have stated repeatedly, the Group of the European People's Party condemns any form of fundamentalism and in that sense, we think it important for this report to be drafted in Parliament, and have endorsed it accordingly."
"Fundamentalists have turned the myth of their religion into a streamlined ideology which forms the basis of their polity, and it is absolutely vital for the West to understand this fundamentalism."
"Our intelligentsia must make this effort."
"At the same time, Europe's Christian, or post-Christian, society must re-affirm its own, moral identity, this with the intention of being better able to protect its own values, and of understanding what is happening in the rest of the world, or what is happening with the 2.5 million Muslims who live in the European Union today."
"The treatment of women under fundamentalist regimes, the topic of this report, is a burning issue."
"Denial of their rights and their dignity is unacceptable, but unfortunately, the rapporteur failed to draft a report which draws a distinction between religious perception and the place of religion in society on the one hand, and religious fundamentalism on the other."
"As a result, religion is being denied what other institutions and movements are being granted, namely the freedom of opinion and expression of this opinion, even if that opinion is partly seen as not conforming to the development of society. I share this view."
"This is why the PPE-DE Group in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has not accepted the text, despite however much it is opposed to the oppression of women."
"Together with a number of feminist groups in Afghanistan, I have personally in my group launched a support campaign in order to give them the chance to emancipate."
"If Europe wants to have any influence at all, and that is, after all, the aim of our campaign - the aim is not to launch an empty slogan, but to exert influence - we will need to learn to understand fundamentalism, whether we like it or not."
"I should like to conclude my speech with a reaction of the mufti of Marseille."
"It is in English, and I think that he is right and that it should determine our attitude too."
"The mufti of Marseille"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the great merit of Mrs Izquierdo Rojo's report is that it has triggered another wide-ranging debate about the influence of religious fundamentalism on the emancipation of women."
"On behalf of the Socialist Group, I welcome the report, which emphasises Europe's responsibility for ensuring respect for fundamental rights and democratic principles as well as the secularity of nation states."
"Throughout the world, however, women's rights are being restricted or breached on the pretext of religious or cultural traditions or the law."
"This does not apply only to Islamists, but also to other religious groups."
"After difficult negotiations, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities is proposing more than 30 paragraphs of specific measures, which have met with the agreement of four groups."
"We deeply regret the fact that of all groups the Christian-Democratic Group was not prepared to take part in compromise negotiations."
"The rapporteur was willing to do so."
"The need to fight against the suppression mechanisms of the fundamentalists should, after all, be the subject of a consensus."
"The Afghan Taliban provided us with an example of how they first jettisoned women's rights, then forced women to wear the burka, and finally denied them education and medical care and cut them off from any kind of paid employment."
"In a joint declaration, the Women's Rights Committee in the European Parliament and the women of the Council of Europe call for an international group of female observers to be set up to see that Afghan women have their unrestricted human rights restored to them."
"We condemn any kind of fundamentalism, offence or crime for reasons of so-called honour, such as stoning or genital mutilation or withholding reproductive rights, and that includes in Europe."
"Within the EU, we need to influence immigration laws and asylum policy so that reasons for persecution which are gender-specific or not related to a particular state are recognised."
"In my country this is the subject of a major debate and there too it is the Christian-Democratic Group which is refusing to compromise."
"Afghanistan, a country where, during the Taliban's reign of terror, women were not allowed to leave their homes, were not allowed to work or receive education, is the most poignant example of a country where fundamentalists, backed by their delusions, oppressed women."
"However, on a smaller scale too, there are women across the world who are being oppressed, abused or discriminated against in the name of religion."
"In many Islamic countries, girls are genitally maimed, although this is not mentioned anywhere in the Koran."
"In fact, the Koran prohibits this practice."
"This is no longer religion, but fundamentalism."
"Some fellow MEPs labour under the misapprehension that I, along with other MEPs, denounce any religious interference in politics."
"This is incorrect."
"We welcome the fact that people are involved in European politics."
"This comes about via industry, environmental organisations and the unions."
"Needless to say, religions will also lobby for their interests and their ideals."
"The fact that churches defend their political agendas here among MEPs is a credit to our institution."
"I am therefore delighted with the Vatican's attention to this report, as documented in the authoritative Spanish newspaper, El Pais, among others."
"As a first step towards an open dialogue with the Vatican, I should like to say the following in response to their criticism: we simply want women to be able to decide for themselves whether, and if so when, they want to bear children."
"The report also focuses on the difficult position of women in developing countries and of lesbians."
"These are real problems which would be solved far better if politicians were to join forces with churches."
"Cooperation always leads to better results."
"Our joint fight against capital punishment or poverty is a good case in point."
"Would it not be wonderful if, on the road to yet more cooperation, we could start an open dialogue with regard to the Vatican's position on condoms?"
"Last year, 2.6 million people died of AIDS in Africa."
"If the Vatican stops the ban on condoms, we might be able to rescue a percentage of these people."
"Let us therefore enter into this open dialogue so that we can together fight fundamentalism at some stage in future, on the understanding that each take up their own responsibilities."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur and the fellow MEPs with whom we have cooperated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that everyone is agreed that fundamentalism has an extremely negative effect on the emancipation process of women."
"It is a source of violation of human and women's rights and fundamental freedoms, as enshrined in the international treaties and conventions, and exercises its baleful influence not only directly, but also via religious rules, cultural characteristics, customs, political campaigns and social standards."
"Women's rights are human rights, and this must form the basis of our actions."
"As I see it, and as we hear, women wish to accentuate the equal qualities of, and not the differences between, people."
"Let us transcend our religious differences in order to achieve a more humane world, preferably without violence."
"How many wars and how much violence find their improper origins in religious intolerance, often fed by political interests rather than religious perception?"
"The unnecessary, pointless violence between Muslims and Hindus in India serves as a recent example of this."
"It would be a major credit to this report if, thanks to the suggestions mentioned in it, an extreme danger of fundamentalism, namely the suffering of women and girls in Afghanistan, were turned into an example of how things can be changed."
"Allow me to explain."
"In the report, we asked the Council, the Member States and the Commission to take a joint initiative to send a special group of observers, specialised in gender equality, to Afghanistan to ensure that women's rights, as enshrined in international agreements and Treaties, are observed, and that aid and reconstruction policy takes sufficient account of the gender equality issues."
"In this way, the tragedy caused by the Taliban, as well as the solution to it, can be used in the fight against other forms of fundamentalism."
"This report is also praiseworthy for the fact that it expresses the wish that in the future directive on procedures for granting asylum in the Member States, account should be taken of various forms of female persecution."
"Mr President, it has taken a long time to bring this report before the plenary sitting as religion and sexuality are without doubt two very sensitive issues to address, even in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"Now we have come this far, I would like to thank my colleagues who have put in so much effort to draw up a number of new amendments."
"I would particularly like to thank them for showing the courage to address the role of Saudi Arabia, something which we otherwise tend to keep quiet about, given that we live, it might be said, in an era characterised by neo-liberal economic fundamentalism."
"There are many different sorts of fundamentalism both within and outside the borders of the European Union."
"I cannot help but mention last week's scandal, one of many scandals over the years."
"This time it concerned the United States."
"The Catholic Church has protected those of its representatives who have sexually abused children in their congregations for a generation."
"What is worst is when degenerates of this kind are also defended with the aid of the law."
"In this case, I am thinking of the current cases in Nigeria, where women are sentenced to be stoned to death for having sexual relations outside marriage."
"I am also thinking of the legal proceedings taken in Portugal against women who have had abortions and against those who have helped them to have these abortions, as well as of the recent referendum on the same issue in Ireland."
"These are just a few examples among many which demonstrate the right assumed by men to control women and children as their personal property."
"This often takes place in the name of religion and often under the protection of the law."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is always revolutionary to discuss the situation of women, but a few facts need to be made clear first."
"Fundamentalisms affect more than just the lives of women, they affect the lives of people in general, and for that reason they must be opposed and rejected on principle for they are at the root of a vision of society that is based on conflict."
"It is precisely because of this intrinsic nature that they have such negative consequences for women, becoming a sort of ethical justification for abuse and violence."
"Clearly, respect for fundamental human rights is a cultural even more than a legal heritage, which is shared by the Member States of the European Union, a common value which has to contend with practices, customs, religions and cultures with which Europe comes into contact mainly because of migration."
"I would like to make it clear, however, as a Catholic, that I am absolutely convinced that Catholicism is not guilty of the forms of fundamentalism that the report appears to suggest it is."
"I fully support the call for the adoption of a universal moratorium on executions and the death penalty, an effective, incisive action, a campaign against mutilation, flogging and stoning, such as we have carried out and will continue to carry out for cases such as that of the Nigerian woman, Safiya Husseini."
"I would like to draw your attention to a number of issues which I feel need to be addressed, calling upon the Commission and Parliament to reflect on them once again: to reflect on the right of the family, on the minimum conditions for the right of asylum, on integration, with regard to which we need to move away from a form of hypocritical rhetoric which drifts between full integration with the Member States of the European Union and respect for identities, and on the need for a clear separation of Church from State, or rather of religion from politics."
"To sum up, we confirm our rejection of any form of violence, particularly violence and oppression inflicted on human beings, be they men or women."
"We call upon the Commission not just to guarantee that the Community acquis on women's rights will be respected in the talks, but also to analyse all these problematic issues further, for there are at least as many unresolved issues as issues which have been resolved."
"Thousands of women suffer oppression, abuse or other forms of maltreatment."
"Every serious attempt to do something about this deserves our support."
"After all, women are equal to men and deserve respect for their talents."
"As a Christian, I have adopted this attitude based on the Bible."
"However, the report on women and fundamentalism offers no solution to the problem. Quite the reverse, in fact."
"The report tips towards a similar kind of intolerant fundamentalism to that which it means to fight."
"Respect for the deep conviction of worshippers is nowhere to be detected."
"The report arrogantly prescribes what is good and evil."
"Religions are treated with a negative and biased approach."
"The report's basic ideology is founded on the belief that people determine for themselves what is right and wrong."
"People only have rights."
"Any mutual ties of love and care, of solidarity and self-denial are treated with suspicion."
"This appears to me to be unadulterated egotism, despite the veneer of human rights."
"The statements about motherhood form the most disappointing part of the report."
"Motherhood is, by definition, not a purely personal matter, if nothing else because children develop their own personalities."
"Furthermore, the father is depicted in an appalling manner as somebody who exercises control over the reproductive capacity of women."
"As a father, I feel deeply hurt by this statement."
"Is the rapporteur looking to abolish men, by any chance?"
"I regret the work that has gone into this report by the rapporteur, but I hope that it will be rejected."
"Let us look for other ways of improving the position of oppressed women."
"Mr President, Mrs Poli Bortone, as a Catholic, is calling and has called quite clearly for a clear separation of Church from State, or rather, as she said, of religion from politics."
"As a lay person, I make exactly the same request, which, I feel, restores dignity to those who have faith or religious beliefs and restores dignity to those with political responsibilities."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the problem is precisely this: the separation of religion from political power and political decision-making."
"The problem covers more than just the religions we describe as fundamentalist, it is more than just the extreme case of genital mutilation and the Sharia: it is the general, standard situation, which is common in our countries too, the fact that there needs to be a separation of Church from State, of religion from politics."
"This is the heart of the matter, this is what we must have the courage to do."
"It is too easy to condemn extreme cases or Afghanistan; it is more difficult to take a look at our own home, more difficult to talk about the continual interference: I refer, for example, to scientific research, to the ban on the use of supernumerary embryo cells for scientific purposes, I am thinking of the Church's positions on therapeutic cloning and the obedience shown by the political class."
"Therefore, the meaning of this debate, of this report, for us and for all the women who live in Arab countries, whether extremist or not, is that the dignity of each individual and the respect for the religious beliefs of each individual will be safeguarded only if we assume our responsibility to separate religion from politics, Church from State."
"There you are: this, I feel, is what we must have the courage to do, without limiting our focus, so to speak, to extreme situations."
"We must take care."
"If we do not make the separation absolutely clear-cut and make indulgent concessions to the claims of cultural relativism, we will not help the women of Arab or European countries who are fighting for recognition of their role in society and their integrity at all."
"Mr President, in European society and especially in the European Parliament, where we fight for respect for human rights, the debate on the issue of fundamentalism and its repercussions on people's lives and on the productivity and creativity of society is of immense importance."
"History teaches us - and modern times also show us - that women are the first and most vulnerable victims of fundamentalism and it is this which interests Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights."
"Violations of women's human rights are a daily occurrence in numerous areas of the world, in various forms and in various sectors of public and private life."
"And if we exercise a little self-criticism, we must admit that it was the destruction of cultural monuments by the Taliban and the terrorist attack on 11 September which made us aware of the situation of women in Afghanistan."
"And cultural and religious customs and traditions are constantly cited in Afghanistan - as they are elsewhere - as an excuse for violating these rights."
"It is true that women and how they live are always the last bastion of resistance to progress in a country or society."
"So what we see is that, while numerous countries accused of violating human rights, especially women's human rights, are finding the courage to introduce economic reforms which often fly in the face of traditional or religious precepts, when it comes to women and their rights, change is resisted at every turn."
"My political group and the rapporteur differ on the role which religion plays in people's lives."
"We do not accept that religion and human rights are in opposite camps."
"Anyway, keeping the faith cannot go hand in glove with suppression and violence."
"This was the thrust of repeated amendments proposed by my political group in committee; however, the rapporteur failed to pay them any attention, which is why my political group has tabled amendments before plenary."
"Rather than fight our citizens' religious convictions, our approach is to mobilise all the political means at our disposal to ensure that the principles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights are applied to all policies, as the European Commission did recently when it took the initiative to strengthen these policies in its foreign relations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is extremely important that the European Parliament discusses and votes in favour of the report on women and fundamentalism."
"This is a political issue of the utmost topicality, which must be addressed carefully but quite firmly."
"It is our view that, in the European Union, equal rights for women and men, the right of all of us not to suffer public and domestic violence and to undertake the tasks that are within our ability, which we wish to undertake and which benefit us, is one of the greatest privileges we enjoy."
"We wish to share these privileges with all the women in the world."
"The violence we see throughout the world, particularly the situation of Afghan women under the Taliban regime, also exists, unfortunately, in other countries in which the dignity and will of women are trampled on for religious or ideological reasons."
"We must condemn and fight effectively against the various forms of fundamentalism that exist in the world and which allow such situations to exist."
"No one will be able to understand why the European Parliament is not adopting a strong position on this matter."
"Many compromise amendments have now been tabled."
"We must make an effort to reach agreement and we need to keep an open and tolerant mind on this matter."
"We cannot adopt a fundamentalist approach to this issue of intransigence toward the enormously serious situations taking place across the world and, in some cases, for example concerning the decision on reproductive rights, even within the European Union."
"The aim of this report is to secure a vote against all forms of fundamentalism."
"If the European Parliament does not approve the report, it would, from a political point of view, be extremely serious; it would send the message to the world that the European Parliament cannot agree on how to fight the various forms of fundamentalism that currently exist."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we are caught between a desire for clarity and the difficult nature of this subject."
"I am slightly uncomfortable with this report."
"I accept that it took a certain amount of courage to draw up this report, but I am not convinced that it had to be so ambiguous."
"The line between religion and fundamentalism does not seem to me to be clearly drawn."
"This certainly does not mean that fundamentalism is bad and religion good, but rather that we must not confuse religion with fundamentalism and vice versa."
"Speaking, not as a politician, but as a researcher who has studied the history of women, I know one thing: there is not a single religion that has not created a hierarchy between the sexes."
"This is a historical fact that cannot be denied."
"All those of us who want to oppose fundamentalism in any shape or form must face up to this historical fact without being hypocritical about it."
"In every religion, there is a hierarchy between the sexes."
"Some do promote certain women's rights, but few create and promote gender equality."
"That does not exist."
"We just have to put up with it, as it were."
"Personally, I am in favour of separating church and State, as you can tell from my speech."
"My words are addressed to all followers of religion."
"Fundamentalist or not, you are well aware that no religion has produced a theory on equality between men and women."
"This report makes me uncomfortable as there are some things that are not right."
"Recital T, for example, states that fundamentalism and feminism can be reconciled."
"Nothing could be further from the truth."
"It is possible to cobble together or come up with strategies for emancipation despite fundamentalism, as certain Iranian women have proved to us, but that does not make it true in all cases."
"Similarly, when I read in Article 31 that religious leaders must be asked to grant women the right to control their own bodies, I must protest."
"They will not do it!"
"They are fighting against contraception and abortion."
"We know it, fundamentalism or not."
"Let us think seriously and clearly about all that."
"We will undoubtedly disagree, but each person's position will be clear to us all."
"Mr President, we are firm supporters of the fight to uphold women's rights which are trampled upon by fundamentalists, but we feel that this report does not do the cause any favours."
"When it accuses the religious organisations of barring women from leading positions in the hierarchy, it is not attacking the kind of fundamentalism which is a threat - Islamic fundamentalism - so much as the Church, which restricts priesthood to men."
"The report contradicts itself when it calls upon the European Parliament - moreover in arrogant, disrespectful terms - to impose its own views on matters of dogma and ideology on the Pope and the patriarchs."
"This prompts me to wonder what is happening to the European Parliament: is it the parliament of the peoples or a parliament serving the occult powers?"
"The report makes two mistakes."
"The first is to equate Islamic fundamentalism with the principles of the Christian tradition, which have been dismissed as obsolete and reactionary, whereas the Christian and Catholic tradition is an integral part of the heritage of values and common culture of the European peoples."
"The second is to see Islamic fundamentalism as a degenerate sect of Islam when it is actually the current, authentic interpretation of Islam which is taught in all Islamic universities."
"It may be politically correct to disregard these facts but in doing so we are preventing Europe from defending itself against the danger represented by Islamic communities, governed by the severe rules of the Sharia which takes as much notice of women's rights as it does of our right of the family and all the principles of freedom."
"Mr President, I have to say that I am genuinely perplexed - and I am not saying this to take sides - by this report, not least in the light of my experience of the past two years in which, as Vice-President of the ACP-EEC Joint Assembly responsible for Human Rights, much of my time was spent promoting women's rights and freedoms."
"I am perplexed by many parts of the report and I want to go back to the crux of the matter, which I feel has been comprehensively defined by Mrs Bonino in her speech, and state my views clearly once again."
"The problem is the separation of religion from politics."
"From this point of view, if there is to be such a separation, it has to be understood that there are two ways of looking at these two radically different dimensions of life; so much so that, in actual fact, the only fundamentalism I truly fear is the fundamentalism of those sorts of idealisms which can no longer see the sense of reality in dealing with each specific subject individually by different means."
"Therefore, when this report calls upon us not to recognise States in which women are excluded from government and it is referring not to a normal State but to a State such as the Vatican, for example, I realise immediately that there is something wrong, for we are being asked to trespass on Member States' prerogatives and interfere in something which does not deserve such treatment."
"Similarly, if religion and politics are to be separated, the problem is the freedom of the Church, which must not be conditioned by political points of view or prerogatives."
"Therefore, when I read in point K of this report that, when religious bodies carry out activities of a public nature, they are, just by doing so, as good as committing a crime against an alleged European law; that is, if, by way of example, a religious body were to run a hospital or a school, it would in some way be a threat to European law, I find this extremely disturbing."
"That is why I confirm once again my support for the fight to uphold women's rights, but I must strongly reiterate my concern at the report's method and subject matter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last Friday, 8 March, was International Women's Day."
"I hope that each one of us, men and women, took part in meetings, seminars and conferences to confirm, once and for all, that equality between men and women is vital for the democratic development of our societies."
"The values of the European Union laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights include the right to human dignity, the right to the integrity of the person, freedom of thought, conscience and religion and equality between men and women."
"Therefore, here, in this Assembly, let us accept our responsibilities."
"It is up to us, the men and women of Europe, to apply these rights and ensure their application within the European Union and to defend and develop these values in the rest of the world."
"Here, I would like to point out how important the adoption of this report would be in this battle, as we must keep on tirelessly reminding ourselves that women are the primary victims of fundamentalism."
"They are victims of violence, social, economic, political and sexual discrimination, psychological and physical abuse, oppression, and are refused all the fundamental rights: equality, access to education and politics, and all in the very name of fundamentalism, which is the antithesis of human rights."
"We can and must take action."
"We must promote and protect democracy and human rights in our Association Agreements."
"We must also ensure intercultural dialogue between the two banks of the Mediterranean by increasing monitoring for more active participation of women in the actions and programmes we support."
"Lastly, we must support women seeking asylum in the European Union having suffered persecution in their own country in the name of fundamentalism."
"The defence of women's rights and equality between men and women must be one of the cornerstones of our actions which requires specific attention from our Assembly."
"In this Assembly, from now on, with the vote on this directive, let us give women the means and the signal to cast off their chains and let us once more assume our responsibilities."
"Mr President, the discussion is very interesting but I have noticed that hardly anyone is talking about the text, probably because many of us are confused by it."
"The history of this report, in the first place, shows that this initiative is untimely."
"What was originally a report on women in Islam has ended up as a convoluted, ambiguous report with no real coherence."
"In not wishing to attack Islam head-on, which I understand, the definition of fundamentalism has remained vague."
"Yet is fundamentalism not a caricature of religion?"
"We are all in agreement with regard to separating the temporal from the spiritual, and, from then on, it is not really within Parliament's remit to get involved in the ambiguous area of comparative theology."
"However, certain points deserve our agreement, in particular the statement that, within the territory of the Member States, customs and beliefs that are counter to human rights, and in particular women's rights, cannot be tolerated and that the family rights of the Member States take precedence over those of the countries of origin of immigrants."
"In conclusion, equality between men and women is not a matter of theory."
"Women must be promoted, along with their position and role in society, not simply as women, but because they are part of the same humanity, and therefore the same dignity, as men."
"Mr President, fundamentalism causes many problems within societies, and women, in particular, are the victim."
"This is illustrated by such things as the situation of women in Afghanistan, the stoning of women, or traditional practices such as female circumcision which, unfortunately, are still being carried out, also in Europe."
"In fundamentalist societies in particular, women are often denied fundamental rights and freedoms, and often have no access to adequate assistance, health care and education."
"This is why I was pleased with the proposal by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to draft an own-initiative report on the topic of 'Women and fundamentalism' and this is precisely why I am disappointed with the poor quality of the present report."
"I regret that we were unable to find a compromise within Mrs Karamanou's opinion."
"The Izquierdo report is right to call attention to the adverse effects of fundamentalism."
"However, if the topic and the intention are good, it does not necessarily follow that the report is good."
"The report goes too far where it lumps together religion, fundamentalism and human rights violation."
"The report is more anti-religion than it is pro-woman."
"It has adopted the wrong approach because solutions are sought in half-yearly reports, the setting up of an open university for women only, special mobility programmes for women - as if women needed this - and intervention in countries which act in accordance with their legislation but which, in the eyes of the rapporteur, nevertheless offer women inadequate protection."
"The report is also inconsistent."
"It is fair to call for the separation of church and state, but it goes on to prescribe requirements for the internal organisation of religious traditions."
"Moreover, the report is full of careless formulations."
"Our group has tabled amendments, which can improve the report to some extent."
"However, even if they were all adopted, there are many instances left of over-simplification, lack of editorial clarity, duplication, obligatory repetitions of EU legislation and proposals which fall outside our remit."
"In my country, representatives of human rights organisations, women's organisations, churches and women in churches have made an urgent appeal to vote against the report."
"One thing is certain: women and religion, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and Parliament, along with the fight against fundamentalism, deserve a better report than this one."
"Mr President, I am also perplexed by the fact that tradition and culture are always used as an argument at the expense of anything else."
"Historically, culture and tradition have put women into the situation of inequality they suffer today."
"The worst violations against women in the world are currently carried out on behalf of religious fundamentalism."
"Religious fundamentalism is also political and, when women and girls live under it, their lives tragically offer them no possibility of escape."
"In the name of the freedom of thought which the Members from the People's Party advocate, quite rightly, the Izquierdo report argues in favour of the separation of the powers of Church and State, that is, between religion and politics."
"That should be the report's most significant argument."
"Many women are awaiting our commitment on this issue."
"We must defend the values that we, men and women, espouse in order that we may live together in freedom."
"In the name of that freedom of choice and decision which is denied to the majority of women in the rest of the world."
"We do not agree with the exclusive determinism for women, which condemns them for the rest of their lives."
"It is not true that women can participate with the same dignity as men because they are excluded from practically everything which may give them that dignity."
"In the name of tradition, religion and fundamentalism, women are stoned, murdered and mutilated."
"As I have said, many women await our commitment and we cannot disappoint them."
"In the name of freedom of thought, we must vote in favour of this report."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Izquierdo Rojo because she touches on a very important and difficult problem in her report."
"To start with, as far as fundamentalism is concerned, I think that we have to analyse the concept outside the European Union."
"According to the Treaty, the European Union is a union of independent states."
"Religion is a purely private matter for each individual and keeping the faith is a personal decision for each individual, assuming of course that keeping the faith does not run counter to the basic principles which unite all the Member States of the European Union."
"On Women's Day recently, we discussed Muslim women in Europe."
"Islam is the second most important religion in the European Union today."
"The European Muslim women who spoke highlighted the fact that the Koran is interpreted solely by men."
"Women are never involved in interpreting the Koran."
"However, any interpretation of the Koran or any other religion in the European Union cannot be respected unless the basic laws and principles of the European Union are respected first."
"This means that the basic principle of equality of men and women is a principle on which any other priorities and principles must be founded."
"However, outside Europe, fundamentalism really is a very important problem, as many of the speakers have described."
"I think that identifying, describing and condemning the problem is very important, but Europe will be guilty by omission if it fails to take very specific measures to deal with it worldwide."
"The European Commission has proposed specific measures to mainstream the gender dimension in all forms of foreign policy, in external trade, in development aid, in all the European Union's individual agreements with third countries and at summits organised between the European Union and various continents, such as the Europe/Africa, Europe/Asia and Europe/Latin America summits."
"This proposal is quite specific."
"First, last year, as part of mainstreaming in all individual policies, the Commission presented the action plan on development relating to women."
"It contains very specific actions on how to take account of respect for women's human rights, the involvement of women in development aid and the development of each country, and how to apply this action plan, with incentives and, where necessary, with sanctions."
"Similarly, we are organising an initial seminar in March for experts from the 15 Member States and delegates invited from all over the world to debate a foreign policy action plan to be complied with by the European Union and the Member States."
"We are preparing a Council of Foreign Ministers in 2003 at which the main item on the agenda will be a foreign policy action plan and recommendations."
"This is a very important report because it focuses the debate on what is now one of the most serious issues at global level, the crime perpetrated against women on the grounds of religion or cultural mores, a crime which affects hundreds of millions of women."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0038/2002) by Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (Noise) (17th individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (10479/1/2001 - C5-0546/2001 - 1992/0449A(COD))"
"Mr President, I should like to begin with a comment on the Rules of Procedure, and I assume that the time it takes will not be deducted from my speaking time."
"I think we should try something new in Parliament today."
"What I envisage doing is dividing my five minutes in such a way that I am allowed to talk for four minutes to introduce the debate and for one minute to conclude it, once the Commissioner has made her speech. I propose this in the light of two factors."
"First of all, I understand that the Conference of Presidents had an 'away day' last week, when they decided to have more lively debates here in the House. The second factor is Rule 121, paragraph 4 of the Rules of Procedure."
"I asked the Sittings Directorate, before I came here today, if what I propose was possible."
"I was told flatly it was not, but I want to ask permission to do what I propose, given that there is nothing in the Rules of Procedure to prevent such a procedure."
"I therefore assume that you will be sympathetic towards organising matters in this way today."
"Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, of course I am not going to subtract the time you have spent on this request from your speaking time."
"I thank you for having chosen a moment when I am in the chair to carry out this kind of experiment, which makes my life much more enjoyable."
"I must say that I do not see any problem with your suggestion."
"If you speak as rapporteur and, after the Commissioner has spoken, you ask for the floor to make some point of detail in relation to what has taken place during the debate or what the Commissioner has said, I do not see any problem in our proceeding in that way."
"I would now ask you to take the floor, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, as rapporteur."
"Mr President, can I do the same if there is a problem?"
"If the Member replies and then there is a need for me to reply, can I do the same?"
"Commissioner, my understanding is that, in your capacity as representative of the Commission, you can request the floor whenever you like."
"Mr President, with regard once again to the Rules of Procedure, I want to say that my business following the debate is not to criticise anything the Commission has said but, rather, to comment on aspects of what my fellow MEPs here in the House have stated."
"I am now, then, embarking upon my speaking time."
"Noise is a major problem in European workplaces, and I believe it is important to emphasise that this directive is good for workers and that it does not affect anyone else."
"As has been discussed, there are many misunderstandings as to who is affected by this directive."
"We know that noise can have incredibly harmful effects."
"The possible effects of noise are very well documented."
"We are talking about tinnitus and permanent loss of hearing."
"I believe that combating noise in the workplace is the best thing we can do to prevent injury at work and to prevent employees being permanently excluded from the labour market."
"It has therefore surprised me a great deal during the debate on this issue in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that, for example, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, which normally attaches incredible importance to doing something for handicapped people in the EU, has not shown greater interest in efforts to prevent people from being handicapped by damage to their hearing, for that is at all events the best strategy of all."
"We also know that the existing noise directive from 1996 is out of date and does not provide employees with sufficient protection."
"The common position with which we are now being presented is far better, for an actual limit value is being introduced for the first time."
"It is an important step that such a common minimum level should be established for the whole of the EU."
"The amendments adopted by the committee improve the common position on a range of points, and I am pleased about the support which many have said they will give."
"The biggest improvement can be achieved if we set great store by the preventive strategy, and I believe that that is a right and proper principle."
"I turn now to the music and entertainment industry."
"This is a much discussed subject in connection with which the Group of the Party of European Socialists has entered into a compromise, by which we stand, with the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats."
"I must not, however, disguise the fact that this is an impairment of the common position, and it is interesting that we now see a European Parliament that attaches less importance to protecting employees than the Council of Ministers does."
"This is a new development, and I would ask the public to note the fact."
"We support the compromise proposal because it has been important to us to avoid having the common position rejected in the European Parliament."
"And, as we heard, there was a real risk of that happening."
"That would have been clearly unacceptable for, then, employees would only have been protected at the 1996 level."
"We have therefore accepted the compromise, and that of course also shows that we have been incredibly sympathetic to what the music and entertainment industry has told us in connection with this matter."
"I would also say to my fellow MEPs in the House that we have perhaps sometimes been too sympathetic."
"By that, I mean in fact that some MEPs have not been critical enough of what the industry has said."
"Rumours of the worst kind have circulated about this matter."
"I have been accused of wanting to close down the whole of the pop industry in Great Britain and of wanting to prohibit the bagpipes in Scotland."
"It is all complete and utter nonsense, of course."
"Naturally, we must listen to what society around us says, but that does not mean we simply have to roll over."
"We have a compromise proposal I can live with. I am in actual fact extremely satisfied with it."
"It will mean that the entertainment industry will only be covered by the directive after five years and, in the intervening period, we shall call upon the Commission to carry out an investigation of how the directive will affect the music and entertainment industry."
"The Commission will subsequently assess whether it is necessary to exempt the industry from the directive or to regulate it in some other way."
"I believe this compromise proposal will make it clear how much exaggeration there has been in this matter and also make it clear that even people in the music industry are very seriously affected by the damage to their hearing that we are in actual fact trying to combat."
"Finally, I wish to emphasise that I should like to have seen us achieve more in terms of improving workers' protection."
"That has not been possible, but what is now crucial is that, tomorrow, MEPs support those proposals which in actual fact improve the common position and ensure that we attach more importance to the preventive side."
"I urge all my fellow MEPs to support the proposals now tabled by the committee, together with the compromise proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, minimum health and safety standards are the core of European employee protection legislation."
"The harmful negative effects of noise exposure are scientifically documented and we do not need to discuss them in detail here."
"Noise-induced deafness is one of the most common occupational illnesses."
"Measures to protect workers from noise thus have a high priority."
"Everyone involved - workers, employers and legislators - should therefore seize every opportunity to keep noise pollution in the workplace as low as possible."
"With regard to reducing the noise levels which people voluntarily submit to during their leisure time, however, there is little we can do, other than appeal to the individual to exercise common sense."
"In agreeing protective measures for the workplace, however, we must also take account of the scope for their practical implementation - and especially the impact on small and medium-sized businesses."
"There is little point in adopting highly complex rules at European level if they cannot or will not be complied with in practice."
"In striking a balance, I believe that the amendments proposed by this House generally offer acceptable solutions."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur particularly for her willingness to compromise, which was already evident in the committee."
"This defused a potential conflict over a significant change to exposure limit values and action limit values, without sacrificing the justified interests of employees."
"With regard to the assessment of the noise exposure level, too, the provisions of the Council's common position on individual hearing protection should be maintained."
"We also endorse Amendment No 8, which states that Member States may lay down values which are lower than the exposure limit values and the action limit values laid down in this directive where this is necessary with regard to the health and safety of workers."
"This is entirely in line with the principle of minimum standards in European social policy."
"We also make it clear that the employer is responsible for enforcing the wearing of hearing protectors and the provision of individual training."
"As 'prevention is better than cure', a worker whose noise exposure exceeds the lower exposure action values will also be entitled to appropriate audiometric testing."
"The use of a weekly noise exposure level in place of the daily noise exposure level under certain conditions is sensible, as envisaged in the Council's common position."
"The aspect of this directive which triggered the most heated debate concerned the treatment of workers who are exposed to music, from classical/orchestral music to disco."
"In my view, we take adequate account of this special area in the compromise proposed in Amendment 23."
"I hope this is a solution which the Council can also endorse, for an immediate and unconditional inclusion of these events will hardly do justice to the general belief that music - whether in the concert hall or the night-club - is noise and should therefore be treated restrictively from the outset."
"Mr President, many congratulations to the rapporteur."
"She has produced a very well-balanced report."
"It proposes sensible amendments which will not impose unreasonable burdens on firms, but which will improve the directive and reduce the risk of hearing loss resulting from exposure to noise at work."
"That is what this proposal is all about."
"Too many workers within the European Union continue to be at risk of hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work."
"Mrs Thorning-Schmidt has shown herself to be reasonable and willing to listen to reasonable and reasoned argument and evidence."
"She did, after all, withdraw many of her initial amendments, tabling new ones which move closer to, or back to, the common position on a number of elements including key action and exposure limit values."
"But others in this House are straining to carve a new and retrograde path in the social field."
"For the first time in conciliation in the social field we are seeing moves, particularly on the right and centre groupings of the House, to weaken significantly common positions established in the Social Affairs Council, and even, at times, to exclude significant sectors of activity from the legislation altogether."
"We have seen this in relation to this proposal on noise and the parallel proposal on vibration."
"Compromise Amendment No 23 on the music and entertainment sectors is a response to such a danger."
"Do not get me wrong: it might conceivably be necessary to weaken the common position when new information or evidence previously overlooked comes to light, but in my view that has not been the case in the examples I mention."
"We have instead seen something tantamount to a panic response to concentrated, manipulative lobbying and adverse media coverage fed by deliberate disinformation and misinformation."
"These developments are to be deplored."
"At least two factors seem to be at work."
"Firstly, lobby groups have woken up to the pressure points in the codecision procedure."
"They know how to apply political pressure, much of it far from evidence-based, on Parliament."
"They think we are the weakest link, and the signal we are sending them is that they are absolutely correct."
"Secondly, too many Members of this House delight in issuing press releases seeking to trivialise legislation that is entirely necessary, justified and proportionate."
"They will not let facts get in the way of seeing their own name in print and it is not hard to see why so many ill-informed articles have appeared concerning this proposal."
"They have been fed by grossly misleading or totally factually incorrect press releases and briefings from Members of this House."
"I hope that we can all grow up quickly and bring a little more dignity and integrity to our role as co-legislator."
"My own father finds it difficult to converse with my infant son because of industrially-induced hearing loss."
"That seems to me a very good reason to promote sensible legislation like this."
"Mr President, if the rapporteur's original draft report had gone through and had been accepted, it would have decimated industry across the EU."
"Yes, by all means protect workers, but do not throw workers out of work!"
"It was essential that hearing protection should be taken into account, and I congratulate those industries and everybody else who convinced the rapporteur of the need to do so."
"If this had not been the case, with the exposure limit set at 87, hammering steel at 95-100 decibels, bottling at 98 decibels, and pig-feeding at 100 decibels would have ceased to exist, as would the construction and mining industries."
"Cement works and part of the engineering industry would have been decimated."
"I recognise that the rapporteur has moved and I welcome that."
"I welcome the fact that she has moved from daily measuring to weekly measuring in exceptional circumstances, but I would like her to move further to weekly measurements, to go back to the main body of the text as in the common position."
"I am very pleased that we have got the compromise amendment on music and leisure, whatever the rapporteur says: to have five years' exemption for the music and leisure industry, for the Commission to do a report, and then to come back to this House, but to consult with both sides of industry."
"I hope it goes through and I hope all MEPs will vote for it."
"Otherwise, we will have the ridiculous prospect of bar staff wearing ear-muffs when people go in to order a pint of beer."
"I am also glad that we have a chance to debate this because if it had been rejected on a second reading in committee, we would have had no chance to debate this today in the plenary session - no chance to put forward the amendment to exclude music and leisure for five years, and Parliament's view would not have been taken into account."
"So I say to those people who voted against the report in committee: if you had got your way, there is no way we would be standing here today."
"Mr President, I will start by expressing my amazement at the speech by Mr Hughes, whom I usually experience as being a reasonably logical and calm person and who suddenly, as soon as there is any objection to this directive, from whatever quarter, is of the opinion that sinister forces are at work."
"We are simply carrying out our task as parliamentarians and we listen to everyone, including people who are not directly involved in the process that leads to directives."
"In my view, this Parliament is not indifferent to the cause of health and safety, nor to objections concerning the implementation thereof."
"I am therefore delighted that we can conclude the second reading of the noise directive - forgive me for not using the correct title of the directive - this week."
"According to the Dutch official dictionary, noise is defined as a harsh, unpleasant sound, including background noise, din, racket, roar and commotion."
"In other words, it is a noise which any right-minded person will experience as disagreeable and which we can do without."
"I am therefore astounded, even dismayed - and many a composer will be turning in their graves - that Beethoven is being likened to a drill."
"According to the Council, the Commission and a number of fellow MEPs, being subjected to the noise of a hefty circular saw is actually worse than Tchaikovsky."
"I do understand that this is not merely about whether the noise is irritating, but also whether it is harmful."
"What I should like to point out is that different types of noise justify a differentiated approach."
"I am of the opinion that the music and entertainment industry should fall outside the scope of this directive and be regulated in a separate directive."
"The fundamental difference between noise and Vivaldi is as follows: in the music and entertainment industry, sound is the ultimate product, or at least an important component thereof."
"Sound plays a central role in this industry."
"Noise in a factory is a negative side-effect, which makes no difference to the end result of the activity - quite the reverse, in fact - if it is not there."
"Music involves customers; it involves activities of great cultural value, especially for young people."
"We would not prevent professional footballers from playing in excess of 45 minutes per week, would we?"
"That is the difference; that is what matters; we found a response to it other than levelling unjustified criticism at this side of the House, as though we have no care for musical technique."
"We have, but we also care about the people concerned."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our European constitution, our Treaties, state that we are responsible for improving the workplace environment in order to protect the health of employees."
"I have the impression that this has often been forgotten, especially in the context of this public debate."
"The ignorance of the press - sometimes the quality press - also confirms this view."
"In addition to the usual objections from industry, massive lobbying was, of course, carried out by the music industry as well - not the dark forces, but quite specifically the music industry."
"This outcry raises three interesting points."
"Firstly: The general public's lack of awareness that since 1986, employees in the music industry have been covered by a directive which is still in force."
"All employees are covered, except for seamen."
"This is now being rectified."
"Secondly: It reveals the lack of monitoring in the Member States, for if better monitoring had been carried out, the groups affected - employers and employees - would not be in such a state of shock today."
"Thirdly: It also shows, of course - and I say this critically - the very poor representation of employees' interests."
"I would like to send the Commission a copy of a letter which I received from the Swiss Musicians Federation about a hearing in 1996, which shows very clearly, Mr Pronk, that damage to hearing is always to be taken seriously, regardless of whether someone works in the construction industry, ceramics, or a music company or orchestra."
"(Interjection: Or even in Parliament!)"
"Or even in Parliament, but fortunately, most of our colleagues are not as noisy as that!"
"Of course, there are rules at national level."
"As a left-wing traditionalist, too, I believe that the state and the employer have a duty to protect workers from workplace hazards."
"This is precisely our task, and in my view, with this directive, we have achieved this goal."
"Mr President, the rapporteur has come a long way in recent weeks in terms of dumping some of her more extreme amendments."
"However, I take little comfort from this."
"I hope the rapporteur will not take this personally, as I know how much thought and work she has put into the report."
"However, in my view, the amendments that remain are neither necessary nor helpful."
"This is not just my own view."
"I am delighted to see the extent to which Mrs Lynne echoed this view so powerfully a few moments ago."
"In the words of the UK Health and Safety Executive, the body set up to give the UK Government the expert and impartial scientific advice so necessary when dealing with such issues, these amendments provide ""no benefit for health and safety and their sole effect will be to place unnecessary and unwelcome burdens on industry, particularly on small firms""."
"The Executive advises us to oppose most of the Socialist amendments."
"Independently, UK Conservative MEPs had come to the identical conclusion."
"One of these is Amendment No 18, which I see the trade unions are supporting, while curiously claiming that many employers support it, too."
"I have not come across a single employer who supports this."
"It will be interesting to see whether UK Labour MEPs vote as their government has advised or their trade unions have instructed."
"I suspect the answer will be no surprise."
"We shall be supporting the amendment to exempt music from the directive, an amendment originally conceived by my colleague Mr Pronk."
"However, that still leaves us with the problems facing industry if other amendments also pass."
"It is very telling that in the week EU leaders are in Barcelona, calling for EU businesses to become more competitive, and on the very day that the UK Prime Minister, Mr Blair, is spinning the line that he is so much against red tape, his Socialist MEPs continue to pursue the same old agenda, regardless of the impact on jobs."
"I urge them, even at this late stage, to vote against these amendments, to vote for jobs, to vote for reform and to vote for Barcelona."
"Mr President, I shall begin my short intervention by thanking the rapporteur for the work she has done."
"Having said this, I will express my views on certain points of the report which, in my humble opinion, could have been dealt with differently, and on amendments and proposals which are difficult to accept, above all by professionals in the field of prevention; of course on the basis of the view that there is no such thing as zero risk and that work is an unpleasant activity."
"I agree with the rapporteur that combating noise in the workplace is the best thing we can do, but I do not agree that collective protection measures should always have priority over individual protection measures."
"In any event, I believe that they are complementary or supplementary, or that individual measures should be applied rather than collective ones."
"We must consider the distribution of responsibilities; it clearly falls to the employer to provide the means, and it is they who have the disciplinary policy measures to ensure they are complied with, but the worker is no less responsible, and cannot ignore their responsibility, since they are the first to be affected if they do not adopt individual and personal protection measures."
"I also disagree with you somewhat with regard to the scope, since I believe that, rather than talking about including the self-employed within the scope, it would be preferable to include them by means of the concept of workplaces and the person responsible for them, particularly in view of the increasingly frequent externalisation of many activities in numerous work sectors."
"Amendment No 15 deals with an issue which is perhaps purely grammatical."
"Where it speaks of hearing protection measures 'likely to be used', I believe we should say 'of mandatory use'."
"Furthermore, there are activities involving a different intensity of sound at different times, which must be considered and resolved."
"I liked what the rapporteur said about music."
"All of this, Mr President, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, must be done from the point of view of providing quality employment with less risk to the health and safety of workers, and this objective demands legislation which is clear in its principles and in its wording."
"Mr President, I should like, first, to congratulate Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, because she has dealt with what is, both technically and politically, a very difficult issue."
"Just how difficult this issue is can be seen from the fact that the amended proposal has been pending before the Council since 1994 and the first part of the proposal on mechanical vibration is only now ready for discussion by the joint legislators."
"We put health and safety at the top of the social agenda and we have undertaken to improve protection for workers' health and safety by bringing the directive which already exists - 86/188 - into line with Framework Directive 89/391 and updating some of its provisions."
"I should like to point out that some of the proposals we have heard take us behind the current framework and the specific directive which already exists."
"Loss of hearing is clearly the most widely-known harmful effect of noise."
"It is the most serious, but not the only effect."
"And as far as compensation for workers who have suffered the consequences of occupational illnesses are concerned, one-third concerns hearing problems."
"In five countries in which studies have been carried out - Holland, Portugal, Spain, France and Germany - compensation for hearing problems costs EUR 96 billion a year."
"The Commission has accepted the Council's common position in that it enhances the level of protection set out in the Commission proposal."
"The reduction in the exposure limit value from 96 db to 87 db is clearly good progress."
"The Commission fully accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 20 and 22, which improve the quality of the text and clarify its meaning."
"The Commission partly accepts Amendments Nos 4, 15, 16 and 19 and rejects Amendments Nos 3, 5, 13 and 21, together with Amendments Nos 23 and 25."
"Although I agree with the idea behind Amendment No 3, the second part of Amendment No 4, Amendment No 5, Amendment No 13 and the second part of Amendment No 16, the Commission cannot accept them for reasons of consistency and legislative procedure."
"The Commission also rejects Amendment No 21, because it feels that the manner in which the Member States obtain access to the relevant medical and scientific advice is a question of subsidiarity."
"Finally on the question of compromise Amendments Nos 23 and 25, which temporarily exclude music and entertainment from the scope of the proposal, the Commission is strongly opposed to this derogation because there is no scientific justification for it."
"Applying health and safety measures to the music market will affect 3 to 5 million workers in Europe."
"Factory noise has been compared with the noise from music or concerts. I think the figures speak for themselves."
"Musicians constantly performing in concert are continually exposed to noise levels as high as 130 db."
"Constant exposure to this noise gradually gives them problems with their hearing, without which they cannot do their job."
"I should also like to remind the House that HINDREC, the European Association of Industry, Hotels and Restaurants, agrees with the proposal currently on the table."
"And there is another statistic I should like to give you: the noise level in small pubs is in the order of 75 db, that is, well below the limit value of 90 already set."
"If you surf the Internet you will see all these new aids, which are very different from standard ear muffs. Basically what they do is to reduce the sound to which each worker is exposed to a level set by the worker, so that they can do their job without suffering this gradual deterioration in their hearing."
"Finally, I should like to remind the House that there are another two physical agents in the workplace, optical radiation and electromagnetic fields, and that we need to start work on the next two directives, which are also very important and affect large numbers of workers."
"Mr President, two things. First of all, I should like to tell the Commission that I am pleased about the amendments that are being supported."
"I am rather annoyed that the Commission has not thought along the same lines as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs regarding Amendments Nos 3 and 5, because they specifically emphasise the efforts at prevention I tried to emphasise in my speech."
"I therefore hope that the Commission will reconsider them."
"I would also ask the Commission to give us a little help today in responding to something said by Mr Bushill-Matthews and Mr Pronk."
"Could the Commission first of all explain to these gentlemen that there is also something called sustainable development within employment and that, when we talk about wanting a proper working environment and proper health and safety regulations, what in actual fact we want is a sustainable labour market from which people are not excluded?"
"Mr Bushill-Matthews must also agree with me that, in the long term, what is economically most sustainable is not to have a whole lot of people sitting on the 'reserve bench'."
"And, talking about a 'reserve bench', I also wish to address Mr Pronk and ask the Commission to help me a little."
"Could the Commission explain to Mr Pronk once and for all that people who play football or go to football matches will not be affected by this directive?"
"And perhaps we could also, once and for all, have the lobbyists locked out of this House."
"Mrs Diamantopoulou, do you wish to make any comment?"
"No."
"Thank you very much."
"The vote is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the Commission communication on unfair practices by airlines of third countries."
"Mrs de Palacio has the floor."
"Mr President, I am pleased to announce to the House that the Commission has decided to propose to the Council and the European Parliament a Regulation on the adoption of legal measures to react against the unfair competition practiced by third-country air companies receiving State aid."
"We have all seen over recent months how, owing to several different circumstances, third-country air companies have received large amounts of public subsidy which in many cases have been used to lower fares and create unfair competition on routes on which European Union air companies compete."
"This has created a legal vacuum which has placed our companies at an unfair advantage in comparison with the companies of third countries."
"In order to provide ourselves with instruments which can allow us to defend and support our air sector, which is absolutely strategic for the European Union, we are going to propose, and today we have adopted, the proposed regulation on predatory practices within the framework of air transport services."
"In the field of sea transport there is already legislation to combat charges which create unfair competition and in other areas, such as aid granted in the manufactured goods sector, we have other instruments."
"Ladies and gentlemen, all of this is for a very simple reason: because the air services sector is not included within the multilateral agreements of the World Trade Organisation."
"In this regard, it is a question of establishing forms of compensation to counter the advantages that the use of this State aid or non-commercial advantages represent for these third-country companies to the detriment of our companies."
"I believe that it is a balanced regulation which contains - as you will see when you analyse it - a definition of what its principles are, of what is meant by guaranteeing fair competition, of what is understood to be unfair charging practice and establishes a procedure which guarantees that in no event will there be either overcompensation nor advantageous actions."
"In this respect, by means of a complaint or simply as a matter of routine, it is proposed that the Commission should open an investigation to determine whether or not there is unfairness in the charges implemented by third companies, and, in accordance with the particular situation, there will either be an agreement with the country or with the relevant company, or, if not, measures may be taken, either provisional, for 6 months, or permanent, until such a time as there is a change by the relevant third countries or companies."
"I believe that this is absolutely essential if we are to genuinely guarantee that we are going to prevent unfair competition and our air sector being affected by State aid or non-commercial advantages."
"Mr President, I think the Commission is right to take action in this direction because we, as the European Union, need legal tools to deal with the specific issue of unfair competition from third countries."
"Of course we shall be examining the Commission proposal in the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and studying the details, but I should like now to ask you three very brief questions."
"First, have you already got evidence or at least received accusations from various European companies of unfair competition from third countries, America, Switzerland or other countries which we read about in the press from time to time?"
"Secondly, you referred to measures to be taken by the European Union in such cases."
"What sort of measures are to be taken and how do they stand in relation to the transatlantic agreements already in existence on which the Advocate-General of the European Court has already expressed an opinion?"
"In other words, how do the bilateral agreements stand in relation to the European Commission's multilateral measures?"
"Thirdly, a question which bears no relation to this issue but is highly topical and, if you wish, you can answer us."
"What is to be done about covering the European airlines' insurance premiums?"
"Cover expires at the end of March."
"What is the European Commission's position on this?"
"I would ask all honourable Members, if they can - and I believe this is possible - to summarise their questions in no longer than one minute."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I would simply like to pose two questions to supplement the comments made by Mr Hatzidakis."
"If we call for new instruments, the question we will be asked is this: What are we doing with the existing instruments, and why are they not sufficient?"
"That is the reason for my two supplementary questions."
"Firstly: Do we not already have the option of taking action against Switzerland?"
"I believe that what Switzerland has done with regard to the restructuring of Swissair into Crossair, Swiss Airlines or whatever is clearly a subsidy case."
"Even if the treaty has not yet been ratified, there must be opportunities outside the treaty to proceed against Switzerland."
"When will you do so?"
"Secondly: If we take action against unfair practices relating to ticket dumping outside the EU, can you tell us what you propose to do to combat internal price dumping within the European Union in the immediate future?"
"There are increasingly frequent cases of airlines offering tickets below cost price in order to control the market."
"Do you intend to tackle this problem as well?"
"Mr President, I have a quick question for the Commissioner regarding the point of providing proof."
"If a third country does not provide the information that is required to discover whether they are involved in unfair competitive practices, what would the Commission do?"
"Mr President, I shall be very brief."
"It is true that two companies have caused this situation, one quite directly and the other in a more general way."
"It is also true that various ministers, in their speeches at the last Council and in a letter that they have sent to me, have expressed their concern at the situation."
"I repeat, however, that although there have been no complaints, this proposal will enable the Commission to take formal action."
"With regard to the transatlantic agreements, the problem is that, at the moment, there is no EU-US agreement, for example."
"There are only bilateral agreements with Member States of the Union, and these do not contain clauses that, in general, provide for the resolution of these situations of unfair competition."
"Where insurance is concerned, the situation, in principle, has not changed."
"We still maintain that on 31 March, the special guarantee for the provision of insurance by the Member States will end for new risks related to terrorism or to war."
"Nevertheless, the Transport Council is due to look at this issue and consider practices in the United States and in Japan, because a normal insurance market will not function unless the United States and Japan and their airlines are also involved."
"I wish to thank Mr Jarzembowski and Hatzidakis for their questions."
"I should like to say to Mr Jarzembowski that this measure will work against any third country that grants State aid which is used by its companies to distort competition and which, therefore, encourages unfair competition."
"As for Switzerland, ladies and gentlemen, you are all aware that the transport agreement has still not entered into force, not through any fault of Switzerland, but because of the three European Union countries that have not yet ratified it."
"The fact of the matter is that we do not know how long this situation will take to be resolved."
"In any event, also with regard to Switzerland, we must be adequately covered from the legal point of view."
"I should like to reply to Mrs Foster's question on proof."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in all of these types of mechanism, the States involved must provide proof."
"Sometimes, third countries are reluctant to do this."
"One possibility is that compensatory rights could be imposed, to be paid by companies engaged in unfair competition, to compensate for and eliminate this unfair competition."
"These rights will be limited to artificial price lowering, but under no circumstances can this lead to additional costs to what is a reasonable fare, as defined in the texts we are debating."
"I forgot to say in my answer to Mr Jarzembowski that we are investigating unfair competition within the European Union, when it occurs and, to be specific, at the moment we are looking at a problem concerning the use of an airport in Belgium."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I would like to ask you this: What influence do airport duties have on these practices?"
"Mr President, I withdraw the question I was going to ask because it has already been put by Mr Hatzidakis and Mr Jarzembowski."
"I thank the Commissioner for her communication but I would like her to say what she means by 'unfair competition' because I did not fully understand this point."
"Unfair practice occurs when an airline that has received State aid in its own country does not use this aid to cover a certain type of cost but to artificially lower prices on routes in which it is in competition with European Union airlines."
"With regard to the receipt of airport taxes, one way of receiving these compensatory rights, would be to impose a surcharge on airport taxes."
"Thank you very much, Mrs de Palacio."
"That concludes this item."
"The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0008/2002)."
"Part I"
"Question No 34 by José María Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado (H-0079/02):"
"Subject: International adoption of Romanian children"
"What action is being taken by the Commission (and, in particular, by its representative in Bucharest) in order to ensure that the review of the cases involving the international adoption of children which the Romanian Government suspended over nine months ago is carried out promptly?"
"Is the Commission aware that such suspension is having a serious effect on the hundreds of Community families who have applied to adopt children on the basis of full guarantees and who have paid out substantial sums of money?"
"What action is the Commission intending to take in order to protect the rights of those people?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, child protection in Romania is one of the most important issues arising within the framework of cooperation between the Commission and Romania, and it is an issue which I myself have also dealt with regularly and pro-actively since the start of my term in office."
"There is no doubt that there have been serious problems in Romania regarding the protection of children in state-run institutions and also regarding the system of international adoptions."
"Romania has signed the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Hague Convention on Protection of Children."
"The Hague Convention signatory states have joined with us in expressing their frequent concerns to the Romanian Government about the very serious shortcomings in the Romanian legislation and procedures governing adoption and the way in which they are implemented in practice."
"I must tell you, Mr Gil-Robles, that I personally had no choice but to acknowledge that in Romania, there has been a very high incidence of commercial trafficking of children - which is just about the worst crime imaginable - but that on the other hand, adoptions have of course also taken place entirely in accordance with the proper procedures, and that a substantial grey area between the trafficking of children and normal international adoptions has existed."
"The Commission therefore brought intensive pressure to bear on the Romanian Government to embark on a radical overhaul of the entire system, starting with the legislation and including the institutions, structures, procedures and decision-making channels - indeed, every aspect of the process."
"Nothing in Romania's system of international adoptions could possibly remain as it was."
"To ensure that no abuse of children can occur while these reforms are under way, the Commission resolutely supported the imposition of a moratorium on international adoptions."
"I am very pleased to say that the present Romanian Government has succeeded in enforcing this moratorium."
"It is not the Commission's policy to block international adoptions."
"Quite the contrary - the Commission's policy is to help ensure that these international adoptions take place within a system which is entirely transparent, conforms with internationally recognised rules, and excludes any possibility that a single case of child abuse could occur."
"I hope that appropriate legislation and administrative procedures will be put in place in Romania within the near future so that the normal systems governing international adoptions can be resumed."
"The cases which you referred to in your question, Mr Gil-Robles, and which had already been initiated but where a decision was still pending when the moratorium was imposed are being examined by the Romanian Government on a case-by-case basis, and if it is quite clear that there are no problems with the adoption, the Romanian Government has the option of suspending the moratorium in these individual cases."
"I believe that this will help to resolve the problem you describe."
"However, let me say again, Mr Gil-Robles, even though this may not be welcome in some quarters: in striking a balance between protecting children in Romania and the needs of prospective parents - whichever country they may live in - our first priority must always be to protect the child."
"I think it is quite reasonable to say to families who wish to welcome an adopted child into their lives that they have to wait another few months, rather than run the risk that even a single case of the corruption which was rife in Romania's child protection system could recur."
"Commissioner, I have listened to you with the utmost respect, but there is another question I wish to put to you: why did the Commission, in the EC-Romania Association Council meeting, oppose that Council asking the Romanian authorities to pass this legislation, which they promised for the end of last year, as rapidly as possible?"
"We have had a moratorium in place since June 2001 and the Romanian Government has formally declared that this legislation would be ready by the end of last year."
"According to my information, however, although it has been approved by the Council of Ministers, it has not been submitted to Parliament and is still floating around, no one knows exactly where."
"I am surprised that the Commission, whose intentions the Commissioner has expressed very clearly, is not attempting to kick-start this process."
"I fully agree that the priority must be the children's welfare, but this will not improve by holding up legislation that will enable international adoptions to take place. The way to improve their welfare is to push ahead, as quickly as possible, with this legislation, and not to leave these children in the orphanages until that happens."
"Mr Gil-Robles, I regret to say that we appear to be at odds over this matter."
"Firstly, as regards the Association Council, there was full agreement between the Member States and the Commission on what we should say about this issue, and also between the Presidency and the Commission."
"There were no conflicts here; rather, there was a common position."
"On the fundamental issue, let me reiterate: our policy is clear and unequivocal."
"The child's interests are the priority."
"Until the system in Romania guarantees that international adoptions take place in accordance with our required standards, I shall continue to oppose any re-opening of the gates to allow international adoptions to take place without restrictions."
"I have said to you that special permission may be granted in cases when adoptions had already been initiated before the moratorium came into force."
"The Commission will vigorously resist - I repeat - vigorously resist any situation in which the corruption which we witnessed in Romania has any chance of re-emerging."
"I repeat, I believe it is better to tell prospective parents that they must wait a little longer until we have a system which provides an absolute guarantee of protection to the children, rather than run any kind of risk."
"I should like to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen and his staff for the consistent concern and attention they have shown with regard to this important issue."
"Is the Commissioner aware that 93% of Romanian people are against inter-country adoption as a solution for abandoned children in Romania, as is the Romanian Government, and that the Romanian Orthodox Church to which 89% of Romanian citizens belong, wholly opposes such a practice?"
"Is he further aware that the payments made by these Spanish families have gone to Romanian foster families over a period of time, and thus these children are not officially abandoned according to international conventions, particularly the UN Convention, which has been ratified by the governments of all the Member States, including Spain and therefore forms a part of the acquis communautaire?"
"Baroness Nicholson, I am aware of the problems you describe, and I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the very resolute and determined action by the Commission with regard to the protection of children in Romania has resulted, not least, from the consistent pressure applied by the European Parliament."
"It was this House which repeatedly called on the Commission to reject any compromises on the protection of Romanian children, and the Commission is firmly adhering to this course."
"I fully agree with Baroness Nicholson that international adoptions are by no means the best instrument to protect children."
"Nonetheless, I believe that in the Romanian case, they are an option which we should not rule out entirely."
"Mr President, I agree with Commissioner Verheugen when he says that the most important aspect of this type of case is the welfare of the Romanian children."
"There are, perhaps, two aspects of this matter that need to be raised: firstly, is Romania adequately protecting its children?"
"Are there any alternative systems?"
"Can the European Commission adopt measures to guarantee improvements in the way these children are treated?"
"Secondly, since Mr Verheugen is a member of a Commission that represents the countries of the European Union, has the Commission adopted measures to ensure that, in the event that international adoptions take place involving citizens of Community countries, guarantees will be provided in the reception countries for Romanian children to be treated appropriately, in accordance with international law, Community law and with the national law of the Member States?"
"Commission. (DE) Mr Medina Ortega, on the first point, I can tell you that the Commission has allocated substantial human and financial resources to improving conditions in Romania's childcare institutions for many years."
"I am sure that everyone in this House is aware of the appalling conditions in these institutions directly after the revolution, and, indeed, for many years afterwards."
"Thanks to the help we provided, much of it as pre-accession funds, steady improvements in the situation have been achieved."
"Nonetheless, we are still a long way from a situation which we could describe as satisfactory."
"This is why these measures will be continued on an intensive basis."
"On the second point, I fully agree with you."
"This is precisely the aim of our efforts in Romania and in conjunction with the Romanian Government - to ensure that the system governing international adoptions is fully and unequivocally in line with the standards required by the European Union and international law."
"Question No 35 by Proinsias De Rossa (H-0097/02):"
"Subject: Chemical and electro-shock technology"
"Given recent concerns over the use of chemical and electro-shock technology in torture and human rights violations, how many companies manufacturing such equipment have received the CE quality mark?"
"Also, what is the process by which the CE mark is awarded to such products, and is the ethical question of how this technology is to be used considered as well as the safety of the user of the product?"
"Further, what research is used by the Commission as the basis for the decision to award the quality mark?"
"The CE conformity marking was introduced into Community legislation by a Council decision of 1990 concerning the models for the various phases of the conformity assessment procedures which I intended to be used in the technical harmonisation directives, and by the Council directive of 1993."
"The latter introduced the CE marking into a number of sectoral technical harmonisation directives."
"The CE conformity marking must be affixed to any product falling within the scope of a technical harmonisation directive providing for it."
"It signifies that the product complies with the legally binding requirements of the applicable technical harmonisation directive."
"The manufacturer is responsible for affixing the CE conformity marking, although the directives often require the intervention of a third-party conformity-assessment body."
"Member States are responsible for the designation of such bodies in accordance with the applicable provisions of the directives."
"A number of services in the Commission are responsible for technical harmonisation directives providing for the CE conformity marking, although most fall under the responsibility of DG Enterprise."
"However, the Commission intervenes directly neither in the process of evaluating the conformity of products nor in the award of the CE conformity marking."
"All manufacturers of stun weapons falling within the scope of the technical harmonisation directives providing for the CE conformity marking must affix this marking to the relevant products."
"The Commission does not have information about the number of manufacturers involved."
"The Commission has already replied to this issue in 1997. The question was then posed by Mrs Wemheuer."
"The Commission then noted that a wide variety of equipment could potentially be used for the purpose of torture."
"Moreover, it is not always possible to determine in advance to what use such equipment will be put."
"I am therefore of the opinion that it is not feasible to apply a different treatment in the context of these directives to equipment that could potentially be used as an instrument of torture."
"Nevertheless, and in order to take account of the concerns of the honourable Member of Parliament, the Commission, and especially the Director-General for External Relations is currently preparing a proposal for a Council regulation concerning trade in equipment which may be used for torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."
"The aim of this regulation is, inter alia, to impose controls on exports of equipment which may be used for such purposes in a third country, which will in principle include electric shock equipment."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply and I welcome the proposal to prepare a new regulation."
"Could you indicate to me when you expect this regulation to become effective?"
"Would you not also agree that, while there is obviously some equipment which may or may not be used for torture, stun gun equipment is made to deliberately inflict pain on the person against whom it is used; that up to 50 000 volts can be delivered to a person by a stun gun or by the stun belts which are also used; and that it is inappropriate for equipment of this kind which is marketed by the manufacturers of these torture weapons to carry an EU quality mark as a sign of EU approval of these particular instruments of torture?"
"I can inform the honourable Member that I will pass on the question of the timing of the regulation to my colleague, Mr Patten."
"As far as the other questions are concerned, a recent report by Amnesty International says that stun guns are not used for torture or ill-treatment by the police or prison guards within the European Union."
"The use of stun guns is for self-defence and riot control is not in question."
"The other issues you raised must be reviewed in the context of this regulation."
"I shall be ready to inform Parliament once I have obtained more detailed information from my colleague and his departments."
"Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen."
"This is not the time to enter into a debate, Mr De Rossa."
"According to the Rules of Procedure, the same Member may not ask further questions."
"If another Member wishes to ask a supplementary question, he or she may do so, but you may not."
"We shall, therefore, proceed to the following question."
"Question No 36 by Niall Andrews, which has been taken over by Mr Brian Crowley (H-0126/02):"
"Subject: Halting the stoning-to-death of Nigerian mother Safiya Yakuba Hussaini"
"As the Commission is well aware, there is growing alarm at the threatened stoning-to-death of Nigerian mother, Safiya Yakuba Hussaini."
"Will the Commission state what, if any, representations it has made to the Nigerian authorities seeking to halt this horrific sentence, what weight it therefore attaches to its programme for the support of human rights and democracy and the new Cotonou Partnership Agreement, and will it make a statement on this matter, including the need to concentrate on measures aimed at improving the status of women in Nigeria, which remains an on-going issue for EU-Nigeria relations."
"Mr President, the Commission has made representations to the Nigerian Ambassador in Brussels with regard to this case and President Prodi has appealed directly to President Obasanjo to intervene."
"The developments in this case are also being followed closely by the Commission Delegation in Abuja."
"An appeal has been lodged by the defendant and will be heard on 18 March 2002."
"In the meantime, the sentence has been suspended by the Islamic Appeal Court of Sokoto."
"The European Union is strongly opposed to the use of the death penalty."
"With a view to attaining the prime objective of abolishing the death penalty where it still exists, the EU calls for its use to be progressively restricted and made subject to minimum standards."
"The EU is also pressing for moratoria to be introduced where relevant."
"The Troika recently made a demarche on the application of the death penalty in Nigeria."
"The Commission is seeking to end the practice of public and particularly cruel executions pursued in certain Islamic countries."
"In the case of Nigeria, the Commission will work through the framework of the Cotonou Agreement, two of the fundamental conditions of which are respect for human rights and equality between men and women."
"Where these conditions are not met, the Agreement allows for a process of political dialogue between the national authorities and the Commission."
"The country support strategy for Nigeria has identified the strengthening of democracy and respect for human rights as areas requiring action and corresponding programmes will soon be forthcoming, including programmes to improve the status of women."
"In addition, within the framework of the Community budget, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights includes Nigeria as a ""focal country""."
"Nigeria is eligible for support for measures in the field of good governance and this will have a positive impact on the status of women by raising awareness among them of their legal rights."
"A project is currently under way to strengthen civil society, especially in northern Nigeria."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response."
"It is a delicate time, whilst an appeal is going on, to be raising what are emotive issues and I understand how difficult it is for you, Commissioner, to give a full outline of what action the Commission would take in future if the death penalty were to be imposed."
"However, could I take this opportunity to ensure that, with the good offices of the Commission, and utilising the partnership agreements we have with Nigeria, there will be a greater understanding, not only of the respect for human rights, but also of our total abhorrence of the death penalty in any form, whether it be by electric chair or by stoning or by any other method."
"I would have this strength of feeling with regard to America, as much as with Nigeria or any other country in the world that continues to use the death penalty."
"If possible, could the Commission make resources available to make sure this woman has proper legal representation to guarantee that she has a fair hearing and that every resource is utilised to save her life?"
"Efforts to increase awareness of the rights of people within the framework of Sharia law are part of all the work we do, especially relating to the situation of women."
"We are, in Nigeria, focusing a major part of our development cooperation at state level on a number of states."
"This brings us closer to the authorities, and also, in some cases, closer to some of the states where Sharia law has been instituted."
"We are trying to position ourselves in a manner which makes a meaningful discussion possible."
"The broader issue of the death penalty is quite clear."
"It is a global issue and I am sure it is something which we all agree on."
"Finally, let me add that I very much appreciate the Member's approach and his tone given the fact that we are at a sensitive stage in the case in question."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am very grateful for your reply and relieved that the Commission has acted so swiftly in this matter."
"The punishment of the woman in question was based on Islamic law."
"An unmarried woman had become pregnant, by all accounts as the result of rape."
"The question as I see it, however, is not just the status of women, but an attempt at power politics, where Islam is being used in Nigeria to stir up the feelings of the people and create artificial disputes, as I have brought to the attention of the Commission in my earlier written questions."
"I would now like to ask whether the Commission has considered any tools that might be used through our policy on development cooperation to lessen this ever-growing exploitation of religious tension."
"This will, in any case, be the theme of the analysis of what we can do."
"I should warn, however, against the perception that our development cooperation activities with a given country make it possible for us to influence events of this kind profoundly."
"The introduction of Sharia law in a number of northern states in Nigeria is a complex and highly political process with local roots."
"We have a shared framework of values as expressed in the Cotonou Agreement."
"This is what we can discuss and pursue with the Government of Nigeria."
"This is not an easy case, but it is one in which the widespread public attention it has attracted and international public opinion can really be of use."
"We at the Commission will do what we can to help exert pressure."
"Question No 37 by Karin Riis-Jørgensen (H-0148/02):"
"Subject: Take-over bids"
"Does the Commission believe that European companies will be given a disincentive to be listed on stock exchanges - and the development of efficient equity markets impeded - if the EU introduces a break through rule de facto eliminating shareholders' multiple voting rights in the event of takeovers as proposed by the High Level Group of Company Law Experts?"
"Does the Commission believe that owners of shares with multiple voting rights would suffer a loss if the EU introduces a break through rule de facto eliminating shareholder's multiple voting rights in the event of the takeovers as proposed by the High Level Group of Company Law Experts?"
"The Commission wishes to thank the honourable Member for her questions and her interest in the Commission's work concerning the matter of takeover bids."
"It is still, however, a bit early for the Commission to provide final answers to those questions."
"The Commission has launched a thorough examination of the recommendations made by the Group of High Level Company Law Experts relating to takeover bids and has consulted interested parties in order to decide whether and how such recommendations could be included in a new proposal for a directive."
"The Commission is aware of the criticism raised by certain Member States regarding the specific recommendation on multiple voting rights and the possible loss of certain rights after a takeover bid via the ""breakthrough"" mechanism."
"The Commission will, wherever possible, do its utmost to take account of the various opinions expressed during this phase of informal consultation with all interested parties."
"I am afraid I can say no more at this moment, but no doubt Mrs Riis-Jörgensen, the committee of which she is a member and myself will engage in dialogue as soon as a more concrete proposal has been formulated."
"I would also like to ask Mrs Riis-Jörgensen to contain her impatience until then."
"Commissioner Bolkestein, women are not very patient but I will try to be patient and wait for you to come up with proposals which, hopefully, will balance all the interests you have mentioned."
"I look forward to a thorough discussion and cooperation."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen. That is very kind of you."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Second part"
"Questions to Commissioner Lamy"
"Question No 38 by Paul Rübig (H-0135/02):"
"Subject: Impact of the WTO disputes settlement procedure on SMUs"
"In paragraph 39 of the report on openness and democracy in world trade, which the European Parliament adopted in October 2001, Members expressed concern at the direct and grave effects of some WTO dispute settlement cases on undertakings throughout Europe, particularly SMUs."
"Parliament called on the Commission to take concrete steps, both within the EU and at the WTO, to give such undertakings legal recourse to seek compensation."
"What concrete steps has the Commission so far taken to this end?"
"What steps are planned?"
"What is the Commission's view of the call for WTO punitive duties to be paid from the general budgets of WTO Members rather than by private enterprise?"
"The question concerns the impact of the WTO disputes settlement procedure on small- and medium-sized undertakings."
"As you know, the WTO disputes settlement procedure is essential in ensuring that the multilateral trade system is secure and predictable."
"The suspension of trade concessions, which are sometimes wrongly referred to as sanctions, is the last resort for a State which uses the dispute settlement procedure where the State that is at fault has breached either the agreements or the decisions taken under the WTO dispute settlement procedure."
"From our point of view, the main benefit of the system for European businesses, including SMUs, is that it applies great pressure to respect the rules of the World Trade Organisation."
"This is the main benefit for our businesses, and therefore for SMUs too."
"There are, without doubt, cases where the international agreements have been breached and these must, of course, continue to be the exception."
"On this point, we believe that compensation must be preferable to the withdrawal of trade concessions and, within the framework of the WTO, compensation, which is a voluntary measure agreed by the plaintiff State, is a better option."
"In addition, this measure is only provisional."
"Otherwise, the system would not be as secure and predictable."
"I should like to give you two examples."
"Firstly, in the case of hormone-treated beef, we effectively lost a case at the WTO."
"The Commission submitted a proposal for a directive in 2000."
"We also hope, and I want to make this clear to the House, that the co-legislators are going to take a close interest in this."
"We regret that this is not the case at the moment."
"In the meantime, we are conducting negotiations with the United States to find an interim solution which, broadly speaking, would enable them to export greater quantities of hormone-free beef."
"This is a case where, temporarily, compensation may enable a solution to be found."
"Secondly, as part of the reform of the disputes settlement procedure, we recently submitted a proposal to the WTO in order to facilitate recourse to seeking compensation, as a real alternative to the retaliatory measures, in particular by providing for an arbitration mechanism on the amount of compensation."
"This would have the huge advantage of enabling all parties involved in a dispute to negotiate on the basis of a figure set by a third party."
"Mr Rübig, this is the information that I can give you on the solution that is sometimes envisaged of possibly establishing such a supranational punitive system at the WTO."
"We do not believe in such a system."
"It would involve a fundamental change in international relations."
"That is why we do not feel that the international fine option is, at this stage, the correct course of action, if only because it does not provide an answer to the question of what coercive measures to implement in order to force parties to pay a fine that they wish to avoid."
"In contrast, we prefer the current system and the compensation system, which - and this will be my final point - is always provisional since the underlying objective of any system that imposes discipline and respect for these disciplines is to force the State at fault to toe the line."
"That is our guiding principle."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that the imposition of punitive duties is a very powerful instrument which may threaten the economic survival of individual undertakings."
"That is the reason for my question: Which methods could you envisage in future to protect enterprises from the adverse effects of such measures?"
"Would compensation, tax relief or other options be a possibility so that individual enterprises do not have to bear the consequences of a dispute settlement procedure?"
"Well, I think that the answer to your question, Mr Rübig, is, in that case, to move from a system of sanctions to a compensation system which obviously has the advantage of being much more voluntary."
"But the idea that businesses, which may fall victim to a system of sanctions, could have the right to compensation, for one reason or another, is not recognised in either international or Community law."
"We have also challenged the American system at the WTO, for example. This system was conceived several years ago and finalised last year and involves compensating businesses that fall victim to antidumping with the income from antidumping rights."
"We believe that this system provides an incentive to commit fraud and, therefore, we are not considering compensation systems."
"Once again, sanctions are only there to apply discipline and if we can effect the transition to a compensation system, then we would have a system that is more voluntary and is, if I may so, less random and punitive than sanctions."
"Many of the problems that affect injured parties in trade disputes, especially SMEs with limited resources, arise from the time it takes for the WTO to make its rulings - often many months, if not years."
"No doubt this will be the case with the new steel dispute with the Americans."
"But rather than granting compensation, which would probably arrive too late to prevent the business concerned from going to the wall, would it not be better for the WTO to have a system of temporary injunctions, which would require the suspension of such actions on the basis of prima facie evidence of illegal action until substantive decisions can be made?"
"Would the Commissioner be in favour of such a system?"
"If so, could he suggest how one might go about implementing it?"
"I agree that it is a very good idea, Mr Purvis."
"The international legal system, and that of the WTO is rather slow although it is in fact not much slower than our national legal systems when dealing with this type of case, but 'summary' type proceedings, which you refer to as injunctions, might be appropriate."
"I have two comments to make in response to this point."
"First of all, it is a good idea."
"Secondly, as it happens, the WTO disputes settlement procedure is still in its infancy."
"It is barely five years old, which, for legal proceedings, is still very young, especially for France and we are, for the time being, working on improving other parts of the procedure."
"I acknowledge, however, that this is a question that we must ask ourselves when the time arises."
"However, this type of procedure does not provide a response to an objection raised, which is how do we go about ensuring that injunctions or summary proceedings of this sort are observed?"
"If they are breached, do we have recourse to trade measures?"
"I do not think that the use of law enforcement authorities provided for in Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter is applicable in this case."
"And as soon as this ceases to be the case and that there is no, if I may say so, State authority in command of a police force, you come back to the problem of sanctions."
"The idea is a good one, but we must still answer the question of knowing how to implement this, if not through sanctions and compensation pay-outs, which brings us back to the previous problem."
"Thank you very much for your cooperation, Mr Lamy."
"Questions to Commissioner Wallström"
"Question No 39 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0062/02):"
"Subject: Packaging and packaging waste"
"Has Greece notified the Commission of its national measures to implement Directive 94/62/EEC"
"Mr President, an infringement procedure against Greece was opened in 1996 regarding the failure of the Greek authorities to transpose Directive 94/62 on packaging and packaging waste international legislation."
"In July 1998 the Commission received notification from the Greek authorities on a draft law which would transpose Directive 94/62."
"However, this draft law was not immediately adopted into Greek legislation and so transposition did not actually occur in 1998."
"On 13 April 2000 the European Court of Justice condemned Greece for non-transposition of Directive 94/62."
"On 2 May 2000 the Commission requested information from the Greek authorities regarding the measures taken to comply with the Court ruling, but no information was provided."
"The procedure stemming from Article 228 was initiated against Greece on 8 November 2000 and a reasoned opinion was sent to Greece on 10 April 2001."
"On 2 August 2001 Greece adopted Law 2939/2001, thereby transposing Directive No 94/62 into Greek national legislation."
"The Commission received notification of this law from the Greek authorities on 26 September 2001."
"This law has satisfactorily incorporated the observations of the Commission concerning the notification text transmitted to the Commission in 1998 and the procedure against Greece under Article 228 regarding transposition of Directive 94/62 was therefore closed on 20 December 2001."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for such a detailed reply, full of dates and numbers."
"The only question which remains is, when will the provisions of the directive and the law which you mentioned to us start being applied?"
"I am asking because there has been very heavy rainfall in Athens over the past two days, coupled with a strike by refuse collectors, and the huge volume of rubbish to which this directive applies has blocked all the drains and the town has flooded."
"Can you tell me what is being planned apart from formally introducing this law?"
"I think that there are deadlines."
"Can you tell me what your views are?"
"When, roughly, will the volume of rubbish start decreasing and a different sort of policy - a recycling and recovery policy - be introduced?"
"The Greek Government should have already started to implement the directive so I hope that it is now properly transposed and that all the necessary measures have been taken by the Greek Government to make sure it complies with the existing directive."
"Question No 40 by Glyn Ford (H-0092/02):"
"Subject: Water Framework Directive"
"By 2015 under the new Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC"
"The water framework directive has set the objective to achieve good status for all waters in the European Union."
"It will address all relevant sources of pollution, including industrial activities."
"As a tool to achieve this objective the directive follows a combined approach of emission controls addressing pollution at the source and water quality standards to be achieved for the particular water body."
"Complementing existing Community legislation on major sources of pollution, urban waste water discharges, pollution from agriculture and impacts from large industrial installations, the water framework directive foresees emission controls for particularly hazardous substances and water quality standards at Community level."
"Commission proposals for these to Parliament and the Council have to be submitted by December 2003, also taking into account cost-effectiveness and proportionality."
"Participation of all relevant stakeholders will be one of the key elements of the directive."
"This will be achieved by mandatory public participation when developing and adopting the necessary river basin management plans, but also by broad participatory processes at EU level, facilitating the implementation of the directive."
"This process is to ensure input and participation by all interested and involved parties."
"Further, Community research efforts under the Sixth Framework Programme will support the implementation of the directive, as will the LIFE financial instrument in the field of innovative and integrated techniques and methods."
"Beyond those measures the Treaty provides for clear guidance as regards financing Community environmental policy being, as a rule, the responsibility of Member States."
"On state aids the Commission does not intend to propose changes."
"I am slightly disappointed with the response from the Commissioner."
"While I am fully in support of strong, effective and costed legislation to force improvements in environmental standards governing water quality and other matters, and of the proper policing of such legislation, I would also like to see this stick approach complemented by, as it were, a degree of carrot."
"In my own region - and particularly in Cornwall, which is an Objective 1 area - we have very many small and medium enterprises that will find it most difficult to comply with this legislation."
"I would like to see some financial incentives or rewards introduced to enable them to stop polluting water."
"If we merely have, if you like, the stick approach and no carrots, then I am afraid we are going to find it more difficult to reach these standards and, at the same time, increase suffering in some of the very small enterprises in the UK county hardest hit by job losses, when we are actually spending considerable sums of money trying to create jobs there."
"Mr Ford, I wish I had more carrots and more money to provide us with a financial incentive, but I do not have this money and it is actually for the Member States to follow up and ensure that they create the kind of financial steering instruments and the kind of financial incentives necessary here."
"That is the only answer I can provide apart from repeating that we have some funds available, LIFE, project funding and research."
"But we cannot go into each and every Member State directly and create those incentives."
"That will have to remain the responsibility of the Member States."
"I have a very specific question: When will the treatment of waste water in Brussels comply with the legislation?"
"The implementation of the waste water treatment plans in Brussels is long-awaited and, as you know, we have initiated infringement proceedings against Belgium on this matter."
"According to the latest information we have received, it should be ready by 2006."
"Question No 41 by Nuala Ahern (H-0093/02):"
"Subject: Assessment of radioactive emissions from Sellafield and Cap de la Hague"
"Has the Commission already made an assessment and if not, will it undertake an immediate comparative assessment of the details of radioactive effluents and emissions released respectively from the Sellafield nuclear waste and fuel processing plant, operated by BNFL in the UK, and the La Hague nuclear waste and fuel processing plant, operated by COGEMA in France, as published in the Commission Radiation Protection Report 127, Radioactive effluents from nuclear power stations and nuclear fuel reprocessing plants in the European Union, 1995-1999, and the report prepared for the European Parliament's Scientific and Technological Options Assessment Programme (STOA) on 'Possible Toxic Effects from the Nuclear Reprocessing Plants at Sellafield (UK) and Cap de la Hague (France)', published in December 2001 and November 2001 respectively?"
"Mr President, I am wearing my Irish scarf today."
"In response to the question, the Commission has compared the following two reports: its own radiation protection report 127 (Radioactive effluents from nuclear power stations and nuclear fuel reprocessing plants in the European Union, 1995-1999), published in December 2001; and the so-called WISE report, drawn up for the European Parliament's Scientific and Technological Options Assessment Programme (STOA), on the possible toxic effects from the nuclear reprocessing plants at Sellafield and Cap de la Hague in France, published in November 2001."
"In particular, the Commission compared the reporting of radioactive effluents released from the Sellafield and La Hague sites."
"The Commission can confirm that the data reported in the two documents were found to be consistent."
"The difference between the two documents lies in the fact that the Commission document simply reports discharge data whereas the WISE report presents an analysis of the impact of these discharges on human health and the environment."
"A separate analysis of the data carried out on behalf of the European Commission is now available on the Europa website and I will ensure that a copy is made available to the honourable Member."
"In order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of all historical discharges on the northern European marine environment, in 2000 the European Commission launched the so-called Marina II study, which will be completed this summer."
"It will provide additional detailed information on radioactive discharges and resulting activity concentrations."
"It will also make an assessment of their levels in northern European marine waters and their impact on human health and on the environment."
"Thank you for your answer, Commissioner."
"I am aware of the Marina study. I am very interested in its outcome."
"It will not report for a while yet, as you said."
"However, I should like to ask, based on that and the assessment you have already made, what further steps the Commissioner would recommend to control the continued emissions of radionuclides from Sellafield and La Hague."
"They are the largest man-made radioactive emissions and pollutants and do not pollute just EU Member States but migrate across the globe."
"Indeed, Norway has complained particularly about the Arctic fishing grounds being affected."
"What would you recommend as a result of all this assessment and forthcoming studies?"
"You recently visited Ireland - you have your Irish scarf on!"
"You indicated that you are concerned about the emissions from Sellafield."
"We also have a recent RPII report, which I would recommend the Commission to study."
"You urged the Irish Government to pursue the issue at EU level instead of simply under the OSPAR."
"I have also made a complaint. I want to ask you to address that in depth."
"I have had to engage a lawyer to follow up the fact that this has not been dealt with responsibly over the last couple of years."
"There has also been a recent departure of a Commission official, Mr Curry, to the board of BNFL."
"Has the Commission agreed that this is not a conflict of interest?"
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to say to Mrs Ahern that the overall objective lies in meeting the OSPAR commitment, the aim being to achieve a substantial reduction in discharges by 2020."
"The Commission is committed to helping OSPAR achieve that aim and the Member States will assist them to that end."
"We are, of course, following developments closely."
"That is our task, but only after the Marina study is complete will we be provided with a good basis and platform, a scientific assessment of the situation enabling us to judge what exactly we should do and find the correct measures, if necessary, to help reduce discharges."
"So once the Marina study is complete there will be another opportunity to take stock and decide on the measures to come."
"I have indeed heard and seen in the media that Mr Curry has been appointed to the Board of the BNFL."
"Since, to the best of our knowledge, Mr Curry had not contacted us in advance to notify us of this new appointment, the Director-General for Personnel and Administration sent him a letter asking him to clarify his situation further and reminding him of his obligations under the Staff Regulations."
"We are looking forward to a reply from him."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question which interests me is this: what is the legal basis - the relevant legislation and technical directives - for the assessment of radioactive effluents?"
