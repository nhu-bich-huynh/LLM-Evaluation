"Text"
"The adverse effects on tourism in general should not, however, be overestimated."
"We have every right to hope that tourism will recover at most of the European tourist destinations."
"Tourism is one of the European Union's major branches of industry, with a direct contribution to the gross domestic product and to employment amounting to about 5%, and its indirect contribution to some 12%."
"In its 13 November 2001 communication entitled 'Working together for the future of European tourism', the Commission proposed an operational framework and measures aimed at invigorating the European tourist industry, an area in which it is backing close collaboration between all participants in the public and private sectors."
"The Commission's legislative and work programme for 2003 envisages a new communication on the further transposition of parts of the 2001 communication, with specific reference to the issue of the sustainability of European tourism."
"This will be an initiative specifically aimed at coordinating action by all interested parties to revive the European tourist industry."
"If the Member States and the tourist industry agree to the Commission initiating further coordinated action to help the European tourist industry recover from markedly adverse circumstances, the Commission would be willing to do so under Community competences defined in the Treaty."
"Mention of Community competences leads me to refer to the Convention, which, to a large degree, works with a view to legal continuity."
"In the present Treaty on the European Communities, tourism is listed under Article 3 (1) (u)."
"As regards reference to tourism as a complementary responsibility in the future constitution, we must wait and see what proposals the praesidium will put forward on the subject and how the Convention responds to them."
"As far as its legislative programme for 2003 is concerned, the Commission has listed over 40 items of proposed legislation that can be expected to have some effect on tourism, 24 of them to a more or less marked degree."
"These include proposals relating to the policy priorities for 2003, as well as other items of proposed legislation that will probably be put forward in 2003."
"They cover a multiplicity of policy areas, mainly transport - with 40% of all proposals and half of the most important - followed by taxation issues with 5 proposals."
"It is to be hoped that these initiatives by the Commission will receive this House's support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there can be no doubt that, especially recently, tourism in Europe is going through a serious crisis, due in part to the Iraqi crisis."
"I think that there should be action to deal with this problem at European level."
"We would expect more substantial steps in this direction but, of course, the basic problem is the lack of a legal basis in the Treaty."
"And that is what I shall focus on in my intervention."
"I know that from time to time the Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, also does what he can and what he is allowed to do on the basis of the current legislative framework; however, there are initiatives which affect the tourism sector and do not fit into a single approach and, at the same time, there is the strange phenomenon that, although we have policy for industry, we do not have policy for the most important part of industry or, in all events, a part which is becoming more and more important, which is tourism."
"It is also strange, I think, that there are policies on various individual issues, such as fisheries, and rightly so, while the tourism sector, which provides work for a great many workers, the number of which rises year by year, is ignored."
"No-one here in this Parliament, Commissioner, is talking about replacing the role of the Member States."
"On the contrary."
"We are talking about added value at Brussels level."
"We are talking about coordinating action, we are talking about imitating what is basically happening in other sectors, as in the example of industry I mentioned to you."
"The constitutional Convention is an important opportunity that should not be missed."
"Your reply, the reply of the Commission, not you personally, because I know that you are not responsible for the issue, you are merely so kind as to represent the Commission here, does not, I must say, satisfy Parliament."
"If you look at the positions taken by Parliament from time to time, your reply is rather neutral."
"One expects a stronger commitment on the part of the Commission for the Convention."
"There are members of the Convention who are addressing the issue."
"Our honourable friend, Mr Lamassoure, has tabled an amendment so that tourism becomes an additional responsibility of the European Union and we are waiting for substantial steps and a strong commitment on this particular issue on the part of the European Commission, because the Convention cannot and must not go unexploited."
"This is an opportunity for us to make a fresh start on tourism at European level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, approximately one year ago, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the future of tourism in Europe, for which I was rapporteur, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. This resolution expressly proposed that the tourism sector should have a solid legal base in the future European Constitution in order to allow the Commission to react effectively to the various problems that might arise."
"Since this is one of the largest sectors of activity in Europe, which is the top tourist region in the world, and since it is one of the sectors with the brightest future in terms of jobs and wealth creation, it is hard to understand the lack of political recognition and means for intervention provided in the current Treaties."
"Since the growing trend in our manufacturing industry is to relocate outside Europe, tourism emerges as a labour-intensive activity involving a multitude of services that cannot be relocated, which Europe has now and on which it can continue to count in future."
"Because of its cross-border definition, however, should this activity remain outside the scope of the European institutions?"
"Can Europe refuse to intervene in a sector that is one of the most promising for its future development?"
"Can the European Union remain unprepared to confront and respond to the needs of the industries involved in this activity, simply because there is no legal base that would enable it to intervene effectively?"
"This is the situation we must now address."
"In fact, the provisions of the new Constitution presented by the Praesidium do not contain a single reference to tourism."
"There is not even a proposal to maintain what has been achieved in the Treaties currently in force."
"We in the European Parliament maintain our position of wanting tourism to be referred to expressly as a sector of competences shared between the European Union and the Member States, being referred to specifically in the first part of the Constitution and in the part concerning the policies of the future European Constitution."
"Our question is this: what is the Commission doing to achieve this?"
"I therefore ask the Commission what its proposals are for strengthening the legal base of tourism in the future European Constitution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as a member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism I am glad finally to have an opportunity to speak about tourism."
"In my view, there are three specific issues."
"The first is the environmental impact."
"A very large number of Members of this House come from areas where tourism is important as an economic sector and where tourism has a major impact on people and the environment."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commission how it intends to manage this impact of tourism on people and the environment."
"Further, what is the Commission doing about the conservation of tourism in the context of Agenda 21?"
"I also think of the importance of Article 6 of the Treaty, which obliges the Commission to integrate environmental protection in its policy sectors, thus including the tourist sector, with a view to the promotion of sustainable development."
"A second aspect is the link with regional policy."
"There is certainly a link with regional development and tourism."
"But it must not be the case that a region's own trump cards, that is its nature and cultural heritage, are destroyed."
"The Structural Funds must be expressed far more clearly in this regard."
"The third link is transport policy."
"There has of course been enormous growth in passenger traffic."
"We see growth not only in air traffic, but also in car traffic."
"Here we need a specific approach in my view in favour of environmentally friendly and safe transport."
"The current disappearance of the international overnight trains proves that we are falling short in this area."
"There is also no European regulation on taking bicycles on the train."
"I hope that the Commission is prepared to invest in good practices, networking and knowledge development around the problems of mobility and tourism."
"Mr President, Commissioner, what I am going to say is not directed at you personally, but, as you are representing the Commission, I trust that you will relay our discussions to your fellow Commissioner, Mr Liikanen."
"The fact is that I found your answer rather soothing."
"I believe that, as a result of the war in Iraq and of the outbreak of SARS in Asia, tourism in Europe and tourist travel to Europe have - as we say on the German coast - heavy weather to contend with, as does foreign tourism outside Europe."
"Air travel alone has seen passenger numbers decline, with a drop of 10% on flights to the Middle East and as much as 25% and more for flights to Asia."
"The airlines and tourism enterprises are doing their best to get the situation under control, but they need support from the Member States and from the EU."
"There are, alas, no indications so far as to how the European Union and the Member States propose to develop a joint strategy to alleviate this crisis and bring it to an end."
"So my first question to the Commissioner is to ask whether she is willing to appoint, on an ad hoc basis, a high-level working party, which would involve the tourist industry and whose purpose would be to develop a strategy to reduce the tourist industry's costs and to stimulate international tourism?"
"Secondly, Commissioner, and quite apart from the present crisis, the Commission must, I believe, examine the fundamental aspects underlying tourism and give primary and close attention to the competitive situation in the Member States."
"After all, it cannot be right, in a European single market, that the Member States should levy VAT at different rates on similar tourist activities."
"That distorts the competition among them."
"You will know - and have yourself emphasised the fact - that the tourist industry merits our particular attention precisely because it is in the hands of the same small and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs and training opportunities over wide areas of the European Union."
"In conclusion, I want to repeat something that has been said by all the previous speakers, which is that support measures for tourism require legal certainty and legal clarity, and, for that reason, tourism must become a task in its own right in the constitution, with clear powers to act laid down for it."
"Commissioner, I admit that we too have problems with our representatives in the Convention, but the Commission, too, has two representatives there, and so I ask you whether the Commission's two representatives have made an unambiguous request for tourism to be incorporated into the new constitution as a task involving powers to act."
"Thank you, Mr Jarzembowski."
"As it seems that Mrs Schreyer wishes to respond, she has the floor."
"Mr President, as such specific questions have been put, I would again like to take the opportunity of responding to Mr Dhaene."
"I had stated that the Commission would, this year, be issuing a communication on the sustainability of tourism."
"In view of the issue in the Convention, I can, at present, tell you only that the Commission does of course want to safeguard the present position, but I can certainly concede that you are right to say that we have two representatives in the Convention as against the sixteen from Parliament."
"That being so, I am sure that things can be done there."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.06 p.m.)"
"Situation in Iraq"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Iraq."
"The Council has arrived in Strasbourg and the minister is on his way."
"I would suggest to the House that we should in any event commence our debate, reversing the normal pattern by beginning with the Commission statement, if this is acceptable to the Commissioner."
"Given the pressure on our agenda it is important that we try to proceed on time."
"The minister should be here in a few minutes."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by giving an account of my visit to Baghdad a week ago."
"I travelled there with the overall objective of signalling our continuing humanitarian support and solidarity with the Iraqi people."
"As a reminder, ECHO has since 1992 and before the current conflict allocated EUR 157 million in humanitarian aid, mainly for health and sanitation."
"This programme was complementary to the oil-for-food programme and, in fact, made ECHO the largest humanitarian donor in the country."
"Following the outbreak of the conflict, EUR 100 million was secured overall for humanitarian needs, of which an amount of EUR 22.5 million has now been committed and is being implemented, mainly for activities concerning health and water."
"I wanted to get a first-hand impression of the humanitarian situation in the country through discussions with our partners - the UN, Red Cross and NGOs, the US-led Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Aid (ORHA) - and Member States, and through project visits."
"To that effect, I met with ICRC President Kellenberger, Ambassador Ward, who is heading the humanitarian aid pillar of ORHA, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator Mr Lopes da Silva, a large number of NGOs and the Member States present in Baghdad."
"I visited the Abu Nawas raw water pumping station and the big Al Yarmouk hospital."
"Another objective was to evaluate possibilities for the opening of an ECHO office in Baghdad."
"Premises have now been identified and following the administrative procedures the office should open by the end of May."
"ECHO staff have been present in Baghdad for some time."
"My assessment of the humanitarian situation in Iraq is that it cannot be characterised as a humanitarian catastrophe."
"The direct humanitarian impact of the war has fortunately been smaller than was expected by most humanitarian agencies."
"No massive population movements have occurred and direct casualties as a result of the conflict have also, fortunately, been far less numerous than some of the initial estimations had predicted."
"Nevertheless, there are very real humanitarian needs and the situation remains very fragile, notably in the main urban centres - there are more than two or three cities of importance in this respect - where the problem is still very much the availability of safe water and similar problems."
"There could easily be a humanitarian disaster if the occupying powers fail to enforce law and order and institutions are not reactivated and put back in charge."
"Safety is still a very real problem for people trying to go to work or return to work in Iraq."
"According to the Geneva Conventions, it is the obligation of the occupying powers not only to restore and maintain law and order in all places under their control, but also to ensure that people have full and secure access to vital goods and services, and to make it possible for people to return to their work."
"In spite of this, the international community, as such, has a duty to assist the victims of the situation, and the Commission has up to now approved humanitarian aid operations, as I have already mentioned, amounting to EUR 22.5 million."
"These include emergency relief, emergency supplies of drugs and medical equipment, water supply and basic, very immediate rehabilitation of health, water and sanitation infrastructures."
"ECHO is also supporting OCHA - the UN coordinator - and is making it possible for it to work efficiently."
"The remaining EUR 77.5 million of the 100 million secured will be programmed, and decisions made, as further needs are assessed and identified."
"The current priorities for ECHO are to support the rapid restoration of social services, especially health care, including the resumption of vaccination campaigns, the effective coordination of humanitarian assistance, mine awareness and de-mining activities."
"It also envisages support for the World Food Programme to help cover the gaps in the food distribution programme."
"I hope this will be a transitional challenge."
"Under the oil-for-food programme the system was well organised: 44 000 local outlets running year-in-year-out provided 60% of the population's food requirements."
"This was a huge operation, with the Iraqi authorities themselves responsible for the two southern parts of the country, and the UN for the north."
"We must ensure the whole thing works, because leaving it to some miracle of the market economy to solve all this from one week to another is a recipe for turmoil and disaster."
"This is quite well understood by all the different players involved in the situation."
"However, it is a complicated operation."
"Concerning the wider political framework, the discussion at the UN Security Council of a draft UN Security Council resolution constitutes a positive step in bringing the debate over Iraq's future back to the United Nations."
"We make a very clear distinction - for many good reasons - between the immediate response to humanitarian needs and the whole discussion concerning reconstruction."
"They are very different."
"Everything relating to reconstruction brings us immediately into the centre of political discussions about the structure and structuring of power in the new Iraq."
"In the case of humanitarian aid, however, the immediate response can and should be handled as a much more focused activity."
"This Security Council draft resolution has been tabled, as everybody knows, by the US and the UK to clarify how the occupying powers would like things to be organised."
"The Iraqi Assistance Fund is the cornerstone for handling all the decisions and financial management of the country and its resources."
"The decisions concerning this Iraqi Assistance Fund and also covering decisions on licensing in the oil industry are to be taken by the occupying powers, and the Iraqi side and the UN are given a consultative role in those decisions on the basis of the draft resolution."
"The draft resolution would also provide for immunity for those making these decisions, and the remaining money - the unspent balance from the oil-for-food programme - should also be put into this fund and administered like the rest of it."
"It is supposed to run for 12 months, but then to continue unchanged - with all the provisions unchanged - if no new decisions are made to that effect by the Security Council, of which these two main occupying powers are permanent members."
"The Commission's involvement in the reconstruction phase will naturally depend on the outcome of these discussions in the Security Council - this is self-evident."
"At the informal ministerial meeting in Rhodes, the Council invited the Commission to undertake some concrete steps to start identifying possibilities for EU involvement in the reconstruction in Iraq."
"We have therefore increased our working contacts with the relevant international organisations (World Bank, IMF and UN) with a view to taking forward jointly our analysis of the situation in Iraq."
"The Commission has developed specific expertise in various aspects of reconstruction and rehabilitation from other crisis situations, such as Kosovo, East Timor, Afghanistan and Ivory Coast."
"But, in any case, concrete decisions will need to be taken on the basis of an appropriate political framework and a solid needs assessment, and through a participatory process with the international community and the Iraqis themselves."
"A final comment on the regional dimension: the Union is very well placed to offer a regional approach to stabilisation, which will be extremely important in the case of Iraq."
"Our ties with the region are already very important."
"The Barcelona process, the comprehensive dialogue, the human rights and on-going political and cooperation negotiations with Iran, the on-going negotiations for a free trade area with the Gulf Cooperation Council, the ministerial meetings and our very tight political links with Turkey - all these constitute a solid basis on which to build an active and constructive EU policy in the wake of the Iraqi conflict."
"We need to continually assess how best to reinforce our political dialogue and role in the region."
"In addition to making a statement on Iraq as planned, Minister Yiannitsis will also comment on the terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two days ago there was another terrorist attack in Riad with a significant number of victims, deaths and injuries."
"Again a few days ago, a similar terrorist attack in Chechnya gave rise to a significant number of victims."
"The presence of violence is strong everywhere."
"In my capacity as President-in-Office of the European Union, I should like to roundly condemn these disgusting actions, to express my profound sorrow for the victims and their families, to express the wish for ways to be found to break this tragic form of political intervention and dispense justice and to emphasise the urgent need for us to achieve conditions of stability, security and confidence; for us to impose the policy against blind violence and fanaticism."
"Allow me now to move on to the item on the agenda relating to Iraq."
"Today, we face a new situation in Iraq."
"From a military point of view, the operations have essentially been completed."
"From a political point of view, a series of questions is being raised to which I shall refer in a moment."
"From a practical point of view, the predominant issues are humanitarian aid and the safeguarding of security, order and the restoration of normalcy in the area."
"Although the overall situation appears to be improving, the rate of progress is slow and it is obvious that considerable difficulties and problems need to be resolved."
"At the present stage, the allied forces are responsible for consolidating security and providing humanitarian aid with the presence of Member States of the European Union; however, the assistance and support of the international community as a whole are needed for there to be a fast, efficient and operational return to normalcy."
"The first priority, of course, is the channelling of humanitarian aid and the full restoration of order and security."
"Significant sums have been amassed within the framework of the United Nations - approximately USD 1.7 billion - without, however, there being a clear picture of the record of damage and the reconstruction requirements of the country."
"The European Commission and, from what I heard, Commissioner Nielson obviously referred to this, has already earmarked EUR 100 million, part of which has already been channelled to the area and an important contribution is being made at bilateral level by the European countries."
"There are plans on the part of the European Union for a grant of EUR 250 million for 2003."
"I would point out that, as long as the sanctions regime continues to apply, the United Nations oil for food programme, which was recently extended to 3 June 2003, continues to operate."
"I should like to add at this point that, in order to deal with the humanitarian crisis, cooperation between all the agencies involved is particularly important, so as to safeguard access to the country, as is independent and impartial action on all sides."
"There is no need for me to stress that, in addition to the provision of humanitarian aid, the need to protect the cultural heritage of Iraq from a repeat of incidents such as those that took place recently is extremely important."
"I should like to express my disgust at the looting and destruction of archaeological treasures, museums and monuments and stress that our immediate objective must be to find the priceless exhibits that have disappeared and seize and return them to the country as and when they appear."
"We expect the planning and the administrative work of the military forces occupying Iraq to have tangible results in this sector shortly and we also see coordinated action on the part of the international community on this matter as a top priority."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union, on the basis of its previous experience with regard to the reconstruction of states and areas - I refer to Kosovo, Afghanistan and East Timor - must and can contribute efficiently to the reconstruction of Iraq."
"Its active participation can focus on numerous sectors, not just on the humanitarian aid I referred to, but also on replacing infrastructures, on support and the provision of know-how with the democratisation and restructuring of institutions, so-called institutional building, on cooperation within the framework of international financial organisations in order to find a solution to the question of Iraq's debt and, of course, on the political reconstruction of the country."
"It is precisely the joint objective of contributing to the more general reconstruction of the country which is yet another point of convergence and reason for putting the differences which recently split the Member States on the question of Iraq behind us."
"At the European summit in Athens on 16 and 17 April, the European Union confirmed its commitment to playing an important role in this direction and asked the High Representative and the Commission to examine this question."
"I would point out that this question was also discussed during the course of the informal Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Greece two weeks ago and we are examining how and what we can contribute."
"In fact, important questions still remain open, such as, in particular, how oil revenues are to be controlled, what the future of the oil for food programme will be, what will happen to the contracts signed by the previous regime, how the weapons of mass destruction will be located, what will happen when UNMOVIC returns and others."
"The basic principles governing our action to manage the situation in Iraq, however, remain unchanged. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country, the vital role of the United Nations and the right of the Iraqi people to determine their future."
"Equally important, of course, is the establishment of a government which is representative of the entire population and the use of the natural wealth of the country for its own benefit."
"We believe that the United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, with its special institutional and organisational infrastructure and its political experience from similar situations, have a fundamental role."
"The appointment by the Secretary-General of the United Nations of a special representative to Iraq is a positive step in this direction."
"A smooth transition to a democratic and stable situation will also contribute towards regional peace and stability."
"Within this framework, we have repeatedly pointed out to neighbouring countries the need to demonstrate sangfroid and self-control and to contribute to the reconstruction of Iraq and to combating the humanitarian problem, with the objective of stability in the region."
"Both Turkey and Iran are taking a positive approach to the overall question."
"Similarly today, attention has also been turned to the question of the road map for peace in the Middle East."
"It is clear, as has been said many times, that the promotion of the peace process in the Middle East will have highly positive repercussions overall."
"The meeting of the Quartet at ministerial level on 21 May is particularly important within this framework, given that the establishment of positive prospects take precedence and we urgently need to restore a climate of trust with the Arab world."
"Regional stability and security will also help substantially to combat the problems linked with Iraq, and will also facilitate the reintegration of the country into the international community after 12 years of sanctions and essential isolation."
"The issue of disarming the country must be settled definitively in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations and must be linked to the adoption at broader regional level of an overall and efficient policy for preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is often easy to agree on general principles, but it is proving to be particularly difficult to agree on specific solutions and decisions, especially when questions are raised of institutions, of international legitimacy, of arrangements which emerge after a war, of situations which have arisen objectively and need to be dealt with."
"This naturally has repercussions both on the extent to which and the method by which questions are dealt with."
"From the Presidency's point of view, however, I believe that we can summarise the priorities as follows: first we need to develop a pragmatic, global, cohesive European policy for post-war Iraq, taking account of the long-term aspects of developments in the Middle East as a whole; to clarify how we, the European Union, see the role of the United Nations in post-war Iraq; to help Iraq get over the problems it has been through and to set up conditions of peace, security, acceptance, dignity and prosperity for the Iraqi people; to implement the principles we accepted in our joint decisions at recent Councils; and to promote regional stability and cooperation by supporting the peace process in the Middle East."
"These priorities do not mean that we do not face problems and dangers."
"I shall refer specifically to just some of these dangers."
"One such danger is that discussions on Iraq will turn from being fruitful dialogue on dealing with the central problems affecting the country to secondary conflicts."
"A second issue is the difficulty in agreeing on subsequent measures and subsequent decisions by the Security Council."
"A third issue relates to developments in trans-Atlantic relations."
"Fourthly, the differences between the European states, although I believe that, on the issues of the post-war phase, these phenomena will be far less acute."
"Fifthly, the inability to determine the role we wish to play in Iraq and, finally, any obstacles that might lead us into inertia."
"I think that we must bear these dangers in mind so that we deal with them efficiently, so that we arrive at an approach and action which will enable us to deal with the Iraqi question and its repercussions."
"In the final analysis, it is the stability, security, normalcy and economic development not only of the country but also of the wider area which are put into doubt or which are linked to these developments."
"The whole issue is also connected to the credibility of everyone involved in the Iraqi crisis and, consequently, of Europe also."
"In closing, however, I should like to confirm that the Council, as I mentioned, is demonstrating a constructive approach to the formulation of joint answers to the issues of Iraq."
"There is close contact between all sides without exception, which is helping us, on the one hand, to prevent splits in contacts between the Member States and, on the other hand - and these intentions are indicative - to reach agreements despite any differences, to have open lines, to see as a matter of priority where there are bridges and how we can make use of them."
"It is this constructive stance that also appeared in our discussions in Gimnich and which, I believe, can make us more optimistic about the ability of the European Union to finally play a positive and active role at this stage in Iraq."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on Tuesday night some 90 people died in a brutal terrorist attack in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The victims included both Saudis and Europeans - as far as we know, French, British, German, one Swiss - and Australians."
"This shows once again that the challenges posed by terrorism do not just affect the Americans, they affect us all, and the lesson we should learn from this appalling terrorist attack in Riyadh should be that we need to join together to fight terrorism resolutely throughout the world."
"The President-in-Office was right to refer to Chechnya."
"The European Parliament - well my group at least, but I think this also applies to the other groups - will be considering very carefully what further progress can be made towards a peaceful solution in Chechnya."
"Following the Iraq war, we Europeans need to decide what lessons we can learn from experiences which have been painful for Europe as well, and we must make it clear that there is no cause for defeatism."
"During this unhappy period of lack of European unity I have often heard it said this makes nonsense of the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"No, we must treat this crisis as an opportunity to be seized and make sure that in future we do better than with the Iraq crisis and the Iraq war."
"Above all, we need to make sure that before one Member State or a number of Member States adopt a national position and then go public, we should discuss our respective standpoints within the European Union so that we can arrive at a common position."
"This demand is also aimed at the two European members of the United Nations Security Council."
"The Maastricht Treaty already stipulates that before Member States who are members of the Security Council vote, they should first consult with their partners in the European Union, and that is the lesson we should learn from the past few weeks."
"I would also like to add - and this concerns our relations with the United States - that those people who think that a united Europe should be created in opposition to the United States are on shaky ground, because if we build up Europe in opposition to the United States, then at least half, if not more, of all Europeans would turn their back on a united Europe, so there is in fact no alternative to creating a Europe that does not oppose the United States, but is an equal partner of the USA."
"Let me add a further point. One voice in America suggested that Europe could be divided into New Europe and Old Europe."
"On a recent visit to Warsaw I realised that they are not happy with that suggestion there."
"Warsaw - Poland - is part of the Old Europe and shares our roots, and we should not allow anyone to divide Europe into two halves."
"No, it is up to us to act in unison."
"Now let me turn to Iraq."
"We are bound to have a strong interest in civil order being swiftly re-established, and when we are talking about the relationship between the European Union and the Arab Islamic states we often say that there cannot and must not be any clash of civilisation, and the same of course applies to order in Iraq."
"Iraq's population includes Shiites, Sunnis and Christians, Arabs and Kurds, and I believe that one area where we really may be able to help - and if we can help, then we should - is to ensure that peace and order prevail in Iraq, and that there is no conflict between the various religious or ethnic groups."
"I believe that the European Union has an important role to play here, and on behalf of my group I welcome the fact that you have been to Iraq, Commissioner Nielson."
"It is of course very difficult to say at this point here in the European Parliament whether the United Nations is to be given an exclusive role, and what role we as the European Union and others are to play - NATO perhaps, and the United States and the United Kingdom as the two powers that intervened there."
"That is hard to say, but what we can say is that we call on everyone involved there - and particularly the Europeans, including our Polish partners and friends - for we Europeans to take whatever action we take in concert, once we have agreed on a common position."
"There are enormous humanitarian challenges in Iraq, and I believe that we can make a contribution to security there, to the establishment of a police force, to water supply, to healthcare and to a new political order in general."
"In conclusion, let me say this: we do of course have questions for our American friends and partners."
"So far, no weapons of mass destruction have been found."
"I recommend that the search for them should be continued, as that was the basis for intervention, and its political credibility is dependent on that, which is why we need to take that question very seriously indeed."
"(Applause)"
"What we need to achieve now is a peaceful solution in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine, and that was indeed our great hope following the Kuwait crisis in 1991, when I was very much in favour of the liberation of Kuwait and the firm action against Saddam Hussein that it involved."
"We must seize this opportunity now."
"The credibility of our policy will also depend on our success in achieving a peaceful solution there, and I call on all of us to make a united and decisive contribution as Europeans."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by joining - on behalf of the Socialist Group - in the condemnation of the massive attacks in Saudi Arabia and Chechnya, and Parliament should also send its condolences to the families of all the victims of this war, particularly the civil population, and stress that we profoundly regret the fact that 14 journalists have died during the conflict, two have disappeared and American troops have bombed media organisations such as Al-Jazeera and also the Palestine hotel, which was occupied by journalists."
"Having heard Mr Poettering, I would like to say, on behalf of my group, that we regret even more than you that it has not been considered appropriate to produce a resolution, because we could have agreed on many points and because it is important that the European Parliament's voice is heard."
"We are giving the impression that we are indifferent to what is happening and we have a shared responsibility with the other institutions of the Union."
"Firstly, with regard to the emergency situation, I would like to welcome the efforts the Commission is making - the Commissioner has been in Baghdad."
"EUR 100 million is being provided, and I would ask you please to include women in the peace negotiations and in aid, because this is a very important element if peace is to be achieved in Iraq."
"Furthermore, I believe we must support the restoration of basic services."
"The Commissioner has raised a point which I believe to be important: we must not confuse humanitarian aid with reconstruction and, above all, humanitarian aid must not be a political bargaining chip."
"You have the support of the Socialist Group in this regard."
"With regard to the reconstruction process and the debate under way in the Security Council, I would like firstly to point out that, according to international law, we are in a de facto situation, in which there is a coalition which is acting as an occupying power in occupied territory."
"In accordance with the Geneva Convention and the Hague Regulations, the coalition has clear responsibilities and limits to its authority, and this must be incorporated into the current framework, because otherwise everything will depend on the power games in Washington."
"I remind you that the first team of American governors in Iraq has already come to an end."
"The confusion is increasing all the time and it is therefore important to reaffirm the role of the United Nations Security Council."
"We Europeans have responsibilities here."
"It is the case that, according to Articles 11, 12 and 13 of the Treaty, we are obliged to coordinate our positions."
"But it is odd that we are able to coordinate them amongst Europeans and with others, in the Middle East Quartet and even with the Arab League, but the same principle is not applied in the Security Council."
"Public opinion cannot understand this and furthermore Europe has serious responsibilities here."
"It is therefore very important that the agreement reached in Athens on 16 April is now applied, but within the framework of international law."
"Why?"
"In order to establish a government belonging to the Iraqi people, which respects territorial integrity and also provides the Iraqi people with an opportunity, having finally been liberated from a despotic tyranny."
"We are beginning to see the disappearance of political and religious repression and the Iraqi people are being allowed to express themselves."
"This is an absolutely essential issue."
"The lifting of the embargo - as expressed in several United Nations Resolutions - must be carried out under the authority of those Resolutions."
"The inspectors must also return, because paradoxically the only people who have found any traces of weapons of mass destruction have been the teams of Mr Blix and Mr ElBaradei rather than the American inspectors, who are acting illegally, and it is therefore also important to intervene in this regard."
"I would like to reiterate, on behalf of my group, that Iraqi oil and its exploitation belongs to the Iraqi people."
"Oil - as we have seen too often - is a poisoned gift and there must be genuine respect for its use and the right to access to resources for the Iraqi people."
"Finally, Mr President, please allow me to refer to the situation in the Middle East."
"We cannot say that action had to be taken because 12 years had passed during which the regime of Saddam Hussein had not respected the United Nations resolutions when we have been waiting three decades for Resolution 242 to be complied with."
"We must support the roadmap, Mr Sharon cannot cold-shoulder the Union's High Representative for Foreign Policy, Mr Solana, because he has met President Arafat."
"We must show goodwill, and above all we must defuse the most dangerous time bomb in the Middle East."
"And all this requires that we Europeans re-establish our unity and act together."
"Mr President, although many of us opposed the basis for the recent war with Iraq, we can unite in rejoicing at the fall of the brutal dictator Saddam Hussein."
"The Iraqi people can now rebuild their country as a free democracy, at peace with its neighbours and using its immense natural resources to raise the standard of living."
"The question for Europe today is how to unite in rebuilding Iraq so that we can overcome our previous division."
"We must project Europe's voice with the unity of a choir singing from the same hymn sheet, rather than the dissonance of an unruly cacophony."
"The informal meeting of foreign ministers leaves me cautiously optimistic."
"I welcome the proposals from the Commission and the Greek Presidency to guide our action in post-war Iraq."
"While we may not yet have the capacity to wage war in defence of our values, we have long experience at winning the peace."
"My group favours an active role for Europe in rebuilding Iraq, but for that we need the legitimacy which can come only from another UN resolution."
"We were promised a 'vital' role for the UN by President Bush."
"Our foreign ministers have demanded a 'central' role for the United Nations."
"Yet the draft resolution of the US, the UK and Spain falls far short of either."
"You cannot give a vital role to the UN simply by proclaiming it in a recital to a Security Council resolution."
"A vital role means that rebuilding Iraq would not be not possible without the UN; it entails not endorsing for a 12-month period the authority of the self-declared occupying powers, with the right to direct the disbursement of funds from Iraqi oil revenues."
"A vital role for the UN means its involvement in setting up, as soon as possible, a legitimate and representative government of Iraqis, in lifting sanctions and in providing urgent humanitarian aid."
"Why have running water and electricity not yet been restored?"
"How many must die before we get medical supplies into hospitals and clean up the unexploded ordnance?"
"Where are the police that the UN could send to help restore law and order?"
"We need to give the people of Iraq a better life or their hardship will become anger towards the occupying powers."
"A vital or central role for the UN also means readmitting Hans Blix and his weapons inspectors to verify what has happened to the weapons of mass destruction which remain unaccounted for."
"Their existence and the claim that they could be used within 45 minutes were central to the case for war."
"The weapons inspectors have the international legitimacy and credibility to complete the job they were asked to do, in cooperation with American and British forces on the ground."
"The tragic events of Monday night in Saudi Arabia remind us of the continuing instability in the region."
"That is why my group welcomes the visit of Colin Powell, marking the re-engagement of the United States in the peace process."
"For lasting peace in the region and a successful rebuilding of Iraq, we must simultaneously take forward the Quartet's roadmap for peace in Israel and Palestine."
"Mr President, the last time we took a stance on Iraq was before the war, when Parliament expressed its full support for the United Nations inspectors."
"At that time, we stated that none of the reasons put forward at that time justified a war and that 'any further steps must be taken by the Security Council after a full assessment of the situation'."
"Have we nothing to say about the extremely serious events that have taken place since then, which have been in total conflict with this line?"
"That is what seems to be indicated by the majority decision of this House not to conclude this debate with the adoption of a resolution."
"This petty decision would be rather trivial if it did not reflect a much deeper, serious defect of the European Union, namely its inability to define its identity and defend it with vigour."
"This failure to take political responsibility has been spectacular since George Bush first implemented his new strategic doctrine."
"To those who, like my group, feel that it is essential to react, in particular by looking towards what the New York Times calls 'the other superpower', in other words the general public who are actively opposed to the idea of war, I propose three closely linked priorities."
"The first is to refuse to accept a fait accompli in Iraq."
"The Iraqi people have been both freed from a dictatorship and plunged into chaos."
"Having spoken to long-time opponents of Saddam Hussein, I can tell you that, on 9 April 2003, many hearts and minds experienced a mixture of joy and suffering, relief and humiliation."
"As the days passed, exasperation took over as a result of the blood spilt, the extent of the damage, vandalism and looting, the military occupation and the US civil proconsul."
"All this, while the supposed motive for the war - the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction, of which George Bush, Tony Blair and José Maria Aznar all have irrefutable proof, of course - is running out of credibility."
"Our second priority must therefore be to make an active commitment to ensuring the effective implementation of the Middle East roadmap."
"The Union is co-initiator of this roadmap and therefore cannot rest on its laurels in the fact of the daily attempts by Sharon's Government to destroy this slim chance of peace, in the belief that the current host in the White House will always understand its reasons."
"Finally, we must all help to determine where the mad venture of pre-emptive war will lead us if Europe does not manage to muster the political will to do all in its power to nip it in the bud."
"The fight against terrorism and against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is vital."
"This dangerous imperial shift, however, is a completely different matter."
"I reiterate today, Mr President, for the third time, the request by my group for Parliament's first major, in-depth debate on the new strategic doctrine published by George Bush on 20 September."
"This cynical homage to the law of the most powerful seeks solely to debase all of the principles of the United Nations Charter, as demonstrated once again even now by the US draft resolution to the Security Council."
"It is time for Europe to raise the alarm and to take up its responsibilities."
"That is what the majority of our citizens, from Strasbourg to Warsaw, expect of us."
"Our own roadmap could consist of seeking to meet this expectation."
"In any event, my group is ready."
"Mr President, there is nothing more unpleasant for a politician than to be right but not to win the argument."
"What is even worse is to be wrong and to see ever more clearly how wrong you were."
"Very specifically, we all know that the so-called existence of large quantities of weapons of mass destruction was the main official reason for starting this war."
"We all recall the presentations by Tony Blair and Colin Powell in the United Nations, where they produced hard evidence of the existence of these weapons of mass destruction."
"Now, after weeks of searching by hundreds of American and British soldiers, it seems this evidence does not exist."
"Might this perhaps be the reason why the authorities, for which read the Americans and the British, are refusing to let Hans Blix and his UN inspection team in?"
"The UN weapons inspectors are the only ones who can demonstrate that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction, but they are also the only ones who will very probably demonstrate that Bush and Blair were wrong when they started this war because there were supposed to be weapons of mass destruction."
"This refusal is part of a much broader pattern, one of keeping the United Nations at arm's length."
"It is not right and nor is it smart."
"Let me give two examples of where the role of the United Nations is crucial."
"UNEP, the United Nations environmental organisation, has, rightly in my view, pressed for an investigation as soon as possible into the environmental effects, the environmental consequences of the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium for example."
"The establishment of a tribunal, sorely needed for processing the criminal past, is only possible with the help of the United Nations."
"But let us also be clear: the European Union itself can only function at full power whether we are talking of humanitarian aid or of reconstruction within a framework that has been legitimised by the United Nations and as an equal partner of the US and not as a subcontractor."
"My fear is that Europe, without that UN mandate, will nonetheless, half-heartedly and probably even grudgingly, assist with the reconstruction of Iraq."
"The EU from a sense of duty, some Member States because they have no wish for a second conflict with the United States and because they want their share."
"That is not the Common Foreign Policy that my group has in mind."
"The road to a European Union common foreign policy runs via New York, via the United Nations."
"Only with a UN mandate will the EU be able to put its - not insignificant - capabilities to use in building up Iraq and returning the government to the Iraqi people."
"That is also in the interest of the United States and the United Kingdom."
"I should therefore like to call on the British, the Spanish, but also the Polish governments and our colleagues in the government parties in those countries to break with the logic of war according to which the winner takes all."
"The winner does not take all; it must not want to, nor must it be able to."
"Look at what is happening in Iraq at the moment."
"It is a chaos in which one military governor succeeds another because the Americans and the British do not really know exactly what to do."
"Iraq has no need of triumphalist victors who do not know what to do."
"The war has been won by the few, but the peace can only be won by the many."
"Mr President, I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the Greek Presidency and Commissioner Nielson for the very fine statements that they made here this morning, and to my Parliamentary colleagues for the very enlightening statements they have made as well."
"The US Government has avowed its intention to hand over the sovereignty of Iraq to a representative Iraqi Government at a very early date."
"Two meetings of Iraqi political leaders have now taken place."
"The most recent, in Baghdad on 25 April, ended with an agreement to work to put together a transitional administration by 3 June 2003."
"This administration will then work to promulgate a new constitution for the people of Iraq and deal with other long-term government issues."
"I very much welcome the fact that a draft resolution has been tabled at the United Nations on the subject of how to deal with the post-conflict situation in Iraq."
"I believe that there are a number of guiding yardsticks which must be adhered to in the context of addressing the future role of the United Nations in Iraq."
"The United Nations must play a central role in the reconstruction of Iraq."
"This must begin from a clear understanding that it is not the purpose of any United Nations involvement to legitimise the recent military conflict."
"The United Nations must be an equal partner, and not have a subordinate position limited to acquiescing to decisions made by the coalition in Iraq."
"It would be very unfair to the civilian population of Iraq to allow questions of principle to prevent effective United Nations engagement with immediate needs."
"We should recall the comments of the Secretary-General of the United Nations when he said that we must find: 'unity of purpose in the post-war phase in Iraq'."
"The overriding aim must be to set aside past divisions and focus on what must and can be done to help the Iraqi people at this time."
"From the perspective of the European Union we must set out exactly the likely future role for the European Union in Iraq."
"There was some general agreement at the last meeting of EU foreign ministers, held in Rhodes on 3 May, that the EU must play a stronger role in the post-conflict situation in Iraq."
"The European Commission has already dispatched a needs-assessment mission to Iraq."
"There is also agreement that the Chargés d'Affaires could return to Iraq from the Member States of the Union."
"There has been no agreement to date on whether or not the European Union should appoint a special representative for Iraq."
"This latter issue is one very important matter which must be given urgent political consideration."
"The European Union should engage in the reconstruction of Iraq and in a situation where the United Nations is at the centre of this effort."
"EU resources would then be made available to fund key reconstruction activities, such as the rebuilding of basic social infrastructure, including health, education, water and sanitation services."
"It is only right and proper that sanctions against Iraq be lifted."
"They serve no purpose whatsoever at this juncture, as they were originally designed to target a regime which now no longer exists."
"UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency should return to Iraq at the earliest opportunity and complete their mission."
"The use of Iraq's oil revenues must also play a key part in the actual reconstruction of Iraq, but any use of such monies must be undertaken in the best interests of the Iraqi people, who must play a role in any such decisions as fully and as early as possible."
"A central role for the United Nations would confer real legitimacy on whatever interim arrangements are put in place in Iraq."
"It would also contribute to lessening political tensions in the Middle East region and to reducing the political instability that is so sadly but evidently there at this particular time."
"Mr President, the lesson of the Iraq war is not that we should copy the United States and devise our own foreign policy, involving our own superstate army and military-industrial complex."
"If we had had qualified majority voting on the Iraq issue, neither the British nor the French policy would have obtained majority support."
"The solution is not to create a superstate, but for us to stick together in Europe in order to strengthen the UN."
"If the UN decides that a dictator is to be disarmed, it must also have the power to implement the decision."
"The UN should have its own rapid reaction force, and the EU's rapid reaction force should be made available to the UN."
"The right of veto in the UN Security Council must be limited so that the UN can also take action, even if a small minority is opposed to its doing so."
"Otherwise, superpowers will act independently and so create justifications for anyone being able to act off their own bat using military assaults and terror tactics."
"War criminals should be tracked down and brought before the International Criminal Court."
"Pressure should be exerted on all countries to accept the International Criminal Court and the UN Pact."
"The lesson is that we must uphold the international rule of law if we do not wish to end up as victims of the laws of the jungle and of the strongest and ourselves become targets for new generations of terrorists."
"Only through the rule of law can terrorism and dictatorship be brought effectively to an end."
"Mr President, 172 troops - 34 British and 138 American - gave their lives for the cause of Iraq's freedom during the war."
"Today certainly, my colleagues and I salute what they and all the coalition forces did to ensure that Iraq could be free."
"Throughout the debates that we have had on the Iraq crisis, I have made it clear that for us war was always a last resort."
"If only the nations of the world had united in a determined way, then Saddam, in my view, could have been dealt with without the need for war."
"Now that the conflict is over, the emphasis is rightly on the stabilisation of Iraq, on the building of civil society, on creating the conditions for a democratic state that can live in peace with its neighbours and also on restoring the Iraqi economy in the interests of the Iraqi people."
"Of course there are great hurdles to overcome."
"That is not in dispute."
"However we should be in no doubt that only the removal of Saddam Hussein has made any of these things possible."
"The second great task that can now be taken forward is progress towards a durable settlement between Israel and the Palestinians."
"The road map to peace sponsored by the Quartet offers a solid basis for a resolution of this most difficult of issues in the Middle East: the parties in the wider region, the blueprint for a lasting peace, a secure Israel whose right to exist is recognised by the Arab world, and a Palestinian state living side by side with Israel in harmony and peace."
"There is much work to be done on both of these projects, but the opportunity is there now for a real and lasting peace to be forged in this vitally important region of the world."
"As for the wider world, the crisis has created real questions about the United Nations and its ability to implement its own declared intentions."
"NATO has suffered internal divisions of a kind never before experienced."
"The European Union has demonstrated that it is incapable of speaking with a single voice, whilst some Member States have shown more interest in creating a counterweight to the United States, than in building a genuine transatlantic partnership based on common values."
"It is time for some straight talking."
"The actions of the gang of four at the Brussels summit last month clearly show the strategic error they are making in trying to divide the transatlantic alliance."
"Whatever soft words they say, this summit was a calculated attempt to foment division between Europe and the USA, and if we have learned anything from the events of recent months it is surely that Europe and America must stand together to deal with threats to our collective security."
"New structures and new military headquarters in competition with the United States would fracture an alliance that has served us well in Europe."
"I am glad that the majority of European nations understand this and have had the courage to say so."
"Finally, if Europe is serious about defence and security, it needs to provide the financial resources."
"New and divisive structures are not needed."
"What we need is increased capability."
"I hope that Europe has learned a lesson from this crisis."
"NATO and the transatlantic alliance must remain the bedrock of European defence."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is only a few weeks since the USA unilaterally decided to attack Iraq."
"Acting without a UN mandate, the United States began a war of aggression in a flagrant breach of international law."
"To be precise, it was not the USA alone that initiated the war: a whole string of allies, some of whom acted openly, but others secretly, also joined together in the 'coalition of the willing', or perhaps we should say 'coalition of the compliant'."
"In addition to the self-appointed occupying powers - the United States, United Kingdom and Poland - the ranks of the coalition of the willing also included such major military powers as Palau, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and the Kingdom of Tonga."
"The aim of this war of aggression was, acting in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, to remove weapons of mass destruction from Iraq."
"There is no legal basis in international law for the attacking forces' additional objective of overthrowing the regime of the dictator Saddam Hussein, nor is there any such provision in the Charter of the United Nations."
"Nor do I believe that it should be the role of the international community to remove dictators throughout the world by means of warfare."
"It also leaves a rather unpleasant aftertaste to consider that Britain's Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was willing to send umpteen thousand British soldiers into Iraq to hunt down one dictator, while the same Jack Straw, when he was Britain's Home Secretary, decided to release another dictator, Augusto Pinochet, and thereby thus allow him to escape from the clutches of British justice."
"The USA's unilateral war against Iraq achieved its objective of removing Saddam Hussein's regime."
"However, the war also resulted in appalling collateral damage: the first immediate victim was the United Nations Organisation and international law, the second was the unity of the European Union and the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and the third was NATO, which also received its share of ideological cluster bombs."
"The new doctrine of preventive war, launched by the chief ideologist, Richard Perle, the Lord of Darkness, has also shaken the foundations of NATO."
"Among the questions that remain to be answered, Mr President and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, are when this war will end and when the end of the war will be declared."
"So, firstly, what is the European Union doing to ensure that end to the war is declared?"
"Secondly, where are the weapons of mass destruction on account of which the war was declared?"
"If the Americans are not prepared to tell us what the position on weapons of mass destruction is, then we in Europe should at least tackle them and demand a statement."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I visited Iraq 12 days ago."
"I spent 8 days in the south, reviewing the public health situation in my capacity as the World Health Organisation's Special Envoy. I listened to the people."
"I met with 50 tribal leaders, upwards of 20 000 Marsh Arabs, and I reviewed and inspected extensively hospitals and primary health clinics in Basra, Al-Amara and other smaller towns and villages."
"I re-opened the World Health Organisation Office and I set up a clinic now dealing with 15 000 medical consultations a month."
"The people are relishing their freedom."
"Their joyfulness is tempered only by the continuation of the bitter legacy of Saddam."
"Their lives were malignly regulated down to the smallest detail."
"Saddam modelled his total control on Stalin, whom he emulated."
"The ordinary Iraqi family's purchase, even of one bar of soap, was politically directed and controlled."
"When sentenced to ear amputation, the prisoner had to seek out and pay the surgeon to perform the mutilation."
"The more money the prisoner was able to offer, the more ear the surgeon permitted to remain intact."
"A trade in human flesh, a cruel bargain with Saddam Hussein - for Saddam owned the Iraqi people's every movement from tear-sodden cradle to early and unquiet grave."
"These systems are still intact and throttling the Iraqi people."
"It is early days."
"The coalition forces are doing fine work, particularly in the south and in delivering public health to the people of Iraq."
"The United Nations - especially the World Health Organisation - is now fully engaged and is using its specialist skills to excellent effect."
"However, the UN can only do so much in such a complex and difficult political situation."
"Patience is needed, as is the continuing security provided by the coalition forces, to give the Iraqi people the time and space they need to unravel the evil web Saddam wove so skilfully around them."
"The task now is to help the people to enjoy their freedom and to entrench it constitutionally and politically for future generations."
"Mr President, we cannot shirk our responsibilities."
"The war against Iraq, based on the falsehood that weapons of mass destruction were present in the country, US militarisation and the principle of pre-emptive, indefinite war, has endangered the whole human race, forcing us to live in fear of terrorist crimes and the suffering they cause."
"We cannot fail to mention - it is our duty - that the USA's imperalist policy is destroying not just life, land, history and culture but the entire system of world relations, the United Nations Pact and international law."
"We cannot just turn the page and pretend that nothing has happened."
"We must build and rebuild our relations with the USA, with the countries of the world, with due respect for human and civil rights, pursuing justice and rejecting double standards, as in the case of the Israeli occupation of Palestine."
"Saddam Hussein has vanished into thin air, and, I, together with the Iraqis, can only rejoice, but the situation is unstable and the occupying forces must be replaced by an Iraqi government which includes women and is coordinated by the United Nations."
"The European Union must do its part, promoting reconstruction and economic aid, the reestablishment of democracy and the access for Iraq to its own resources."
"France, Germany, Belgium, the Pope and the crowds of pacifists have given the European Union and Europe credibility in that part of the world."
"Let us therefore continue to pursue a path leading, as I said, to respect for rights and not oppression and occupation."
"Mr President, we all knew that there was going to be a humanitarian disaster and that it was going to affect women and children especially, who make up the majority of the Iraqi population."
"We MEPs who were in Baghdad and Basra witnessed this in particular."
"The inspectors there told us - as did Mr Blix in the United Nations - that there were no weapons of mass destruction."
"I do not know what we are surprised about."
"But we were not aware of the immense irresponsibility of the occupiers."
"Chaos and the law of the jungle reign in Iraq and the citizens lack protection."
"And I would draw attention to the fact that the majority of the future occupiers are members of the European Union: the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, the Spanish State, while the European Union is absent."
"In this regard, Mr President, it seems to me ludicrous that Mr Poettering is still saying that we cannot create a European Union in opposition to the United States."
"Quite the contrary: the United States - the extreme right governing there - is working against the European Union as a body with a presence in the world."
"We are witnessing an unacceptable situation which this Parliament must condemn on behalf of the citizens of Europe who demonstrated against it."
"Mr President, we must call for the full restoration of United Nations law and we must point out once again that the 'oil for food' programme and the inspections are the sole responsibility of the United Nations."
"Otherwise, the established law will be broken, even with resolutions which the occupiers originally approved."
"In any event, I would like to say in particular today that I reject the position of the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Aznar, who has become a servant of the extreme right currently governing the United States."
"He wants to turn the Spanish State into a new Puerto Rico."
"Particularly in view of the fact that this goes against the views of the majority of the Spanish people."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, all possible humanitarian assistance must be provided, of course; but above all, if this assistance is to be effective, the political presence of the European Union and the United Nations is needed."
"Mr President, on behalf of the citizens of Iraq, we thank God that Saddam's reign of terror has been brought to an end."
"It is to be hoped that we will not have too long to wait for the fallen absolute ruler of Mesopotamia and his two sons to be arrested, if they are still alive."
"Precisely because of this Iraqi opposition circles are finally expecting clarification about the country's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction."
"With these same newcomers to the Iraqi political stage we are seriously concerned about the continuing lack of public safety in the capital Baghdad."
"Saddam's hand in this - his amnesty for almost 100 000 criminals just before the start of the military intervention by the Americans and the British - does not discharge the Americans in particular of their responsibility to provide for law and order in the administrative centre of the country."
"In this they can also count on the expertise and assistance of Iraq's burgeoning democratic forces."
"The huge task of reconstructing Iraq makes a substantial humanitarian contribution from the European Union equally welcome."
"The food stocks of Iraqi families are totally exhausted."
"A willingness to make sacrifices on our part will strengthen the transatlantic partnership."
"It will at the same time cultivate goodwill amongst the Iraqi civilian population."
"Washington's diplomatic efforts to contain religious radicalism in the region likewise deserve European backing."
"In this way Iraq's territorial integrity under democratic administration can also be safeguarded externally."
"Mr President, in the wake of the dreadful attack in Riyadh and the triumphant return of Ayatollah Al Akim to Iraq, it is important to realise that the way in which the UK-US coalition has dealt with the issue of Iraq has considerably clouded perspectives."
"Following 11 September, a relentless war was launched against Islamic terrorism by a coalition that consisted of almost the entire international community."
"Close cooperation, in particular between the United States and the countries of Europe, where the 11 September attack had been planned, began to produce results, with significant blows to the Al Qaeda network."
"The United States replaced this clear and virtually uncontested strategic approach with a much more hazardous project by borrowing the old domino theory, popular in the communist world in the 1970s, and applying it to the export of the democratic model to the Arab-Muslim arena based on a new Iraq democratised by the US."
"As far as democracy is concerned, what we are currently seeing with the anarchy that has followed the dictatorship is that there are more and more calls for the establishment of Sharia law in Iraq."
"If there were to be prolonged occupation, together with an ongoing general situation of insecurity, we would be facing a two-fold risk."
"Firstly, the ongoing military occupation of a country where the Shiite holy sites are located would give considerable fresh impetus to Islamic terrorism and, at a local level, the restoration of order would inevitably have to involve the network of Shiite mosques."
"Prolonging the current situation is therefore especially dangerous."
"It could compromise the vital resumption of a firm, global strategy to combat the multinationals of Islamic terrorism."
"The triple suicide bombing in Riyadh demonstrates that it is just as prevalent as always in spite of the military action in Iraq."
"In order to gather the international community together again around the urgent need to combat a form of terrorism that threatens us all, our immediate aim must not be to decide who to punish and who to reward, it is to prevent the situation in Iraq from deteriorating and ensuring that the military occupation is replaced as soon as possible with new Iraqi authorities who draw their legitimacy from the recognition accorded to them by the international community."
"Mr President, in my contribution, I will rise above the coarse insults directed at Prime Minster Aznar by a Member of this House."
"As regards the current situation in Iraq, I think we need to distinguish between what can and cannot wait."
"Re-establishing food supplies for people who have suffered under a long and cruel dictatorship and 12 years of embargo, Mr President, certainly cannot wait."
"Concerning the provision of humanitarian aid, the European Commission and many Member States deserve to be thanked for their efforts."
"Notwithstanding the efforts of the international community in general, and the European Union in particular, I feel it is important to put things into perspective."
"I will therefore take the liberty of quoting some figures regarding this aid."
"The United States is the principal donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq."
"Its contribution totals EUR 964 million."
"Great Britain is in second place with EUR 336 million and Japan is in third place with EUR 192 million."
"The figure for ECHO is EUR 100 million."
"Then there are the figures for other countries."
"Spain has donated EUR 60 million for humanitarian purposes, Australia, EUR 55 million, Canada and Germany EUR 50 million."
"I am sorry that Mr Wurtz is not present in the House as his country is contributing EUR 10 million in humanitarian aid, according to the figures of 13 May 2003."
"Mr President, there is clearly a need to re-establish supplies of drinking water and electricity in Iraq, along with health services."
"It is also clear that given the situation on the ground, the second priority has to be the formation of an interim Iraqi authority."
"Such an authority must be formed in a democratic manner and Iraqis must play a key role in the process."
"In my opinion, the authority also needs to be federal in nature."
"There is one great issue currently hanging in the balance."
"This is, or should be, the establishment of a multi-ethnic, multi-religious state, based on the principles of inclusion, representation and responsibility."
"This issue has come to the fore because the media has played up the religious reawakening in Iran."
"The latest debates at the United Nations show that past disagreements have been overcome and that there is now space for everyone to adopt constructive attitudes."
"Mr President, I believe this is the line the European Union should take."
"We have to help promote stability in the region."
"We must act and we must use our ability to engage in dialogues with the countries of the region to the full."
"Lebanon now has an Association Agreement with the European Union."
"Syria is part of the Euro-Mediterranean Association."
"We are currently engaged in a critical dialogue with Iran and we should also pursue the objectives of the so-called road-map."
"The United States, Mr President, has proposed an ambitious free trade agreement with the countries of the region."
"The European Union must use its ability to engage in dialogue to the full."
"We must work to ensure that the region is stable, peaceful, prosperous and democratic."
"Minister, the next informal meeting due to be held in Crete on 26 and 27 May should serve as a unique opportunity to develop the role the European Union must play in this difficult situation."
"Mr President, I have to say that I am surprised at how little has been said in this debate about the fact that a people has been liberated, that freedom reigns where terror once did and that Shia clerics are now able to return to Iraq in an atmosphere of religious toleration where once they were murdered."
"In the last few days we have seen a reminder of the nature of Saddam's regime with the discovery of yet another mass grave."
"Too much of the debate has been about apportioning blame for what has happened in the past and too little of it has been about looking forward."
"Ensuring that Iraq is run by Iraqis for Iraqis should be an absolute priority."
"The wishes and needs of the Iraqi people should be paramount."
"It is for that reason that I welcome the draft UN Resolution, which addresses the immediate needs of the Iraqi people."
"It lifts sanctions: how many people in this Chamber have been calling for that over the last few years?"
"It envisages a political process to put the country back into the hands of the Iraqis with the involvement of a UN special coordinator."
"It sets up a process to wind up the 'Oil for Food' programme while ensuring that oil can only be sold for the benefit of the Iraqi people and it creates a new fund for the reconstruction and humanitarian needs of Iraq which involves the IMF and the World Bank."
"There are of course many problems to be dealt with."
"We cannot run reconstruction from the top down as if it were a military campaign."
"We cannot impose systems and procedures dreamed up in Washington and expect them to work."
"We have to have a bottom-up approach which involves the Iraqi people first and foremost."
"In order for that to happen, the establishment of security, effective policing and the rule of law should be given absolute priority."
"My concern is that American troops, unlike British troops, are not equipped for policing action and our priority therefore should be to get police into northern Iraq."
"We have already seen security established largely in southern Iraq."
"My final concern is that there has been no proper discussion on debt reconstruction in Iraq, nor even on who the debt belongs to."
"Until we resolve these issues there will be no long-term solution for Iraq."
"Mr President, the chairman of our group has already covered what I wanted to say."
"I would point out: first, disgust and condemnation for what happened yesterday in Saudi Arabia - yes, but let us not forget that Commissioner Patten closed his speech when the war started by saying that the situation and developments in Iraq would exacerbate the problem of terrorism - and now we are reaping the fruit of the deeds of the United States and Great Britain, and of this tacit stance on the part of the European Union."
"Secondly, I feel sorry for the European Parliament."
"We are living through one of the darkest days of the European Parliament."
"What shall we say to our citizens during the European elections in a year's time?"
"What did we do doing the war?"
"We did not pass a single decision, a single resolution."
"What did we do after the war?"
"When we have cholera, when we have dozens dead, when we have the looting of Baghdad museum, when we have the looting of nuclear facilities, we do not pass a decision, we do not pass a resolution, because those who back the war do not want the European Parliament to pass a resolution and stand before European public opinion."
"Thirdly, a call to the president-in-office: not allied forces, Mr President-in-Office, not allied forces!"
"They are occupying forces."
"That is what we should call them, because the European Union should not back faits accomplis."
"As many people have already said, the justification for the invasion and occupation of Iraq was about the existence of weapons of mass destruction but, as we all know, it was more about regime change."
"As Mr Sakellariou said, there is no justification in international law for the invasion and occupation of a country to change the regime in that country."
"It sets a very dangerous precedent."
"However, in relation to weapons of mass destruction, none have been found."
"That is clear."
"This was the justification, despite what some people were saying all along about the situation."
"It is essential that the weapons inspectors return to Iraq, for Hans Blix to be allowed back in."
"Let them verify whether or not weapons of mass destruction were there."
"As we all know, that is highly unlikely."
"It also means that the US, the UK and the others who supported them are pursuing a shoot-to-kill policy - i.e. we believe or suspect the Iraqis have weapons of mass destruction, therefore we go in, we shoot and kill the people and then afterwards we find out there was no justification for this action."
"This is a war crime in my eyes."
"I do not believe that there was any justification for what happened in Iraq."
"It is essential that the weapons inspectors be allowed back in."
"In relation to the proposal mentioned by several speakers, this UK-, US- and Spanish-backed proposal for a UN resolution would put the administration of Iraq, including decisions on its oil reserves, into the hands of the invaders and occupying forces."
"This is blatant, modern-day colonialism and we should not allow it."
"In relation to Iraq itself, Iraq was one of the countries in the region with the most advanced education system, with education for all - male and female alike."
"Now that education system has been completely decimated."
"Some people today have mentioned women's rights within Iraq."
"One of the ways to ensure that women are liberated, have rights and know their rights, is through a proper education system."
"What will happen in relation to the education system in Iraq and how will it be reinstated?"
"So, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen representing the Member States, the opponents of the war were right."
"The destabilisation, the aggression and the invasion of Iraq caused by the US-UK union - the only union which is at this minute still standing - no more sought to topple the Baath socialist regime than to destroy phantom weapons of mass destruction."
"Very simply, the aim was the wholesale destruction of Iraq in order to realise the ideological and industrial designs of the small gang of theorists with a portfolio who reign in Washington."
"They really could not care less about peace in the Middle East or the Iraqi people, who they are deliberately - and I mean deliberately - plunging into anarchy, with its terrible trail of unspeakable violence and suffering."
"They play with people as one plays with marbles, and that is the way of empires, particularly this US empire."
"Europe has allowed its creation out of cowardice, by eradicating its only roots, its nations, in particular France, which is the only country to implement an independent global policy, and not because Europe is old but simply because, deprived of national vigour, it is politically dead."
"It will therefore only be further hypocrisy to speak today in this ludicrous forum of rebuilding Iraq, when what is really on the agenda is destroying Iraq until not a stone remains standing, except, of course, for the derricks."
"The question is not how to rebuild, but to what extent we will destroy Iraq, humiliate the Arab people and heighten their anger to play into the hands of the ideologists who want at all costs to provoke a general war between civilisations, which will be a war against civilisations, beginning with what is left of our own."
"Mr President, the situation in Iraq now presents us with the extremely difficult task of determining how the transition process will be legitimised and guided after the end of the war towards the free, democratic system founded on political, religious and ethnic diversity that we all wish to see."
"The motion for a resolution submitted by the United States to the UN on Friday appears to reduce the Security Council's involvement to a minor role, regulates the use of the oil reserves rigorously according to a preconceived order and, lastly, fails to set a term to the duration of the US and UK administration, which means it will probably remain in place for quite some time."
"Lastly, it is said that the interim administration will be managed by the occupying powers, together with the Iraqi people and a UN coordinator."
"The formula is generic and seems to confine the role of the UN chiefly to the coordination of humanitarian aid or not much more."
"Europe is sending a specific request for much greater involvement in the immediate term."
"Since the European Union is the closest entity in geopolitical terms, it would be truly absurd for it not to be involved in a process which is so important for the future of the region."
"Moreover, we cannot endorse the US strategy to create a link with the talks with Iran, intended to avert the danger of the large Shiite population having a destabilising effect."
"This ethno-religious situation must be evaluated with extreme care, but Europe cannot now stand by and do nothing in the face of the terrifying scenes heralded by the Al Qaeda's resumption of its strategy of terror."
"The stabilisation of Iraq, with measures to ensure religious peace between the different ethic elements, is clearly necessary in a region such as the Gulf where the insidious web of Islamic terrorism is so desperately strong and has penetrated so very deep."
"This attack, which is reminiscent of the attack in Chechnya, makes the challenge posed to the West by the international web of Islamic fanaticism a matter of great relevance once again."
"Therefore, over and above its differences with the United States over Iraq, Europe must shoulder all its responsibilities and combat organised terrorism, which, as has now been extensively proven, is finding a home even in the Member States of the European Union, in many mosques and Islamic centres, often funded by Saudi Arabia."
"Mr President, I am not a particular friend of the Bush government, but I would take this opportunity to congratulate and thank the Americans and the coalition for the military action in Iraq."
"It was swift and effective and succeeded in its purpose of removing of an evil regime."
"The terrible consequences for the whole of the Middle East foreseen by some in this plenary did not arise."
"Having thanked the Americans, it is time to tell them that we do not expect them to stay in Iraq for one hour longer than is necessary."
"I am confident that they share this view, and it is my hope that the United Nations will play the dominant role in post-war Iraq."
"The European Union too has a role to play in Iraq in the months to come - the role of supporting democratic development in order to stabilise the whole region."
"We can draw on the experiences of the Union's efforts in Afghanistan and I look forward to seeing a united Europe behind this new, big challenge in Iraq, starting with the lifting of sanctions."
"Mr President, in my one minute, I should like briefly to emphasise the following: it is a disgrace that there will be no resolution today, obviously because the majority does not want the unprovoked illegal attack by the United States and Great Britain to be condemned."
"That was also clear from most of the speeches today."
"Neither the Commissioner nor the Presidency, while condemning the terrorist attack in Riad, had so much as a word, even of disapproval, for the predatory, terrorist, criminal attack by the United States and Great Britain."
"It is a disgrace!"
"On the contrary, even today they essentially wanted to legalise the crime by unashamedly acknowledging the responsibility of the occupying forces for keeping order and for reconstruction, obviously hoping that the European Union will be given a slice of the pie."
"It is a disgrace!"
"Neither one nor the other stood up against the position of the United States on a preventive strike, leaving the way clear for the crime to be repeated."
"Besides, they all, including the European Union, agreed in Prague on the preventive strike."
"Once again, it is a disgrace, Mr President."
"It is up to us to roundly condemn the crime. To call for the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces from Iraq and for the invaders to pay the cost of restoring the damage they caused."
"For the invaders and their Iraqi associates to be convicted as war criminals. The UN must decide even at this late stage on strict sanctions against the invaders and must supervise payment of the compensation."
"And finally, for the Iraqi people to be left free to take its fate in its own hands without conquerors."
"Consequently, the Iraqi people must organise and develop their national resistance."
"Only the defeat of the conquerors will bring peace and order."
"We owe them our solidarity."
"Mr President, I regret the fact that this debate is not to be followed by a resolution, as it is vital for Parliament to send a political signal to the general public regarding this serious international crisis triggered off by the United States' warmongering diplomacy."
"That has demonstrated to a ridiculous extent what virtually the entire international community condemned as the real driving force behind this unilateral aggression, as my colleagues in the Verts/ALE Group had already pointed out."
"These measures, however, cannot be reduced to mere verbal condemnation. In the fact of this global hegemonic power, the credibility, and even the future, of the UN has received a dangerous blow and we cannot remain indifferent to this."
"It has had a knock-on effect on the political goals of our Community project too, on its attempt to unite the voices of Europe in both a spirit of consensus and international legitimacy."
"Twenty-four million souls are abandoned to their sorry fate, without even a guarantee that their daily needs will be met."
"This is indeed a very, very serious hour and a European initiative is urgently required."
"We cannot content ourselves with becoming a reconstruction agency, although that task is absolutely necessary and urgent."
"The jeopardising of a potential historic turning point in the international situation has now become more than just a slick, journalistic phrase."
"The threat is very real and seems to be being overlooked in this Chamber."
"It is therefore up to this enlarged Parliament, including the observers from the new Member countries, to realise that the European Union must propose a more mature, more long-term alternative in light of the United States' opportunistic and mercenary calculations."
"It is up to us to consider, for instance, the legalist voices, such as France, Germany and Belgium, and establish a common, united position."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the UN must be restored to its place at the centre of the international negotiating mechanism."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, today I want to talk about the lessons the Union must learn from its impotence throughout this entire Iraqi crisis, something that you yourselves have quite rightly lamented."
"On 10 April, by a majority of three-quarters, Parliament adopted a resolution on the new European security and defence architecture, desirable at the end of this war."
"This very broad consensus does not come as a surprise as even the latest Eurobarometer polls indicate that 71% of EU citizens are currently in favour of the development of a common policy in this area."
"Moreover, this request is also coming from outside the Union, from the many parties who wish the European Union to play its part in managing the affairs of a world whose future must no longer rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America."
"It must be said that this long-awaited Europe does not yet exist, and it will not exist until the institutional reforms which are vital for its operation have been implemented."
"That is the inspiration behind Parliament's proposals, although we are well aware of the limits to their scope."
"We are quite aware that it will ultimately be up to the Convention to recommend whether they be adopted."
"If three quarters of the Members of Parliament were prepared to take up such a clear and, in certain cases, courageous stance on this issue in a roll-call vote last month, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is because, thanks to the Iraqi crisis, they understood that it was essential to give their unreserved support to our colleagues currently working in the working groups on defence, chaired by Commissioner Barnier, and on foreign policy, chaired by Mr Dehaene."
"Having learned the lessons of the Iraqi crisis and appalled by the cacophony that prevailed within the Union during the crisis, all those in favour of building a common house agree that tomorrow's Europe of 25 members will take its rightful place in the international arena, which it has been unable to retain as a Europe of Fifteen."
"The main goal must be to enable Europe to speak with a single voice at last."
"If the Convention succeeds in this, it will be because it has been able to learn from the recent divisions, which I, like you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, am convinced are more illusory than real."
"Mr President, there are no bounds to my joy at the toppling of Saddam Hussein and of his regime, but that does not mean that I do not believe as strongly as ever that this war was wrong."
"It was in contravention of international law and there was an alternative; I am surprised that so few Members remember that in May 2002 we agreed on an alternative course."
"It seems that many of us have a very short memory."
"However, let me peer into the future: the conscience of the world, and that includes the conscience and the views of the Polish Pope, has been assuaged by promises that the United Nations would be involved after the war and that the international community would come into its own then."
"The draft Security Council resolution is a farce and the British minister Clare Short has acted consistently by resigning."
"Now let me look a little further into the future, and consider the Middle East peace process."
"In this case too we were told that the Iraq war would make it possible to set the peace process in train, but that nothing had yet been decided."
"So how do things look now?"
"On the Palestinian side an important step has, thank goodness, been taken in response to pressure from the US and principally from Europe, with the appointment for the first time of a prime minister, Abu Mazen."
"We wish to give him our full support so that he can do what he has promised and what in my view he would really like to do - to fight violence and terrorism."
"But the reaction on the Israeli side, or to be precise on the part of Mr Sharon's Israeli government, is not exactly positive."
"If Mr Sharon refuses to welcome Mr Solana, then that is something the entire European Union should be protesting against."
"Just as Mr Sharon cannot claim, thank goodness, to speak for the whole of Israel, nor can Abu Mazen - unfortunately - claim at present to represent the whole of Palestine."
"Arafat is also a force in Palestine that we need to win over to this peace process, and that is why discussions with him are also both necessary and justified."
"I have to say, however, that I have heard relatively little from those people who claimed before the war that we would be on the 'peace front' after the war, working to achieve peace."
"I have in mind in particular Spain's Prime Minister Aznar."
"I am pleased to say that Mr Papandreou, on the other hand, is very active."
"I also hear a lot from Mr Solana, and I hope that everyone in this House and in Europe will now at least attempt to achieve progress in the peace process in Israel and Palestine, and to implement the road map, even if it leaves a lot to be desired."
"For there can no longer be any excuse nor the least justification for this war, if we cannot even get the peace process going."
"Mr President, we are glad the dictatorship in Iraq has come to an end."
"It should be borne in mind however that the war was not fought simply to end the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein."
"The United States tolerates other dictatorships around the world."
"Wars are not fought about those."
"We Spaniards lived for over 20 years under a dictatorship directly supported by the United States."
"The stated aim of the war was the elimination of weapons of mass destruction."
"No such weapons have been found, however."
"I would like to point out that a conference was held in the Azores prior to the war in Iraq. It was attended by the United States, the United Kingdom and the Prime Minister of Spain."
"The last group photograph before the attack on Iraq was taken there."
"Now the war is over, however, control of Iraq has not been divided between those who attended the Azores conference."
"It has been divided instead between the United States, the United Kingdom and Poland."
"Spain has been sidelined."
"Its involvement does not seem to be consistent with its government's support for the war."
"Much more than the Archaeological Museum has been destroyed in Iraq."
"There is a great deal of reconstruction work to be done."
"Let us hope too that the United Nations will once again become the guarantor of world order."
"It is perhaps not generally known that the small country I come from is among those countries that have given the United States an unconditional endorsement. In this quite surrealistic debate, I should like, moreover, to draw attention to a most outstanding contribution by my fellow countryman and fellow MEP, Mr Andreasen from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, who is closely associated with the Danish Prime Minister."
"Normally, he speaks in Danish, which is a good idea. As a symbolic act, he gave his speech in English, however, and that of course brilliantly reflects his close relationship with the Danish Prime Minister, who belongs to the same political party as himself and is a close colleague of his."
"The Danish Prime Minister spent five days in Washington, and the press - the Danish world press, with which my fellow MEPs are probably unfamiliar - described how, during the concluding session, as the Prime Minister paid tribute to President Bush for his honourable conduct, the strains of Mendelsohn's Wedding March from the famous play were suddenly heard. I should like, moreover, to emphasise - for my fellow MEPs may well not be aware of this - that Mr Andreasen, who gave the Prime Minister his unconditional endorsement, is certainly no slouch when it comes to irony."
"The rhetoric on which the Danish Government's endorsement of the United States is based is so absurd that only a major ironist could expose it, as my fellow MEP did so brilliantly, it being understood that what is so surreal about this debate is that the EU has no common foreign policy and that this Parliament would in any case have no influence over such a policy."
"Mr President, the highly predictable military victory of the US and UK forces in Iraq has generated among some people a sort of ad hoc opportunism: let us forget all about past quarrels and let us build a democratic Iraq under the expert leadership of the US."
"This vision, although legally tenable, is unlikely to get European foreign policy off to a good start again."
"We will not pick up the pieces and re-establish European unity as a future project by drawing a veil over the causes of the unilateral military operation and the manner in which it was planned and decided."
"We must first expose the falsehood, which I would call the falsehood of the century, the claim that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction that could threaten global security."
"Not a single prohibited weapon has been found."
"It becomes clearer every day that the people of the world as well as the United Nations have been fooled by those who have wanted for a long time to find a pretext for war at all costs."
"We must also condemn a second falsehood, which claims that the United Nations has failed and that, as a result, the reconstruction of Iraq and its oil - which some call the spoils of war - should be a matter for the victors."
"The United Nations has not failed."
"It has been brutally swept aside by those who did not succeed in achieving the qualified majority required by the Security Council."
"Although international law has been violated, there is now a chance to reestablish it. As far as the European Union is concerned, this means reestablishing the United Nations' responsibility for crisis management in full."
"I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to reject the United States' requests and to remain firm in their desire to entrust the UN, and the UN alone, with a central role in post-war Iraq."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, however strange it may sound, I do not feel there is any point in taking advantage of and squandering the 3 minutes at my disposal to make you suffer by repeating everything that has been said to saturation point in this Chamber on the tragedy in Iraq over the last few months."
"That is why I shall also confine myself to one question which, in my opinion, needs to be asked as a matter of priority now by the European Parliament, the elected representative body of the peoples of Europe, to whom we have to answer for our judgments and decisions and who are interested and ultimately entitled to have at least one answer as regards the pretexts which the leadership of the war coalition used primarily in order to justify its actions and persuade or deceive international and, in particular, European public opinion."
"What, in other words, was the specific outcome of the attack on Iraq and the triumphant military victory over the regime of Saddam Hussein, as regards the location and neutralisation of the banned Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, the establishment of a democratic and representative Iraqi government and the elimination of international terrorism and, in particular Al Qaeda?"
"Mr President, the success of the US operation in Iraq and the speed with which the objective of liberating the country from the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein was achieved, with a relatively low toll of victims, are confirmation of what many had thought, namely that the war was going to be the least difficult part of this operation."
"The attack in Riyadh - which is already giving some people, not least in this House, a perverse, ill-concealed sense of satisfaction because they now feel justified in saying 'We knew there was no point in attacking Iraq' - is proof that the real war against terrorism is only just starting."
"Now starts the phase of reconstructing the country, which has been destroyed and laid waste, and of mending the alliances compromised by the war."
"With the help of the 10 countries which we have just welcomed into our midst, the European Union must show that is capable of genuine unity."
"Of course, it is exciting to see that, after this war which some people still persist in describing as unnecessary, pamphlets, books and newspapers are being sold on the streets of Baghdad which would have led to a prison sentence and torture under Saddam Hussein - or, elsewhere, under Communism."
"We will soon be listening to the President of Poland, Mr Kwasniewski, speaking in this House."
"He and I belong to different political wings, but he has shown himself to be a courageous leader, giving his country's support for the intervention in Iraq, and this has earned him the criticism of those Heads of State and Government which made the wrong political decision and now find it hard to admit their error."
"In his meeting with Mr Chirac and Mr Schröder last week, President Kwasniewski asked for Poland not to be forced to choose between Europe and the United States: it is possible to be the friend of both."
"We in Parliament must endeavour to be the friends of both as well."
"Mr President, it is a matter of regret that Parliament has found it impossible to construct a resolution for today's debate."
"It is obvious from the debate here that we could in fact have constructed a resolution on a wide range of issues on which we agree."
"We would, of course, have had to leave aside a lot of the self-justification that we all tend to engage in on all sides."
"I oppose the war and I continue to oppose its outcome and the direction which Iraq is taking at the present time."
"However, we must seek to reconstruct confidence in a law-based world order."
"We cannot do that by seeking to justify ourselves in terms of our attitudes to the war."
"We have to do it by, in the first place, seeking to construct a unity in the European Union."
"We have to find a middle ground between those who see a need for a unipolar world and those who see the need for a multipolar world."
"There is no way out of this."
"The European Union has to address this issue."
"It could give a lead in trying to do this and I hope that when they meet next week the leaders of our groups will seek to put in place some mechanism to enable Parliament to address this matter."
"We cannot seriously ask the people to support us in the European elections next year and at the same time pretend we do not have a role and that we have nothing to say about the direction the world is going in."
"This is of the utmost importance."
"We are talking about war and peace."
"Life is still cheap in the Middle East and we will continue to count the cost of the recent war for a very long time."
"We need to get to grips with our different world views."
"We need to get to grips with the United States and persuade them that a law-based world order is far better than a Pax Americana."
"In their interests and in our interests it is essential that we do this as a matter of urgency."
"Mr President, I first wish to join with the other Members in condemning the terrible terrorist atrocity in Riyadh and offering sympathy to the bereaved and injured."
"Now that the war in Iraq has ended, the emphasis shifts to rebuilding and reconstruction."
"As well as the physical and political reconstruction of Iraq, we also have to rebuild relationships within the EU itself and our credibility in the field of common foreign and security policy, we have to repair the damage that has been inflicted on the UN and, last but not least, we have to rebuild the transatlantic relationship."
"The attitude of the US in the post-war situation will provide the key as to whether or not we can achieve any or all of these."
"I value the transatlantic relationship."
"It is in the interest of both the EU and the United States that the present rift in our relationship be healed."
"However, it has to be said that it must be a genuine partnership of equals and not simply one in which the EU role is that of a junior partner and in which we are automatically expected to support US foreign policy without question and, if we disagree with aspects of it, are accused of being disloyal and anti-American."
"What has been totally unacceptable is the reported anti-French hysteria, in particular that attributed to the Washington Government establishment."
"There needs to be a change in the attitude of the current US Administration if the transatlantic relationship is indeed to be restored."
"Giving the United Nations the lead role in post-war Iraq, as EU leaders have requested, would be the clearest demonstration on the part of the United States that it values the transatlantic relationship and it genuinely wants to rebuild it."
"It should not be forgotten that the United Nations fulfilled a similar role in East Timor in 1999."
"This experience should now be put to good use in the interests of the people of Iraq."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, before the war, during the war, and today, after the war in Iraq, Parliament has faithfully analysed the situation and expressed its views."
"Unfortunately, these views have differed, but that is the way things are: the European Union is divided."
"Mine have not changed. I wholly condemn Saddam Hussein's regime, but I fear that the way in which the United States brought it down has created a situation which is, if not equally horrific, at least as unmanageable."
"I do not endorse wars that are decided upon unilaterally. I believe the role of international organisations must be reaffirmed, particularly the role of the UN, not only in approving the use of force but also in supervising reconstruction."
"Reaffirming principles is a good start but it is not enough."
"Rebuilding after destroying is a duty, including for those who in no way participated in the destruction."
"Yet this is still not enough."
"We must also do everything in our power to understand why and how Europeans as well as Europeans and Americans have become so divided."
"We must do everything in our power to rebuild our union, not just around a table but in our minds too."
"This means that we must work flat out to agree on a vision of the world or, at least, to achieve converging visions on major problems such as transatlantic relations, the role and reforms of international organisations, the role of the law and of force, and so on. These are difficult subjects and are sometimes even taboo subjects."
"These efforts to achieve mutual understanding and clarification of ideas by seeking consensus whenever possible, however, are utterly essential for us after the blow we have been dealt."
"It is absolutely vital to rebuild Iraq and to save human lives."
"Nonetheless, we must also rebuild, or rather build, a common vision of the world and our responsibilities in the world."
"The Greek Presidency has endeavoured to begin this work, but we have a long, long way to go."
"Mr President, we have to recognise that the relationship between the European Union and the United States is at an all-time low."
"I believe that over the coming months we have a role to play in this Parliament, along with the Council and the Commission, to rebuild that relationship."
"When we recognise the great need there will be to rebuild Iraq, we must also recognise the tremendous need to rebuild the relationship between the European Union and the United States."
"We have to face up to the truth."
"The truth is that we have grown apart."
"Each of us has focused on different priorities and, in many ways, we have ceased to understand each other's concerns."
"After the attacks on the Twin Towers on that terrible day in 2001, the United States concentrated on terrorism: where the next attack was coming from, homeland security."
"In Europe we went on to bring in the euro and concentrate on enlargement."
"To some extent we have lost track of what we have been trying to do."
"We have both retreated to hurling insults at each other across the Atlantic."
"Now is the time for each of us, on both sides of the pond, to take a step back and allow things to calm down."
"We must begin to rebuild that relationship."
"We have far too great a common bond."
"We share common values. We must not allow recent events to continue, or ferment or destroy us."
"Yes, it will take time and no doubt it will be difficult."
"There will always be disagreements between us and the United States. Let us hope that those disagreements, in the future, will only be in the WTO, over steel or on trade."
"Those are natural disagreements, which we can have."
"But let us begin a renewed, an improved, deeper relationship and one that will not crumble as the last one did."
"Mr President, I too should like to express my deepest disappointment at the fact that we proved unable to agree on a joint resolution of the European Parliament, despite the fact that today's debate shows that there is common ground, that there are the materials to build a common European identity."
"An identity that can offer politics, logic and culture against the violence and the social and cultural barbarity being promoted by the new military doctrine of the United States."
"The European Union has a duty and an obligation to study in depth the new international situation being created by American expansionism and the untrustworthiness of the neo-conservative American leadership."
"We have a duty to demand answers to questions which still remain open:"
"First, about the blatant violation of international law with an aggressive war; secondly, about the attempt to deceive public opinion about alleged weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be the lie of the century; thirdly, about the barbaric looting of cultural treasures, and I hope that no museum will dare receive the stolen goods; fourthly, about the annihilation of hundreds of civilians, about the destruction of infrastructures, about the bombing of television stations and the murder of journalists and, last but not least, about the war unleashed by the United States against the United Nations."
"Certainly, the collapse of the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein cannot be used to whitewash the Americans and their allies."
"Finally, I should like to stress that the worthy women of Iraq can make a decisive contribution to the ending of the chaos in post-war Iraq, to the reconstruction of the country and to the future democratic governance."
"The presidency and the Commission must demand the immediate application of unanimous UN resolution 1325 calling for increased participation and representation of women in all decision-making centres at all levels."
"And finally, we hope that on 21 June the European Union will exert its influence so that decisions are taken that will implement the road map, so that a fair solution can at last be found to the question of the Middle East and a climate of trust can be restored with the Arab world."
"Mr President, a few very brief final comments on the debate in Parliament this morning."
"We have to deal with three issues that are closely bound up with each other."
"The main issue, I think, is what we are doing in Iraq immediately, what we are doing in Iraq in relation to the problems that have arisen, with the misery, with the people, with the need to restore normalcy, to combat the phenomena tormenting the people over there."
"I think that, at this stage of the debate, this is much more important than debating internal divisions and a series of other issues which are of course important, but which are not as pressing or urgent as the situation in Iraq."
"I think that the European Union, to judge by appearances, has answers to this."
"It has both practical answers - humanitarian aid, support for cultural issues, support and pressure to find a peace process in the Middle East - and political answers to a series of issues which I shall not repeat, because it is important that the European Union has come out, has supported these principles, has made the efforts it has made during all these months for a different position to be heard on a series of such issues."
"The second point, of course, is what happens with the international system, with the role of the UN, where this war in Iraq has got us in terms of weapons of mass destruction."
"There are important gaps here which need answers."
"In fact, the European Union does, I think, have a position here and you here, today, raised a series of issues and it is important that they be raised and answered."
"The third point, the major issue to come out of this entire crisis is the need for a common foreign policy, a common policy on security and defence issues."
"I think that, within all these procedures, a new momentum has started up in the European Union, from which we need to learn lessons and see what we can do."
"I should like, however, to close by commenting that many who speak of the need for a common foreign policy or common security or defence policy consider that what must of necessity emerge from these procedures are decisions or positions which correspond absolutely to their creed and their positions."
"This is precisely the problem we have in developing a common foreign policy."
"This policy will prosper, will become a reality only once we realise that we need to broker compromises between us, understand the positions developed by all of us and find those elements that can unite us, that can act as a common denominator, and not those elements on which we have differences."
"It was this approach, moreover, that allowed us, I believe, over the last two or three months, to take certain steps in this direction, steps which were welcomed both by public opinion and by you here, by the European Parliament."
"Mr President, my first remark in response to this discussion is that I am very pleased to note, and I agree with the way Mr De Rossa put it, that there is broad agreement in Parliament on most of the important elements of the situation."
"This discussion in Parliament has shown that the European Parliament is a source of constructive ideas in the EU and a lot of inspiration can be drawn from what has been said this morning."
"A lot of inspiration is needed."
"My second remark is specifically to Mr Titley, who raised the issue of Iraq's debt."
"This is a core element in clearing the ground so that we can move forward."
"Success depends on focussing on the issue of handling and clarifying Iraq's debt."
"To do this an honest broker is needed. It is not conceivable that the occupying power would ever be seen as that."
"This is one very good illustration, relating to a very practical and crucial point, of the need to have the UN playing exactly that role of honest broker."
"We need to ask all creditors to come forward to present their case."
"We can use the IMF and the World Bank as the treasurer of this operation, and use the UN as the honest broker."
"Anything else will not work, but instead create suspicion."
"To Mr Andreasen, who expressed a strong hope that the UN will have a real role, I would say, please spend the minutes it takes to read the draft resolution now on the table at the Security Council. Having done so, please talk to your Prime Minister."
"This is what must be done to bring that hope into what looks a little like political talk."
"On the big, broader issue of the role of the Commission and reconstruction, it is not enough for Member States to say that they want the Commission to do something in this area."
"If we do not organise the basic political conditions properly, it will be difficult for the Commission to play a meaningful, effective role."
"The reality here is that we are still in a phase where the basic, real, political issues must be addressed first."
"Finally, many Members have correctly pointed out that the big problem is the ability to agree a position in Europe."
"I agree that a qualified majority vote is better than disqualified unanimity."
"People will say that is not a guarantee that Europe will have one single standpoint."
"No, but Europe will have a standpoint and that is the one which will have authority."
"There might be disagreement after a vote, yes, but Europe will have a standpoint."
"The dynamics of everyone in the Union knowing that a standpoint can emerge after a discussion is a very pedagogical instrument, which will discipline politics in regard to how things are being discussed."
"There is a world of difference between qualified majority and disqualified unanimity."
"Mr President, I asked Commissioner Nielson a question to which I would like a reply."
"I asked him to explain his statement that the Americans are well on the way to becoming members of OPEC."
"I should like to hear what he has to say about this."
"I hope that you can give him the opportunity to give me a reply."
"I am not going to restart the debate."
"The Commissioner can reply if he wishes."
"Mr President, it would look strange if I did not reply."
"This was my way of condensing the analysis, linguistically speaking, in order to express the concern that if the resolution before the Security Council does not give the United Nations a real role, and if it is adopted, then the occupying powers will de facto be the ones to decide on the oil in Iraq."
"That is self-evident, and is not adding anything of substance to this discussion."
"The ending of all sanctions would also normalise Iraq's situation as a large oil producing and exporting country."
"It was a member of OPEC."
"In putting it the way I did, I was trying to clarify the discussion."
"I think, to some extent, I have drawn attention to the reality of who would be in power if the United Nations is not given an authoritative role."
". (PT) The illegal, unjust and illegitimate war against Iraq waged by the UK and US armies, with thousands of highly destructive bombs including cluster bombs being dropped, with the deaths of thousands of people, the destruction of huge residential areas, markets, hospitals, schools and other public places, followed by the sacking and pillaging of the historical and cultural heritage of the Iraqi people and of humanity as a whole, demands that the Bush Administration and its allies be called to account for their actions."
"We cannot accept any attempt to whitewash the crimes that have been committed, in an attempt, after the event, to justify the aggression and occupation."
"We regret the fact that the EU has not issued a clear and resounding condemnation of this aggression against Iraq and we insist on the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces."
"The sovereignty of the Iraqi people and the territorial integrity of its country must be respected."
"Solidarity with the Iraqi people, with the Palestinian people and with all peoples engaged in a struggle means that we must step up the fight for peace, for disarmament, to abolish nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, for military bases in foreign territory to be dismantled, for NATO to be dissolved, against militarism, for the UN Charter to be respected and for peoples' sovereignty and their right to decide their own destiny to be safeguarded."
"Mr President, I have just found out that some observers are taking part in votes by raising their hands. Would you please make it clear once again, for the avoidance of doubt, that it is of course only full Members of this House who may take part in votes."
"We are very keen that the observers play as full a role as possible in the work of Parliament, but they are not entitled to vote."
"That is quite clear."
"Thank you for pointing that out."
"Report (A5-0140/2003) by Neena Gill, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament for the financial year 2004 (2003/2016(BUD))"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. and resumed at 12.30 p.m.)"
"Mr President, on the voting slip which we have in front of us it says that Amendment No 85 is identical to Amendment No 99."
"I should like to point out that this is not actually the case."
"The two amendments are significantly different, especially in relation to the Nuclear Conventions of Paris and Vienna."
"In Amendment No 85, the paragraph which is under the IMO provisions is not under the nuclear provisions."
"In Amendment No 99, it is."
"I know this is slightly confusing, but it is a confusing directive!"
"They are not the same and therefore should not be voted as identical amendments."
"To me they are similar so we can vote on them together, if possible."
". (PT) I support this report, which finally creates the legal instrument that has been for too long awaited by the cooperative sector."
"I share the concern that creating the Statute for the European Cooperative Society should respect employees' acquired rights and the protection of these rights, both when an SCE is set up and in the structural changes of an already-existing SCE."
"Furthermore, the SCE must ensure that workers are informed and consulted and are permanently represented and involved in the management of the SCE."
"Consequently, decisions must take account of the opinions of employee representatives."
"Lastly, I wish to highlight:"
"a) the legislative role given to Member States in the regulation on the Statute for employee representatives on the SCE and the importance of the principle that employee representatives should benefit from the same level of protection as employee representatives at national level;"
"b) the initiatives in the field of Corporate Social Responsibility, which must be promoted by employee representatives when they participate in the management of SCEs;"
"c) gender balance. We must ensure that the methods used to nominate, appoint or elect employee representatives promote gender balance."
". (PT) With the proposal for a directive addressed in this report, the Commission is seeking to supplement the Statute for a European Cooperative Society with regard to the involvement of employees."
"In addition to the legal and institutional issues involved in this entire process, we need fundamentally to adapt its content on reconciling employee participation and rights in European Cooperative Societies."
"The rapporteur broadly accepts the Commission's proposals and confines himself to tabling a limited number of new elements, specifically concerning: gender balance, Corporate Social Responsibility and the level of protection afforded to employee representatives, which must be the same as that afforded to employee representatives at national level."
"There is also a proposal to remove the clause that would allow Member States not to implement the system of employee participation in the event that a European Cooperative Society is established by the merger of two cooperatives, which would clearly call employee rights into question. It is therefore appropriate to remove this clause."
". I have voted for the De Rossa report on cooperatives and its implications for working people because it is an excellent contribution to the development of cooperatives in the European Union."
"My colleague, Mr De Rossa, has produced a report which will assist in the proliferation of the cooperative model which when experienced by working people is seen as having key advantages."
"In the UK cooperative sector, which is now growing and has gone through a process of modernisation, this report will be welcomed."
". (PT) I am voting against the report because I feel that the issue directly related to the involvement of employees in European Cooperative Societies (SCE) exceeds the scope of Article 137."
"In changing this legal base, the rapporteur has attempted to promote new powers for Parliament which do not appear to comply with the letter and the spirit of the Treaties."
"In my opinion, just like Paragraph 1(e) of the same article, which runs counter to the recommendation of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Paragraph 3 of that article does not constitute a sufficient and necessary legal basis for the desired employee participation in the life of these cooperative societies. The use of Article 308 is, therefore, fully justified."
"Similarly, I believe that allowing arrangements for the involvement of employees to be renegotiated in the case of substantial structural changes following the creation of an SCE could be at odds with the aforementioned article, which makes me fear for the solidity and viability of these bodies."
". (PT) Although I acknowledge the merit of the Delegation of the Conciliation Committee and the fine work of Mr Callanan, I still believe that we have not achieved a sufficiently ambitious outcome with regard to noise pollution, to atmospheric pollution and to promoting the quality of water for human consumption."
"I therefore disagree with the derogation granted to steam-powered craft, with applying the 3dB allowance to all engines types and with the limit values set for exhaust emissions in specific inland waters."
". (PT) I am voting against this report because I believe that the European Cooperative Society (SCE) exceeds the scope of legislative harmonisation and constitutes a new supranational legal form."
"I do not agree with the view that the high number of exemptions made for national legislation would not damage the innovative nature of the SCE."
"In fact, at a strictly interpretative level, I consider the view that a legal framework must be impervious to specific local characteristics in order to warrant the term reductive. I would instead suggest that this factor can only enrich the organisation and enable it truly to adapt to specific cases and situations."
"The argument of 'completing the internal market', which is presented as a justification for using Article 95 is not clearly delimited, since it applies to almost all legislation."
"There is a clear political attempt by the rapporteur and the committees delivering an opinion to promote the allocation of more and greater powers to Parliament, and they all allege that this claim is merely based on doctrines accepted in law."
"I am genuinely sorry that this approach has been used as a weapon and as a justification for yet another institutional conflict."
"Prudence dictates that instead of demanding further power, we should make good use of what we have."
"Mr President, I just want to explain why I voted in favour of Amendment No 1 to the Gill report."
"I think at a time when so many of our citizens are facing such uncertainty about pensions and other work-related benefits, it would be quite wrong of Members of this House to vote themselves extra privileges and would send out all the wrong signals."
"I am very pleased that on this side of the House at least the majority of colleagues voted against the proposal to extend health benefits to retired Members."
". All Members of the House benefit from free medical insurance."
"It is a sad example of a failure of solidarity between generations that an alliance principally composed of Socialists and Greens has voted against even an investigation into extending the system to retired Members."
"I voted for the Manders report on environmental liability because the amendments adopted ultimately responded quite well to the objections I had raised during yesterday's debate."
"A very significant majority of Members (312 in favour, 179 against) held the same view."
"The main amendments that convinced me to vote in favour are: 1) Amendments Nos 85 and 99, which call on the Commission, in particular, to draw up proposals for the application of the directive to environmental damage caused by nuclear pollution and maritime transport; 2) Amendments Nos 86 and 103, which do away with the exemption from liability linked to the prior issue of an administrative authorisation or the insufficiency of scientific and technical knowledge; 3) Amendment No 107, which calls on operators to use appropriate forms of financial security to cover their responsibilities."
"Amendment No 54 was also adopted, which is not perfect but I can accept it. It calls for additional legislation regarding liability for damage caused by GMOs, notably damage that could affect non-GMO products."
"Of course, I call for the moratorium on GMO authorisations to remain in place until this legislation has been adopted."
"(FR) The Manders report claims to be based on the polluter pays principle: businesses that cause environmental damage must bear the costs of the damage they have caused."
"As some of the amendments were a step in the right direction, we voted in favour of this report."
"However, one major problem remains: putting it into practice."
"It is not enough for Parliament to adopt these recommendations for them to be enforced, nor is it enough for it to appoint a competent authority for operators to shoulder their responsibilities."
"This is particularly true where the operator is a multinational group that has the resources to evade them and the competent authority usually gives in to its demands, as we saw in France with TotalFinaElf (Erika oil slick, explosion at the AZF factory)."
"The rapporteur's emphases regarding the polluter being responsible up to a certain limit would be funny if the behaviour of these large groups, which are concerned first and foremost with their profit margins, did not have tragic consequences for the population."
"Similarly, it is not enough for financial guarantees to be established."
"The IOPCF, which is supposed to cover oil tanker risk, has just announced that it will only reimburse 15% of the Prestige damage as it has no money."
"To appease the anger of the victims, the French Government did not consider looking to the charter company but will make the taxpayers pay instead."
"In other words, faced with the harsh reality of a profit-oriented society, this report will make absolutely no difference at all."
"(PT) It is our view that policies for protecting the environment and natural resources are crucial to sustainable development. Priority must be attached to policies and measures aimed at prevention, for example, developing forms of research and support for access to the best technology available, paying particular attention to the problems and specific characteristics of small and medium-sized companies."
"There is, however, an increasing need to enforce liability for remedying environmental damage."
"I would highlight the recent example of the Prestige."
"For this reason it is important, in the context of a broader set of measures and actions, to ensure that heavy industry - and this is the main culprit - accepts liability for preserving the environment and natural resources, through correct, fair and effective methods; that we combat impunity and avoid public finances ending up bearing the costs and having to remedy the environmental damage caused by negligence or commercial strategies - almost always private - which seek only to obtain the greatest possible profit."
"This EP resolution improves the Commission proposal (based on the 1983 Green Paper) on environmental liability in terms of preventing and remedying environmental damage, by casting doubt on the positions advocated by heavy industry (see the opinion delivered by UNICE) which typified the proposal presented by the Commission."
". Public authorities, especially local authorities, currently face significant burdens arising from environmental damage, from a wide range of sources, both major and minor."
"This directive gives an opportunity to better identify and assign responsibility and should follow the 'polluter pays' principle."
"I opposed committee Amendment No 37, which is contrary to that principle and which would place unacceptable burdens on local authorities and also be potentially disastrous for local economies."
"Particularly in the UK, governments have been guilty of seeking to leave local authorities to pick up the cost of EU legislation - such as disposal of refrigeration equipment - and blaming 'Brussels'."
"The costs of implementing this directive must not be inflicted unfairly upon hard-pressed local authority budgets, either through approving a faulty directive or as a result of ultimately flawed implementation by government."
"(EL) The directive on a system of environmental liability based on the trite 'polluter pays' principle, which has proven to be efficient for the restoration of environmental damage by those responsible but also detrimental, in that it has weakened actual prevention and is ultimately proving to be the most cynical excuse for new tax burdens on 'polluted citizens' in that the polluters - big industrial business - not only are not paying for the restoration of the huge disasters they cause (Erika, Prestige, Sevezo etc.) but also, in addition, they are being strengthened by incentives and tax relief."
"Environmental damage is being reduced to manifest hypocrisy, in that the 'financial guarantees' on the part of the operator are being shifted to the state and to the workers either by increasing operating costs or by passing them on in product prices."
"With the exemptions and its limited scope, it is being reduced to a 'fig leaf' for monopoly interests, in that it does not include overall protection of biodiversity, oil pollution, nuclear damage, non-ionising radiation, GMOs etc. and provocatively exempts from liability charges those who cause huge ecological damage through unprovoked and barbaric military interventions."
"The limited definitions of damage, liability and other basic concepts, which are shot through with exemptions and peculiar 'presumptions of non liability' make us particularly cautious and critical with respect to this 'environmental liability'."
"."
"(NL) Not only do businesses produce goods and services, they also produce pollution and accidents."
"The costs of repairing the damage to the environment fall on the injured parties or the government."
"The benefits of the economic activity that has led to the damage, on the other hand, fall to the business."
"To combat this injustice the 'polluter pays' principle was developed long ago, but businesses continue to exert pressure to undermine it as far as possible."
"We can see this in the right-wing amendments submitted, which seriously limit liability."
"After 21 years of preparation nothing seems to have come of the original intentions."
"The directive is applicable to just 13% of the EU's territory, the regions indicated in the Birds Directive and Natura 2000."
"Marine pollution and damage due to nuclear energy do not count and even if people were acting on the basis of a licence or the state of the art at the time, there is no liability."
"Oil disasters at sea and contamination of natural crops by genetically modified crops do not lead to liability."
"Advances in environmental protection at national level are made impossible if Article 95 for a uniform market is placed ahead of environmental protection in Article 175."
"Only the left-wing amendments, taken as a whole, can make this proposal in any way acceptable."
". On behalf of the EPLP I would like to indicate our support for the general principle of 'the polluter restores'."
"This is a fundamental shift in the direction of environmental policy in the EU."
"No longer should the public bear the burden of clean-up costs when often the polluter has walked away."
"The EPLP does not, however, support the inclusion of GMOs in this directive as, firstly, we believe it is the wrong directive and, secondly, there is existing legislation on this topic and this could give rise to confusion among potential operators as to which legislation is applicable."
". (PT) This Commission proposal intended to ensure the adoption of an overall Community system for preventing and remedying environmental damage including water pollution, damage done to biodiversity and soil contamination, which constitute a serious risk to human health, is extremely important."
"After several years of debate and many environmental disasters, we have reached a crucial point for effectively preventing and remedying environmental damage, in a genuine 'parting of the waves'."
"I have supported the Commission's approach of largely leaving the specific institutional and procedural measures for achieving the intended results to the discretion of the Member States, in line with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"I consider the Commission proposal's approach too vague, however, on issues such as: the scope of its definition of biodiversity (restricted to the Nature 2000 network), the system of compulsory financial guarantee/insurance (for operators listed in Annex I of the Proposal), adopting a system of exemptions, removing objective liability for introducing 'mitigating factors' and excluding damage resulting from certain activities."
"I therefore expressed my disagreement on certain aspects, but I believe I must contribute to the adoption of this Directive, which moves, overall, in the right direction and constitutes an undeniably important milestone."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Mr President, a Bilderberg meeting will open in Versailles tomorrow."
"The reason I raise this issue is that a number of Commissioners - Monti, Liikanen, Solbes Mira, Verheugen, Vitorino and Bolkestein - have all in the past attended Bilderberg meetings."
"Indeed, Commissioner Prodi was actually a steering committee member in the eighties at the same time as Wim Duisenberg was the treasurer of Bilderberg."
"Another reason I have raised this issue is that I have submitted a priority written question through Parliament but whenever I raise the issue of Bilderberg I am sent from pillar to post."
"I should have had a reply on 25 April but still have not received one."
"The Bilderberg meeting is starting at the weekend."
"When I have tried to put an oral question in this Parliament or in the last one, the Commissioners have basically been afraid to answer."
"What I really want to know is whether the Commissioners attend these meetings in their own private capacity or whether they are representing the Commission."
"If they are representing the Commission, we need to know what happens at these Bilderberg meetings because at the end of the day this is a secret organisation which is deciding global policy without any input from the public."
"It is about time the doors of Bilderberg were opened and the public really knew what goes on, because most of the major players in the world today are all playing a part in Bilderberg."
"The President of this Parliament, Mr Cox, actually attended one of these meetings in Sweden a couple of years ago."
"The people need to know what happens at the Bilderberg meetings, and if I ask a question in good time the Commission should answer that question."
"There is no justification for the Commission not to answer it."
"Mrs McKenna, I have noted your comments, which I shall also pass on to the European Commission so that, as you are referring to Commissioners, you can receive the relevant reply from it."
"The next item is the statement by the Council on the EU-USA extradition agreement and the International Criminal Court."
"The Minister of Justice of Greece, Mr Petsalnikos, has the floor on behalf of the Council."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the information you have provided, but unfortunately I do not think you have responded to the oral question tabled by my group."
"It remains outstanding."
"Clearly the agreement before us is especially relevant for both the European Union and the United States."
"The United States has decided to foster closer cooperation, especially in relation to the fight against organised crime."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as rapporteur I therefore feel we must welcome this type of initiative."
"I am especially pleased that for the first time the European Union is going to sign an agreement on cooperation on judicial and criminal matters."
"This should serve as a model in arriving at similar agreements with other third countries."
"I would however like to provide some additional details on three issues."
"Will this agreement make the fight against organised crime more effective?"
"As I understand it, it will."
"This level of cooperation will clearly help the fight against money laundering, trafficking in human beings, drug trafficking and terrorism."
"Will this agreement reinforce the European Judicial Area?"
"I think it will inasmuch as it will oblige Member States and candidate countries to speed up the ratification of the European texts that form the basis of this agreement."
"These texts include the protocol on money laundering and the decision on the detention and surrender procedure and on joint investigation teams."
"The third question is whether these texts represent added value over and above the bilateral agreements currently in force."
"I have to say that the answer to this question is also affirmative."
"As regards existing agreements, the new agreement will streamline cooperation and provide for increased guarantees to be given in the interests of those accused."
"Nevertheless, I feel I must draw the attention of the Presidency of the Council to the doubts expressed by Parliament, as reflected in the question that led to this statement."
"Firstly, we want to be sure that the same guarantees offered by the European arrest warrant would apply in the case of the United States issuing a request for extradition."
"The second issue concerns the doubts over whether a Member State has the capacity to decide if a person should be sent to the United States or referred to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court."
"Although there is an explanatory note on this in the text of the agreement on the International Criminal Court, as you mentioned, we believe it would have been much clearer if this reference had been inserted into the text of the agreement."
"This would have eliminated the uncertainty on the subject and made it quite clear that a Member State may take that decision."
"The third issue relates to procedure."
"I would like to highlight a positive and also a negative aspect of this subject."
"Firstly, we would like to thank the Greek Presidency for publishing the text of this international agreement before it had even been signed."
"This allowed Parliament to consider its contents."
"An important precedent has been set."
"Nonetheless, this cannot be deemed adequate in terms of democratic control."
"I will move on to outline the negative aspect."
"To date, the European Parliament has never been consulted on any similar international agreements, even when they concerned fundamental aspects of foreign policy and cooperation on judicial matters."
"In our opinion this is unacceptable."
"Furthermore, unfortunately agreements of this type do not have to be ratified either by national parliaments or by this House."
"When neither the European Parliament nor national parliaments are involved, how can we say that the European Union's actions in this regard are in line with the democratic principles on which it is based under Article 6 of the EU Treaty?"
"This is why it is appropriate for the European Parliament to be consulted and not merely informed, as you have said."
"We feel this is a central and highly relevant issue."
"I communicated this to the Presidency of the Council in a letter sent in December last year."
"I could not understand why I did not receive a reply."
"I also made the current President-in-Office of the Council aware of the strength of feeling when the latter appeared before meetings of the committee I chair."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the liberties and fundamental interests of the citizen's of Europe are at stake."
"We are dealing with judicial and criminal cooperation, a subject on which the Treaty provides for a closer level of cooperation than that provided for by the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"I would therefore like you to reconsider your position should no consultation be allowed for."
"I also call upon you to convey Parliament's opinion on this matter to the Council."
"I have communicated this opinion to you in the strongest terms."
"If our message is not brought before the Council, Parliament would have to consider the possibility of taking its case to the Court of Justice."
"Lastly, I would like to thank the Presidency once again for the positive attitude it has shown in relation to such a sensitive dossier, as demonstrated by your presence in the House."
"Mr President, 18 months ago when I had the honour to serve as chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, this House adopted a resolution on judicial cooperation between the Union and the USA."
"That resolution set out four key requirements for any extradition agreement: full respect for the European Convention on Human Rights; no extradition of persons likely to face military tribunals; no extradition if the accused risks facing the death penalty; and that any measures affecting data protection should be proportionate, effective and time-limited."
"The terrorist outrages in Saudi Arabia on Monday night once again remind us that terrorism still poses a deadly serious threat."
"We need a robust and effective response."
"However, the Liberal Democrats in this House insist that anti-terrorism measures must always respect fundamental rights and be subject to proper democratic oversight and control."
"Striking the right balance is essential to success in fighting those who seek to undermine the fabric of democratic societies."
"The current draft agreements between the EU and the US on extradition and legal cooperation must not escape the parliamentary scrutiny provided for in our Treaties."
"They concern 'fundamental choices' within the meaning of Article 21."
"They fall not only under Article 38 but also under Article 24, and it is scandalous that the Council does not consult this House in advance on all the Article 24 agreements."
"In France, the Conseil d'Etat has refused the Assemblée Nationale the right to approve such agreements: so unless the Council consults us, what parliamentary scrutiny exists in the European Union?"
"These agreements on extradition and legal co-operation are very ambitious."
"The United States declines to sign the UN conventions on cybercrime, on crime prevention and on the International Criminal Court."
"In the Union, Member States have not yet ratified our decision on money laundering or the framework directive on terrorism."
"Yet these proposals cover the whole Palermo agenda."
"They should at the very least provide for the establishment of bodies to oversee their operation and provide feedback."
"I can only regret that this agreement makes no reference to the International Criminal Court."
"I would urge the Council to rectify this."
"The Council must seek to reconcile the potential conflict between a request from the ICC to surrender a person to the court and the obligation stemming from this extradition agreement."
"The slide away from democracy can start with the best of intentions."
"The European Union must guard against it."
"Do not let the Council's haste facilitate it."
"I can fully endorse the criticism made by the previous speakers."
"I would just draw attention to the fact that, under Articles 38 and 24 of the Treaty, Parliament has no right whatsoever to be heard."
"It is an extraordinary provision, which means that the Council can enter into these agreements off its own bat."
"In April of last year, the Council wrote to the British human rights organisation, State Watch, which had requested information about these agreements, and said that the negotiations that were under way had to be kept secret, since the Council's interest in secrecy counted for more than its interest in democratic scrutiny."
"It is easy to see why the Council has kept these negotiations secret for more than a year, for, if they lead to an agreement, very important parts of the legal certainty by which most of our legal systems are characterised would be successfully abolished at the stroke of a pen."
"Broadly speaking, the state of our law would be reduced to something reminiscent of what it was in the Middle Ages, both by the extradition agreement, which goes very much farther than what was urged, covering, as it does, very many more types of crime than terrorism - it is enough to have been sentenced to one year's imprisonment under the penal legislation of the country by or from which extradition is requested - and by the second part of the agreement, namely that relating to what is termed mutual legal aid."
"Ask the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay."
"These agreements are being entered into with the United States in the name of legal certainty at the same time as everything is being done to infringe legal certainty."
"Ask the 3 000 prisoners - overwhelmingly foreigners - suspected of terrorism and consigned to American jails without having access to any information."
"Ask the eleven million active FBI informers who, if this agreement is ever implemented, will be given permission to operate within the territories of the EU countries."
"That would, as has been said, be a decisive retrograde step. As I said before, this Parliament has no influence at all, either legally or constitutionally, but the debate may be of use in raising the storm that will be necessary for checking these attempts to undermine legal certainty."
"President-in-Office of the Council, today, for the first time, we are debating an extradition agreement between the European Union and the United States on which no parliament in the European Union, not even the European Parliament, has been consulted."
"I would therefore like to thank you very much for being here with us today, but I am also quite aware of the fact that we have virtually no room for manoeuvre at all, given that, as you yourself have said, everything may well have been decided by 5 June."
"Once again, negotiations on matters which are absolutely crucial for the citizens' freedoms and rights are being carried out, or rather have been carried out, with a complete lack of transparency, and we have only been able to see behind the veil where faits accomplis are concerned."
"The Council persists in refusing any kind of formal consultation of the European Parliament."
"At times like these, when there are many who believe that democracy and rights can be exported by means of unlawful wars, I find this particularly disturbing."
"We consider it to be a clear violation of the Treaty, and we are assessing the feasibility of appealing to the Court on the grounds of violation of the prerogatives of the European Parliament."
"I genuinely hope that the majority of Parliament will be of the opinion that it is possible to lodge an appeal of this kind."
"We have many grounds for scepticism and concern regarding this agreement, including the failure to give priority to the European arrest warrant in the event of simultaneous requests and the ambiguity which persists even on matters on which there is as little disagreement in this House as data protection or the death penalty."
"We wonder, moreover, why it is that we are in such a hurry to conclude this agreement when we know that a number of European citizens are being held prisoner wholly unlawfully at Guantánamo, as has already been mentioned by other Members, and that nothing is known of them."
"If the Union and Parliament want to live up to their reputation as at least verbal champions of rights, we must get moving and send a delegation without delay to ascertain the conditions in which those citizens are being held before we sign an agreement with the United States."
"It will be interesting, and possibly even amusing, to see whether the United States allows us to do that."
"Today, however, we would like to receive answers on the possible - or rather, probable - contradictions between this agreement and the Statute of the International Criminal Court, on which, I regret to say, you did not focus, President-in-Office."
"We would like a clear response to the following questions."
"Is it true that the United States, actively supported by the United Kingdom, is opposed to any reference to the Criminal Court in the agreement?"
"What will happen in the event of conflict between the Rome Statute, in particular the obligation to cooperate with the Criminal Court, and the EU-US extradition agreement?"
"Lastly, given the unambiguous position of the European Parliament, not least, which is opposed to the bilateral agreements guaranteeing the impunity of US citizens, could you please tell us whether any of the present or future Members of the European Union have been asked to sign these agreements?"
"Do you know of the existence of any agreements of this kind?"
"Mr President, in my opinion the Council has made a conscientious attempt to reach a balanced result where these accords are concerned."
"On the one hand it is important that we support our NATO friends where possible in the fight against terrorism."
"It is also in our own interest that together we fight against organised crime."
"If this becomes easier as a result of the extradition and legal cooperation agreement, then that is a major gain."
"At the same time I can see that the legal systems of the United States and the European Union are not the same."
"It is logical therefore that the United States cannot be treated on a par with an EU Member State."
"The United States is a democratic unit in which human rights are guaranteed, but their interpretation is not always the same as that of the EU Member States."
"The issue of the death penalty now appears to have been settled to general satisfaction by the Council's compromise."
"There is still the question of competing extradition requests by way for example of a European arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court."
"I understand that the Council has discussed this and also recognised it as a problem, but can this be adequately resolved by leaving it to the Member States?"
"There is also the question of whether the requirements of the European data protection directive can be adequately met."
"In view of these sensitivities the Council has rightly decided to put these proposals to the national parliaments for ratification."
"Mr Donner, the Dutch Minister of Justice, declared that the proposals remained within the limits of current Dutch treaties with the United States."
"His calm reaction was a relief after the overwrought reaction of various fellow parliamentarians at home and abroad."
"There are some who are making the United States into a bogeyman."
"No wonder they are not leaping at the chance to become involved with the International Criminal Court."
"I understand that the Council has reached a compromise here too."
"Member States can conclude a non-extradition treaty with the United States with representatives dispatched by the government in Washington."
"This provides an opening for further negotiations."
"I am assuming that the Council will be keeping us informed about this."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am not going to repeat the excellent points made concerning the untenable situation as regards what is known as the third pillar."
"In reality, there is the possibility that this situation could affect many areas and send out an undemocratic image of the European Union, especially to the candidate countries."
"At the Parthenon, we celebrated the advent of the democratic Europe, yet, at the first part-session which our observers - the few that are here - are attending, we must in all conscience kick up a fuss, because you are not consulting us on key issues such as the one in question."
"I do not want to go into details on this subject, particularly as I have very little time."
"I wanted to say to you, Mr President, that you have said very little about the Criminal Court."
"I also wanted to say to the House that it is, in any case, important to take account of the extradition provided for by the Rome Statute."
"The handing-over of those who are accused is not extradition in the legal sense of the term."
"The fact that this is not discussed is not, therefore, a problem in itself."
"Naturally, Europe must remember its undertaking to maintain and preserve the integrity of the Statute as well as the contents of the declaration of 30 September 2002."
"This declaration recommends to all candidate countries and all Member States that they should not sign any bilateral agreements that would go against the principle that is the basis for the Court, which I am glad to say has existed since 11 March and will, I hope, be able to start operating very soon."
"Mr President, this agreement is very important, not just because it will be useful in the fight against international crime but also because this is the first time the Union as such has negotiated an international agreement on this matter, which binds the Member States and takes precedence over any bilateral agreements they have concluded."
"The rules and criteria adopted will therefore serve as useful benchmarks for similar agreements with many other third countries, and that is another reason why they must be considered carefully."
"The Union is bound by the provisions of the Treaties and the acts signed by its institutions."
"In matters of respect for fundamental rights, it is bound by Article 6(1) and (2) of the Treaty on European Union and by the Charter on Fundamental Rights, which lay down more stringent guarantees than those provided for in third countries and, in particular, in the United States - I too am thinking of the European citizens still imprisoned at Guantánamo - and it is therefore these provisions of the Treaty, not respect for individual rights in general, which must be referred to in the EU-US agreement."
"The reservation not to cooperate if the accused is liable to face the death penalty is expressed in relation to extradition but not - as it should be - where judicial cooperation is concerned."
"This is a requirement that binds not just the Member States but the Union as such too, which does not have the power to conclude agreements which provide for derogations from this principle."
"I therefore consider Article 9 of the agreement on judicial cooperation to be inadequate."
"Then it is absurd that the Council should conclude agreements with third countries which it has not yet implemented within the Union because the Member States have failed to ratify the agreements or because of failure to implement framework decisions which have already been adopted."
"It is also absurd that, as provided for by Article 10 of the agreement, a request for extradition from a third country might take precedence over a request from a Member State to hand a person over made by virtue of a European arrest warrant."
"We must therefore remedy these shortcomings, and the agreement will then be a model for European Union cooperation with third countries to combat international crime, with due regard for the fundamental rights which the Union acknowledges all human beings to have."
"Mr President, I should like to associate myself with what Mr Watson and other fellow Members here have already said."
"In itself this is an extraordinarily important agreement and it is therefore all the more a crying shame that the consultation of the various people's representations is not properly organised."
"In my own country, for example, the agreements had to be read in a room because the agreement was a secret one."
"We have now had them handed out and I wonder whether this method of discussion is the right one?"
"I share the view of the Chairman of our Committee that we may possibly have to go to the Court of Justice if a different procedure is not followed."
"In any event I have some specific questions. Is it right that the American Government should refuse to accept the International Criminal Court?"
"Can you say explicitly what role the Council is planning to assign to the International Criminal Court?"
"Have the candidate countries been consulted?"
"This proposal does after all affect them too."
"Is not the lower limit of one year, on the basis of which people can be extradited, far too low?"
"In short, Mr President, I doubt very much that this will be handled properly and I should therefore be very glad to see that we can discuss this subject more and better than is currently the case."
"Mr President, a year ago Mr John Bolton, the Deputy US Secretary of State, said that the sole purpose of the International Criminal Court was to constrain American military power."
"Well, if we have to choose between might and right, we obviously have to defend the international legal order."
"The coming weeks will test the EU's support for the ICC, as the US is intensifying its efforts to obtain bilateral immunity agreements from third countries."
"We must support those countries which are coming under pressure."
"We must also monitor the situation and find out who is going to agree and who is going to resist."
"We do not have this information."
"Furthermore, we would still like to know what steps the Council is taking to guarantee that Iraqi prisoners will not be arbitrarily tried by US military courts, but judged by independent international tribunals, preferably under the auspices of the United Nations."
"Mr President, do the various European Member States have sufficient trust in each other's legal systems?"
"That was the essence of the discussion on the European arrest warrant."
"If the Council is to have its way such trust will have to be placed blindly in a third country outside the borders of the European Union, namely the United States."
"In my view this is, for the present, a bridge too far."
"First, a critical and public debate on this matter is required."
"After all, we are dealing here with fundamental human rights, personal freedom of movement and the preservation of personal safety and property."
"It is surely unacceptable simply to try to force citizens and their elected representatives to swallow important amendments to those rights whether they like it or not."
"First as regards the extradition treaty."
"The norm for extradition between the US and the EU Member States is to be that an offence should carry a minimum sentence of 1 year's imprisonment."
"For some Member States that already have a bilateral extradition treaty with the US this is nothing new."
"But conspiracy, participation and an attempt to commit an offence will also require compulsory extradition and that is definitely far-reaching."
"But for Member States without a bilateral extradition treaty and for Member States that operate a so-called positive list there will be a sweeping change."
"My question to the representative of the Council is therefore whether we can be given a list of the various consequences of the implementation of the treaty for individual Member States."
"As is generally known, the rights of suspects are not generally adequately protected in the United States."
"The European Union must guarantee the civil rights of its residents, in this case those of suspects and convicted persons."
"I doubt whether the Union will be able still to do so when this treaty is implemented."
"It should be possible, at the very least, to demand that the treaty refer to the ECHR and that EU Member States should not be permitted to depart from it in implementing this treaty."
"That is why the escape clause on the problem of the death penalty is totally inadequate."
"It is not sufficient that EU countries should be able to refuse extradition, if there is a threat that the death penalty will be imposed, no, they should be bound to refuse."
"Better still, Member States must include a provision in the treaty giving them the option of trying cases themselves if extradition to the US is refused."
"In that case EU citizens would at least be assured of an adequate legal process with guarantees secured within Europe for the trial."
"The treaty on judicial cooperation in the criminal field raises the question of the judicial and political responsibility for the consequences: the detection teams."
"Is Miami Vice about to arrive in Europe?"
"Experience has taught us that the US has far less rigid views than our own on the boundaries of acceptable behaviour."
"Who is to sound the alarm if in the future we are confronted with American agents who introduce a system of logging off?"
"Other Members of this House have already pointed out that data protection is not adequate."
"In conclusion, I should like to warmly support what was said by the chairman of our committee, namely that he finds it unacceptable that the Council should yet again refuse to consult Parliament."
"We simply cannot accept this any longer and to be quite honest, I fail to understand how the Greek Presidency dares to continue the process by repeatedly making fools of this House."
"I find this nothing short of scandalous."
"Mr President, in the fight against international crime and terrorism, there is already cooperation between the Member States of the European Union and the United States as regards information and this has produced significant results."
"It must be developed at judicial level in order to improve efficiency, but also in order to comply with our fundamental principles and the protection of freedoms."
"Indeed, the more effort we put into stepping up international cooperation in the fight against terrorism and other forms of crime, the more care we will have to take not to lose the democratic guarantees and legal principles on which our action is based along the way."
"Like Mr Watson, I would also mention Parliament's resolution of 13 December 2001, and, in particular, the principles it set out concerning the negotiations on judicial cooperation with the United States."
"Firstly, complete respect for the European Convention on Human Rights and minimum procedural guarantees of a fair trial, as confirmed by the European Court of Human Rights."
"Article 6 of the Treaty establishing the European Union must be mentioned explicitly in the agreement and there should also be a reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was proclaimed by the Council, by the Member States, and will, I hope, be given constitutional value."
"Secondly, extradition to the United States must be refused for people who may be tried before military tribunals."
"Thirdly, extradition must not be allowed if the defendant is liable to be sentenced to the death penalty."
"Mr Alavanos is right: it is not simply a matter of stating that it 'may be denied'; it must not be possible if there is a risk of execution."
"Fourthly, we must ensure that the provisions on data protection are proportionate and effective and only last for a limited period of time."
"As regards the connection with the European arrest warrant and the International Criminal Court, I believe that, where there is a choice, the Member States must be free to choose between requests for extradition by the United States and requests to hand people over under the European arrest warrant or from the International Criminal Court, but I would like you to inform us of the positions in the Council."
"Is it true that the United States rejects all references to the ICC and a number of Member States support this position?"
"The United States has asked for a reextradition clause to be included in the agreement that would prevent an EU Member State sending a US citizen to the International Criminal Court or another international tribunal without its express agreement."
"Is this request also supported by Member States?"
"Lastly, does the Council acknowledge that such a reextradition clause would be contrary to its commitments regarding precisely the International Criminal Court and the Rome Statute?"
"Thank you, Minister."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission made a detailed statement to this House about the New Neighbours Initiative back on 11 March, and to be honest not very much has happened since then that I can report to you."
"The Member States have begun dealing with this subject in the Council, and Mr Yiannitsis has just reported on that in some detail."
"We have discussed this subject with the future Member States, and there has been the very laudable initiative of the Greek Presidency, in connection with the signing of the enlargement treaty in Athens, to discuss this subject with those partner states that will be affected by this New Neighbours Initiative in the course of a European Conference."
"I am delighted to tell you that responses to this were thoroughly positive, so we can assume that this initiative can rely on a sufficient level of political support across the board."
"The starting point for our proposals on a new neighbourhood policy is of course enlargement, but now is not the time to discuss the membership prospects of our new neighbours."
"What we need for the coming decade is above all a differentiated strategy for intensive good-neighbourly relations that is not linked with any statement about the question of accession."
"It is our intention to export the stability, security and prosperity that we have created and hope to build upon in the enlarged European Union."
"President Prodi has already described this objective as a 'ring of friends' surrounding us, a ring extending from Russia to Morocco."
"This will allow us to share with our partners much of what makes the European Union what it is, not least the common market and its rules, our Community programmes and political dialogue, but not our internal institutions."
"The Commission has already explained that the countries of the western Balkans and also Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey are not included in this ring, and why that is."
"These countries already have prospects for future membership, and in the case of Romania and Bulgaria this already involves a specific time frame."
"It goes without saying that the intensity and pace at which relations between the EU and individual countries develop will depend on the capabilities and ambitions of the individual partner states."
"But in this case too, as for enlargement, the principle of differentiation will play an important part."
"We therefore want to work out an action plan with each individual country based on experience and our present treaty commitments."
"These action plans will set out our common road map, and will contain objectives, timetables, modalities and monitoring mechanisms binding both sides in the same way."
"It will emerge from this process whether or not we need new treaty instruments."
"However, it is in any case intended that work should proceed under the existing partnership and cooperation agreements, and should not be delayed by the prospect of further agreements in the future."
"Where do we stand at present with this project?"
"Well, for the time being, in conjunction with the candidate countries and the partner states, we are making our contribution to the discussions and conclusions planned in the Council."
"We have held our first exploratory talks with Ukraine and Moldova, so as to pave the way for the necessary cooperation."
"For the EU-Ukraine Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, both sides have jointly produced a detailed analysis of what has been achieved and have jointly determined what further steps are required."
"Internally, within the Commission that is, we are now in the process of working out the basic planks of the action plans."
"Each national plan must relate to a comprehensive and coherent framework covering all areas."
"It must be possible to measure how this has been implemented in practice against predetermined criteria, so that the progress reports envisaged can be drawn up."
"So you will see that we want to make use of an instrument that has already very much proved its worth during the enlargement process."
"We are developing the basis of a new financial instrument and although we have already outlined the general purposes of this instrument, we still need to define it more precisely and to establish the planning principles and the overall financial envelope."
"We intend to bring forward a special communication on this subject in the autumn."
"We should then be in a position to start on the practical work, as soon as we have been given the necessary political green light. As you have heard, the Presidency is working on that and the Presidency's approach has the Commission's full support."
"Parliament's contribution to the further debate will not only be significant but will also carry weight."
"The representatives of the people in our partner states must play their part in contributing to further progress."
"We can take it that the parliaments of the partner states will attach great importance to the views of the European Parliament, and I would also be grateful if the Members of the European Parliament would use their contacts to enter into an intensive dialogue and exchange of experience with parliamentarians in the partner states."
"That is why I am very pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has already appointed a rapporteur and had its first discussion on this."
"I wish Mrs Napoletano every success with her task, and I would like to assure her that she can totally rely on the full support and cooperation of the Commission in her work."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to inform the House that Mrs Louise Fréchette, the first deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, is with us."
"Mrs Fréchette was in the European Parliament today for bilateral meetings with a number of honourable Members and will be meeting President Pat Cox this afternoon."
"We welcome her, we congratulate her on her deep dedication to the performance of her duties and we trust that her stay at the European Parliament will be very, very fruitful."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, apart from the generally accepted historical reasons for the enlargement of the European Union, another factor which has played an important part in our decision in favour of this initiative is that since the fall of the Iron Curtain there have been differences between the West and former Eastern Bloc countries in terms of prosperity, democracy and law and order which cannot be allowed to continue. We therefore have good reasons for working to ensure that prosperity and democracy also have a chance in those countries where that was impossible under Soviet dictatorship."
"With enlargement, we are pushing the boundary of prosperity and democracy further eastwards, so that the question once again arises, this time in the case of our new neighbours, of how we can live alongside them, and the Commission is to be congratulated on the way it has racked its brains to find solutions."
"I support all the activities described by the Commissioner down to the last detail - with one exception, where I am opposed. That is your suggestion, Mr Verheugen, that you can manage all this without making a statement about possible decisions on accession."
"On that particular point I think you are wrong."
"I think it is essential, while we are in the process of enlargement - a process that will keep us busy for a long time in fact - that we should spell out who is to be a neighbour in the future and who is to be a future Member State of the European Union."
"It is now absolutely imperative for us to address the issue of the borders of the European Union - and I do not just mean its geographical borders."
"The Treaty itself obliges us to address this issue, because, as the Commission communication correctly mentions, European states may apply for membership of the European Union."
"However, we need to consider how far the political union that we consider desirable can be extended, what the limits to integration are, what the shape of our future structures will be, and what the nature of the European Union must be."
"That is not something we can or should try to resolve conclusively today, but it is very much under discussion in the Convention."
"We do not need to resolve the conflict about whether the European Union is a federal state or some other kind of animal."
"In such cases we lawyers tend to talk about something being sui generis. However, we do need to make a decision about who in future will be neighbours and who will be Member States, because on the one hand we owe the citizens of the European Union some clarity on this issue, as they want to know how far the European project now extends, but on the other hand we also owe clarity to our neighbours, whose hopes we should not raise if they cannot be fulfilled."
"That is one of the problems that we have with Turkey, which is an important partner and ally."
"The question of how to deal with Turkey has been left unresolved for too long."
"The objective of 'political union' also has its limits."
"The process of enlargement has now essentially reached a stage where there may still be some scope for 'rounding off', but any further accession that would jeopardise the Union's capacity for integration and totally undermine the balance between these 25 states has to be ruled out. Enlargement has reached a stage where to shape a common view by reconciling varying positions and conflicting standpoints would take so much energy that there would be no scope for effective external action."
"That is indeed one of the lessons of the Iraq war, where divergent viewpoints within the European Union condemned us to inaction."
"Who can seriously believe that the accession of countries ranging from the Mediterranean area through Turkey to Russia could possibly make the Union stronger and more effective?"
"That is why we need to resolve the question of the borders of the European Union now, and only then can we try to act as good neighbours."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to start by telling the Commission how timely and appropriate the communication on the Wider Europe and on relations with its new neighbours to the east and south is, not least in that it makes it possible to structure the debate to exclude improvisation or extemporisation, which have the effect of raising easily-raised or vain hopes in a situation which is extremely complex and in a state of constant flux."
"Indeed, there could not be a worse moment to raise false hopes regarding new dimensions of enlargement than that when we have to successfully carry the integration of ten countries through to a conclusion and to assess the effectiveness of the reforms decided on by the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference."
"This, however, does not mean that the Union must become inward-looking."
"Thus, the Commission is right to produce a wider integration strategy involving countries and geographical areas located to the east and south of the enlarged Union at the very time when the accession treaties for the ten new Member States are being signed."
"It is, however, right, as the Commission communication states, to avoid making a misleading parallel between neighbour countries and countries which will never become part of the European Union, and, at the same time, to avoid accession to the European institutions being the only instrument which can be proposed for a closer cooperation policy addressing common problems and interests."
"In other words, we need to ensure that the strategy and enlargement are relatively independent of each other."
"For precisely this reason, in the initial debate which took place in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the need emerged to provide a single framework for a broad strategy which is also practical enough to propose policies for today, not for an unspecified time in the future which we are unable to foresee at this present moment but for which we can and must pave the way."
"In this regard, the initial ideas which have emerged during the debate are along these lines. To complete the geopolitical framework, considering the countries of the Caucasus too."
"To look, including in the context of the Mediterranean, beyond the countries of the current partnership."
"Not to exclude from this strategy, Commissioner, countries which are already about to join the Union, not in order to cause confusion but because these countries too will need to be able to interact with the areas on their borders."
"If borders are considered to be more than just physical borders, it is extremely important that, between now and when they join the Union, the Balkans, for example, are able to interact in a Mediterranean context."
"This does not mean that we are to iron out or fail to preserve the differences between the instruments, from the preaccession agreements to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership: quite the opposite, we must strengthen them through the proposal the Commission puts forward on the cross-border dimension."
"The strength of this strategy lies precisely in the fact that common objectives are established for a geographical area which, because of its history, culture and adjacency to the Union, can be described as a pan-European and Mediterranean region - the arc stretching from Russia to Morocco - as President Prodi maintains."
"What can the countries of such a diverse area have in common?"
"I want to say to the Commission and the Council that we insist on one thing: politics, first and foremost."
"We want to share, first and foremost, values, democracy, the rule of law and freedom and to develop new as well as existing instruments and policies in this framework."
"I therefore believe that Parliament can - and will - contribute to this framework, for we are delighted with the spirit of openness already displayed in the speeches of the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, clearly the accession of ten new countries to the European Union is set to change the relationship we have with our neighbours."
"I would like to highlight a fundamental aspect of the Union's cooperation with our neighbours, that of cross-border cooperation."
"Cross-border cooperation has played a key role in European integration."
"It should also play a key role in our relations with our new neighbours following enlargement."
"It is to be hoped that the new European Constitution will give cross-border cooperation the place it deserves."
"Our new neighbours can be divided into three different groups."
"There are the countries of Eastern Europe and the countries of the Mediterranean basin."
"The Balkan States must be borne in mind too, although further accessions may take place in the future in that area."
"Cross-border cooperation may not be sufficient to facilitate perfect collaboration with neighbouring countries."
"We can and must however take advantage of its benefits."
"It allows us to get to know neighbouring countries, and to understand and trust them."
"If we know, understand and trust each other, we can work together and improve our relationship."
"We will be able to export well-being and stability, to quote the Commissioner."
"These two elements are crucial to the future of both the European Union and of our neighbours."
"I would also like to draw your attention to the particular case of Kaliningrad, in Northern Europe."
"This area will become an island surrounded by Member States of the European Union."
"We therefore need to establish a special system of cooperation with Kaliningrad."
"As Mr Yegorov, the current governor of the area has said on many occasions, there needs to be a system of cross-border cooperation with both Lithuania and Poland."
"In my opinion, relations with neighbouring countries from the Mediterranean to northern Russia pose a significant challenge to the European Union."
"Mr President, the historic enlargement of the Union and, perhaps to an even greater extent, the new situation created by the occupation of Iraq and the imperialist pretensions of the United States, mean that we need to think about the role the European Union wishes to play in the future and, in particular, its role with regard to its future neighbours."
"This is urgent."
"The logic of force is persisting after the war."
"By helping itself to the resources and monopolising all of the levers of power, the Bush administration is continuing to both impose the fait accompli against the interests of the Iraqi people and disregard the UN and thus respect for international law."
"To line up another view of the world against this veritable doctrine, the European Union now needs political courage, initiative and dialogue."
"In my view, forging new relations with our future neighbours could be a first decisive step, particularly as regards the Arab Muslim world."
"The virtually constant condemnation and humiliation it is suffering, combined with the economic and social gap, can only serve to fuel religious fundamentalism and the use of terrorism by increasingly dangerous groups, as a result of which the extreme right here hopes to prosper."
"To combat all of these perils effectively, I feel that priority should be given to objectives and means other than those set out in the Commission communication."
"There is no doubt that, in theory, as regards the idea of new momentum, for example, there is the goal of closer relations."
"However, there will be no common area without common construction."
"We are far from that, listening to Romano Prodi talk about political rapprochement and gradual integration into the European Union's economic and social structures."
"Would the word 'neighbours' then be replaced with the word 'partnership'?"
"Does the composition of the enlarged meeting of 40 European countries, held in Athens on 17 April, which you have discussed, prefigure a type of multi-speed integration, with second-zone countries, the so-called Wider Europe, and others in a third zone, the southern Mediterranean countries?"
"Above all, however, mere alignment with the market approach that governs the current process of European integration does little to meet our needs or achieve any effectiveness in this area."
"A genuine cooperation policy cannot equate to the sacrosanct transposition of the Community acquis, because that is what we are talking about, especially when no equivalent is mentioned as regards aid."
"The initiative of launching specific action programmes may be interesting given the rigidity, for example, of the overall Barcelona process."
"Nevertheless, while the negotiations conducted with the candidate countries have left a bitter taste in the mouth and resulted in a great deal of frustration, as we are quite aware, the Commission has not proposed any review of the matter. What is worse, a bonus is offered for the best reform students."
"As regards the conflicts, and I am ending now, the Commission has spent very little time on this aspect although a common area can only be built on the principle of international law and on a much more active role for the Union."
"Finally, the fact that the entire Commission document focuses almost exclusively on the security aspect of relations?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, one of the principal results of enlargement is the fact that countries which, until yesterday, seemed geographically far away have been integrated into the Union, and, therefore, that the peoples of these countries have been integrated, bringing the number of inhabitants of the new enlarged Union up to 450 million."
"The geographical, political and cultural upheavals experienced by the European continent and the Mediterranean Basin during the twentieth century have certainly not helped in the recent past to bring Europe closer to Russia, the new independent states and the countries of the southern Mediterranean, which are now our neighbours."
"They have suffered very diverse, tragic situations, and that is why it is still important today to find common ground and points of active cooperation between us."
"One of the primary objectives of the new reunified Europe, with its 25 Member States, will have to be the achievement of a preferential relationship with these neighbouring countries of both Eastern Europe, Russia and Asia, such as Kazakhstan, and those which make up the Middle East region and lie on the Mediterranean Basin."
"The political Europe born of the work of the Convention and the new institutional treaty which the IGC will submit to the people of the Union will have a duty not just to strengthen economic alliances, which will facilitate the improvement of communications structures too, in order to encourage mutually beneficial trade between citizens and companies, but also and above all to promote all those political, social, cultural and scientific initiatives which will increase the citizens' involvement in the development of democratic, secular governments with due regard for all the national, cultural and religious traditions which, in any case, uphold man's dignity and safeguard his physical integrity."
"If, however, this dialogue is to proceed with equal intensity where all the Union's neighbouring countries are concerned, we believe that political measures in the immediate term to facilitate peace in the Middle East and restore economic stability to the Mediterranean Basin are a priority."
"Indeed, in our opinion, full recognition of the state of Israel and its citizens' right to a life free of terrorism and full recognition of the Palestinian people's right to an autonomous, independent state which is committed to combating all forms of terrorism and to monitoring whether the funds appropriated by the European Union are genuinely used to help the Palestinian people, to educate young people, to develop production activities and to build houses and infrastructure, are a primary objective."
"Another primary objective is preventing a mass exodus from the poorest countries, which would lead to uncontrolled migration, both impoverishing the countries from which the migrants are emigrating and throwing into disorder the structures of the countries of reception, which cannot deal with mass irregular immigration, particularly when, mixed in with the migrants seeking better conditions, there are numerous members of criminal or terrorist organisations dealing in drugs, arms and, worst of all, human beings."
"There is therefore a clear need for a political and economic Union undertaking to encourage ongoing, harmonious development in these countries, so that people find in their native countries not just the means of subsistence but the means of social and cultural progress too."
"Only in this way can it be ensured that the people emigrating will be doing so on the basis of a reasoned decision and in accordance with the rules, not out of desperation or illegally."
"Mr President, we must, moreover, all remember the need to call upon all the European institutions to mount, by means of appropriate agreements with the governments of neighbouring states, an intense, relentless fight against child abuse, the exploitation, especially sexual exploitation, of women and children, and all practices which violate the physical integrity of the individual."
"Mr President, the proximity policy for the enlarged Europe, which has just been discussed by the Council and the Commission, would appear to be very interesting as it forms part of a new, more flexible approach, the approach of general cooperation that is graduated and differentiated, adapted to the situation of each neighbour country."
"At this stage, however, four questions come to mind."
"Firstly, the content of the neighbourhood agreements has at times been defined by the expression 'everything except the institutions', which may be mistakenly interpreted as meaning 'everything except decision-making power'."
"This ambiguity must be clarified."
"Secondly, once again with regard to the content, there has also been talk of giving priority to extending the single market's four freedoms of movement."
"Is it not very rash to make this commitment in advance?"
"It is all too clear that other objectives are much more pressing, for instance security."
"Thirdly, the new proximity policy seems to have to be limited to non-candidate neighbouring countries."
"Turkey is not included in this list, but it is difficult to know why that is the case as its accession has not yet been officially approved."
"Fourthly, in this proximity policy, the European Union is not starting from scratch."
"It is not starting from square one as the current Members already have relations with their neighbours, particularly those with which they share borders."
"How is the European policy going to work in relation to the existing national policies?"
"Should the Member countries which are the immediate neighbours of these countries not be given a decisive role or a special right of consultation as regards the new European policy?"
"Mr President, it just so happens that there is, today, an article on the future of Europe in the international press."
"It paints a very dramatic picture, mapped out by a French institute, of the dangers threatening Europe."
"Populations are falling, economic growth is stagnating, and the institute takes the view that the situation will be long-term."
"The innovative strength of the European Union lags far behind that of the United States. Doom and gloom."
"The remedy that the French institute prescribes is to open our eyes, see the bigger picture and look further than the Commission does at this moment."
"That was what it boiled down to."
"Whether this is the remedy, I do not know."
"In any case we must always keep the United States at the back of our minds, since that country is an important neighbour of ours."
"As far as the course of events in Europe and in our neighbour states on this continent are concerned, however, I am bound to say that I had a sense of déjà vu when I read the Commission's statement."
"The Commission is familiar with the whole field of expansion, and with the attendant process."
"Reading the document one has the strong feeling that we are embarking on a new round of expansions."
"It is made very clear that this is not the case."
"The only prospect being offered to the surrounding countries is participation in the internal market, not participation in the Union and its decision-making process."
"But we find that matters relating to environmental policy, public order, security, fighting crime, quality of government administration, the rule of law, are all open to consideration for a joint approach - in short, virtually the whole spectrum of topics also discussed on the admission of the candidate countries."
"The development of neighbouring countries, the statement continues, in all these sectors can then be discussed annually in progress reports."
"It looks remarkably like the expansion process."
"In addition there is talk of benchmarks - there are a number of internationally recognised benchmarks, by which the neighbouring countries will be measured, and these are consequently mentioned in concrete terms."
"I just wonder whether we are dealing here with a 'Department of Public Works' effect."
"The Department of Public Works is a very efficient agency in the Netherlands that is continually creating polders and dikes."
"Once they have completed the construction of a new polder, they suddenly find that a dike is much too low and they immediately have to set to work on it."
"This may be something of a tongue-in-cheek comment, but I could well imagine that that effect might play a part."
"Those involved in hands-on work see further ahead than the rest of us."
"The theme of a Wider Europe therefore, if I have understood correctly, in fact concerns the affiliation of neighbouring countries to the European Union but without their participation in its decision-making."
"This will in fact turn them into virtual satellites, also removing them, for instance, from existing cooperative agreements in which they are involved;"
"Russia from the GOS, and perhaps also the North African countries from their own federation of Arab states."
"It also presupposes that our current Member States fully meet the benchmarks and criteria mentioned in the statement."
"Naturally I warmly welcome the latter news."
"That every new candidate must be carefully judged by the same standard, is a conviction we all share."
"How are we to deal in that respect, however, with countries to which we definitely cannot or do not wish to offer the prospect of membership?"
"Will they accept such assessment and such an annual investigation?"
"It seems to me that a Wider Europe might be a space for countries whose traditions make it impossible to opt for the European democratic model."
"I can imagine that there are such countries."
"It is actually difficult to deny admission to countries that do opt for the model."
"What moral basis is there for telling such countries, when they ask for a date, that they can not join?"
"My feeling is that such issues will have to be discussed in great detail in the future."
"Mr President, we live in a world where the better our neighbours and our other fellow human beings thrive, the better we also thrive."
"That is why it is important to cultivate a policy that strengthens democracy and prosperity in the Union's neighbouring regions."
"When Finland joined the European Union the Union suddenly had Russia as its neighbour, sharing a border with that country which is almost 1 300 kilometres long."
"That border still represents one of the world's widest gulfs between standards of living."
"Despite development, Russia still has much hard work to do in the creation of democratic social structures."
"The strengthening of democracy and civil society also remains a fundamental aim of cooperation between the EU and Russia."
"Enlargement means that, in addition to the border between Finland and Russia, the Union will be getting 10 new Interreg-TACIS borders."
"It will no longer be possible to maintain the current system of cooperation, but the experience we have had up till now of cooperation should be put to careful use."
"The new Member States will bring with them Belarus, Ukraine and Moldava as neighbours."
"Each of them has significant political and economic problems."
"If they get worse they could increase instability in Europe."
"The situation is worst in Belarus, where the political situation has hindered EU cooperation with the country."
"Hopefully preparations for the elections in 2004 will clear the way for what would at least be the first openings for cooperation."
"The Commission communication quite rightly stresses the importance of cross-border and regional cooperation with our new neighbours."
"A new financial instrument must be developed for cooperation."
"It should, in my opinion, be based on the Interreg principles and be flexible enough to meet the needs of each border region."
"The key principles are that it should be multiannual, that there should be power of decision in the regions, and that it should be organised as efficiently as possible with regard to its administration and making payments."
"It is also important that expertise and cultural know-how in the new Member States of the EU should be swiftly harnessed in the planning and implementation of policy towards our neighbours."
"Mr President, I would like to draw attention to a region at the very edge of the continent, the Caucasus, which the Minister has already mentioned and which the rapporteur, Mrs Napoletano, has touched on."
"It is a matter of interest to Europe, for the Caucasus has been part of Europe during many periods of history."
"Armenia and Georgia are two of the oldest Christian countries."
"In the Middle Ages, Armenia was considered to be a major European power."
"At the end of the nineteenth century, nobody would have denied that Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, was a powerful centre among the pioneers of the oil industry, even in European terms."
"Today, moreover, Azerbaijan is the principal supplier of crude oil to the European Union."
"After the First World War and before the collapse of the Soviet Union, the national governments of the three countries, despite their diversity, turned to European values."
"The Conference of Versailles gave a number of European powers the task of assisting the birth of the new democracies."
"The three Republics participated in the 1972-1975 Pan-European Helsinki Conference as part of the Soviet delegation, and all three are part of the Council of Europe."
"They are therefore not foreign to Europe."
"The EU-Southern Caucasus Parliamentary Cooperation Committee has visited these countries on a number of occasions, and the solution for finding a way out of the crisis put forward by the three governments lay, each time, in establishing closer relations with Europe as quickly as possible."
"It is hoped that even the potentially extremely dangerous crises such as the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh can be resolved in a European context."
"The United States and Russia are involved in the region for economic reasons."
"The national governments, with different emphases, of course, therefore have to carry out balancing operations."
"Nevertheless, they would prefer another protagonist such as the European Union to be more involved."
"Our Cooperation Committee - for which I have appointed myself spokesman - was impressed by the intrinsic feeling displayed by the three countries - Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan - of historically being part of Europe."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that we are holding this debate in the European Parliament today, because the issue of Europe's external borders is one that we really have to tackle."
"The question we have to address politically speaking, and which we are currently examining in the Convention, is how far European integration can go."
"What is the bond that links us together politically and encourages us to take joint political action?"
"Geography is another issue that we need to discuss."
"What are the geographical limits to a Europe that is willing to cooperate within this political union?"
"And that leads on to this question: how are we to work with our neighbours beyond this closely cooperating Europe?"
"I would accordingly like to thank the Commission and the Council for having addressed in their paper and in today's debate something that Europe urgently needs: a wide-ranging public debate on this very issue, the geographical expansion of Europe, not of the continent of Europe, but of close political cooperation within the European Union."
"We will also have to stop thinking in black and white terms, as if relations can only take two forms - non-membership or full membership."
"It would be the worst possible mistake if that were the signal we were sending out."
"Europe has at its disposal a broad panoply of individual forms of cooperation."
"I myself come from a constituency that will continue to border on a non-Member State, namely Switzerland. In this case we have found a variety of solutions, including legal solutions based on agreements and cooperation arrangements through integration and specific European programmes."
"This is a perfect example of how the interests of a particular country - Switzerland - and of the EU can be reconciled without simply saying, 'you either remain on the outside or you become a full member'."
"So we should focus once again on achieving this broad panoply of means of cooperating with our neighbours without constantly having discussions about ever more countries joining the European Union."
"We also need to ask ourselves what the limits are to Europe's capacity for integration."
"If we are to discuss the question of political boundaries, of political responsibility, then we also need to consider who can tread this path alongside us."
"A European Union that ultimately degenerates into an enormous free trade area is not the model I am committed to, and I think that my fellow Members feel the same way."
"I also expect these debates to be held in public and not in the Council, essentially at the meetings of Heads of State and Government, which discussed Turkey's accession in less than three minutes."
"That is no way to deal with issues of this kind."
"We need to listen to people here, and that must be the signal that goes out from Strasbourg today."
"We must take the public with us, and if they are ready to go down this road with us, we should work together politically to make it happen."
"Mr President, in one year, the European Union of the 25, and later of the 27, will have new neighbours, but it will also keep old neighbours."
"A debate on the new environment is both useful and necessary."
"From this point of view, the position of Commission President Prodi, that the European Union must look on all new neighbours as friends and associates is absolutely correct."
"This position must become the position of all of us, peoples and governments alike of both the 25 and the 27, and that is because, in certain cases, sometimes overt and sometimes concealed, opposition is being expressed on the basis of historical atavism or by reviving past antagonisms and/or enmities."
"In all events, we do not need divisions, we do not need new iron curtains, we do not need new cold war fronts."
"We must look on many of our new neighbours as potential candidates for integration into the European Union or, in any event, as associates and friends."
"Any perspective must, however, express the free democratic will of each nation."
"On the borders of Europe, following enlargement, interesting tasks are under way, tasks that are often of wider geopolitical and strategic interest, including for countries which are not located in this area, which means that they intervene in developments."
"From the Ukraine, Belarus, Moldavia, Russia, the western Balkans, the Caucasus, the Middle East, the other side of the Mediterranean, peoples expect a great deal of the European Union, of us."
"We must respond positively to these expectations."
"Now as regards the boundaries of Europe, I should like to add to what Mr Volcic said about the Caucasus, that right back in antiquity, in the ancient Greek tragedy of Prometheus Bound, it says that this is where the gods tied up Prometheus in order to punish him for giving man fire, that is to say the first elements of modern civilisation."
"Mr President, in my view, the main aim of the initiative for new neighbours in the Wider Europe is not to put those neighbours who are waiting for their turn to join the Union to come one day on hold, Commissioner Verheugen."
"They are already aware of our requirements, which will continue to be based on the Copenhagen criteria, although they will no doubt be better clarified by the constitution proposals we are awaiting from the Convention."
"I highlighted the importance of this during this morning's debate, but I would like to relay to you the moving account of one of these countries, which, in its own words, is currently waiting in the kindergarten of the Council of Europe until it is one day allowed into the older children's playground of the European Parliament."
"This was in Mostar, where, as you know, the rivalry and fear between Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosnians are still far too intense, in spite of the efforts of the European Community."
"In Mostar, the Croatian mayor of the town told me that the only thing that Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosnians have in common is the sentiment and the belief that they must be Europeans together."
"So that is the situation of those who are waiting."
"However, although I am paying all due attention to the reflections of our rapporteur, Mrs Napoletano, I am not the only person to ask if we can use this report to send a very strong signal to all those who have neither the desire nor the intention to seek their accession, and I am thinking in particular of our neighbours in the southern Mediterranean."
"There are many in that region who fear that the efforts made with regard to Central and Eastern Europe may result in a slackening of the links with their own countries that are already too little institutionalised."
"In the emotion following the 11 September attacks, we decided quite unanimously, for example, to give fresh impetus to the Barcelona process and, to this end, decided to create a Euro-Mediterranean Forum, which, I am sad to say, is not functioning today due to the war in Iraq."
"Is it not time, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to reinvigorate this initiative without delay?"
"Mr President, during the last plenary sitting, we voted in favour of one of the greatest ventures ever undertaken by the European Union - the accession of ten new Member States."
"The challenges are not over yet, however."
"Our horizons are widening, our borders are expanding and the arrival of new Member States will spur the Union on further to consolidate relations with its new neighbours, such that - as I see it - in the coming years, the Union's ability to provide its citizens with security, stability and sustainable development will depend on its desire and ability to step up and develop cooperation and dialogue with the new neighbouring countries."
"In this regard, the Wider Europe initiative draws our attention to the European Union's new proximity policy, seeking to define a strategic framework for relations with the new neighbouring countries during the coming decade."
"Poland is one of the countries which have now reached the eve of their de facto accession to the European Union, and I am the rapporteur for Poland."
"As such, I particularly welcome the important role that this major border country will be able to play in developing neighbourly relations with countries such as Ukraine, Belarus and, above all, Russia, as President Kwasniewski said only today."
"Lastly, I had to mention the southern Mediterranean, which is of particular interest to a country such as Italy, almost all of whose territory borders on the Mediterranean Sea and which is thus a natural bridge linking the European Union and the countries of the southern Mediterranean."
"In conclusion, I hope that the Council and the Commission, together with the European Parliament, especially given the impending start of the Italian Presidency, will create better geopolitical conditions for carrying through the project for a renewed Europe, a Europe which is not just politically wider but which has grown in economic and social terms too, so that countries which are different but which have common interests make up a healthy whole, despite the differences in their history and individual experiences."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commission communication."
"I confess that I was initially somewhat surprised that this paper bracketed together countries like Libya and Belarus in a single communication."
"These two countries, like the other countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean or in eastern and south-eastern Europe, have precious little in common apart from their relative geographical proximity to the European Union."
"That is why I am pleased that each country is to be dealt with individually."
"The Presidency has made an announcement to that effect and the Commissioner talked about action plans."
"As something has therefore been said about practically all our neighbours, for the sake of completeness a sentence could have been added about Norway and Switzerland, as an example, at least in the case of Norway, of just what can be done without signing up to actual membership."
"I find wording such as the heading 'Different countries, common interests' somewhat unfocussed."
"Their agendas really are too different."
"It has been said that there are countries that have membership prospects and others that do not."
"If we want to, we can demand a lot more from neighbours who also belong to the Council of Europe: for example, in return for granting trade preferences, we can make demands in the area of human rights."
"However, we should not make offers that we cannot honour."
"We cannot offer all neighbouring states the four freedoms as the Commission does in Section 3 of its communication, and I quote: 'the prospect of a stake in the EU's Internal Market and further integration and liberalisation to promote the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital'."
"Fortunately, the Commissioner did not repeat that quotation from the communication as such."
"However, the communication almost gives the impression that we are offering an 'à la carte' Europe."
"I have to say that I cannot identify any political consensus for granting North Africa and Russia, for example, freedom of movement in any foreseeable political future."
"I therefore call on the Commission to draw up pragmatic and realistic action plans that neither raise false hopes nor over-commit the EU."
"Mr President, it is important to establish the EU's relations with its new neighbours, following the enlargement through a zone of prosperity and a ring of friends with whom the EU enjoys close, peaceful and cooperative economic relations."
"In return for concrete progress, Russia and countries of the Western NIS and the Southern Mediterranean should be offered the prospect of a stake in the EU's internal market and participation in the so-called four freedoms - in effect, everything bar participation in the Institutions."
"Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union allows any European state the opportunity of joining the Union, which is why accession has already been ruled out for the non-European Mediterranean partners."
"Russia and Belarus do not wish to join the European Union, being content with the PCA Agreement, and the Maghreb is planning to be part of an African Union."
"However, better engagement and cooperation with Belarus in areas of common interest is essential to encourage reform in that country."
"In spite of Article 49, there is still a serious danger that Moldova and Ukraine will see the process as insufficiently differentiated and as a way of distancing the EU from their just membership aspirations."
"In addition, the suggestion that there should be additional freedom of movement of persons for all neighbouring countries would undermine the existing attempts to limit large-scale immigration into the EU."
"The movement of skilled and educated people to nearby countries would also create a serious brain-drain that would damage the economies of countries such as Moldova and Ukraine."
"However, the EU is looking at ways of facilitating the crossing of external borders for bona fide third country nationals; after all, good fences make for good neighbours in my opinion."
"Lastly, I propose that Phare and other successful pre-accession financial instruments, which have benefited acceding countries so much, be extended, along with the remit of the EIB to the Western NIS countries, which would replace the current limited Tacis Programme and approach, which carries no private sector economic investments."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that the initiative presented by the European Commission on 11 March last is the best response the European Union could give to some of the fears inspired by enlargement."
"This proposal is based on an overall view of the place of the new Europe in its surroundings, but from an individual viewpoint for each country, without affecting the European aspirations of these countries."
"That should be clear."
"This area of new neighbours should be built on compliance with shared values, which we must continue to establish."
"That way, the EU strategy with regard to the southern border, in terms of democratisation and human development, cannot be limited to the democratic clause."
"The United States are currently implementing a global strategy on this subject with increased budgetary resources and the European Union cannot lose sight of the overwhelming need to foster democratisation along its closest cultural and strategic border."
"This should take place gradually and realistically, but with strict requirements."
"The European Union should provide what our Mediterranean partners are always asking for: an area of shared prosperity."
"This, however, should also be an area of shared responsibility, above all with regard to the subject of immigration, which is of particular concern to this House."
"In order to accomplish this, the Commission's proposals on the free movement of persons should be studied carefully and debated in depth, and Parliament must be heard."
"The global and regional strategy represented by this initiative for new neighbours must act as a spur for regional integration and strengthen cross-border cooperation between the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries, which is currently almost non-existent."
"It must also break down, once and for all, the walls that make many borders between Mediterranean countries impenetrable."
"The initiative we are discussing today must be credible and offer tangible results."
"This will require sufficient budgetary resources and certain proposals will need to be reviewed, such as the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank."
"Lastly, we must also explore the possibility of a 'conference of neighbours' involving the Heads of State and Government of these countries to address matters of common interest, including the Middle East, in the presence of the two parties and two members of the Quartet."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to make three brief comments, and to reiterate that no complete plan is as yet in existence; the situation is rather that a plan is now being developed in conjunction with the Member States and the partner states based on the reflections the Commission has presented to you."
"This plan will be differentiated and tailored to the needs of each country, so there is no danger, for example, that Libya will be offered freedom of movement."
"Instead, the instruments available will be examined to see to which countries they are best suited, and how we can take advantage of existing potential for cooperation. Our intention is that at some point next year there will then be an overarching strategy for the future."
"Secondly, this plan includes those countries that do not have any prospect of membership."
"I think I made that clear, so I cannot understand why several Members of this House have suggested that preparations are being made for a covert further round of enlargement."
"It is precisely because these countries have no prospect of membership that they are included in this programme."
"All the other countries we have been discussing here do have membership prospects, that is to say, the Balkan states, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey."
"The countries in the European Economic Area and Switzerland in any case have a special treaty relationship with the European Union, which has already been pushed to its limits."
"The only further step possible for these countries is full membership; there are no other options open to them."
"It is, though, for these countries themselves to decide if that is what they want."
"That brings me to the last point that I would like to clarify. It is a shame that Mr Ferber is no longer here to listen to what I have to say, although I asked him to stay to hear me out."
"I really must defend the EU Heads of State and Government against the accusation that they dealt with Turkey's application in just three minutes."
"That was not the case in either Helsinki or Copenhagen."
"In both cases hours of detailed discussion were devoted to this subject."
"Perhaps Mr Ferber was referring to the fact that it only took three minutes in Copenhagen to decide which Cyprus protocol should be adopted, Protocol A or Protocol B, which confirmed that the two sides could not agree on a political solution in Copenhagen either."
"But I would like to spell out that the subject of Turkey is always discussed with the greatest care in the Council and that a very great deal of time has been devoted to it."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"In any case, your response to Mr Ferber is a response to the whole House. It will appear in the Minutes."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on preparation for the EU-Russia summit."
"Mr Yiannitsis, President-in-Office of the Council, has the floor."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the opportunity given to me today to refer to the relations between the European Union and Russia is exceptionally timely, given that the summit in St Petersburg, which will be held at the end of May, has given occasion both here and in Moscow for an integrated examination of the framework for cooperation between the two sides."
"Preparations for this summit were also an occasion for a more global approach to the question of cooperation with Russia and essentially demonstrate the common wish to strengthen our relations on the basis of common objectives, on the basis of a mutual effort to resolve problems and create new prospects."
"The basic parameter of our plan is the realisation that Russia is a strategic partner for the Union, its biggest and most important neighbour."
"At the same time, enlargement will increase the points of contact, the common interests and the common challenges even more."
"Despite the difficulties which it is encountering in its efforts to change to a market economy, Russia is still a country with huge potential."
"The current international climate has also reminded us once again of the importance of our strategic relations with Russia."
"Of course, this image does not make us also forget its major weaknesses."
"As I just said, the Russian economy is still in a transitional stage."
"Its economy accounts for just one tenth of the volume of this economy, that is, of the Union of the 15; it absorbs just 4% of our exports, while the European Union absorbs 40% of its exports."
"Similarly the institutions of the market economy remain weak and the financial sector in particular is facing problems and its regulatory framework needs to be developed."
"Finally, Russia has still not joined the World Trade Organisation."
"Its political system presents a similar picture."
"Despite significant progress in the field of stabilising democracy, there are still shortcomings in relation to human rights, especially in Chechnya, which I shall come back to, as well as problems of organised crime and corruption."
"It is without doubt in the Union's interest to help Russia develop a stable, democratic, prosperous society by strengthening its ties to Europe."
"This is something we have achieved in other cases, using different types of tools, of course, than those which have to do with Russia."
"And although the means we use are different, essentially the objectives, in other words the dissemination of the Union's values to its surroundings, to its environment, both geographical and political, always constitute the basis of our policy."
"With this thought in mind, we took initiatives, as soon as we assumed the Presidency, for an initial evaluation of the adequacy of our framework for cooperation with Russia."
"As we know, relations with Russia are based, from the contractual point of view, on a partnership and cooperation agreement."
"This was signed in 1994 under the previous Greek Presidency."
"May I remind you that this is the type of agreement which the European Union has kept for all the countries of the former Soviet Union, with the exception of the Baltic States, which we recently welcomed as members of the ?U. Consequently, apart from a few differences, the same type of agreement ties us to Russia as ties us to the countries of central Asia."
"This lack of proportion quickly became apparent, given that the partnership and cooperation agreement was unable to cover sufficient sectors, such as close cooperation on judicial matters and internal affairs, on foreign policy and defence matters, on the questions of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, combating terrorism and other matters. That was one of the main reasons why we adopted a common strategy with Russia in 1999."
"This cooperation was implemented in a series of ad hoc initiatives."
"I can mention by way of example the energy dialogue, the initiative to create a common European Economic Area, the action plan for cooperation on questions of justice and internal affairs, which do not, however, have a contractual legal basis."
"Appraisals of the adequacy of the EU-Russia cooperation framework, as regards covering a broad range of relations, vary."
"Everyone acknowledges that the framework has, to a great extent, been overtaken by events and that this will become even more apparent in the future."
"On the other hand, neither the ?U nor Russia appear to be ready to proceed with a radical reform of the framework, a reform that would also presuppose time-consuming procedures for new negotiation and ratification."
"In the face of this situation, the Presidency proposed that the work of the summit should focus exclusively on the future of our relations with Russia, approaching the matter at two levels, naturally with the St Petersburg summit, as the datum plane for taking decisions."
"The first level is to reform the cooperation structures with the objective of rationalisation and of securing tangible results on a regular basis and the second level is to examine the possibility of the summit's giving the political order to start up the procedure for processing ideas and strengthening the cooperation framework in the sectors in which this is needed."
"At the first level for reforming cooperation structures, the procedure has already borne fruit with specific proposals to the Russian side."
"We hope that Russia will respond positively and that this will be reflected in the summit's decisions."
"As far as the second level is concerned, there are some reservations between the partners about the extent to which it is advisable for us to start up the procedure for reforming our relations with Russia, at a time when the existing framework has not yet been fully applied."
"We believe that, in order for us to engage Russia in a procedure of gradual harmonisation with European standards, a balanced policy of incentives and preconditions is needed, which can also include in the incentives the prospect of the long-term upgrading of the cooperation framework in sectors in which we all know this is needed and in which everything shows that this will happen sooner or later, especially on second and third pillar issues."
"We also believe that the St Petersburg summit, the first following enlargement and with the participation of all the new Member States, is the appropriate forum for taking this step."
"Beyond the medium- and long-term prospects of our relations with Russia, we have also focused on achieving tangible results on a series of outstanding issues."
"A major issue that has dragged on in relations between the two sides, the signature of the Multilateral Nuclear Environment and Programme for Russia, has already been set for the 21 May in Stockholm."
"Secondly, the problems with the application of the solution for the movement of people between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia have been overcome."
"Thirdly, negotiations have started on the conclusion of an EU-Russia readmission agreement and we hope they will be completed quickly."
"Fourthly, we are optimistic that the mechanism for resolving differences within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement will have been set up by the time the summit takes place."
"Our efforts to persuade Russia to invite the ten new members of the Union to St Petersburg are also having positive results."
"Thus the summit is acquiring even greater symbolic importance and may contribute to a peaceful and secure Europe which confronts challenges with closer cooperation."
"We also decided in our deliberations with Russia to link progress on matters of greater interest to Russia with corresponding progress on matters of greater interest to us, the ?U, so that we arrive at specific results."
"Thus, we have focused our efforts on the environment, by which I mean Russia has to agree to ratify the Kyoto protocol, on nuclear safety, on issues of safety at sea and on issues of justice and home affairs, with the emphasis on progress with negotiations on the readmission agreement."
"Finally, I would point out the common interest in combating the threat of narcotics from Afghanistan and central Asia."
"I should like to say a few words about Chechnya, to which we attach particular importance."
"First of all, I should like once again to express our disgust about the recent criminal terrorist bombings which cost the lives of dozens of people."
"There has been another such attack today."
"On the other hand, I want to welcome the statements by President Putin following the attack, in which he promised to continue efforts to resolve the problem by political means."
"We believe that political procedure and dialogue are the only way to achieve a lasting solution to the problem."
"We continue to take every opportunity to underline the need for respect for human rights and the need to punish those involved in violations of human rights and in violations of international humanitarian law."
"At the same time, we need to encourage Moscow to move towards the application of an integrated policy on Chechnya, the aim of which will be the establishment of peace, the consolidation of a climate of trust and the economic and social reconstruction of the area."
"In order to achieve this, we must examine the possibility of drawing up specific programmes that will aim to promote democracy, the rule of law, institutions and social recovery."
"As far as the results of the March referendum are concerned, we note with satisfaction that, despite the particularly difficult situation, the ballot was held without any violent episodes being reported."
"We must point out that, despite any irregularities and organisational weaknesses there may have been, the vote in favour of the constitution would appear at first glance to be positive and may be seen as a first step by Moscow towards a political settlement in Chechnya."
"Finally, the presidency considers that the OSCE can provide valuable help to efforts by the Russian authorities in the area."
"We heartily support the efforts by Holland which, in its capacity as chairmanship-in-office of the OSCE, is holding discussions with the Russian Government in connection with the modus operandi of a new OSCE mission in Chechnya."
"We welcome the results of the discussions so far, which appear to be paving the way for the presence of Holland there and we hope that the Organization will thus be able to start operating and make a positive contribution to efforts for peace and democracy in the area."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit in St Petersburg provides a welcome opportunity to briefly take stock of our relations and to analyse the problems that we have to solve together."
"Both sides are in full agreement that we have wide-ranging relations on a long-term basis, and that these relations need to be based on common values and should be further developed in the direction of a strategic partnership."
"For our part, we attach particular importance to cooperation in what we regard as areas of risk that we can only overcome together, such as environmental protection, nuclear safety and justice and home affairs issues."
"Our relations with Russia will also, but not to the exclusion of all else, be shaped by the enlargement of the European Union, as the debate that we have just had shows."
"The neighbourhood policy that we discussed here this afternoon plays an important role in our relations with Russia, but there are also other significant factors, such as the security of the European Union's energy supply, the joint war on terror, and the need for cooperation to solve major regional and global problems."
"On Russia's side, there is particular interest in cooperation on security policy, as evidenced by Russian participation in the police mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina or the proposal for a joint European centre for crisis management."
"We have recently made very good progress in some areas, particularly on Kaliningrad. I am pleased to say that the transit issues that the European Parliament dealt with in considerable detail have now been resolved."
"The instruments that we proposed in conjunction with Russia at the time have now been introduced and can be implemented as from July."
"A special Tacis programme for Kaliningrad has also been agreed so as to help ensure that instead of the socio-economic gap between Kaliningrad and neighbouring countries widening - which has already been mentioned this afternoon - it will be narrowed."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council has already said, good progress has been made in negotiations on a readmission agreement."
"I would also like to mention that the energy dialogue with Russia has led to concrete results."
"Examples of this are agreement on projects of common interest and the energy technology centre in Moscow."
"We hope that we will be able to present a joint plan for the common economic area by the end of this year."
"Good progress is being made in the negotiations on Russia's membership of the WTO."
"Next week we will be signing the multilateral nuclear environmental programme with Russia and other donor countries in Stockholm."
"This certainly represents a breakthrough in dealing with contaminated nuclear sites in north-west Russia."
"We are hoping for a ban on single-hull vessels transporting heavy fuel oils in the Baltic Sea."
"Unfortunately, ratification of the Kyoto Protocol has not yet been achieved in Russia."
"This subject will therefore have to be given high priority in the forthcoming talks at political level."
"We should not ignore the fact that there are many areas where, although we agree on the fundamental objectives, we nevertheless have different ideas about how to achieve those objectives."
"Neither side wants to see new 'moats' or 'curtains' in Europe."
"In particular, the Commission hopes that the neighbourhood policy proposals it brought forward in March will prevent new 'moats' developing on the European Union's eastern borders, which could lead to a two-class Europe."
"The enlarged Union will have to further intensify and deepen cooperation with its neighbours, but our security needs dictate that the new Member States should also fully and effectively implement the Schengen rules when they join Schengen."
"There are considerable reservations within the European Union about the Russians' desire for a detailed timetable for complete visa freedom."
"It is of course conceivable as a long-term objective, and it is something the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement committees could deal with."
"Nevertheless, we should as of now be taking advantage of the full scope of the Schengen framework to make minor border traffic as simple as possible and to promote cross-border economic development."
"This will of course also require the refinement of technical assistance instruments."
"I am grateful that the President-in-Office commented on Chechnya."
"I simply wish to confirm that on behalf of the Commission."
"Chechnya is also still very much on our agenda and our list of priorities remains the same: a peaceful political solution, respect for human rights and humanitarian aid."
"We concur with the Russians that our cooperation structures should be shaped more efficiently."
"Nevertheless, we cannot agree to their wish for extensive use of the 15+1 formula, or in future a 25+1 formula."
"This brings us very close indeed to the central issue of the EU's identity."
"We do, however, believe that there is considerable scope for improving the way the institutions work under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, especially as regards the Cooperation Council."
"Lastly, we would like to emphasise that we may have different views about the process of adapting to EU enlargement."
"Russia is currently working on the assumption that extending the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to the new EU Member States provides an opportunity to renegotiate trade policy and other issues."
"We do not see it that way."
"In contrast, we hope that the basically positive view of EU enlargement in Russia will help to maintain the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement as the basis of our relations, including the new Member States."
"The Commission will not enter into any negotiations about the consequences of enlargement."
"This wide range of subjects and the need to give all the Heads of State present in St Petersburg an opportunity to put forward their viewpoints makes thorough preparation of the St Petersburg Summit all the more necessary."
"The EU is being represented here, in the time-honoured fashion, by the Presidency, the Commission and the Council Secretariat, and Mr Yiannitsis has already reported in detail on the objectives the Council is pursuing in this context, and there is total agreement on all this."
"Mr President, four minutes is a generous allowance, especially after both the President of the Council and the Commissioner have answered quite a number of questions raised in the resolution, and I should like to express my thanks."
"Russia of course remains an exceptionally important topic for us, not so much because our border has become so much longer, since the accession of Finland, which brought the larger part of that border with it."
"In fact, the border has been extended only around Kaliningrad and the Baltic states."
"I should like therefore to begin with the latter."
"The last time this was discussed I asked whether the Council, following on from the treatment of the Kaliningrad question on transit visas for Russian citizens, could urge Russia to ensure that the border agreements between Russia and the three Baltic states are all ratified."
"This question is still hanging over the market somewhat."
"In the previous debate the Commissioner gave an unambiguous indication of complete agreement, since Russians going to St Petersburg will travel not via Lithuania and Belarus but via Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia."
"That is why it is vitally important that this gives us a means of exerting pressure on the Russians to get rid of this silly little discrepancy."
"I hope that the President of the Council will give that point a moment's thought."
"The President of the Council also talked of the agreements and of course he also had in mind the complaints that have been made about their implementation."
"He promises us streamlining, meaning that there must also probably be a better focus on Russian complaints too, that greater efficiency, more guaranteed finance - naturally an important point in any case - more support with project management, etc. will be forthcoming and that a new northern-dimension environmental programme could probably serve as a model."
"I was gratified to hear that progress in being made in that respect, since on our last visit to Murmansk we found that the cleaning up of those nuclear submarines is proceeding at an extremely slow rate."
"It is in our mutual interest that this process should be accelerated."
"In this context it would be interesting if you could tell us to what extent TACIS can be associated with cross-border projects."
"Cross-border projects are always difficult in any case, but it seems that using TACIS actually makes things a little more difficult still."
"I was pleased to see that the common European economic area also came up for discussion at the summit."
"I should like to ask whether that is one of the typical effects of our idea of a wider Europe."
"Does this wider Europe in fact relate to these kinds of bilateral agreements, like this common economic area with Russia?"
"In that context have we considered other matters that might be raised in the framework of a wider Europe, for example the democratic development of Russia?"
"Can we exert any influence?"
"If so, in what way?"
"The fact is that, as yet, the Russian Federation cannot be called an entirely normal democracy."
"Many say that Russia should be integrated into the security structures of Europe."
"I have a question on this point."
"It is naturally splendid that Russia should be integrated into trans-Atlantic security structures."
"That strikes me as an excellent first step."
"But what would be the effect if Russia, which after all is a former superpower with a great military capability, were to start playing a major role in European security and defence policy?"
"It seems to me that our relationship would become slightly unbalanced."
"I should especially like to hear the Council's assessment of this."
"The resolution also calls on the Commission to set up a strategic partnership."
"That means of course that there must be convergence in EU policy."
"Strategic partnership, by bringing the whole EU into line, actually has more meaning for us than it does for Russia."
"That has been apparent in the past."
"Now, with the crisis in Iraq and the crisis in the EU regarding Iraq, what are the actual prospects of the convergence of this policy in a strategic partnership with Russia?"
"I should like to wish the Commissioner much courage in publishing reports on this matter."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there really must now be a new phase in our relations with Russia."
"It is now a historic time - in Russia, in the Union, and in the world too - and we must act."
"We have only partly implemented this master document, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"Bureaucracy has obstructed reform, and inertia, the Kaliningrad question, environmental problems and the mass media have generally drained it of its strength."
"Terrorist attacks, whose victims' relatives I want to express my deep condolences to - and my sympathies also go to the victims themselves - show that there is opposition to any political solution in Chechnya, although my understanding is that the Russian Government has gone down that path by actually organising elections."
"The human rights situation in Russia still needs a lot of work."
"It may be that if we are to deal with the Chechnya issue, which is souring relations between us, we need to provide a working group to plod on with the task in cooperation with Russia."
"Reforms in Russia have thus been slow to come about."
"Meanwhile, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are gaining strength more rapidly and sustainably, being led in their progress by the European Union."
"Russia may lose its markets in the region, and Union enlargement, if the worst comes to the worst, may isolate Russia."
"For that reason I want to emphasise the need for a new approach: we need a new strategic partnership with Russia."
"The Iraq war has shown that Russia is part of a European area of cooperation."
"It is the most recent example of that."
"The spearhead of this partnership could be Russia's modernisation and its civil society movement."
"Cooperation on energy, an area where still only a little has been achieved, could give a boost to its economy."
"An example of this might be the Northern Dimension, which, with the right financing, would strengthen this partnership."
"Russia must put the Investments Protection Agreement in order."
"The country must be made a member of the WTO as soon as possible, and given a certain role to play in European security cooperation."
"The fact is, the faster Russia 'westernises', the faster human rights will improve there."
"Russia is constructing no fewer than three oil ports in a remote part of the Gulf of Finland, which is known for its reefs and which forms one end of the Baltic Sea, the world's most ecologically burdened sea."
"In winter the solid ice cover there is 70 centimetres thick and the pack ice is anything up to 20 metres high."
"This last winter dozens of ships were cast adrift by ice, there being no help available from an ice breaker - ships on their way to Russia."
"Vessels not strong enough to withstand the pressure of ice and in such an appalling condition as those are an environmental time bomb, just like the Prestige was."
"I want to ask the Council what action Greece, as the country to hold the Presidency, has taken to ensure that only double-hull, ice-strengthened tankers, which can get there safely, should travel to these three new oil ports in Russia."
"There is one thing about Russia that has often gone unremarked. That is the importance of its culture, about which still too little is known in Europe."
"Now that the machinery we work with, the information society, is crying out for content, Russian content production could diversify and enrich content production in Europe, which is engaged in global competition."
"Russia has turned westwards, but I think it has also turned to the north, which is apparent from Russian activity in the northern and northwestern regions."
"This means that a new opportunity has now been created for the European Union and Russia to swiftly improve their mutual cooperation, along with the chance for them both to benefit from it."
"Mr President, it is the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party that the resolution agreed among the groups will provide a good basis for the work of the EU-Russia Summit."
"The position taken here is forward-looking and constructive, although it also has criticisms to make."
"The resolution will also be of use with regard to the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee meeting between the European Parliament and the Russian Duma to be held in Moscow next week."
"For my own part I would like to stress that we must try to narrow the economic and social differences that exist on all the Union's external borders."
"With the border between the EU and Russia becoming much longer than before, we must make dramatic improvements to cross-border cooperation."
"We must particularly encourage the Member States and their regions located on the EU's external borders to create direct links over the border to Russia."
"Such systematic programmes of cooperation between neighbouring regions have been in place on the border between Finland and Russia for a good ten years now."
"There now has to be the same kind of action both between Estonia and Russia and Latvia and Russia. Lithuania and Poland, meanwhile, must take special responsibility for the development of the Kaliningrad region."
"The Union has to be prepared to finance this cooperation between neighbouring regions."
"For cooperation in the border regions we need a new system of funding."
"The current TACIS and Interreg systems are not strong enough and they cannot be adequately coordinated."
"We have to create a new system of funding that can be used on the Union's other external borders too."
"The PHARE scheme, before it became part of the accession process, might serve as a model for this new system."
"Mr President, it is obviously not a matter of dispute in this House that we want a really in-depth partnership with Russia, and the EU, or the candidate countries, and Russia did indeed, in the past make a great deal of progress - and face manifest problems - in this regard."
"Reference has already been made to the issues connected with the Kaliningrad region, which I believe have still not yet been satisfactorily resolved, not to mention the failure of the Russian Government or the European Union to make purposeful, comprehensive or even strategic use of the opportunities that might result from this problem."
"'Strategic' is, in my mind, the key word in terms of what I am talking about."
"I believe that we should be evaluating the European Union's joint strategy from June 1999 - to which Mr Oostlander has already referred - in a much more critical light."
"To date, I believe, it has been neither joint nor - in the literal sense of the word - a strategy, nor is the far more modest framework for relations between the European Union and Russia that we actually have being adequately realised."
"I would like, in the first place, to highlight our responsibility and the chances we have of a strategic partnership in the area of security policy."
"I believe it to be of great significance that the European Union and Russia are, by means of the strategic development of their relations, contributing to multilateralism, helping to strengthen international law, to advance international cooperation, the UN, international agreements and disarmament."
"I can also see the present need for the UN to have a role in the reconstruction of Iraq."
"Secondly, there is a need for our economic relations with Russia to develop further in terms of substance and of quality."
"I regard the energy alliance as very important indeed, but as not going far enough."
"It should, I think, be quite consciously about the development of economic ties that would to some degree be mutual and on an equal footing."
"I believe that to make economic sense, and that it could make a very close relationship between the European Union and Russia irreversible."
"I believe it to be also utterly unacceptable that Russia's exports to the EU are arranged similarly to what one would expect from a developing country that is rich in raw materials."
"I know it will be very difficult to change that."
"This makes political efforts by both sides particularly important."
"Thirdly, any strategic partnership demands that both parties be consistent in their commitment to democracy and the implementation of human and minority rights."
"One has to accept that this will be evaluated in different ways."
"What is not acceptable is that human rights and their role should be regarded purely in terms of economic cycles, as I believe they are by many EU governments, especially as regards the issue of Chechnya."
"I see that as also a sign that there is no strategy."
"Let me conclude by saying that I hope that we, the European public, and also those of us who sit in this House, will, in our dealings with the Commission, the Council, and the Russian Government, have the courage to speak rather more resolutely about the strategic and institutional objective of a strategic relationship between the European Union and Russia, so that the door may be kept open."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our relations with Russia give me the impression that the values on which the European Union is founded, and which also apply to relations with Russia, are increasingly being sold down the river."
"While deals are being done about the shared use of Russia's enormous energy sources and cooperation in the field of armaments is being negotiated, fundamental democratic rights and respect for human rights no longer have any part to play, even though full respect for human and minority rights are the basis for all forms of partnership, cooperation, and economic relationship - something that the first paragraph of the Agreement makes abundantly clear."
"What this means is that the restrictions on the freedom of the press, the hounding of journalists, the massive political pressure on the justice system, conditions in prisons and, not least, the human rights violations in the war on the Chechen people must have a central place in the summit talks and must not be allowed to appear only as the dessert course at the final banquet."
"Concessions in economic relations and help with military research must be made conditional on significant improvements in the human rights situation in Russia, and on the country's respect for fundamental rights."
"That, at any rate, was what was agreed here in this House between the Commission, the Council and Parliament when the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement was approved."
"My expectation of the Commission and the Council is that they keep their promise, which will mean that the discussion must give priority to peaceful resolution of the conflict in Chechnya, and that there must be real insistence on dialogue at long last."
"It is clear that we all - my own group included - condemn the crimes that are being committed there by both sides, the bomb attacks as much as the crimes committed by the troops of the Russian Interior Ministry."
"We condemn the attempt to find solutions by means of violent acts against the civilian population."
"That is not acceptable."
"Peaceful dialogue is the only option, but it must be made possible by concessions on the part of the Russian Government and, most of all, by the crimes committed under the aegis of the State against the civilian population being punished."
"This leads me to ask you to reverse the priorities at this summit and not give centre stage to economic relations in the way you have done today."
"Mr President, two bloody terrorist attacks in Chechnya and Saudi Arabia at the beginning of this week underline the necessity of an international campaign against international terrorism."
"It is precisely this political urgency that demands an effective approach."
"In that sense clear doubts are being raised about the Russian anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya."
"Not least by Russian politicians and Russian citizens themselves."
"On the main cause a recent academic analysis is clarity itself: 'The main obstacle to a true normalisation and pacification of Chechnya is the atrocities committed by Russian forces and special units.'"
"Sadly, the Chechen terror gangs attract many young Chechens who are otherwise afraid that they will be picked up, abused, tortured and maybe even shot by Russian troops who are completely out of control."
"The draft resolution before us says nothing about this worrying situation in the Northern Caucasus."
"This House wishes, in view of the penultimate paragraph, to await the report on the visit of its delegation to Chechnya in mid-June."
"Hopefully the Council and Commission will raise the question of tackling the thoroughly deplorable Chechen terrorism - let there be no misunderstanding on that point - at the forthcoming summit with the Russian Federation."
"And not only because of wider geographical repercussions?"
"That brings me to another important point concerning regional security and stability."
"Paragraph 4 of the draft resolution welcomes the active participation of both the EU and Russia in the Middle East peace process."
"However, that process is not served in any way by the military and nuclear ambitions of the Islamic Republic of Iran."
"The US is afraid that these Iranian ambitions are being given practical sustenance by the present nuclear cooperation between Russia and Iran."
"At the beginning of this month therefore there was an American request to Russia to reconsider this specific cooperation."
"Do Council and Commission share these concerns of our Atlantic ally and do they also intend to raise this question at the forthcoming Summit with the Kremlin?"
"I sincerely hope that they will make a common trans-Atlantic front against Russia and Iran!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, the text on which we are going to vote tomorrow on the relations between the European Union and Russia is frankly repugnant."
"Mr Oostlander talked to us about his concerns regarding democratisation, or the lack of democratisation, in Russia, but he did not say a word in his four-minute speech about Chechnya."
"Mr Paasilinna, who together with Mr Oostlander is one of the main initiators of this resolution, did not mention it either."
"The resolution even goes so far as to praise the Russian military forces for their peacekeeping efforts."
"Russian peacekeeping forces, in Chechnya or elsewhere - like a few years ago in Afghanistan - let everyone judge for themselves."
"For once, at least the Council spoke a little about Chechnya, but I feel that the Council is deluding itself and I would even go so far as to say that it is lying to itself."
"However, by the same token, it is lying to us and telling us stories because the issue is not that which the President-in-Office of the Council outlined."
"The political solution proposed by Mr Putin is not a political solution. It encourages two forms of terrorism: the terror imposed on a daily basis by the Russian forces in Chechnya and the actions of gangs of terrorists secretly assisted by these same Russian military forces, who now occupy the entire territory and no longer give the political solution advocated by the Council a chance."
"We have tried everything, Europe did everything it could to isolate Mr Maskadov, who was nonetheless elected by the people of Chechnya during elections legitimised by the OSCE."
"The European Union has done everything it can to ensure that the ministers of Mr Maskadov's Government cannot move throughout Europe and can no longer meet the political authorities in the various EU countries."
"It has done everything in its power to destroy any possibility of real negotiations between the Chechens and the Russian authorities."
"Today, we have a kind of Quisling controlling Grozny and the surrounding area, who obeys Moscow."
"From time to time, he rebels and draws up a report, which you mentioned, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in which he speaks about the daily policy of terror implemented by the Russian authorities in Chechnya."
"That is the reality today."
"Without President Maskadov, peace will not be possible and no political solution will be possible in Chechnya."
"Without a clear message to President Putin to launch negotiations, there will be no solution in Chechnya."
"Moreover, Mr Putin stated about 10 months ago in the Financial Times that the problem facing Russia was not that of the final status of Chechnya but one of security."
"Mr Maskadov's Foreign Minister has proposed provisional administration of Chechnya by the United Nations, precisely to reassure the Russian authorities and to establish, within five or ten years, a Chechnyan administration that would provide a guarantee against the threats to Russian security."
"You do not talk about this; you do not want to see it happen; you do not want to see the Chechnyan Foreign Minister, who can no longer move throughout Europe and to whom you refuse a visa, just as you refuse visas to the other members of Mr Maskadov's government."
"That is the opposite of what should be done and yet it is what you continue to do."
"That is what makes it impossible to break the circle of terror, which, every day, as Mr Belder and Mrs Schroedter said, pushes young Chechens to despair, young people who have seen their parents, brothers and cousins killed in Grozny or in other towns in Chechnya, kidnapped and raped by the Russian forces."
"By acting this way, you are pushing them into the arms of the extremists who finance some of the madmen operating elsewhere in the world."
"It is essential to change this attitude as soon as possible. If not, instead of champagne, you will be agreeing to drink blood at the next St Petersburg summit."
"Mr President, neither at the international or global level - as shown by the Iraq crisis - nor at the European level, can we avoid dealing with Russia, and this is only right."
"We need Russia as a partner, and I believe deeper cooperation with it to be both desirable and worth striving after, for the Russians should understand the enlargement of the European Union not as a hostile act, but as an opportunity."
"As has been frequently said, borders shift and change, and one of the consequences of enlargement is that we will be sharing borders with Russia."
"The resolution, under the Danish Presidency, of the problem with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad - the former Königsberg - is very much to be welcomed."
"Now there is also to be a new summit on 31 May, an EU-Russia summit on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the founding of St Petersburg."
"There has since 1999 been a common strategy, whose cornerstones are meant to be democracy, the rule of law, further integration into a European economic and social area and general enhancement of security and stability in Europe, along with reforms in the energy sector and the shared struggle against organised crime."
"Russia does not aspire to membership of the European Union, which would go against its conception of itself as a major power."
"The European Union should seek genuine cooperation with Russia, which would, not least, involve the European Investment Bank being allowed more opportunities for activity in Russia, an idea put forward by, among others, Mr Schüssel, the Austrian Chancellor, who propounded it in a letter to President Prodi of the Commission."
"If Russia were to ratify the agreement with the European Investment Bank, which agreement is oriented towards the Northern dimension, the Russians would at once have billions of euros at their disposal, which would make it possible for a fair amount of nuclear waste to be disposed of."
"As far as Chechnya is concerned, it is clear that we must demand that human rights be respected, just as much as we must condemn terrorism, which again claimed civilian victims only a few days ago."
"Diplomacy, however, is what is called for here, in order to break the spiral of violence and responses to violence."
"Mr President, allow me a few supplementary observations on issues which have been touched on during the debate because, for the rest, both my first intervention and the Commission intervention gave a great many replies to a series of issues."
"We are, of course, interested in having, as with every other country, a successful summit."
"The precise objective of the meetings being held is to promote the objectives which we too have in accordance with the ambitions, values and principles that we want to promote."
"We know that these procedures are often time-consuming and laborious."
"I know of no procedure which quickly results in changes, in solutions to problems which have dragged on."
"I should like to refer to Kaliningrad."
"The solution for Kaliningrad is progressing to timetable and I think that it is progressing satisfactorily."
"The ratification by the duma of the border agreement with Lithuania will have taken place by 30 June, according to the commitments entered into."
"And we expect the same for the readmission agreement between Russia and Lithuania."
"Similarly, I should like to say that provision has been made for a special TACIS programme on Kaliningrad and our precise objective is for the summit to give the order to draw up a strategy jointly with Russia, so that there is integrated development of this Russian area."
"As far as the Northern Dimension is concerned, we are currently preparing the new action plan and the Commission is preparing a first draft which we shall subsequently process within the framework of the Council."
"We consider that the Northern Dimension must continue to be an important development tool in our relations with Russia."
"The signature of the MN?PR agreement will release funds for protection against nuclear dangers in north-west Russia, funds which have been amassed precisely within the framework of the Northern Dimension."
"I should like to point out that huge changes have been made as regards Russia over the last thirteen years."
"Traditional stereotypes have been overturned, new premises have been created, Russia's relations with the European Union, with ????, with the United States, have changed radically and this is creating new situations, of which each Member State and the European Union as a whole are weighing the importance and deciding to see how to proceed and what momentum to give."
"Within these frameworks, one needs to take account of the reports on foreign policy, security and defence issues, but I should like to point out that one needs to be very, very careful here."
"These are not issues that can proceed quickly."
"They need a long-term perspective and strategy and a method that does not create confrontations and contradictory situations on basic strategic choices by the European Union and Europe as a whole."
"We therefore welcome the possibilities opening up and are proceeding with the methods and the degrees of freedom that we judge are opening up on each occasion and allowing us closer forms of cooperation."
"Could the President-in-Office of the Council say something more about the ratification of the border agreements between Latvia, Estonia and Russia?"
"I specifically asked for that."
"Mr Oostlander, I am able to inform you that, while the agreement between Russia and Lithuania is in the process of being concluded, the duma has given a firm undertaking that the border agreement with Lithuania will be ratified by the end of this month."
"As for the others, I am not in a position to give you news of such a positive outcome, but we are working on them."
"In practice, though, this will not in the least be a problem, as there is no dispute about the borderlines."
"The only real problem was in connection with Kaliningrad, and that has been resolved."
"Pursuant to Rule 37(2) I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate"
"Question No 1 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0215/03):"
"Subject: Implementation of Council Directive 1999/70/EC by Greece"
"Council Directive 1999/70/EC"
"Article 2, Paragraph 1 of Council Directive 1999/70/?C concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by the European Trade Union Confederation, the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe and the European Centre of Enterprises with Public Participation obliges the Member States to comply with the directive in question by 10 July 2001."
"Under Article 2, Paragraph 2, the Member States may have one more year, if necessary, over and above the deadline for the application of the directive in question, in order to take account of special difficulties or implementation under a collective agreement."
"Bearing this in mind, the Council would ask the honourable Member to put the question to the Commission, because the Commission is competent for ascertaining progress with regard to the application of Community law by the Member States."
"I am sorry, but by reason of my capacity as the Council's representative, I cannot mention more details, of which there are many and which would have enlightened the honourable Member."
"Mr President, I have listened carefully to the President-in-Office's reply."
"Certainly the Commission has a responsibility for the application of Community legislation but the Council cannot also be without responsibility for the fact that a Member State is not applying an important directive."
"And of course, in relation to the original question, today there is a presidential decree - a month ago - it has of course changed - but the presidential decree died in its infancy because the Civil Court of Appeal of Crete found in judgment 466 in 2002 that it contradicted the basic provisions of the Community directive."
"I can do no more than repeat my question to the President-in-Office with this new information."
"I have nothing to say other than to ask the honourable Member to put his question to the Commission."
"Question No 2 by Josu Ortuondo Larrea (H-0217/03):"
"Subject: War against Iraq: Aerial refuelling of B-52 bombers over European cities"
"The Basque Country and the whole of north-eastern Spain have been taken by surprise at newspaper reports on the route followed by B-52 bombers between their base at Fairford (England) and Iraq."
"It appears that they are being refuelled by KC-135 'stratotankers' in the skies above Bilbao, Pamplona, Zaragoza and Barcelona, before entering the Mediterranean."
"Rather than refuelling over the Atlantic, they are cutting corners and flying close to towns and cities with hundreds of thousands of inhabitants, whose safety they are jeopardising."
"The Spanish airforce is banned from carrying out such operations over population centres."
"Does the Council not consider the overflying by these aircraft of densely populated towns and cities to be an infringement of public safety?"
"When coupled with the aerial refuelling operations, is this not showing disregard for the rights of the local populations, which are taking second place to a cruel war that is opposed by public opinion in Europe and world-wide and is being waged without the consent of the UN Security Council?"
"Should the EU not reproach Mr Aznar and his government for allowing these dangerous operations to be conducted and for supporting and participating in the illegal war against Iraq?"
"The allegations contained in the newspaper reports to which the honourable Member refers in his question have not been notified to or discussed in the Council."
"The matter comes under the jurisdiction of the Spanish state."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Spanish citizens have not forgotten how Mr Fraga Iribarne, founder and honorary President of the People's Party, and mentor of the current President, Mr Aznar, as a minister under the dictator Franco, deceived them by swimming in the sea at Mojácar and say that he also did so at Palomares, where four thermonuclear bombs had fallen as a result of a collision during an aerial refuelling operation between a B-52 bomber and a tanker plane."
"In the meantime, the US cleared and fenced off 105 hectares of land contaminated with radioactivity in a large area which was closed to the Spanish people and referred to as Camp Wilson."
"Today, the Spanish People's Party Government has also begun to deny that several B-52 bombers were refuelled in the skies above Bilbao, Iruña/Pamplona and Barcelona on 21 March last, on their way to Iraq."
"Confronted with evidence provided by air traffic controllers, the Spanish Government had no choice yesterday but to recognise in Parliament that that day, at the very least, it authorised the overflying and refuelling of eight bombers carrying 240 tonnes of bombs, and justified this by saying that this involved low-risk manoeuvres."
"Does the Council believe it acceptable for these operations to be carried out overflying densely populated towns and cities and for the Government to claim there is no risk?"
"Does the Council consider it democratic for a government cynically to have denied these events and deceived its citizens so blatantly?"
"I think that the honourable Member merely referred in greater detail to a series of incidents of which the Council is ignorant and, as I said, the matter comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Spanish state."
"It is not a matter for which the Council of the European Union is responsible."
"You clearly heard the Council's response."
"In theory, the response does not give rise to further supplementary questions, but I am going to grant them."
"Mr Nogueira has the floor for a supplementary question."
"Mr President, the Spanish State has been notable for its support of the unilateral attack mounted by the United States and the United Kingdom against Iraq."
"Now, together with Italy and Poland, it is going to act as an occupying power in the Iraqi State."
"Does the Council believe that the Spanish State should consequently share international responsibility because of its warlike, illegal and unjust aggression?"
"What kind of relationship will the European Union have in the action it undertakes in Iraq with the Member States occupying that country?"
"I must remind Mr Nogueira that his question - Question No 3 - which would be next, has lapsed and it is very similar to his supplementary question because a debate took place just this morning based on a Commission and Council statement."
"I am forced to remind you of this."
"In any case, Mr Yiannitsis has the floor if he feels he should respond."
"What the Spanish Government did in relation to the question of Iraq or any other related issues is not a matter on which I, as President-in-Office, can comment or refer to in the manner in which the honourable Member wishes."
"The truth is that I would like it if Mr Ortuondo Larrea did not always bring up national concerns in this Parliament and if he could make contributions to European integration, which is why I believe we are all here."
"Gentlemen, although I am going to give you the floor, I would ask that this be the end of the matter."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has given a full, clear answer with regard to the subject of the question."
"In any case, Mr Ortuondo has the floor if he feels that this concerns him."
"With all due respect for the opinion of Mr Oreja Arburúa, I bring here any issues that affect European citizens."
"The Basque and Catalan citizens who were at risk from the overflying B-52 bombers, and also the Andalusian citizens who were at risk from four bombs which fell on them, are European citizens and, therefore, responding that this is an internal affair is simply an attempt to avoid taking the bull by the horns, when it is a matter that affects European citizens."
"Clearly your metaphors also come from Spain: the bull and its horns."
"There are no points of order."
"I believe we have exhausted the topic of the points raised by Mr Ortuondo."
"Question No 3 lapses."
"Question No 4 by Bernd Posselt (H-0223/03):"
"Subject: Reforming the Dayton Agreement"
"How does the Council Presidency view the notion of reforming the Dayton Agreement in such a way that Bosnia and Herzegovina would be converted from a community of three peoples and two entities into a federation of three peoples with equal rights?"
"Equal rights between the peoples that make up Bosnia-Herzegovina are enshrined in the constitution, as set out in Annex 4 to the peace agreement, and have been confirmed by the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"In an important decision in September 2000, the court ruled that the express recognition of Bosnians, Croatians and Serbs in the constitution of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as peoples that make up the country, brooks just one interpretation: that they enjoy equality as groups."
"It also states that the constitutional principle of collective equality between peoples that make up the country, which derives from the definition of Bosnians, Croatians and Serbs as the peoples that make up the country, prohibits any special privilege for any one of these peoples, any predominance of one side in government structures or any ethnic homogenisation as the result of divisions on a territorial basis."
"The constitution of the Srpska Republic and of the Federation was amended further to this judgment, in order to remove the contested provisions."
"A new law was also passed in order to safeguard the representation of the three peoples that make up the country at all levels of governance and throughout the public sector."
"The European Union is continuing via the stability and association process to promote democratisation, the rule of law and economic reform as means of promoting the rights of the minorities and as a means of promoting equal opportunities for all citizens."
"Mr President, let me start by pointing out that the expression 'to take the bull by the horns' exists in German as well; we may not, alas, have bullfights, but we still have the metaphor."
"I am obliged to the President-in-Office of the Council for his very precise and very fine answer, and would like to put to him a supplementary question. If this development, namely the equal rights of these three ethnic groups being put on a firmer footing - which I very much desire - actually comes to pass, might another approach not be to make the structures rather less bureaucratic?"
"Many Bosnians tell me that there are too many cantons, and that they are too small, something that is a result of an imbalance and leads to a large proportion of the gross national product and of international aid being swallowed up by excessive bureaucracy."
"I should like to start by saying that the simile heard also exists in Greek."
"It would appear in fact to exist in all the countries of the European Union, regardless of whether or not there are bulls, and to remind you, in all events, that bull fights were depicted on frescos in the old Minoan palaces which have existed for thousands of years, before modern Spain."
"As for the rest, I should just like to take note of your comment."
"I have nothing to say."
"Restricting bureaucracy may be a problem."
"Insofar as it is feasible, you may see it but, as you will understand, you cannot also intervene in a series of very internal affairs in these countries without this being seen as another form of intervention."
"Question No 5 by Othmar Karas (H-0229/03):"
"Subject: European corporate tax reform policy"
"Small firms in particular suffer because of the existence of 15 (soon to be 25) different tax systems, because of the bureaucracy resulting from the various VAT rules, and because of the vast administrative demands stemming from the different corporate tax regimes and innumerable dual-taxation agreements."
"What justification can there be for the fact that large firms have a lower effective tax burden to bear than SMEs, which cannot engage in fiscal engineering?"
"How does the Council view the European Parliament's call for continuation of the successfully conducted project for reduced VAT on labour-intensive services in order to prevent illegal working and create a more favourable employment environment?"
"How does the Council view the call for a firm to be required to include intra-EU sales revenue in only one turnover tax declaration, in the state in which its headquarters are located, and how does the Council view the pilot project on home state taxation in order to reduce SMEs' administrative burden?"
"What is the Council's position on extending the principle of qualified- majority voting to those areas of taxation policy which directly influence the extent to which the European internal market can operate?"
"?he administrative cost and the cost of compliance which small and medium-sized enterprises face has been the focus of particular attention during the work of the Council to coordinate the various tax systems."
"Generally speaking, I would say that the Council has turned its attention on numerous occasions to initiatives and proposals as to how to limit the problems and difficulties which small and medium-sized enterprises have with their access to the market."
"As regards the findings from the individual initiatives, the honourable Member will have to address his question to the Commission of the European Communities, whose job it is to monitor the measures in question."
"As far as the procedure under which the Council takes decision in the taxation sector is concerned, it should be noted that the relevant rules are provided for in the Treaty and no one can ask the Council to change those rules."
"In all events, the honourable Member will have observed the discussions held recently, which are also taking place within the framework of the Convention, on the possible extension of qualified majority voting, in which case there may be a different arrangement here too which will give more desirable and more positive results."
"Even if you say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Council cannot be expected to change its stance overnight, I do nonetheless believe that one can expect it to be willing to change a stance that causes problems of this sort."
"Our twenty-five different tax systems result in distortions of competition in the internal market; small and medium-sized businesses are put at a disadvantage, particularly when operating across borders; and, of course, unanimous voting in the Council on tax matters creates problems when it comes to strengthening the internal market and the European economy."
"So let me again ask you what initiative the Council would take in order to remove the disadvantages to small and medium-sized businesses resulting from differing tax systems and to support the internal market as a whole?"
"What initiatives have been taken in the Convention by the Member States in order to do away with the requirement for unanimity on matters affecting the single market?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has asked the Commission to produce a study of the effects of Basle II."
"Even though this study has not yet seen the light of day, we know that the effects of Basle II touch Europe - I refer in particular to the creditworthiness of small and medium-sized enterprises and the securities they are required to provide."
"What I want to ask is: what will the Council do in order to get its hands on this study, and how will it deal with the problem of tax reform in such a way that small and medium-sized enterprises can meet the requirements of Basle II?"
"We shall look and see why the European Commission is late."
"There are numerous cases in which, for objective reasons, the European Commission may be late submitting a study."
"It has also happened to us on other occasions during the course of the Greek Presidency."
"Of course, on the basis of this study - and I do not think that one study will resolve all the problems - and any proposals that may be made, we shall see how we are going to respond."
"Question No 6 by Seán Ó Neachtain (H-0230/03):"
"Subject: EU initiatives to save Amina Lawal from death by stoning"
"Will the Council state what initiatives it is pursuing to save the life of Amina Lawal, the Nigerian woman who is appealing her sentence of mandatory punishment of death by stoning and whose appeal was delayed until after the elections in April 2003, and is the Council aware of other similar convictions in Nigeria and what action is it taking in these cases?"
"The ?U closely monitored the case of Amina Lawal, who was sentenced last year to death by stoning, and we expressed our deep concern in a declaration on 21 ?ugust 2002 about the decision by the court of appeal rejecting Amina Lawal's appeal."
"Following this referral of the case, no similar convictions have been noted in the Council."
"The ?U will continue to exert pressure within the framework of political dialogue and at various levels, especially through the head of missions in Abuja, stressing that Nigeria must ensure that the constitution remains the supreme law in its country."
"Amina Lawal's defence formulated the opinion that supportive action should be taken in a discreet and confidential manner due to the constitutional problems which arise from the application of Sharia law in certain states."
"The ?U has taken this advice on board and is of the opinion that, as long as the case is not considered to be pending, it is better to follow a general approach, such as that I referred to earlier, and not to individualise the case."
"Within these frameworks, the ?U has repeated its position on the death penalty and encouraged the Nigerian Government to continue to work for the abolition of the death penalty and for the prevention of any form of harsh, inhumane or humiliating treatment or punishment."
"In particular, we are urging the Nigerian authorities to respect human rights and human dignity fully, especially as regards women."
"On this issue, the ?U generally attaches great importance to the role of civil society and we are supporting the human rights organisations and other non-governmental bodies active in this sector."
"Given that the electoral process has now been completed, the ?U will continue to focus on this issue - it is an important issue - and will take appropriate action depending on subsequent measures taken by the courts."
"I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"I feel that his answer is satisfactory to an extent."
"However, this is a most appalling case and should be followed more closely than his reply seemed to suggest, because there are other similar cases and similar convictions in Nigeria and elsewhere."
"We must show that we are earnest in calling for the repeal of those most foul actions and that we are against the denial of the most basic human right - the right to life."
"Therefore, I hope that the Council will take further action to ensure that this does not continue and also to seek out where other convictions of a similar nature have taken place."
"I thank the President-in-Office again for his reply, but I would urge that this be followed more closely still with regard to the most basic human rights that I have mentioned."
"I should like to point out that the Council is especially sensitive to more general issues which relate both to human rights and, in all events, to practices of this sort by certain countries in the global system as far as the general part is concerned."
"As regards this specific case, all it is doing is following the recommendation made to it: not to do any harm but, on the contrary, to do whatever might be of help in this specific case and might be effective."
"Mr President, Mr President in Office of the Council, I wonder if there is any EU country that has declared itself prepared to give Amina Lawal protection against the possibility of the court case not going the way we wish it to."
"Has any country shown a readiness in the Council to make such a statement?"
"If we are serious about wishing to protect her, we must press our countries to give her protection against this type of state persecution which is, de facto, exercised against many women."
"I do not know the answer to your question at this moment in time."
"We can examine it and give a written answer."
"Question No 7 by Niall Andrews (H-0232/03):"
"Subject: Cotonou Agreement and Council priorities"
"In the light of the entry into force on 1 April 2003 of the Cotonou Agreement, will the Council outline what its priorities are for enhancing the political dimension, tackling debt, reducing poverty and dealing with the major health issues at a time of increasing global economic uncertainty?"
"The Cotonou Agreement is based on three main pillars: political dialogue, financial and commercial cooperation and development aid."
"This partnership focuses on the objective of reducing and, possibly, eliminating poverty and this is linked to the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the global economy."
"?CP-?U cooperation is based on a series of fundamental principles, which include equality of partners and the adoption of development strategies."
"In order to implement the objectives of the partnership, the Cotonou Agreement clearly stipulates that the ACP countries shall determine the development strategies for their economies and societies with full sovereignty."
"Most provisions of the Agreement were implemented in transitional agreements well before the full entry into force of the Agreement in April 2003."
"Now that the Cotonou Agreement has entered into force, the funds under the ninth EDF are now fully available."
"Programming of these resources, in other words the preparation of the strategic support for each country, which is based on the particular medium-term objectives and on the development strategies of the country, and the introduction of an indicative timetable for implementing the support strategy for each country have almost been completed."
"The Commission announced its intention to use the reserves of the ninth EDF mainly to finance the Community contribution to international initiatives for the benefit of developing countries, such as debt reduction and health."
"These proposals, which are currently being examined by the Council, will also allow for faster disbursement of EDF funds."
"The application of these proposals will require joint decisions with the ACP countries."
"The Council's priorities for EC development policy are clearly noted in the Council and Commission declaration approved in November 2000, which lays down six priority sectors on the basis of the added value of Community action and their contribution to reducing poverty."
"These sectors are: the link between trade and development, regional integration and cooperation, support for macro-economic policies, the promotion of equal access to social services, transport, food security, sustainable rural development and, finally, the creation of an institutional infrastructure."
"The Council supports the Commission's efforts to mange the Community's external aid more efficiently and to use EDF funds in accordance with the objectives and criteria of the Cotonou Agreement."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"It was a very comprehensive reply indeed, but one of the issues I have discovered, over almost thirty years of involvement in development, is the lack of emphasis on education."
"The reason I put this question to the Council was to try and establish whether the Council and the European Union can put more emphasis on education, because in developing countries if you have the three basics - reading, writing and arithmetic - even at the simplest level, you can challenge the village elders and the leaders in your community."
"When you are illiterate that is impossible."
"The purpose of my putting this question was to shift the emphasis, because poverty cannot be tackled through a continuation of the same old formula."
"I believe that 'education, education, education' is the real answer to poverty."
"That is where the emphasis should be."
"I have noted the member's comment."
"I cannot but agree with him that education is crucial to success."
"Moreover, in the age of information technology and knowledge, it is absolutely basic."
"As far as the possibility of further intervention in the internal policies of these countries is concerned, I have noted his comment, which I shall also pass on to the European Commission, and we shall bear it in mind within the framework of the Council."
"Question No 8 by Liam Hyland (H-0234/03):"
"Subject: WTO and agriculture deadline"
"In view of the fact that negotiators at the WTO were unable to agree agriculture negotiating modalities by the 31 March 2003 deadline, does the Council consider that satisfactory progress can be made in other areas in time for the 5th WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancún in Mexico next September, and that more acceptable agricultural proposals can be considered in the meantime in line with the negotiating mandate it gave to the Commission, and how does it regard the views expressed in the US by the Director of the Institute for International Economics, Mr Bergsten, who said, according to Reuters, that the WTO negotiations are more likely to stretch on until the middle of 2007 when the White House's current trade negotiating authority expires?"
"The Council acknowledges that the general situation as regards the Doha negotiations on development matters is far from satisfactory, mainly because the deadlines were not kept to as regards certain sectors, such as the details of access to pharmaceuticals and the details in the agricultural sector."
"The impasse on pharmaceuticals was due to the refusal on the part of the United States to agree to the solution which was accepted by almost all the other countries."
"As far as agriculture is concerned, the situation is more complicated and repeated efforts by the president of the WTO Committee on Agriculture, Mr Harbinson, were rejected by all sides for contradictory and mutually exclusive reasons."
"The Council is, of course, willing to examine any new text submitted by Mr Harbinson or anybody else."
"Despite these difficulties, however, it is fundamental at the present juncture to maintain the momentum of negotiations within the framework of the WTO and to make fundamental progress in the run up to the Cancún conference."
"To start with, in today's unstable international political climate, it is even more important to make essential progress with regard to trade issues."
"In addition, the most recent multilateral meetings in Geneva demonstrated that there is enhanced awareness between the members of the WTO that the pre-preparatory procedure needs to proceed over coming months so as not to create an excessive workload for the Cancún conference."
"Finally, the Council does not share the pessimistic views formulated by certain commentators as regards the Cancún conference."
"The problems which need to be resolved before Cancún are numerous but it is not the first time that we have worked to tight deadlines in trade negotiations."
"If all the important players make serious efforts and demonstrate real political will, it will be possible to make progress on all outstanding issues over coming months."
"Consequently, positive links need to be pursued between issues in order to restore the momentum of the procedure, given that all sides know that there is no agreement until there is full agreement."
"As far as agriculture is concerned, the Council confirmed its support at its meeting on 8 April 2003 for the Community proposal on the details in the agricultural sector and urged the Commission to continue its efforts so that an agreement can be reached on this basis because, in its opinion, this is the most realistic means of completing the negotiations in accordance with the timetable laid down in the Doha ministerial declaration."
"I should like to refer to the concept of rational expectations and rational behaviour and to say that, obviously, any conclusions within the framework of the negotiations being carried out inside the European Union will not be adopted if there is any prospect that they cannot be safeguarded or they cannot be compatible with what is decided at world level."
"Question No 9 by Brian Crowley (H-0236/03):"
"Subject: Closure of Calder Hall Magnox reactor in Sellafield"
"Given the welcome closure of the Calder Hall Magnox reactor at Sellafield at the end of March 2003, will the Council now actively support calls for the closure of the five remaining Magnox plants in the UK which present an increasing safety concern as they get older?"
"The question of nuclear safety generally concerns the Council, which fully supports achieving a high standard of nuclear safety throughout the European Union."
"However, competence and responsibility for nuclear safety lie with the Member States in question; consequently, the Council is not in a position to comment on safety and other aspects relating to specific reactors in specific Member States."
"As the honourable Member will know, each reactor should normally only operate for as long as it complies with the requirements of high nuclear safety standards."
"The current Community legislation on the safety of nuclear facilities is based mainly on Chapter 3 in Title ?? of the Euratom Treaty."
"Directive 96/29/?uratom laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation sets out the basic obligations for radiation protection which must be honoured."
"The Council also notes the Commission's recent proposal for a directive laying down the basic obligations and general principles relating to the safety of nuclear facilities, which will be subject to careful examination."
"As I mentioned, there is the Commission proposal which is being examined by the Council and, if the Council so concludes, there may be a basis for examining this sort of request."
"In addition, I should like to point out that the problem is not a technical one. The problem, over and above the national aspects, also has institutional dimensions, of course it also has political dimensions, but it also has institutional dimensions which you need to respect and not to violate, and that creates restrictions both on this issue and on other issues where there are institutional provisions for the limits within which the Council can intervene."
"Question No 10 by Gerard Collins, which has been taken over by Mr Andrews (H-0238/03):"
"Subject: European Rural Model"
"The Greek Presidency has emphasised the importance of the European Rural Model and the foundations on which it is based, namely family farms and local communities, small towns and villages located throughout the EU's rural areas."
"Will the Council make a statement now on the progress made during the Greek Presidency on preserving and promoting this European Rural Model?"
"The Greek Presidency, continuing the efforts of the previous presidency, has been trying since January to progress as best it can with an examination of the legislative proposals for reforming the common agricultural policy, including of course the proposal for a regulation on rural development."
"According to the latest information given to me on developments in the relevant Council, I might add that I am optimistic about progress with this work."
"The debate on reforms during these first six months should allow the Council, following the opinion also of the European Parliament, to reach an agreement on all the reform proposals in June."
"Our presidency attaches great importance to safeguarding the multi-operational European Rural Model, which focuses more on attention to rural development and it could not be any other way, given that we have also tested the value of this model in our country."
"During discussions which have already been held on all the proposals, these aspects of the proposals were generally well received and the importance which needs to be attached to these issues, and the rural development of peripheral areas in particular, was emphasised."
"In addition, the Council and the Commission are aware of the fact that funding under the CAP must comply with the conclusions of the European Council in Berlin on financial ceilings and with the conclusions of the European Council in Brussels in October 2002."
"Consequently, measures in favour of rural development will depend on the funds available under the second pillar of the CAP and any funds obtained from reallocating resources which may be released at the level of the first pillar of the CAP as a result of the reform under way."
"If Mr Andrews would like to reword his question, he also has the floor."
"If he does not wish to reword it, Mr Ó Neachtain has the floor to put his question."
"It was clear from my reply that I agree that this model has an important role in the operation of European agriculture; we are in the process of examining how to proceed."
"During this process, the competent ministers will obviously bring their experience and positions to bear and I hope that the final balance struck will safeguard precisely the positive elements of the model which prevails in the Union and which is important not only from an agricultural but also from a more general economic, social and, in the final analysis, political point of view."
"I shall bear the comments expressed in mind."
"Question No 11 by Mrs Izquierdo Rojo (H-0240/03) will not receive a response as the subject it concerns has been included on the agenda for this part-session."
"Question No 12 by Sarah Ludford , which has been taken over by Mrs Thors (H-0241/03):"
"Subject: Women in Afghanistan and Iraq"
"In Afghanistan, over a year after the fall of the Taliban, life for most women is hardly getting any better."
"What action is the Council, in conjunction with the Commission, taking to improve the situation there for women, who in many cases are in practice still confined to their homes by widespread restrictions?"
"As an aid donor, what pressure is the EU putting on the Afghan interim government to stop harassment and oppression of women, such as bans on walking, obligatory wearing of the burqa and bans on being driven by a man in a taxi?"
"Will the Council ensure, to the best of its ability, that women in post-war Iraq get a fair deal in the process of physical and political reconstruction?"
"The ?U is closely monitoring the situation as regards respect for the human rights of women in Afghanistan."
"In its contacts with the Afghan Transitional Administration, the ?U constantly and incessantly stresses that the rights of Afghan women and the promotion of their full and equal participation in every aspect of public life are an important reference point for the evaluation of the performance of the Afghan Transitional Administration and for defining subsequent EU policy towards Afghanistan."
"On 14 April the Council approved conclusions in which it underlined, among other things, the importance of including the mainstreaming of gender awareness into the policy of the Afghan Transitional Administration and in which it urged the establishment of a constitutional framework for the promotion and protection of human rights, especially with regard to women and girls."
"Similarly, the Council stressed that gender awareness must be one of the features of the government to be formed following free and fair elections by June 2004."
"The Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs, who met the EU ministers in April 2003, subscribes to these conclusions."
"Following the fall of the Taliban, there are nonetheless signs of improvement."
"More and more girls are attending school and they are also studying at higher education institutes in the larger towns."
"The ministries are recruiting women and, generally speaking, a lot of women have returned to their work outside the home."
"One very positive step was the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women on 5 March."
"However, the Council indeed acknowledges that the situation of women is still unacceptable as regards the possibilities of education and work, as regards their legal protection or their full and equal participation in public life, despite the examples to which I referred."
"Similarly, women are the main victims of insecurity, which threatens their life and their dignity."
"The office of the EU special representative for Afghanistan, Mr Vendrell, has established good working relations with the Ministry for Women's Affairs and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Committee and is supporting the creation of an infrastructure of women's organisations through training and dialogue."
"The EU special representative, together with the representatives of the Commission and the Member States, regularly evaluate the achievement of the objectives of the policy of the European Union, including in the field of women's rights and shall, if they deem necessary, submit recommendations on further action to be taken on the part of the ?U. Finally, the Council will also pay special attention to the role of women in the reconstruction of Iraq."
"I shall have taken note of these comments and, as with Afghanistan, the same applies to Iraq and, once the situation has returned to normal, we shall be in a position to take specific actions."
"I said in my position that the situation of women in Afghanistan does indeed correspond to the problematic picture to which you too referred."
"The Council is trying with all the means at its disposal to influence this situation."
"As the author is not present, Question No 13 lapses."
"Question No 14 by José Ribeiro e Castro (H-0243/03):"
"Subject: Cuba: policy review"
"The European Union has been developing a policy of constructive dialogue with Cuba."
"This development was based on the assumption that the Communist regime in Cuba was prepared to open up to some degree and the hope that it might help bring about a move towards democracy and full respect for human rights."
"The European Parliament held a debate on the extremely serious situation in Cuba on 10 April 2003 and adopted a resolution."
"What specific political consequences does the Council draw from the abrupt change in the situation in Cuba?"
"Will the Council continue with the policy which was on the point of being finalised, even though the Cuban regime has brutally overturned the assumptions on which it was based?"
"What steps is the Council taking - and what further steps can it take - to secure the release of all political prisoners being detained by the Cuban regime?"
"Does the Council share the view that, particularly following the award of the 2002 Sakharov prize and certainly throughout 2003, all the European institutions have an even greater responsibility to act firmly and in a spirit of solidarity in support of all those people in Cuba who merely wish to be able to exercise their basic human freedom and who believe in democracy and human rights, including for the people of Cuba?"
"In its regular evaluation of the EU's common position on Cuba, the Council always underlines its approach of open and constructive dialogue with Cuba on all matters of common interest."
"The Council has reiterated that the objectives of the policy of the European Union on Cuba remain the encouragement of a process of transition to a pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, sustainable economic recovery and a better standard of living for the population."
"The ?U monitors the situation in Cuba on a regular basis."
"As soon as it learned of the recent wave of arrests, the presidency, on behalf of the European Union, issued public statements and proceeded with intense demarches towards Havana."
"In their bilateral contacts with the Cuban authorities, the Member States protested strongly about the arrests."
"The Council has taken due account of the resolution passed by the European Union on 10 April, which reinforces the EU's position against these measures."
"At its meeting on 14 April, the Council of the European Union approved the following conclusions:"
"'The Council condemns the recent actions of the Cuban authorities, notably the executions, the large-scale arrests of dissidents, the unfair trials and the arbitrary and excessive sentences imposed."
"It calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners."
"These latest developments, which mark a further deterioration in the human rights situation in Cuba, will affect the EU's relationship with Cuba and the prospects for increased cooperation."
"The Council will keep the situation under close review.'"
"The ?U also supported a resolution on the human rights situation in Cuba which was passed within the framework of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights."
"As a general comment, the presidency of the ?U issued a declaration stating that the ?U condemns the large-scale arrests, the unfair summary trials and the arbitrary and excessive sentences imposed on numerous dissidents for peacefully expressing their political, religious and social opinions and because they were exercising their right to take full and equal part in public life."
"Consequently, the ?U demands that those persons, whom it considers prisoners of conscience, be released without delay and also calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners."
"It is also deeply concerned at the continuing repression of members of the opposition."
"The ?U roundly condemns the recent executions of Cuban citizens carried out following summary trials and expresses its regret that the moratorium on the death penalty in the country has come to an end."
"These latest developments, which mark a further deterioration in the human rights situation in the country, will affect the ?U's relationship with Cuba and the prospects for increased cooperation."
"The ?U will monitor violations of personal and political rights, which continue to affect the Union's relationship with Cuba, very closely."
"I should like to close by pointing out that the ?U will continue to keep the situation under close review, especially as regards the possible exercise of legal recourse for the 78 persons convicted."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the President-in-Office for his extensive answer, but I feel I must suggest that we need to go further."
"It is precisely because we support a change towards transition in Cuba and because people's expectations have been brutally shattered, that I believe we all have a particular responsibility. This is all the more true because last December this Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to a great Cuban personality in the field of human rights: Osvaldo Payá, who is suffering considerably at the moment."
"We must adopt a position of active solidarity, which leads me to ask the following question: is the Council prepared to invite Mr Payá to take part in meetings with the Presidency, with the High Representative and with the Council, in order to give his feelings, in person, about the extremely serious events taking place in Cuba?"
"Would the Council consider the possibility of suggesting to all Member States that they do the same, through their diplomatic representatives, in other words, that they convey their solidarity directly and invite Osvaldo Payá, the 2002 Sakharov prizewinner, to visit every European capital and there give a true picture of the Cuban people's suffering?"
"I referred to the declarations made by the Council and numerous, perhaps all, the Member States condemning recent developments in Cuba."
"The Council is particularly sensitive to this issue, and discussed it at its last meeting and decided to issue these declarations of condemnation."
"Further action will be judged in the light of developments."
"It is clear that what happened in Cuba recently has given rise to a general outcry and we hope that this will influence subsequent decisions by the Cuban Government."
"As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos. 39 to 58 will be answered in writing."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0141/2003) by Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive on Community measures for the control of foot and mouth disease (COM(2002) 736 - C5-0029/2003 - 2002/0299(CNS))."
"Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just as the plenary, just over six months ago, adopted by a large majority the report from the temporary committee on foot and mouth disease, so, today, we are stating our position on the proposal for a Council directive on the control of FMD."
"In so doing, we are coming to the end of a very important chapter, and I would like to take this opportunity of again, and very warmly, thanking all Members, as well as the secretariat and, most especially, the Commission for their excellent cooperation."
"Our special report, and the report now before us, are the fruit of the best kind of cooperation."
"Many of Parliament's demands have already been incorporated into the proposal that the Commission has now submitted, and so the various amendments we have tabled are about making the proposal more precise rather than giving it a new direction."
"As much for the avoidance of misunderstandings as for any other reason, I would like to re-emphasise the fact that we are not calling for any sort of general preventive vaccination of the sort that was customary prior to 1992, but for emergency vaccination, allowing the animals to live, to be the means of first resort when it comes to containing any outbreak of FMD."
"This is an important distinction, and it still needs to be maintained at certain points in the text."
"I would also like to emphasise that products derived from vaccinated animals are not in any way hazardous to human health, nor would they even have any effect on it."
"That much we know, and that is why it would be impossible to justify banning the marketing of products derived from animals vaccinated in the course of an outbreak."
"We know that there will be problems as regards trade with third states such as Japan and USA, but this can be dealt with by regionalisation, and the award of 'FMD-free' status six months after vaccination, rather than - as was the case a year ago - after twelve months, must be considered an essential contribution towards developing a new policy."
"It might be added, though, that we need to keep on working towards getting the OIE to lay down a three-month rule."
"This is the subject of an amendment tabled by Mr Böge and others, which I ask you to support."
"We must, however, vote against the Committee's Amendment No 32, which I do not believe takes adequate account of the present position in international law."
"The Greens' Amendment No 49 also needs to be rejected, as it would reduce the room for manoeuvre that we need."
"I do not want to go into the individual proposals in detail right now, but the incidence of fowlpest or chicken flu is now showing us how important it is to find a new direction for the control of zoonoses and fundamentally re-evaluate it."
"In the Netherlands, twenty-five million animals have already been slaughtered, and the disease has now appeared in Germany as well."
"As we demand in very clear terms in our report, we must eventually find a completely different way of dealing with epizootics, so that it is not trading and economic interests alone that determine what is done."
"The strategy must involve ethics just as much as it does economics."
"The risk of diseases spreading is, in part, made greater by intensive livestock farming and by international trade relations, and so vaccination policy needs to be thought through anew."
"Some viruses are highly deadly and so, in future, another approach will be called for."
"In its report, Parliament has very clearly outlined the economic and social consequences of a strategy failing to hit the mark."
"In the same way, we have to consider how, in future, we can recoup the costs, whether by way of national funds or in conjunction with a European Epizootic Fund, and who is to be compensated - only those immediately affected, whose animals were slaughtered, or all those who sustained financial losses."
"This point has not yet been satisfactorily resolved."
"There is also the need for research, especially applied research, to be stepped up if we are to have improved vaccines, but, at the same time, prophylaxis must be maintained in businesses, in imports, and when transporting animals."
"This is more important than ever as a means of preventing pathogens or viruses from getting to the animals in the first place."
"It is our hope that the Council will, under the Greek Presidency, be able to come to an agreement that will do justice to the needs of the producers, that is, the farmers, the consumers, and also the animals."
"In these areas, the EU has competence and options available, which should be used to the full."
"We in this House have played our part, both in the committee and on the ground, by talking with the people affected in Great Britain and the Netherlands."
"I hope that the future will find us able to break through the vicious circle of killing and isolating."
"Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to begin by complimenting the rapporteur highly on the way in which he has cooperated with the various groups and also on the very commendable result."
"This demonstrates that he has understood the great unease felt at past outbreaks."
"He has produced a very good report in response to the Commissioner's legislative proposals."
"I should also like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Byrne for his speedy reaction to the own-initiative report of Parliament based on investigations we had carried out."
"He has adopted at least some points from this parliamentary report."
"This augurs well for good cooperation between the Commission and Parliament, in achieving, now and in the future, an effective approach to combating animal disease epidemics."
"At the same time, Mr President, I must say on behalf of my group that the parliamentary investigation has taught us just how shattering the outbreak of animal diseases can be."
"We conducted an investigation into the epidemics of foot and mouth disease."
"We saw the consequence for animals and humans alike but we also saw the secondary results."
"The health problems that are still occurring in places hit by foot and mouth, the huge economic loss but also people's distress and all its attendant problems demonstrate that we can no longer view these animal diseases as a technical question but must emphatically also look at the social consequences."
"It cannot be denied that the risks of infectious animal diseases are growing in a world where borders are becoming increasingly transparent and where there is ever more international trade."
"I need only make passing reference to the outbreak of SARS to indicate the degree of panic it can generate."
"We must be fully aware that, if we have opted for a non-vaccination policy, the risks of infectious animal diseases will increase."
"We want to keep animals outside, we want to see cows in the fields, and we want to see chickens and pigs ranging freely."
"That does mean, though, an increased risk."
"In addition there are also the international risks of more transport, more international trade."
"That means that we cannot leave the consequences solely at the door of the farmers but must as politicians reflect on how we can tackle these risks in future."
"In that respect, the Kreissl-Dörfler report is a good initial step."
"If there is a new outbreak we can then at least ensure that through a fundamental change of policy, perhaps also through vaccination, we can achieve a much more effective approach to and control of a number of epidemic animal diseases, in this case foot and mouth disease."
"Regarding that fundamental change of policy, namely the provision of more options for Member States, more options for the Commission and most definitely the use of vaccination to keep an outbreak in check, it is of the utmost importance to look at how we can subsequently control the secondary effects and their repercussions."
"There are a number of important questions."
"To begin with - and so far the Commission has not yet been totally clear about this - how are we to deal with those indirectly affected by future outbreaks?"
"Secondly, how can we ensure that there is a maximum market for products from the moment that prophylactic vaccination is used and the animals survive?"
"Naturally the legislation permits us to sell our products on the European market under certain conditions but as regards the supermarket chains we are left with question marks."
"How are we to deal with this?"
"What is our role as politicians in the process, and what is the role of the Commission?"
"A third question is, how can we ensure that these kinds of outbreaks are translated internationally in trade relations?"
"In that field I should point out that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has submitted an amendment - I tabled it on behalf of Mr Böge and a number of other members of our group, in which we call urgently on the Commission to look at what the rapporteur has said, namely that it is crucial that in the international field the length of export bans following an outbreak be reduced from six to three months."
"That is absolutely crucial to our approach in the European Union, and this approach can only be successful if, internationally too, we see the opportunity of reducing the period from six to three months."
"We urge the Commission to achieve this through negotiation. I should like to hear the Commissioner's response to this point."
"Mr President, I am glad that we have been able to take a step forward regarding the combating of foot and mouth disease."
"At the same time I say this with mixed feelings, now that in my own country, but also our neighbours, Germany and Belgium, the spectre of fowl pest has reared its head."
"Once again I appeal to the Commission to examine how we can take social responsibility for those major animal diseases, such as fowl pest, such as swine fever, and in this case foot and mouth, in order to arrive at a coherent policy."
"But, once again, the Group of the European People's Party is glad that we have managed to take a first step in relation to this foot and mouth dossier."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the FMD crisis has left deep scars."
"The culls have brought heartbreak to countless families."
"They have led to public indignation and rage, sometimes impotent rage at authorities and also rage at Europe, which blocked the vaccination of livestock."
"First of all, my sincere thanks to Mr Kreissl-Dörfler."
"Once again he has done an excellent job."
"After his report on the foot and mouth crisis he has worked hard to ensure that the list of recommendations that this House submitted last December has been incorporated into the Commission's proposal."
"Meanwhile we are engaged in a legislative process."
"I believe that the proposal and the proposed amendments are all in all an acceptable response to the public outcry on the mass culling of livestock."
"I am in favour of the use of prophylactic emergency vaccinations, with animals being kept alive until slaughtered for consumption."
"I should like to stress two important points in the form of questions to the Commission and would like you to respond in a moment."
"The first concerns political responsibility."
"The foot and mouth crisis of 2001 heralded the political landslide of 2002."
"We must at any rate teach politicians a lesson too."
"Confidence in politics suffered a severe dent."
"One important reason was that political responsibility proved anything but transparent."
"Who was responsible for the no-vaccination policy - the government, the EU or the International Bureau for Infectious Diseases?"
"Ministers pointed to the national governments and to the Bureau in Paris."
"For the ordinary citizen it was a complex structure of responsibilities and that led to the image of politicians, who while they were prepared to take a public stand, subsequently preferred to hide behind others."
"Politicians who take no responsibility deprive politics of its credibility."
"This buck-passing game has backfired badly on Europe."
"The hundreds of angry letters and e-mails were signals of the human and institutional tragedy."
"A future outbreak of foot and mouth must not lead to the mass slaughter of healthy livestock."
"We must make a massive effort to ensure this in the period ahead."
"This requires a foot and mouth policy in which there is a clear apportionment of responsibilities, regional, national, European and international and with the parliaments also involved."
"Our aim must be a foot and mouth policy that is not anonymous."
"Responsibilities for choices and compliance must be clearly established."
"It is our task to communicate on this matter."
"In an attempt to achieve such clarity, I should like to ask the Commissioner to make explicit once again here this evening where precisely the responsibility lies."
"Is it true that a Member State has the option of using prophylactic emergency vaccination and subsequently of keeping the vaccinated animals alive?"
"Is it true that animal products from vaccinated livestock can be sold without any problem?"
"This brings me to the second point, namely the marketing of animal products from vaccinated livestock."
"At the moment that a Member State decides to use prophylactic emergency vaccination and to keep the animals alive, it must be possible to sell the products."
"This requires a minimum of two things; supermarkets to sell the products and consumers to buy them."
"How does the Commission plan to create the correct boundary conditions in collaboration with Member States?"
"It cannot, of course, be the intention to keep vaccinated animals alive and then to discover that there is no market for them."
"That would surely ultimately lead to the culling of vaccinated animals."
"I should like to hear your answer to both these questions."
"Mr President, at the height of the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party formulated three principles: how can we prevent such outbreaks from recurring, what are we to do if there is another outbreak and how can we pay for such outbreaks in future?"
"On the first point: better border controls."
"We have heard that the Commission has issued new guidelines."
"I have paid particular attention when arriving back in Europe from time to time from another continent."
"To be honest, despite the newly announced measures I have not yet been able to detect much change."
"What exactly were the new measures?"
"What are we to do if there is another outbreak?"
"We took the view that the mass culling of healthy stock is not acceptable in future, which is why we fully support the conclusions of the report that prophylactic vaccination must be used."
"We went even further."
"In 2001 we submitted an amendment to the budget to ensure that the Commission was able to carry out research into better vaccines, marker vaccines against foot and mouth disease."
"We did not limit ourselves to foot and mouth disease by the way."
"It could extend to all infectious animal diseases."
"It is particularly disappointing to note that as of now, some two years after the amendment was submitted and carried, the Commission has still not begun this research."
"We are constantly given different explanations."
"It will happen."
"But it still has not happened."
"I should like to know why."
"Another point: what is to be done with the products of vaccinated animals?"
"That strikes me as a huge problem."
"This has already been said by Mrs Corbey and by Mr Maat."
"The probability is that it will be more difficult to sell the products of those vaccinated animals, and that it will be at a reduced price."
"Will that also be covered by future compensation schemes, yes or no?"
"What is the Commission proposing to do in this respect?"
"Third point: how are we to pay for such outbreaks in future?"
"In that respect we were lucky with the outbreak in 2001."
"There was sufficiency leeway in the agriculture budget."
"If calculations are correct there is considerably less slack in the agriculture budget."
"The euro is strong against the dollar and there will be very little leeway."
"If there were a new outbreak now, how would we pay for it?"
"This was in fact why the Liberal Group submitted an amendment in 2001 calling for studies to be carried out in to insurance systems."
"In that respect the Commission did do its work."
"At the end of May we shall have a report on the subject."
"As rapporteur for the 2004 budget I myself made it one of my priorities."
"It is not acceptable that we should always leave the financing of such outbreaks to chance, according to whether there is money available or not."
"It must be put on a sound financial footing."
"I hope to be able to work that out in future in consultation with the Commission."
"The point about six months and three months is also essential for us and I therefore recommend that the plenary should accept the amendment of the Liberal and Christian Democrat groups on this."
"Mr President, the history of foot and mouth disease in Europe can be traced back over many years, but the great catastrophe began in the South of England on 21 February 2001."
"Although it had been known for decades what damage could be caused by the uncontrolled outbreak of a disease, the opportunity for effective defence against the epidemic was not taken."
"The courses of action set in motion in the Member States affected were unable to prevent the spread of the virus."
"The state of emergency that was then announced in various regions of the EU left both the rural and urban public equally enraged."
"Rural areas began to resemble high-security blocks, and a sort of state of emergency was the order of the day on the farms that had been affected."
"At this time, there was no shortage of ideas as to who was to blame."
"The EU's ban on vaccination, which adhered to the principle that, if even only one animal was vaccinated, the whole country was declared to be infected with FMD, met with little approval on the part of the public, and even well-informed officials demanded at the time the use of what are termed marker vaccines in order to prevent the disease from becoming more widespread."
"Many members of the public saw the containment of foot and mouth disease by means of the open burning of animal cadavers as demonstrating complete disregard for animals' dignity, and nor did the bottom line add up in economic terms."
"By doing justice to this principle, the report on the control of foot and mouth disease draws the right conclusions from the calamity of 2001, and has, moreover, been able to confirm the results produced by the work of the committee of investigation."
"This is an encouragement to the same course of action in other cases, such as that of fowlpest, a constantly-recurrent disease that spreads from one country to its neighbours, one of the main problems with which is the large number of contacts across frontiers."
"Then - if you go by what the press says - there is the great danger of fowlpest, like foot and mouth disease, becoming even worse than a worst-case scenario."
"The principle of 'killing rather than vaccination' or rather its opposite, should, in the EU, apply to all animal species."
"It would be worth Parliament's time and effort to investigate that more closely, examining, for example, whether the German ordinance to prevent the spreading of classic fowlpest is in line with what is actually known and whether all species should be included in the text."
"It would also be possible to re-examine how cross-border cooperation is actually organised."
"As far as FMD is concerned, all is quiet in the candidate countries, but I would like to take this opportunity to observe that this state of affairs can change rapidly."
"Any and every misjudgment in the area of controlling zoonoses and the early diagnosis of them has economic and social consequences."
"The report was quite right in stating what had to be done, and the work has been a support."
"I endorse the report and the proposals it makes; above all, I endorse those amendments that have to do with the protection of the fundamental right to property, and which lead the report to emphatically hold fast to some sort of compensation arrangement for those affected."
"I also endorse those amendments that seek to increase the freedom of action of veterinarians and the steering bodies in the Member States."
"In so far as the Member States' responsibilities will change at all, they will increase, as the decision as to which epidemic strategy is to be applied, and when, is to become a matter for the country in question, and rightly so."
"This does not discharge those who keep animals from their obligation of cleanliness and good order."
"Criminal activity in border areas involving the trade in animals belongs in another law, but the report sets out the right approach to this, too."
"Mr President, while we are considering this evening how to combat FMD in future, animals and farmers are being hit by the next infectious animal disease, fowl pest."
"The EU's animal disease policy requires re-evaluation."
"No one, in 1991, was aware of the possible consequences of instituting the policy of non-vaccination."
"Since then we have learned the hard way."
"Vaccination could have prevented the destruction of millions of healthy animals."
"If economic interests are paramount, mankind loses its dignity and creation its protection."
"I am glad that the Committee on Agriculture has adopted our amendment, in which we make an urgent plea for the observance of ethical principles in combating animal disease."
"In the new directive set out by the Commission, concern for creation still receives scant attention."
"I did not dare to count on preventive vaccination."
"I had, though, hoped that 'emergency vaccination and retention of stock' would be the first option in the event of an outbreak."
"The Commission continues to opt for culling and at the very most extends the possibilities to emergency vaccination."
"I there fore support the amendments making emergency vaccination the first option in combating the disease."
"Moreover, such emergency vaccination and keeping animals alive must be given a fair chance."
"Products of vaccinated animals are no less safe than those of non-vaccinated animals."
"Labelling these products, however, does create such an impression."
"And that in spite of the fact that, for years prior to 1991, these products were eaten by consumers in my country and elsewhere."
"In addition we must prevent Member States having to opt for culling on the basis of the financial contribution made by Brussels to combating the disease."
"Emergency vaccination costs the European Union less money, while a Member State is subsequently forced to incur costs to market the products."
"The savings created by vaccination should be used to compensate for these incidental costs."
"The existence of various serotypes of the FMD virus is an argument against preventive vaccination."
"At the same time it is an extra stimulus for research into the development of FMD vaccines."
"This makes preventive vaccination the option for the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, the key element in this debate today on foot and mouth disease is the constraints imposed by the OIE with regard to the trade sanctions inflicted on countries that no longer enjoy 'foot and mouth disease free' status."
"It is these rules that make this disease so terrifying for breeders because of the huge economic losses they cause."
"We must remember that the foot and mouth that affects livestock is not dangerous to man."
"It is not a public health problem."
"I therefore endorse our rapporteur's proposal in Amendment No 5 to recital 14 to the effect that the Member States should submit proposals to the OIE to modify trade sanctions in these situations."
"To be more precise, this change to the OIE rules must take two forms."
"Firstly, consideration must be given to the progress made on vaccines - marker vaccines, which make it possible to distinguish a vaccinated animal from an infected animal, and more general vaccines - and we must remember that products from vaccinated animals - dairy or meat - pose no danger to human health nor any risk of contagion."
"Therefore, there is no longer any reason to discriminate against these products or the countries where they are available."
"This change to the rules will also make it possible to reconsider the problem of preventive vaccination, which should be authorised by the Member States in cases where, for their own reasons, the breeders so desire."
"I am thinking in particular of animals with a high genetic value, breeding animals and rare breeds that are important for biodiversity."
"Secondly, Member States must be allowed to regionalise their breeding areas, thereby ensuring that a case of foot and mouth in Alsace - speaking hypothetically of course - does not prevent Brittany from exporting its excellent animal produce."
"Finally, and I am sorry that this point that I raised during the work of our Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease was not taken up by the rapporteur, we must not lose sight of the fact that certain changes in European agriculture, which have been facilitated by shifts in a certain CAP, are in themselves risk factors for the spread of diseases."
"I am referring to the increase in the size of farms, excessive intensification, the spread of enclosed breeding, the specialisation of regions and the transporting of animals over long distances: all of these factors, which combine to create very high animal densities, increase the risk."
"At a time, Mr President, when Parliament will have to state its position on the mid-term review of the CAP, we must endeavour to remedy these shifts rather than amplify them by giving priority to human-sized farms, extensive breeding in the least favoured regions, the local integration of activities and local abattoirs; in short, agriculture with a human face."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish firstly to say to the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, that I have rarely been involved in work on a report that has been handled as diligently and fairly as Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has handled this report."
"It is simply admirable, and I want to say thank you."
"At the same time, I would draw attention to the fact that, by now abandoning the non-vaccination policy, we are creating changes that will be very significant for those countries that export extensively to third countries."
"I want at the same time to say that foot and mouth disease is so infectious that anyone who believes that all the problems are solved merely by opening the way for vaccination and who is also sure of being able in future to contain a future outbreak of the disease will have to think again, for that is not the way foot and mouth disease works."
"I therefore choose to go on believing that it is the non-vaccination policy that we shall continue to work towards, and I acknowledge that the situation will meanwhile be one in which we shall use vaccine, as we did for example in the Netherlands, under the very proficient administration of the Dutch."
"Ring vaccination did prove effective as a way of containing the disease."
"In that connection, it is also important for me to support what was said by my colleague in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, Mr Mulder, namely that it is important for the vaccinated animals not to remain in the food chain but to be removed from it."
"That is not something for which there appears to be a majority right now, but it must be remembered in this regard that the vaccinated animals are of course disease carriers, and, given that fact, it would be a disaster if any of these animals were to pass on the disease."
"I should also like to point out that there can be no question of imagining, as is done for example in Amendment No 11, that milk and meat from vaccinated animals can be sold freely throughout the EU."
"In this area, we must be very clear in demanding regionalisation so that, if such milk and meat is to be sold, it is within, and not across, national borders."
"Although I am aware that this is not Commissioner Byrne's area, I shall again draw attention to the fact that there is a need for export agreements, particularly with the Americans, so that we contain the losses there might be in connection with a future epidemic of foot and mouth disease and, especially, in connection with possible vaccination. It would not of course be of help to anyone if, instead of exporting fresh produce to third countries, we were to close the doors, with the result that these products were to end up on the European market at sharply falling prices."
"That is not of course what farmers need in this situation. There is also a real need for the Commission to undertake serious regionalisation and to conclude agreements with the Americans."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Commissioner Byrne for the commitment he has shown to the work of the parliamentary Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth and, indeed, for ensuring that the main findings of our report have featured prominently in the Commission's directive."
"I also thank Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for working so tirelessly on the matter since day one."
"To have reached this final stage is a positive advertisement for the European Parliament."
"When the temporary committee visited regions affected by this terrible disease, including my own country of Wales, we were told by people how grateful they were that the European Parliament had set up this inquiry as they had no other way of voicing their grievances within their own Member States."
"This directive makes several valuable recommendations relating to the tightening of import controls - which has already been mentioned - setting contingency plans, establishing expert groups and moving emergency vaccination to the forefront of disease control, in line with the welcome changes made to international trade rules."
"Central to the UK Government's mishandling of the 2001 crisis was its lack of a clear-cut policy on whether and when vaccination should have been used."
"This led to the unacceptable continuous culling, which was based on flawed scientific evidence, and the blinkered decision to reject vaccination."
"In the event of future outbreaks, slaughtering should be limited to infected premises, based on sound laboratory tests."
"We owe it to our rural communities everywhere to learn the lessons of 2001."
"Mr President, there are situations in which emergency vaccination is very sensible, but there is no reason for causing difficulties in terms of exports."
"The problem arises due to the fact that the veterinary borders have been removed in connection with the introduction of the internal market."
"The EU has become a single veterinary zone."
"Denmark has lost its independent veterinary status."
"Understandably enough, the United States and Japan also regard the EU as a single country."
"They close the door to the import of pork from throughout the EU if there has been vaccination against foot and mouth disease in one location in the EU."
"Each year, the EU exports approximately 1.5 million tons of pork at a value of EUR 4 000 million."
"Of this, Denmark alone is responsible for 600 000 to 700 000 tons. If the exports were instead to be transferred to the EU's internal market, this would mean an increase approaching 10% in the supply of pork."
"This would lead to a total collapse of the market throughout the EU."
"The Commission should, from the beginning, have taken account of the risk of third countries' introducing trade restrictions."
"The Commission has not remotely taken on board this loss of exports that occurs if no advance measures are taken regarding third countries' acceptance of exports."
"It must of course be possible to change the vaccination strategy, partly so that what are otherwise good intentions are not pursued at the expense of the EU's absolutely vital export interests."
"I must therefore call upon the Commission to ensure it takes account of all the factors - including those relating to trade - in evaluating what rules should apply in future."
"There is a lot to suggest that veterinary regionalisation should be introduced, involving a kind of 'export pocket' free from vaccinated animals, from which exports could be made even if there were foot and mouth disease outbreaks elsewhere in the EU, with corresponding vaccination against the disease."
"Finally, Commissioner, do you intend to comply with my requests?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I really do not want to start without thanking our rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, for the truly outstanding work he has done with this report, but, today, I want also to thank Mrs Redondo, who chaired the committee on foot and mouth disease and who managed it with a great deal of circumspection."
"Fundamentally, I believe, both the Commission proposal for a directive and this report are to be welcomed."
"It is fortunate that the proposal submitted by the Commission takes on board most of the demands made by Parliament's committee on foot and mouth disease, which, on 17 December 2002, adopted a resolution calling for the revision of the European Union's existing policy on the control and prevention of foot and mouth disease."
"As the contributions to today's debate make clear, the next epidemic is already rampant in Europe, and I believe that it really is five minutes to midnight when it comes to our changing the European Union's policy, for we have to avoid in future any epidemic spreading and becoming the tragedy that we saw in Great Britain in 2001."
"We are not talking here only in terms of the grave financial losses sustained by farmers, especially in the upstream and downstream sectors, or about the damage to rural areas and the profound public disquiet; this is, rather, an image issue for European farmers such as ourselves and for the agricultural policy as a whole."
"One important point that has been taken on board is the retention of the ban on prophylactic vaccination, which strikes me as pointless until such time as there is a vaccine that covers all seven serotypes and the 80 subtypes within them."
"There is a need for research into this to be extended and improved."
"A further, and decisive, point is that the importance of emergency vaccination is recognised, so that it is no longer seen as a last resort."
"In conclusion, it has to be said that the disease, which spread to such an immense extent in Great Britain that we all still shudder to recall it, could have been prevented."
"All that was needed was for appropriate control measures to be taken and for the existing vaccination requirements to be adhered to in the Member State in question."
"The one thing that has become perfectly clear is that the Member States really do have to discharge the responsibilities placed on them by the Treaties."
"I trust that we have learned our lessons from the past in order to be able, next time, to act with more responsibility and coordination."
"Never again must there be a catastrophe - for a catastrophe is what it was - of these dimensions."
"Mr President, I wish to join the others in thanking the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, for an excellent job well done."
"It is one of the few areas in which I have noticed that all political groups in this House had very little difference at the end of the day, and certainly our mission was exactly the same."
"I thank him and colleagues who were on the temporary committee for the first year."
"I should like to thank Mr Sturdy, Mr Parish and my UK colleagues who were at the forefront in promoting the original establishment of the temporary committee, for reasons that will be obvious."
"It is not often that I agree fully with my Northern Ireland colleague, Mr Paisley."
"However, on this issue we would find very little to differ on, and I welcome his comments here this evening."
"The outbreak of FMD in the European Union in 2001 was a disaster not only for agriculture but also for many related enterprises and organisations."
"The outbreak demonstrated without question that the European Union's FMD risk-management policy, and the risk assessment on which that was based, needed to be reviewed."
"Farmers, vets and politicians all shared the great concern of the general public over the death and destruction of millions of animals, of which many, if not most, were not infected with the disease."
"There was huge psychological damage, in particular to farmers and their families when they had to depopulate or destroy their animals."
"It is not just in the UK - the epicentre of the outbreak - but even in the Cooley Peninsula in Ireland, which had to be depopulated that to this day the psychological damage to the families concerned is absolutely immense."
"While I do not support the return to routine or preventive vaccination, a review of vaccination policy is very appropriate, especially the use of emergency or fire-break vaccination to control the spread of an outbreak."
"Further discussion with the OIE, the World Organisation for Animal Health, is urgently necessary to ensure that an infected country can regain its FMD-free status as soon as possible."
"After the last case and after the slaughter of the last vaccinated animal it is necessary to regain FMD status."
"In contrast to a colleague, Mr Busk, who has just spoken, I do not have problems with vaccinated animals entering the food chain."
"However, as long as the OIE has concerns about exporting such animals for the food chain, we have to get in line."
"Therefore, we need our scientists to get their heads together on this and resolve it."
"FMD-vaccinated animals are not infectious when they get into the food chain."
"We already vaccinate our cattle for a whole array of diseases and consume them daily."
"Therefore we need to become rational in our approach to this particular issue."
"Marker vaccines to distinguish vaccinated animals from animals carrying the virus will have a major role to play in this area in the future."
"I would like to make a special plea to ensure that Member States' veterinary services are properly resourced."
"With serious financial losses now for many years in livestock enterprises, we cannot take for granted any longer the existence of rural large-animal veterinary practices, especially in our remote areas, let alone the development of urgently needed herd-health surveillance programmes involving routine visits by practising vets."
"The vet is in the front line of surveillance for indigenous and exotic diseases."
"The one thing we can be sure of is not whether there is another outbreak of an exotic disease in the EU, but when."
"I would also like to thank the Commission for acceding to my plea for a special protocol for non-susceptible animals, in particular equidae."
"I refer to Annex VI on the restrictions on the movement of equidae in this area."
"A few amendments were accepted at committee and I would urge the Commission to indicate that it would take them on board."
"An emergency must be documented by a veterinary surgeon on call 24 hours per day, 7 days a week."
"For the equestrian and racing industries, Saturday, Sunday and bank holiday Mondays must be covered for the movement of animals for breeding or for emergency operations or for competition purposes - because the horse does not carry, it is not susceptible."
"The transport must be authorised by the competent authorities, but they must be contactable 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."
"An on-call official veterinarian must be informed about the route prior to the departure of any horse transported in dedicated transport in an outbreak."
"I declare an interest in the equestrian area."
"I thank the Commission and the authorities concerned for including for the first time a protocol in an FMD contingency plan for a non-susceptible species."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0066/2003) by Mrs Ferrer, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on capacity-building in the developing countries (2002/2157(INI))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am sorry to have to discuss this report this evening, at this late hour, when it was initially scheduled for Thursday, which could have enhanced this debate on development cooperation."
"Unfortunately, however, this is the way things are."
"Commissioner, the experience acquired over the past few decades in the field of development cooperation and the lack of significant results in this field have highlighted the need for a change in the focus of development policies, in order to improve the effectiveness of aid, reduce the chasm between rich and poor countries and thus fulfil the objectives of sustainable development that we have set for ourselves."
"There are certainly many and varied factors preventing the poorest countries from being able to board the development train and win the battle to eradicate poverty: external debt, first and foremost, the great shame hanging over developing countries, the fratricidal wars that devastate so many poor countries, the AIDS pandemic, corruption at every level of public life, but this failure can also be explained by the use of foreign models and the fact that development objectives have in the past been set without the participation of those receiving aid."
"We should not be surprised, therefore, that the idea of capacity-building as an essential factor in improving the results of development policies has been gaining ground, in particular since the Rio Declaration of 1992, which recognises the fact that a country's ability to follow the path of sustainable development is largely determined by the capacity of its people and institutions."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation, which fully agrees with this principle, therefore organised a public hearing a few months ago on capacity-building and then agreed that a report should be drawn up on the subject, for which I was given responsibility as rapporteur."
"It should be noted that this report was unanimously approved, since it was unanimous in committee that capacity-building should constitute a fundamental element in development cooperation, essential to ensuring effective aid."
"In order better to understand the scope of the proposals contained in the report, I believe it should be specified that, in my eyes, capacity-building is first and foremost a new form of understanding and, above all, implementing development cooperation policy which requires a long-term global strategy that is individually tailored for the various players according to the different environments represented by their society."
"This strategy should aim to improve skills and the conditions required for a country to be able to improve its levels of economic and social growth."
"All this should take place in support of national efforts to be carried out by each country for itself based on the plan drawn up by each country according to their specific interests and needs along the lines of what is being done, in particular, with strategy documents for each country."
"The European Union and its Member States - although not only them, but all international donors - should therefore review their cooperation methods and change the focus of their development policies so that capacity-building, as a participative process based on appropriation, constitutes the basis for the policy, with the aim of enabling individuals, as well as bodies within civil society, to develop their potential and the skills that should allow them to achieve the development objectives that they themselves must also be in a position to determine."
"We should provide them with the means - in a word - to play a leading role in their own development, to which they have a right."
"In other words, help them to improve their institutional capacities and achieve the level of training that is necessary in order to open the door to development."
"We should also help them to diversify and improve production capacity, develop infrastructures and the macroeconomic framework required to attract investment, provide them with technical assistance to increase trade capacity so that they can integrate world trade and thus share in the profits it generates."
"A development cooperation policy focused along these lines constitutes the most suitable instrument for progress to be made towards eradicating poverty and achieving fair, sustainable development for all."
"That, Commissioner, is why there is a need - I would say an imperative - for a Commission communication in this regard, to instigate action in the field of development aid from the European Union and its Member States and also the various formulas contained in the motion for a resolution on which we are to vote."
"For it is only by means of these policies, by providing the necessary means for capacity-building, that we shall be able to put an end to the injustice which means that 20% of the world's population enjoys 80% of the world's wealth, while 80% are deprived of the right to live in the dignity that is the inalienable right of each individual."
"Mr President, capacity-building in developing countries is one of the new concepts underpinning the current cooperation policy, based on the appropriation of development processes by societies receiving aid."
"It is an endogenic process, by means of which a society increases its social capital, through the activities of individuals, organisations and institutions, in order to carry out its duties and set and achieve its objectives in every field."
"It is therefore a very broad concept, which has been effectively summarised in the report we are discussing today, for which I would like to congratulate Mrs Ferrer. However, although capacity-building in the developing countries should affect all aspects of development, it must be based on essential capacities, which, in the opinion of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, are, on the one hand, organising civil society and strengthening democratic institutions, and, on the other, building individual capacity through education."
"All this should of course take place through certain minimum development requirements that guarantee the survival of the people."
"This means compliance with certain minimum basic health standards."
"The organisation of civil society refers to the structure of citizenship and citizen participation in social and decision-making processes."
"All this should take place within the context of an endogenic dynamic and external aid, as we have requested of the Commission, should therefore be devoted to strengthening basic organisations, urban and rural citizens' associations, local NGOs and traditional social institutions, more than to direct aid to the budgets of the countries receiving aid."
"This evening the Commissioner has recognised that this report is timely and necessary and that it effectively details the capacity-building that must take place for development."
"Strengthening democratic institutions is one of the matters pending cooperation in general and Community cooperation in particular."
"Democracy goes far beyond periodic elections and requires the implementation of flexible participation and dialogue mechanisms between citizens and institutions, as well as their democratisation, based on the concepts of good governance, transparency and combating corruption."
"Individual capacity-building through education is the ultimate capacity-building system."
"The Socialist Group considers education to be a sine qua non condition for development and reducing poverty, as we pointed out in the Community budget."
"With this own-initiative report, the European Parliament calls on the Commission to join large aid organisations in including capacity-building among the general elements of its cooperation policy."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Ferrer once again, as well as all the groups who contributed, with their amendments, to ensuring that this report contains guidelines for updating and improving the Community development cooperation policy."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Junker."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is report (A5-0126/2003) by Mr Van den Berg, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on education and training in the context of poverty reduction in developing countries (COM(2002) 116 - C5-0333/2002 - 2002/2177(COS))."
"Mr President, we feel the Commission Communication is highly relevant and Mr van den Berg's report adds certain contributions that enrich the original text."
"He has shown flexibility by accepting the majority of the amendments tabled, and, on behalf of my parliamentary group, I would like to say that we shall vote for the report."
"In fact, many fora and macroconferences have already been held in relation to the need to increase efforts to eradicate poverty, which is undoubtedly the most serious problem we face."
"It is something of a coincidence that, with the resources now available, it will not be possible to achieve the objectives set for 2015."
"It is good, however, that, within our limited means, we are focusing our attention on health and education, which are so closely linked and interdependent."
"It has been clearly shown that health and education, education and health, are the best policies for development, that they enable millions of human beings to escape poverty."
"It is true that some progress is being made, as stated by the rapporteur."
"In Africa, for example, 60% of children today attend school, which means that 40% are still not attending."
"In other words, 45 million children are condemned to illiteracy and poverty, probably for life."
"New difficulties have arisen in some countries."
"The tragedy of child soldiers means that, in some West African countries, mothers prevent their sons from attending school for fear that they will be kidnapped and not return home, as we have seen recently, last week, in Ivory Coast, in a report by various agencies and other NGOs present on the ground."
"The problems of gender segregation are still causing an unsustainable situation in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries."
"In Latin America investment in education has dropped alarmingly over the past few years of crisis throughout the region, and this affects ethnic minorities in particular, as the Commissioner has pointed out today, in Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, but also in countries such as Argentina, which until now had an excellent education system but is now moving backwards."
"By attending school, both boys and girls can and should receive a basic education that contributes to improving health, not just in relation to HIV and the ways in which it is transmitted - as the rapporteur reminds us - which, although it is a serious problem, is no more serious than other problems that could be alleviated more cheaply."
"This is the case of food hygiene, to cite just one example."
"I feel it is particularly necessary for international financial organisations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to review their criteria and make them more flexible in order to promote free, universal education."
"That is now one of the priorities we must address and try to achieve some progress in this specific area."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since I was the draftsman of the opinion of the committee on women's rights and equal opportunities on this report, I should like first of all to offer my sincere thanks to Mr van den Berg for his excellent work and of course for having adopted portions of our committee's recommendations."
"So what is the situation?"
"We have a good report, we have a good rapporteur, we have a highly-motivated Commissioner here among us, and many committed people in the field, overseas aid workers, and educationalists."
"Yet there are a number of infuriating aspects, because everything takes so long."
"The clock is ticking and yet I see so many organisations in the field that have to beg in order to be able to build schools and pay teachers."
"We have a long road ahead of us."
"The right to education and access to education are often empty words in developing countries."
"That is right: there are still 113 million children who do not attend school and most of them are girls, as Mr van den Berg has already said."
"They have to help with the housework, they have to contribute to the daily provision of food for the whole family, they have to look after the infants, they have to sell any leftovers at market and they have to fetch drinking water."
"That means that they have no time to devote to themselves."
"I can therefore wholeheartedly endorse the conclusions of this report, namely that education is the key to combating poverty."
"Only through education can a country develop, only through an adequately educated population can a country progress."
"Give a girl or a woman education and you are educating the whole family."
"We also all know that equal opportunities for women are not only achieved by changing legislation and social conditions."
"No!"
"It happens through education."
"Participation of women in all sectors of society and the achievement of general social, cultural and economic progress begin with reasonable qualitative and quantitative education."
"We have already seen this in Europe."
"Only when women were given reasonable schooling and access to education did emancipation take off in all sectors of society, including politics."
"But it is a long road."
"As the rapporteur rightly says in the notes to his report, educated women have more opportunities for improving the economic situation of themselves and their family, and even down to their choice of husband."
"The individual personal development of women also offers more protection against exploitation in all its forms, including prostitution, forced or otherwise, and human trafficking, particularly trafficking in women and children."
"I have, despite this, three further observations."
"The time frame indicated in this report is in my view somewhat unclear."
"The financial consequences are not properly set out."
"And I therefore hope that the Commission, jointly with the Member States, will set to work in a coordinated way to achieve the objectives contained in the statement of the Commission."
"Secondly the problem of AIDS, and finally, in conclusion, education, which as Commissioner Nielson said at the outset, must be adapted to the local culture."
"Mr President, tackling the education crisis is one of the most effective means we have at our disposal for breaking the cycle of poverty and achieving the 2015 human development targets."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation and our rapporteur, Mr van den Berg, therefore deserve thanks for a report that demonstrates a thorough knowledge of the subject and genuine concern."
"Now it appears that the 2015 target for universal primary education remains a long way off."
"That is the single factor which is significantly undermining all the other work that is being done in the world to reduce poverty."
"The financing needed is EUR 8 billion per year."
"It is a lot, but not impossible, in order that everyone's right to education, as stated in the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights more than 50 years ago, might come about."
"The rapporteur quite rightly mentions that the Commission must participate in the World Bank's 'Education for all - Fast track' programme."
"Likewise, he warns the EU, and with good reason, not to agree to schooling being included as a service in the WTO's General Agreement on Trade and Services."
"Primary education must be regarded as being independent of free-market rules and productivity criteria."
"We must trust in the notion that raising standards of education and the literacy rate is the best thing global trade can hope for."
"That is why the G8 countries must also be reminded of their promise to finance the Fast Track Initiative."
"My own experience of cooperation development work reinforces my conviction that it is especially necessary to invest in girls' education."
"That is the key to development."
"That way we can combat excessive population growth, as an educated woman will have fewer children."
"Women's education is also a way out of the vicious circle, where, for example, many Asian women and girls find themselves: in mortal danger from the womb to the grave, with discrimination starting even before birth and continuing all their life."
"Where a girl is a liability and a burden on the family only a determined shift in attitudes and the commencement of education opportunities will ensure there is any change."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking my colleague Mr van den Berg most warmly for his splendid report and, of course, also for his other activities, such as education for all."
"As is set out in this report, the proportion of people who are illiterate is depressingly high in many countries, particularly in Africa, where there are few opportunities, especially in sparsely-populated areas."
"As it would, in desert or other uninhabited areas, be unrealistic to build a large number of schools near to where people live, we have to take a good look at other solutions to reduce the educational deficit. This is one of the things Mr van den Berg takes up in his report, proposing, for example, the setting-up of mobile schools, which are of particular importance in providing basic education."
"In this context too, though, I will come back to the subject of modern information and communication technologies, the use of which enables distances to be overcome, the digital gap to be crossed, and education to become more widespread."
"It is certain, though, that in the long term, the most important mass medium is radio, which could - and should - be even more widely used as a means of providing education than it has been so far."
"The example of what is done in the Australian outback can certainly not be followed exactly in African countries, but is one from which one can learn, and it too must form part of any strategy for education."
"I am glad that I do not have to point out the need to take especial account of girls and women in all educational endeavours."
"In this report, at any rate, this has become a generally accepted fact."
"It is not, however, generally known that education - particularly basic education - conducted in the predominant regional languages results in a marked increase in the desire for education and reduces parents' misgivings about sending their children to school."
"This is where we must help with the investment in appropriate teaching material, play our part in promoting the education of teachers and contributing to the dissemination of knowledge that relates to local interests and is therefore an indispensable necessity in terms of raising the consciousness of civil society."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for your Communication and congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work concerning this fundamental issue of education and training in the context of reducing poverty."
"This is not the first time Parliament has addressed this matter and I do not think it will be the last, and not only because for many of us - and for me, of course - achieving obligatory, free, high-quality universal education for all is the absolute priority of development cooperation."
"I said that we will continue to talk about it because we are far from being able to achieve the objectives set in Dakar within the anticipated timescale, and we must therefore continue to be vigilant so that there are no further delays and, if possible, to ensure that at least the European Union and the Member States turn the commitments they have made into reality, into practical action, and that they decide not just to give the appearance of making education the priority in development, but really make it a priority, if we genuinely want a fairer society, in which each individual has the same choices and opportunities."
"In a moment we shall discuss the report for which I am rapporteur, on capacity-building and its key role in improving the effectiveness of development aid."
"How, though, can we think of capacity-building if 113 million children have never been to school and 150 million have not completed primary education, as the rapporteur points out in his report?"
"For this reason, I can but agree with the measures proposed to give education its rightful place in development cooperation policy and overcome the obstacles that prevent so many boys and girls from having access to education and, with it, the right to a better life."
"In conclusion, I would like to ask the rapporteur to accept the amendment I tabled together with Mr Corrie, on behalf of the PPE-DE, requesting recognition for the State's obligation to guarantee the right to education and the role that the private sector can play in making the universal right to education, which sadly is currently the most violated right, a reality."
"Mr President, education is a crucial weapon in the fight against poverty."
"This might be common sense, but it is also a choice in terms of development strategies."
"It is a question of priorities."
"Some people claim that education is an optional extra and that what is really needed is work, even low paid work requiring no qualifications."
"I believe that the low cost option tends to create perverse self-perpetuating mechanisms and that education is not an optional extra."
"Education and training involve an effort to provide opportunities to all individuals, in order to give the greatest number of people the ability to form part of society and to participate in shaping that society."
"The European Union has distinguished itself internationally for its adherence to this approach, both in Europe and with regard to those countries whose development we support."
"We therefore welcome the Commission communication, the content of which fully warrants Parliament's support. We also congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work."
"I simply wish to emphasise some points: the importance of the balance between quality and quantity in education, with a decisive commitment to eradicating illiteracy; the importance of involving local actors in the programmes we support, strengthening the practice of decentralised cooperation; a commitment to achieving gender balance - the education and vocational training of girls and women not only have a direct impact on the economy, but also in the medium term, on changing minds and even on liberating societies; the commitment to protecting education, even in times of conflict and following conflicts and the priority to normalise and improve education and training."
"I would also add the need for further efforts with regard to training for the purpose of reintegrating ex-combatants."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commission's Communication, but above all I would like to congratulate Mr van den Berg on his excellent report, which I believe contains elements and measures that are essential in this task."
"Mr President, 65 million girls in the world are deprived of their right to education and we are doing very little to resolve this situation."
"The framework presented by the Commission, as stated by Mr van den Berg, contains very few proposals for action that specifically promote education for girls."
"This in itself is serious, but it is even more serious if we take into account the fact that babies whose mothers have not had access to education are twice as likely to suffer from malnutrition and die before the age of five than those whose mothers have completed primary education."
"Just one or two years of school for the mother reduce the infant death rate by 15%."
"The education of mothers is far more effective in reducing malnutrition than any other measure, including the availability of food."
"We know that women are a determining factor in development: better-trained women mean a higher level of development for their societies."
"The strategy to combat poverty and, of course, the fight against AIDS can only be successful if specific emphasis is placed on education for girls."
"Therefore, and because it is their fundamental right, education must be our priority: high-quality, obligatory, general, public, primary education lasting at least six years."
"Education - I repeat - must be our priority."
"That is the reason why I shall use my final seconds of speaking time to plead the case, as the rapporteur has done, against including education in the general agreement on trade and services at the next WTO negotiations."
"The right of boys and girls to education cannot be subject to market laws."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is oral question (B5-0092/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the protection of audio-visual performers."
"A very good evening to you, Mr President, at this late hour, shortly before midnight, when we few are together."
"I would just like to play a question and answer game with you."
"Let us talk about an international hit film, a European film that has been a success around the world."
"Let us take as our example the film 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'."
"Do you know who wrote the script?"
"No?"
"Shame on you!"
"Do you know who composed the music for it?"
"That neither!"
"Do you know who directed it?"
"Perhaps someone can remember?"
"No, they cannot."
"Could you tell me who the film's backers were, or who its producer was?"
"Hmm."
"I assume, though, that you have heard of its two stars, Hugh Grant and Andy McDowell."
"We could carry on this question-and-answer game for ever and a day, whether with 'Amélie' or with 'The Pianist', it does not matter which."
"Both directors and producers know all too well what is valuable to them about their actors - firstly, their talent, and secondly their name - whilst the public have quite personal reasons for their adulation of their celluloid heroes and heroines."
"Successes at film festivals, the sought-after jangling of money in box-office tills, good viewer figures - all these things are directly dependent on a performer's quality as an actor and on his or her popularity with the public."
"Let me clarify this by saying that I do not want to be misunderstood as attempting to assess the merits of any one of the creative professions in the film world; such is not my objective."
"Film-making is a collaborative effort in which everyone is important, from the author to the producer."
"All are doing their work, and all of them - with the exception of one professional group - are protected internationally."
"Authors enjoy the protection of the Berne Convention and of the WIPO copyright treaties."
"Producers and players of music are protected internationally by the Rome Convention and the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty."
"Even television stations, which are, primarily, more consumers than creators, have their rights guaranteed by the Rome Convention, and these are to be brought up to date by the WIPO treaty on the rights of broadcasting companies, something that is awaited, being urgently necessary, right and important."
"Performers in films, though, are still not covered by the Performers and Phonograms Treaty."
"Why?"
"Since 1996, negotiations within the WIPO have produced no favourable outcome for the heroes and heroines of the screen, who also got no result from the diplomatic conference in December 2000; nor did bilateral meetings between WIPO members achieve the desired objective."
"The signatory states are now to meet again, in Geneva, from 18 to 20 June."
"Performers in films have been waiting for years for a minimum of protection for their copyrights at an international level."
"Whilst the EU has always acknowledged the economic importance of artistic output, we know all too well that what is today the work of an artist will tomorrow be part of our cultural heritage."
"Within the EU, performers are protected by national legislation, but in most countries their rights are minimal or non-existent."
"The failure to harmonise these rights internationally means that the performers in works originating in the EU are no longer protected, so that their free circulation is curtailed, with adverse effects on the distribution of European works at an international level."
"All in all, then, these are hardly good conditions."
"You will be familiar with the saying that 'the world is a village'."
"Technological developments over recent years, media convergence and technological developments yet to come mean that this saying is more true than ever before."
"Borders are eliminated and obstacles removed, legislators and all interested parties are faced with a plethora of challenges."
"One of them is that of providing international protection for the work of performers, in respect of which the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport wishes to send Geneva a political signal."
"As it is the Commission that will be representing the EU's Member States at the WIPO negotiations in June of this year, we would like to put the following questions to you and be given answers to them."
"What view does the Commission take of this discrepancy between audiovisual performers and other creative artists?"
"Should they not enjoy the same international protection as all their colleagues in the music world?"
"Is the Commission able to inform us of the current position in the WIPO negotiations as regards audiovisual performers?"
"Thirdly, what actions does the Commission contemplate taking in order to do away with this discrimination against one single professional group?"
"Mr President, I would like, first of all, to thank the Commission for its explanations and then also all the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, especially the coordinators, who were able to find a solution to this issue, something that the short time available made a matter of urgency."
"In order to clarify my - perhaps somewhat over-simplified - statement to the effect that broadcasting companies were more consumers than creators, I would like to add that this is not a value-judgment, but simply a statement of fact."
"They are both consumers and creators, but not exclusively so, and even so they can enjoy protection at international level, which film performers cannot."
"On this I agree absolutely with Mrs Hieronymi."
"This is a loophole that we should close, and I am glad that the various powers are making a united effort to do this."
"When we talk about this international protection for audiovisual performers that we desire, what do we mean by it?"
"This is, primarily, about their moral rights."
"Imagine that one of your speeches here in plenary were to be used without your authorisation, in a modified form, or perhaps even misused; as its author, you would be able to defend yourself, but, as a performer, you would have hardly any options, and only rarely the right to do anything about it."
"A second aspect, and an important one, is the use of names. It is of immense importance to any creative artist that he should be able to put his name to his work, even if he is a mere cog, a part of the whole."
"That is every bit as important to performers, including those outside the European Union."
"Now, although one does not perhaps have to worry as much about the likes of Hugh Grant as about the thousands who are less prominent, even national film celebrities sometimes go through bad years, when it just happens that they are not on set for a single day all year."
"That may be the luck of the artist and something that one cannot do anything about, but the rent still has to be paid."
"What would help them is something to which they do, in fact, have every right - to have a share in the added value of successful productions - whether this be through the practice of buy-outs, through appropriate remuneration, or by way of the options that are open to us in the European Union."
"I do think that all the audiovisual performers outside the EU, who do not enjoy these rights, are waiting expectantly for a signal from us."
"I am glad that we are fighting this battle side by side, and I wish you good luck, or, to put it in thespian language: break a leg!"
"May the exercise be a success!"
"In conclusion of this debate, I have received a motion for a resolution"
"The next item is the proposal for a Council decision, by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the conclusion of an agreement in the form of a letter between the European Community and the Republic of Croatia on the ecopoint system applicable to Croatian transit traffic through Austria."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)"
"Broad economic policy guidelines (2003-2005)"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0142/2003) by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Recommendation on the Broad Guidelines of the Economic Policies of the Member States and the Community for 2003-2005(COM(2003) 170 - C5-0189/2003 - 2003/2074(INI))."
"Mr President, I would like to start by explaining exactly what we are discussing."
"We are dealing with the economic guidelines, and in my view, there are three novel aspects to them."
"Firstly, they are economic guidelines for three years, not just for one year."
"Secondly, they will be discussed alongside the employment guidelines."
"Thirdly, we are holding these discussions at a time of recession."
"We have learnt this morning that the most powerful economy in the European Union has entered into recession."
"These are therefore no ordinary economic guidelines."
"Given these circumstances the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and myself in particular, were requested to draft a report promptly to allow the Commission and the Council to study it."
"We were asked to try and arrive at the broadest possible consensus."
"We have achieved this."
"All the groups had to make compromises but we did manage to reach an agreement."
"I should like to take this opportunity of highlighting the splendid work of the spokespersons for the various groups."
"Othmar Karas spoke on behalf of my group, Robert Goebbels spoke on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and Carles-Alfred Gasòliba i Böhm spoke on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"I would also like to say to the Commission that whenever Parliament has been invited to respond, the response has invariably been helpful."
"As suggested in the Poem of the Cid, a servant will always respond well to a good master."
"I urge you to bear this in mind and to involve Parliament in the discussion of these economic guidelines."
"Amongst other things, this discussion will serve to put pressure on the Member States lagging furthest behind."
"I shall now outline the key points of my report."
"Firstly, we want to know whether the current coordination mechanisms are adequate, or whether further measures are needed."
"We understand that the Treaty states that national policies, supply policies and short-term policies are policies of common interest and should be coordinated."
"We are now three years behind with the implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"Whenever the Commissioner appears before us, he states that the delay is due to lack of application and due diligence on the part of the Member States We wish to do more than simply wring our hands."
"We would like to suggest appropriate action to remedy these failures concerning implementation."
"We have two proposals in this regard."
"We would ask the Commission once and for all to draw up a list detailing the rigidities hindering implementation of the internal market and structural change."
"This list should also detail priorities, measures required and the calendar for meeting the Lisbon objectives by 2010."
"Assuming that lack of due diligence on the part of the Member States is the reason for this delay, we call upon the Commission to explain to us what it could do to remedy the situation."
"Once upon a time there was a Spanish constitution stating that Spaniards should be fair and charitable."
"Unfortunately this constitution did not contain any provisions detailing how such a transformation was to be achieved."
"Subsequently, Spain endured three civil wars during the nineteenth century."
"We call for coordination to guarantee that all economic policies are going in the same direction."
"That is what coordination is about."
"Secondly, I would like to stress that I believe wholeheartedly in maintaining balanced budgetary positions."
"There is no need to change things that are working well just because other things are not."
"Monetary policy has worked well during this period."
"This policy is aimed at achieving price stability."
"It is managed through an independent bank and a Stability Pact that has maintained only a certain degree of discipline in the Member States."
"I stress that there has only been a certain degree of discipline."
"Some States have gone significantly astray."
"I would therefore like to reiterate my conviction that budgetary balance must remain the objective."
"As the Commission stated, those extravagant countries will have to reduce their structural deficit by half a percent of GDP."
"Thirdly, convergence programs should be assessed differently, as the Commission itself highlighted."
"The Commission has to verify that budgets are balanced."
"It also has to check carefully to ensure Member States do not exceed the 3% limit."
"In future, the Commission ought to take account of each Member State's starting point."
"It ought to take account of each country's debt and of how it plans to use resources obtained."
"It ought also to take account of the country's anticipated future commitments."
"Take the case of a country which is not in debt, which plans to allocate money to public finances, notably to measures promoting the Lisbon strategy, and which does not have significant commitments for the future."
"The case of a country where these circumstances do not apply is entirely different."
"We call upon the Commission to ensure that Member States build up a budgetary reserve when times are good, or, to use a Biblical image, when the cows are fat."
"Such a reserve could be drawn on in bad times."
"We stress that countries should also reduce taxes whenever possible."
"In particular, we advocate a reduction in taxes increasing labour costs, as this would stimulate employment."
"Countries that cannot afford to reduce taxes should introduce supplementary measures."
"They should reduce public spending or increase income in other ways."
"It is impossible to maintain a balanced budget and reduce taxes at the same time."
"You cannot have your cake and eat it."
"As regards the policy on wages, we advocate keeping wages in line with the Retail Price Index."
"We believe actual wages should be in line with productivity."
"We advocate increasing labour mobility."
"In addition, we call on the Commission to speed up work on eliminating the fiscal barriers hindering the transfer of employment pensions."
"We further call on the Commission to establish an appropriate fiscal policy to complement the agreement reached on pensions."
"We appeal for social dialogue."
"Allow me to reiterate that we would like to see fiscal incentives for employment."
"We call for a reduction of the burdens that make employers unwilling to take on staff, especially those on the lowest wages."
"With regard to policies on investment, we are aware it has frequently been said we are lagging behind the United States because of lack of investment, especially in technology."
"We are also aware that we are more or less on a par with the United States in terms of public investment."
"Under investment occurs in the private sector."
"We therefore call for a benchmarking exercise to pinpoint the various needs, inadequacies and shortcomings of those companies."
"This is particularly relevant if small and medium-sized companies, with less than nine employees, are to access new technologies."
"Resources can only be allocated efficiently if the full picture is clear."
"We just need to know how things stand."
"We would like the Commission to report on this promptly."
"After all, to paraphrase a Spanish poet, there is no such thing as a favourable wind for a sailor who has not yet set his course."
"All we are requesting is a report to identify inadequacies and deficiencies in SMEs."
"It would then be possible to establish how best to proceed."
"I would like to end by thanking all the groups and their spokespersons for their efforts."
"Once again, the Commission can be assured that Parliament is ready, willing and able to help overcome the difficult situation we find ourselves in."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Garcia-Margallo, ladies and gentlemen, let me say right from the start that the Commission has always had, and will continue to have, our group's support for anything that helps to generate more economic dynamism and anything that furthers the implementation of the common objectives and decisions."
"There is, however, one point to which allusion has already been made and which it is important to underline from the outset."
"We have an internal market concept, we have the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies, we have European competition policy, we have the Financial Services Action Plan and the Risk Capital Action Plan, we have Article 2, which obliges Member States to pursue a course of economic policy coordination, we have the Stability and Growth Pact, we have the euro, we have EU enlargement and hence the expansion of the internal market into a home market, and we have the eco-social market economy as our model of economic governance, which means competitiveness within a free market, promoting social cohesion while being mindful of its responsibility towards nature and people."
"Should not all this be enough to put us in a better position than we are in?"
"Why do we need new economic policy guidelines?"
"We need them because we have no European employment policy, because we have no European economic policy, and because the task of implementing all the various decisions that we jointly adopt is therefore primarily a matter for the Member States and because many Member States fail to do their homework."
"Half-heartedness, superficiality, a lack of courage, and complacency, indeed, insincerity about many of the key issues on the Community's agenda shape the picture."
"There is a lack of ambition and a lack of political will."
"Let me say this here today: new economic policy guidelines are no substitute for political will, for the willingness to act instead of apportioning blame, and for greater commitment and a willingness to accept responsibility for all these issues."
"We need more European thinking instead of wrong-headed national egotism."
"There can therefore be only one message sent out from here today, and it is this: we need a benchmark."
"Who is the best, the most creative, the fastest, the most successful in implementing common decisions?"
"It is results that matter, not guidelines or a succession of summits."
"It is the successes, not the means of achieving them, that matter, and we must therefore do our utmost to implement what we have agreed."
"We need fresh impetus, new and courageous efforts, more own capital, more risk capital, and a climate that favours business start-ups."
"We must strengthen the internal market and remove distortions of competition."
"We must introduce majority voting on matters relating to taxation and harmonise all business taxes in Europe."
"We need more competitiveness, more research, more competition in education and research, and more competition on merits."
"If we finally do what we all pledge to do at all the summit meetings, Europe will not only be the world's number one in terms of its population and area, but also in terms of competitiveness and employment."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Mr García Margallo's report, which I consider to be an important contribution to the development of effective coordination of the Union's economic and social policies, starkly exposes the shortcomings which have characterised the drawing up of the broad economic and social policy guidelines in recent years."
"On the one hand, there has for too long been no attempt to establish a proactive policy that can combat the trends towards stagnation and recession which are still raging through many of the Union's economies. On the other hand, to say the least, the principle of streamlining and coordinating employment policies through the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines has been belatedly recognised."
"Moreover, the goal of achieving the strategy laid down in Lisbon in 2000 and the related structural reforms by 2010 has been included in what seems as yet to be a rather ill-defined fashion."
"We must not underestimate the progress made, but it must be stressed that we now need to overcome the delays and ambiguities, providing for effective coordination of Member States' economic, employment and environment policies by establishing a proper calendar setting out the intermediate steps for achieving the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives by 2010, particularly with regard to public investment in the research, education and lifelong training sectors and a European network of essential services, starting with transport and telecommunications."
"Moreover, we also need to set up an institutional coordinating structure in the euro area so that - as stated in Mr García Margallo's report - the euro area has a single representative in all the international economic and financial institutions."
"Lastly, we need, for the euro area too, to define the phases of an economic, social and environment policy which is also compatible with the Lisbon strategy and with flexible management of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"As of 2004, these measures should become the core of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the new goals for enhancing flexible management of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"In this regard, I would stress that we need to avoid general formulae and great ambiguity: not all economic policies can both satisfy the Lisbon and Gothenburg criteria and respect the constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact in terms of public deficit and government debt, even in the event that the Pact is managed more flexibly, as proposed by the Commission - whose efforts we appreciate - particularly in this current phase of virtual stagnation."
"In other words, the Commission cannot ignore the fact that a discrepancy of 3% with regard to the minimum objective of 60% of government debt is due to an increase in current expenditure, or maybe to tax cuts across the board, or to a policy of boosting public and private investment - for example, in research, in training, in retraining workers of retirement age who wish to continue working - especially considering that such investment is recognised, formally recognised, by the Commission itself as an objective of common interest."
"The same priorities should be pursued, as Commissioner Solbes said, in periods of growth too, when the conditions are created for greater compatibility between the broad economic and employment policy guidelines and the parameters of the Stability Pact, which is also - and the Central Bank itself must not forget this - a Pact which should seek to increase income and employment and, after Lisbon, to bring about full employment and social cohesion."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports Mr García-Margallo y Marfil's report."
"We believe it rightly emphasises the importance of providing a more appropriate framework to ensure that the objectives set in the various stability pacts and the main broad guidelines of economic policy are attained."
"The stability and credibility of the Union's economy and its single currency are at stake."
"Over the last few days we have become very much aware of social unrest resulting from essential proposals to reform pensions systems."
"Reform is needed to guarantee pensions and associated benefits."
"These are integral parts of the welfare state system characteristic of the European Union."
"The Union provides and guarantees the best social protection and the greatest social balance when compared to other large economies."
"If it is to preserve that balance, the European Union must make a more determined effort to take the action many have called for in recent times."
"During the preparations for the Spring European Council in Brussels under the current Greek Presidency, we highlighted two shortcomings."
"The first was failure to attain the Lisbon objectives."
"The second concerned the need to tackle a number of outstanding structural reforms mentioned in Mr García-Margallo y Marfil's report."
"Action on these is certainly needed."
"I should like to reiterate the importance of this area."
"It encompasses a number of unresolved key issues which are therefore still holding back economies and their development at European level."
"Liberalisation of some sectors is one area where action is outstanding."
"Another is failure to adopt technological innovation."
"Research and development is not being promoted adequately either."
"Further, as Mr García-Margallo y Marfil pointed out, it has now become urgent to give priority to SMEs, especially to those with the most potential for growth and innovation."
"It is well known that large corporations tend to shed jobs when times are hard."
"This is happening at the moment."
"It is actually the SMEs that create more employment and stimulate economic recovery."
"I would emphasise once again that such recovery must take place within a strict framework and budgetary balance."
"It is also essential to attain the objectives set in the stability pacts."
"These are an integral part of the framework on which the European Union and the euro are based and from which they will develop."
"We cannot afford to restrict or weaken it."
"Mr President, I am the rapporteur for the report on the Guidelines of the Economic Policies of the Member States."
"The idea was for us also to have voted on that report today."
"For the first time, we would have seen economic and employment policy guidelines coordinated in terms of time, but that was unfortunately not to be the case."
"As rapporteur, I pulled out all the stops so that we should be ready in time, but to no avail."
"It means that this report will not be presented until the June part-session, and by then it will be too late."
"It means that the Council will decide on the guidelines on the same day that we vote in Parliament, and the Council will not therefore be able to take account of our points of view."
"That is serious because it means that the important balance between the two processes will go to pot."
"Instead, the economic perspective will totally dominate."
"It is a shift we also see elsewhere in political life."
"It bodes well neither for the Lisbon process nor for the social Europe in which so many Europeans have placed their hopes and confidence."
"The EU now finds itself in a difficult economic situation, with weak demand, low levels of investment and growing unemployment in ever more Member States."
"What was of course needed was a clear overhaul of the economic guidelines, but the Commission continues, unfortunately, to support the Stability and Growth Pact and budget discipline and to believe in the possibility of saving our way out of the crisis."
"If, through having a common currency, it is not permitted to increase state expenditure and there is no possibility of regulation by means of flexible exchange rates, only the labour market remains."
"The measures proposed by the Commission are therefore concerned not so much with economics as with the labour market."
"It is a question first and foremost of reducing labour costs and the attendant social costs, but that leads to a reduction in domestic demand, which is incredibly important."
"That, of course, is what needs to be increased if we are not to enter a vicious circle."
"The Stability and Growth Pact was duly created in order to keep inflation under control during a period of growth when there was a perhaps justified anxiety about inflation."
"Today, the situation is different."
"Now, the same Pact is instead giving rise to deflation and growing unemployment."
"The policy of economic and monetary union binds all the eurozone countries to a common fate and to a policy of cut-backs leading to a type of collective decline."
"'United we stand and united we fall', the refrain might go."
"It means, on the other hand, that those countries are well placed that are able to say no to the euro and to remain outside the policy of economic and monetary union."
"My own country, Sweden, is to hold a referendum on EMU in September, and, with each month that goes by, opposition to the euro is growing, both among the general public and among economic and political experts."
"We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe it would be infinitely better to continue with the Lisbon policy and to pin our faith in investment in skills, knowledge and innovation."
"Ideally, we need comprehensive public investment programmes strategically designed so as to strengthen demand both for products and services from the private market and for training, research and other such things that increase knowledge."
"That is the way forward, and if the actors in the market do not themselves succeed in meeting these requirements, it is we politicians who must create the conditions that induce companies to dare to think in the long term."
"It is impossible to save our way out of the crisis."
"Mr President, rapporteurs, today it was the intention to have a joint debate on both the global economic guidelines and the employment guidelines."
"The rapporteur for these employment guidelines of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs stated a moment ago that we have a problem."
"Not only are we trying to simplify the guidelines, not only are we here to talk about a three-year period, but we are also trying, as they say, to 'streamline' them."
"We have not managed to do this."
"This is very unfortunate since the broad and global economic guidelines in the text to a large extent refer to the employment guidelines which are yet to be discussed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"The problems are patently clear, and in the light of these problems - some people in the Netherlands say that every disadvantage has its advantage - in the light of these circumstances, we have held emergency talks with the Council and the Commission in order to alleviate this problem we have, namely the inability to submit our opinion on the employment guidelines on time."
"The Council has promised that, in the next few years, the consultation period will be longer, and the Commission has also promised that it will submit its proposals more quickly. Both have pledged this in writing."
"Having said this, there is still a problem in my view."
"As Mr Schmid has already pointed out, we are unable to commit to deadlines in certain areas."
"This means that we need to inform both the Commission and the Council of the opinions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in a more informal manner as and when we can and, at a later stage, of the opinions of the plenary too."
"I would mention the fact that, since there were 167 amendments to the employment guidelines, some restraint is called for."
"I should like to make a few comments on the broad economic guidelines and particularly those employment guidelines."
"As some speakers have mentioned already, we are at the moment talking about both long-term policy - which could be referred to as the Lisbon policy, 2010 - and short term policy, and, in the short term, we are facing a recession, as we were reminded a moment ago."
"During a recession such as this, there is no longer a labour shortage, but rather a job shortage."
"This means that employment guidelines should be more dynamic in the short term and should also be more country-specific in a number of ways."
"This job shortage also translates into a shortage of work placement and work experience places."
"Neither does it offer any incentives to solve the poverty problems."
"Reintegration is said to be adversely affected and the concept of availability comes under pressure."
"Financial incentives that are being mentioned here are more limited and will not immediately have the desired effect on the poverty trap and the promotion of jobs."
"In fact, what we need to do in the short term is to consider job sharing again."
"Issues that are very much on the agenda and which I should like to emphasise are working shorter hours, options to cut down the number of hours, the reduction of overtime, which is currently growing rapidly, and possibly promoting subsidised work and social economy or the third sector."
"Alongside this, entrepreneurship should be stimulated."
"In our committee, a number of proposals have already been expressed in the form of compromise proposals in order to stimulate the small and medium-size businesses, and they strongly emphasise the fact that the pillar of equality has taken a knock."
"We should like to maintain this equality."
"This does mean, however, as the Belgian Employment Minister has already pointed out, that certain target groups, such as the elderly, should perhaps be pleased with the fact that they can enjoy their early retirement at the moment."
"This is the subject of political debate."
"We will bring our proposals to the next meetings and we will take it from there."
"Mr President, it was one year ago yesterday that we held a debate on the global economic policy guidelines in this plenary."
"During this debate, I made some critical remarks about the economic policy guidelines."
"I indicated that the promises were very rarely kept."
"To my chagrin, I have to say that little has been done with this criticism since."
"It is therefore logical that the same criticism should now also apply to the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil."
"Last year, we already saw a decline in economic growth."
"We now have to conclude that, despite fine policy intentions, recovery is still not on the cards."
"It appears that, with the policy guidelines, which form an open coordination method, we in the European Union are unable to cope with an impending recession."
"In addition, the objectives of the Lisbon process do not appear achievable with the current instruments."
"In short, the transposition of the policy intentions under implementation and the implementation of the guidelines leave something to be desired."
"Meanwhile, I have gleaned from various sources that an open coordination method does not work."
"In practice, this method is apparently too non-committal and is also not very well-defined."
"Consequently, cooperation by means of the open coordination method is not sufficiently binding upon the Member States."
"It would therefore be useful if it were made clear in what way the Member States can work together in the field of employment and social policy, obviously thereby taking into consideration the Member States' responsibilities."
"I should like to put a question to the European Commission, and specifically Commissioner Solbes, in this connection."
"Can you indicate whether, and if so when, you will be tabling proposals in order to improve cooperation within the framework of the Lisbon process?"
"In this respect, do you deem it possible to come up with a clear definition of the open coordination method in the short term?"
"A few years ago at the Stockholm Summit, it was decided to aim for integration of environmental policy and social policy into the economic policy guidelines."
"This was with the intention to establish a sustainable and social market economy in the European Union."
"At present, economic prospects are uncertain, which has an impact on the creation of a sustainable and social market economy."
"I should therefore like to bring two important points to your attention."
"First of all, social policy."
"In the debate on social policy, the European model is compared to the American model."
"The European model is based on solidarity, while the American model is not."
"The question is now to what extent this solidarity is still reflected in the policy which the Union is wishing to adopt."
"Secondly, I should like to draw your attention to the need for integrating environmental policy into economic policy."
"In my view, there is too little attention paid to the environmental aspects of economic policy."
"It seems that the integration of economic and social policy is more obvious than integrating environmental policy into economic policy."
"Might the reason lie in the fact that environmental policy costs money initially and does not lead to profits that are readily measurable?"
"I would therefore welcome, alongside references to the importance of the environment, clear and concrete environmental objectives to be included in the economic policy guidelines."
"Objectives with regard to energy consumption and CO2 emission reductions spring to mind in this respect."
"Economic growth will need to go hand in hand with a responsible use of natural resources."
"Moreover, I consider taking active government measures aimed at increasing birth rates in Europe in a bid to keep pension schemes affordable extremely debatable."
"Since both the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil and this debate are critical about the global guidelines, it is time that the European Commission took these comments to heart."
"We, as the European Parliament, will need to ensure that economic policy is implemented in a consistent manner."
"The Commission must be pro-active and must inform Parliament in good time about the results achieved."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, when introducing this report on the BEPGs, the rapporteur declared himself to be satisfied with the broad, almost unanimous consensus achieved within the Commission, and, I imagine, within Parliament."
"I can see why, but I believe that there lies the limit of our work and, ultimately, also one of the limitations of the BEPGs as such."
"It is easy to support the Lisbon objectives - who would not agree on these objectives - but what is difficult is to agree on the instruments."
"If you were members of a national parliament, Mr President, Mr Trentin, it would ultimately be a hard task to achieve consensus on the choices to be made and the positions to be adopted."
"I believe that this - but we know that now, it is an intrinsic problem - is the limitation of these major guidelines and the open coordination policies, particularly because I feel we need to have the courage to go further on some issues, making decisions rather than seeking the lowest common denominator of different positions held within Parliament and by the different Member States, and getting to the heart of the issues."
"I want to mention three points, which I feel receive insufficient emphasis in both the BEPGs and the report."
"The first is pension provision."
"Let this be understood - and we must shout it out loud and clear - there are going to be generations of poor pensioners in Europe and we are not doing anything about it because we do not want, we are not strong enough or courageous enough to impose certain choices on those who stand to benefit from pension systems not changing in due time."
"We have systems which are financially unsustainable, whose treatment of the younger and future generations is wicked, and yet we cannot muster the political will to change the situation."
"The issue would cause a heated debate even in Parliament."
"We have witnessed the strike in Austria, we have witnessed the strike in France and there will soon be a strike in Italy."
"The status quo lobby upholding the interests of those seeking to prevent any changes in the field of pensions is powerful and active."
"I believe that the European Parliament's documents and statements too must call strongly for protection of the interests of all, especially the youngest citizens."
"In his report, which is, moreover, valuable, Mr García-Margallo calls for social dialogue."
"I believe that, where an issue such as pensions is concerned, what is needed is not dialogue but a social debate instead and, where necessary, a political debate too."
"The pensions dialogue with the people filling the squares in Vienna, Paris or Rome, where the people's fear is exploited with demagogic proposals when they know full well that something needs to be done, is a sterile dialogue, a dialogue that can lead nowhere."
"Another point: immigration."
"Although I can think of an amendment which I hope will not be supported by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I hope that the reference will be retained in the report to the important role played by immigrants and immigration in increasing the dynamism and flexibility of the European economy at precisely the time when, with enlargement, some of the larger countries are calling for the introduction of the free movement of workers to be postponed until 2011."
"The free movement of workers will contribute greatly to the dynamism of the European economy and the reference must be preserved."
"I will end with one last point, Mr President: the Lisbon goals, making the European economy the most competitive knowledge-based economy."
"We must ask ourselves how that will be possible in countries such as the European countries which reject the cutting-edge technology of GMOs and stem cells."
"Mr President, I fully agree with the previous speaker, Mr Della Vedova, that the greatest challenge to economic sustainability is the growth in Europe's ageing population, which is a problem we must tackle while its economic impact is still controllable."
"The status quo is not really an option for European governments."
"In order to prepare for the overall as well as the budgetary effects of ageing populations we have to increase employment, reduce public debt and reform pensions and health care systems."
"The additional costs that would result from postponing the pension system reforms will in the future be taken out of the pockets of today's youth."
"Change, even change that is necessary and inevitable, always meets with resistance, which is what we have also experienced this week in Strasbourg."
"This resistance to change, however, cannot be allowed to become a pretext for delaying necessary reforms or a barrier to them."
"Europe's economic situation is worrying and our economic growth is clearly poorer than what was forecast."
"Avoidance of geopolitical risks now gives us some hope of faster economic growth, but numerous experts are also pointing out that in forecasts made in the last two years faster economic growth has always been put off until the following six-month period."
"Our poor economic growth is largely home-made: 'made in Europe'."
"Ladies and gentlemen, sluggish growth, falling productivity, a decrease in external demand, a decline in business and consumer confidence, and the continued rise in unemployment are facts of life this year."
"The only positive factor is the low rate of inflation, which has averaged around 2% and will possibly fall even further."
"At their summit meetings the heads of our Member States have promised to implement structural reforms allowing growth and stability."
"The extent to which this has been done in practical terms, however, has been inadequate, and poor economic growth and mass unemployment are the price we pay for putting off these reforms."
"If we want the broad guidelines of economic policies to have a successful outcome they should incorporate a clear work programme which defines the main areas of action for reform and a timetable for completion."
"In addition, the guidelines should list the special actions which are needed in those areas where internal political 'stalemate ' has obstructed progress in certain Member States."
"The EU is still characterised by its under-utilisation of human resources."
"Our employment rate, which is low when viewed in the international context, is also due to the misconceived incentives embedded in our benefit systems, which are conducive to withdrawal from the labour market or remaining outside it."
"Tax and benefit systems should be reformed, for example, by reducing excessively high rates of tax for those on low incomes."
"Tax reductions, however, should be made for everyone in paid employment."
"More flexible arrangements for working time and less stringent regulatory systems would enhance participation in the labour market and improve employment opportunities."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one might be surprised at the way in which the first few recitals of this report have been interpreted but, in the final analysis, this merely shows that everyone agrees with the evidence: the disastrous situation facing the European economy, specifically slow growth, the loss of confidence amongst investors and consumers and the increase in unemployment, to which I would add the unsustainable levels of income inequality, poverty and social exclusion."
"This situation requires a new approach to drafting economic policy decisions in order to achieve the aims of high growth, full employment, sustainable development and greater social cohesion."
"The only problem is that, when confronted with the evidence, the answer is unfortunately always the same: speed up the process of liberalisations and structural reforms, as recommended in the Lisbon strategy - an approach that the employers' representatives welcome so wholeheartedly - wage moderation and sticking to labour flexibility and job instability."
"Let us be clear about this: the rapporteur's amendments accept and support the guidelines proposed by the Commission."
"The rapporteur himself acknowledges that these guidelines are a repetition of previous recommendations, but what is being called a new approach is only 'more of the same', with even greater intensity when what is crucial is to find a new direction."
"We would need to propose a total change to the liberal shift of the EU's economic and social guidelines."
"We must also ask ourselves about the causes of this situation and the answer to this question can be found in the policies that have been pursued to date."
"One only has to look at the current situation to see that making the labour market more precarious, eroding workers' rights and moderating wages are not going to increase productivity, combat poverty or respond to demand that is falling, both internally and externally."
"The link between the economies of the Member States and the reduction in purchasing power is well known, as is the need to invest in education and training and in research and technology in order to facilitate higher productivity."
"As has already been stated here on several occasions, however, we need to do the opposite of what the stupid rules of the Stability Pact call for, which is forcing a reduction in public investment, leading to the State having no responsibility in the fields of health and education and making it difficult to use the Structural Funds correctly in the countries with the weakest economies."
"Similarly, economic and social cohesion requires a bigger Community budget, not the smallest budget to be proposed in recent years, which is what the Commission has just presented for 2004, accounting for less than 1% of Community gross national income."
"Similarly, liberalisations and privatisations are calling into question public service and its quality, as demonstrated by recent workers' protests throughout Europe."
"The most shocking aspect of this report, therefore, which closely follows the Commission's recommendations for this year's economic guidelines, is the argument it makes for its increasingly neoliberal measures despite the serious consequences they are having."
"The Commission makes its aim clear, by expressing the view that wage increases must remain moderate, with the aim of allowing profit margins to be re-established."
"The focus of the Commission's policies is always profit and not people and this is why it is so insistent in calling for a flexible, mobile and cheap labour force, without rights, which can be used whenever, wherever and however employers wish, thereby supporting job instability over employment, and demonstrating total disregard for working people."
"I reiterate: this cannot be the way forward."
"The European Union must be a project for people and not only to increase the profit of a few and the workers should be given greater respect."
"Treating workers with dignity is a crucial step in increasing labour productivity."
"Madam President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, we are here today to discuss the broad economic policy guidelines of the Member States and the European Union, and I would therefore like to start by making one thing very clear."
"I reject any coordination of Member States' economic policies by the European Union."
"The Member States must continue to be responsible for coordination."
"The method whereby, in all areas where the European Union has no competence, conditions are stipulated in the framework of open coordination and guidelines, is fundamentally wrong and moves Europe in the wrong direction."
"The responsibility for economic policy in Europe must remain with the individual Member States."
"What we need in Europe is competition between locations, which can be stimulated by the Member States' different economic policies and which in turn strengthens Europe as a location for business and investment and fosters positive development in this area."
"In my view, economic policy coordination can take place, at best, where the bases for competition are strengthened and also, of course, wherever this common coordination aims to guarantee currency stability."
"It follows from this - if we emphasise the Member States' responsibility in this area - that the Member States also have a specific responsibility for taking the action now required."
"To put it another way, the economic problems which we currently face in Europe's economy are largely the economic problems of large Member States, namely France, Italy and Germany."
"What we must do is clearly underline that these are not cyclical problems but structural problems."
"The key question for these countries is this: will they manage to summon the strength to undertake reforms?"
"These future reforms cannot simply mean tinkering with the system."
"No, the key question is this: will they summon the strength to overhaul the systems per se in these countries?"
"When I say 'overhaul the systems', I mean the areas which exacerbate the structural problems."
"I mean the high labour costs, the high taxes, the costly healthcare systems, the inflexible labour markets, the obstructive trade unions, and the soaring costs of pensions."
"These are the areas where there are structural problems, and these are the areas which must be tackled."
"I believe that by undertaking structural reforms in the major areas of social spending as well as in the pensions sector, we will also remove the budget risks which in turn have an impact on the debt situation in the various countries."
"This is a crucial point, also in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"What we need in these countries is a common-sense majority to ensure that the Stability and Growth Pact is not undermined even more than it is at present."
"Madam President, Mr García Margallo has drafted his report in the tradition of the Lisbon approach."
"It is a balanced report which, more so than the guidelines themselves, is seeking to strike a balance between financial-economic and social and employment-directed policy."
"Like others, I think it is unfortunate that we were unable to discuss Mr Schmid's report on the employment guidelines today, for it is precisely this integrated approach that is of great importance."
"Something which I would particularly like to address is the report's plea to set up a structural reforms action plan."
"Like others, including the Commissioner, I am critical about setting up yet another plan."
"I do think that the underlying analysis is right, namely that so little comes of the recommendations from previous global guidelines and of the Lisbon agenda because the Member States do not actually implement those recommendations and because the Commission does not have any actual power of enforcement in these matters."
"I share this view."
"Very often, many fine words are spoken and nothing is done about them."
"Furthermore, the same government leaders who agree on this are, in Brussels, often those who are reluctant to actually implement the attendant legislation."
"What I would welcome is for the plan for a task force, which was set up during the previous European Summit and which mainly aims to implement policy, to be coupled to this idea of structural reforms."
"I think that this idea fits in very well with what must be done by this task force under the leadership of Wim Kok, namely to draw the attention of the Member States to the need for implementing the strategy."
"In my view, the economic rigidities which Mr Margallo mentioned are precisely those things that fall within this scope of financial-economic and social and employment policy."
"I should like to mention a few points."
"Flexible employment patterns with certainties for workers; increase in labour productivity with a better quality of work; less rigid working and opening times, but also workers' having more say about their hours; intensification of the knowledge potential, but lifelong learning for all, and all age categories; greater labour mobility, but with continuity of accrued rights; and the list goes on."
"In all those structural reforms, it is important to strike this balance and to create a basis for improvements rather than to call for protest."
"I think that the urgency is clear, that the direction is also clear if viewed in this context and that it is essential that those paper recommendations should be translated into real policy."
"Moreover, I hope that this task force can play an important part in this."
"Madam President, the report states that the EU is at present in a difficult situation, with sluggish growth, falling profits, lower external demand, reduced confidence among companies and consumers and increased unemployment."
"Indeed, it is a genuinely disastrous situation, but the question is: what is it due to?"
"I agree with the rapporteur that a new approach to economic policy is required, but what new approach?"
"Neither the Commission nor the rapporteur seems to have a proper answer to that question."
"Might it have to do with the fact that the very starting point for the analysis has no basis in reality?"
"The report says that economic development is poor in the EU."
"On average, that is of course no doubt the case, but the fact remains that, beneath that average, the reality varies incredibly from one EU country to another."
"We are all aware that the situation in Germany is incredibly serious. At the same time, it is by no means as bad in the three EU countries that have chosen to remain outside the eurozone: Great Britain, Denmark and Sweden."
"In these countries, inflation and unemployment are lower than in the eurozone, and growth is higher."
"In 2002, growth in the eurozone was 0.9% compared with 1.8% in the three EU countries not participating in economic and monetary union."
"In Scandinavia, growth is highest in Denmark, the only country which, in a special referendum, said no to EMU."
"The German financial newspaper, Handelsblatt, also stated the other day that one of the main causes of the German crisis is the exorbitant rate for the euro that makes German exports more expensive."
"In Sweden, we do not have this type of problem because, fortunately, we still have our own currency, the rate for which varies in relation to other currencies and is thus continually adjusted to the actual situation in the Swedish economy."
"Another problem for Germany is that, in a depression, it cannot, independently and on the basis of its own needs, decide how large a budget deficit it is to permit for the time being in accordance with normal principles of economic policy."
"When, as now, it is permitting an increased budget deficit to avoid a total economic disaster, the EU instead threatens to impose a fine upon the country."
"All this shows that the attempt, via EMU and the euro, to conduct a centrally managed economic policy in 15 different countries has been a failure."
"The report does not, however, touch upon this."
"There is the feeling that EMU and the euro have become holy cows that cannot be criticised at all within the EU."
"When all the facts conspire to indicate that the EU countries should be permitted a greater measure of democratic self-determination, the rapporteur nonetheless chooses to emphasise dogmatically that the Member States are responsible for coordinating economic policy."
"We now know that a centrally directed bureaucratic economic policy within the EU is a disaster."
"There are many tasks to which the EU can profitably devote itself, for example those of contributing to peaceful conflict resolution and counteracting cross-border threats to the environment."
"The experiment involving a compulsory, uniform and standardised economic policy for all the EU countries has proved a failure."
"This is something I hope the Swedish electorate will remember when, on 14 September, it votes on whether or not Sweden is to exchange the krona for the euro."
"Madam President, the euro's strength at present is supposed to be an indication that the European economy is in quite a healthy state."
"We all know that this is actually not the case."
"In reality, things are not looking good for us."
"In recent decades, we have lived beyond our means."
"The fact is that our social, pensions and healthcare systems are no longer affordable."
"The result is that those who are willing and able to contribute find themselves burdened with levies and taxes which they can no longer afford."
"If we want to solve the problems, we must ease the burden on our contributors, which also means cutting taxes."
"Europe must distribute the burdens more fairly."
"As well as cutting taxes, we must also create employment conditions which once again enable businesses to create jobs so that working becomes a worthwhile option again."
"Work must become a worthwhile option in Europe once more."
"This is the only way to ensure that we can tackle our economic problems effectively in future."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we have heard a great many noble objectives being expressed in today's debate."
"We have heard about full employment and social security, and there is undoubtedly a broad consensus here in this House."
"The only question is: how do we achieve it?"
"The EU is responsible for competition, the internal market, the euro, for areas where there are common objectives and a common need for action, and I think that is the right approach."
"However, I am a fervent opponent of the plan to coordinate economic policies at European level in future."
"In fact, I would be happy if the things that do fall within European competence actually worked out in practice, which brings me to two points."
"Here we are today, with yet another debate about the Lisbon strategy; my astonishment mounts from day to day whenever the Commission talks about this strategy and claims that it is continuing to pursue this objective."
"Perhaps in many years' time, we will talk about how Europe had a dream."
"We should look at ourselves self-critically for once and ask how on earth we are ever to achieve this goal."
"I would like to focus on two points here, and I am particularly interested in tangible action."
"Firstly, I expect the Commission, in future, to identify exactly where the homework needs to be done at national level."
"In other words, it must put its finger on the weak spots, and do so promptly."
"This issue has already been addressed on numerous occasions."
"The second point that I see as being very important is that the Commission should not undermine its own actions in future."
"We have Commissioner Monti who is responsible for competition, we have Commissioner Bolkestein who deals with the internal market, we have Commissioner Liikanen who is responsible for business and who says what form it must take in Europe, we have Commissioner de Palacio, and we have Commissioner Solbes, who regularly tells us which structural reforms are needed in Europe and the Member States, and I support that, I am not criticising."
"However, where I do criticise these Commissioners and what annoys me is when the Commission itself produces proposals which conflict with this Lisbon objective, which conflict with the aim of deregulating the labour market."
"I am thinking, for example, of the directive on precontractual employment relationships and the form that they will have to take in future and also the discrimination which will occur if an entrepreneur - even if he has not yet signed a contract - fails to keep his eye on the ball and ends up being sued because the Commission did not think to build in a reversal of the burden of proof here."
"I have written to these Commissioners."
"Mr Solbes, you have answered on behalf of the Commission."
"Unfortunately, your answer was not specific enough."
"What I want from the Commission is a shift away from the principle that each Commissioner conducts the affairs of his or her department independently along the lines of 'I'll do my thing and you do yours'."
"Please stop the Commission from producing any more directives like this, which, in practice, conflict with the objectives that you yourselves have set for the Member States."
"This brings me to my second point, namely the Stability and Growth Pact."
"On the one hand, I would like to thank you, for at a time when criticism of this issue is being voiced in the Commission, you have kept the flag flying and ultimately campaigned resolutely for the Stability and Growth Pact."
"However, here too, I expect you to put your finger on the weak spots clearly and promptly in future."
"The last time you appeared before us in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the opinions you expressed on Germany were quite opaque."
"I asked you this: 'Are you assuming that what is planned is adequate?"
"Are you assuming that the deficit criterion will not be exceeded this year?"
"Are you assuming that the target will be achieved in 2004 or 2006?'"
"We all knew that this would not be the case."
"Here, your task would be to speak up promptly and send out a clear warning signal so that no one is surprised when the target is not achieved after all."
"False expectations are being awakened, and you have a responsibility to ensure compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Madam President, once again the workers are being called on to pay the price of the crisis plaguing the European and global economy in order to support the competitiveness of European big business within the framework of the struggle taking place for control of the raw materials markets and thanks to the unbridled pursuit of increased profitability."
"The reference point for the essence of the economic guidelines was set by Ecofin itself, when it decided that the main objectives for the next three years would be to reform the pension systems in order to cope with the challenge of the ageing population, increase the efficiency and flexibility of the job market and improve competitiveness through education and training, research and technology."
"Whereas the socio-economic situation is worsening and inequalities are multiplying, the policy of structural reform, which results in unemployment being shared out, makes uncertainty and insecurity the norm and limits workers' incomes, is again being promoted in order to safeguard the lasting growth of the profits of big business."
"The broad economic policy guidelines are guidelines to promote the notorious Lisbon strategy, especially in the fields of employment relations and the social security systems."
"For the first axis of the economic guidelines, boosting economic growth, there is a call for the faithful application of the Stability Pact, a reduction in wage and non-wage costs, a link between wages and productivity, measures to make part-time and temporary work the norm and the promotion of disincentives which will prevent workers from leaving productive activity, the aim being the mandatory extension of working life, and measures for training in early retirement."
"For the second axis, reducing public debt, there is a call for a drastic cut in social spending on workers' health and health care, the aim being for government pension, health and welfare systems, spending on health care, programmes to support the unemployed etc., in other words all forms of social spending, to be cut back because they undermine financial stability, given that government budgets are not in a position to meet these costs."
"For the third, the reform of the pension systems and health care systems, and in the name of financial equilibrium, there is a call for the speedier overturn of the pension systems by increasing the retirement age and reducing pensions, in other words, the gradual abolition of the state's social security obligations and the encouragement of privatisation and commercialisation of the health and welfare sectors."
"In other words, the aim is to impose the liberal choices of big business by fire and sword."
"It is, to say the least, unacceptable, under pressure from monopoly interests, to persist with such unsuccessful measures, which lead the workers into impoverishment and marginalisation, in order to support the unaccountable profiteering of big business."
"The workers are reacting intensely to this policy and are taking to the streets en masse in all the countries which are trying to apply it."
"We support them in their struggle and join with them in condemning this anti-grass roots policy for serving the interests of capital and we are contributing to their fight and supporting the formation of anti-monopolistic, anti-imperialistic rallies to overturn it."
"Madam President, I would like to thank all those who have spoken in this debate."
"Unfortunately, time does not allow me to deal in detail with all the points raised."
"I will however make a few remarks I think are relevant."
"Firstly, I am grateful to the House for its cooperation."
"I appreciate the problems it is up against."
"I too would have welcomed a joint debate on the broad economic guidelines and the employment guidelines today."
"Sadly, one was not possible."
"I appreciate how little time Parliament has available."
"The Council and the Commission are under similar constraints."
"It should be borne in mind that the Commission's proposals need to be based on decisions taken at the Spring European Council."
"It is therefore very difficult to start on this kind of work before April."
"Secondly, today's debate is essentially about whether the economic policy decided on is right for the current situation, or whether this situation should lead us to change our economic policy."
"It appears that two issues have become confused in the course of the debate, namely economic policy and the instruments of economic policy."
"In my view, a study of the operation of macroeconomic policy during this period suggests it is helping to handle the crisis."
"Monetary policy has changed, obviously."
"Also, fiscal policy is now markedly more expansive than before as a function of the limits agreed under the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I shall return to this point later."
"I do believe, however, that the current situation should not lead us to back pedal regarding structural reform."
"After all, structural reform is about modernising our economies."
"It has been suggested that the Stability and Growth Pact is acting as a brake on the economy at present, and that it is a problem."
"I would argue that the Stability Pact has been presented in too simplistic a way, as a rigid tool that does not allow any room for manoeuvre."
"This is not the case."
"A further mistaken assumption was made, namely that discretionary fiscal policies are right for any economic situation."
"I think economic theory says otherwise and holds that such policies are only appropriate in very specific circumstances."
"I believe it is worth thinking carefully about what I consider a crucial issue."
"It appears that the very countries experiencing the greatest difficulties are precisely those that currently have the greatest deficit."
"One might wonder whether the deficit caused the poor economic situation or whether it was the other way around."
"I feel we need to look elsewhere in search of a solution."
"Recent developments in Japan and the internal impact of measures taken by the present Administration in the United States are worth considering."
"I remain convinced that the Stability and Growth Pact is the best instrument at our disposal."
"It provides for an appropriate and flexible fiscal policy."
"This policy is created automatically, insofar as the automatic stabilisers are allowed to operate."
"Impulsive action is controlled and the potentially negative consequences prevented."
"I believe that the vision of our economic policy presented has, in some cases, tended to be anecdotal."
"It focused on detail and veered towards caricature."
"This is most certainly not a policy based more or less exclusively on wage restrictions."
"Nothing could be further from reality."
"Wages are always set in relation to productivity."
"This is not a policy focusing solely on employment either."
"The policy consists of three key instruments I referred to earlier."
"These are sound macroeconomic policies, structural reforms together and medium and long term economic, social and environmental sustainability."
"We do not have flexibility in the labour market exclusively in mind, not even when referring to structural employment policies."
"What we are about is the development of the population, the rate of employment and, of course, labour markets adjusted to the new situation."
"It goes without saying that the economic policy guidelines do not run counter to what was agreed at Lisbon."
"Rather, they are one of the many instruments allowing us to implement the Lisbon process."
"I am surprised at the emphasis on drawing up new action plans and new lists of things to be done."
"I am also surprised at the many references to the need to be better informed about what is happening."
"I assume the House is aware that the Commission's summary report on the implementation of the Lisbon strategy was published in January."
"This report contains all the necessary information on the progress made by each of the Member States in implementing Lisbon."
"You will even find lists and tables showing which countries performed best and which did worst."
"In addition, you will find details of which three countries performed best or worst on each of the objectives."
"All the information is therefore available."
"Furthermore, a report on implementation of the broad economic guidelines is drawn up annually and indicates clearly where the shortcomings are."
"Our main problem does not therefore involve understanding the situation we are in, but in trying to change it."
"By virtue of our system, this falls within the competence of the Member States."
"Our present system is based on peer pressure, as I stated earlier."
"This is obviously a crucial point."
"A number of honourable Members mentioned the open method of coordination."
"In my view, this should only be applied in cases where the Treaty does not provide for a specific method."
"It is therefore a useful method, but one to be used sparingly and by agreement."
"I am sorry time does not permit me to go into further detail."
"I would however like to take this opportunity of thanking you all for your contributions to this morning's debate."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0153/2003) by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the appointment of Mrs Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank [8090/2003 - C5-0193/2003 - 2003/0810(CNS)]."
"Madam President, it falls to me to convey to the House and to the Council the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell's appointment."
"I speak on behalf of the chairman of the committee, Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"I should first like to say that the vote of acceptance, the vote in favour of the appointment of Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell, was carried unanimously within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I should also like to say that this was no accident."
"It was because all the members of the committee agreed that the candidate has the requisite training and ability to carry out the task before her."
"Secondly, I should like to say that the committee was fully satisfied with the written and oral answers provided by the candidate."
"We were particularly impressed with her pertinent responses to questions on three key issues."
"I am now speaking on behalf of my group."
"We noted that the candidate is a firm believer in the dogma of price stability formally proclaimed at Maastricht."
"We found too that the candidate believes equally firmly that it is for the European Central Bank, acting quite independently, to guarantee the dogma of price stability without prejudice to its duty to work towards the other objectives contained in the Treaty."
"Further, we were delighted to find that the candidate is fully prepared to cooperate with the European Parliament."
"This will be to the advantage of the European Central Bank."
"It will render its positions clearer and more public."
"It will also serve to boost the image of this House."
"I would remind you that we have been discussing the broad economic guidelines and that all the speakers emphasised the willingness and ability of Parliament to work loyally towards strengthening an economy that is currently in poor shape."
"Indeed, the European Union as a whole will benefit and Parliament will help to bring the Bank closer to the citizens."
"The latter will be better able to understand the Bank's objectives, methods and actions."
"I should also like to underline, further to this morning's debate, that Parliament is fully prepared to cooperate with the European Central Bank in its task of maintaining price stability."
"This stability is one of the main achievements of the latest stage of the European economy launched at Maastricht."
"I trust this morning's vote will provide confirmation of this."
"With regard to the economic guidelines we would like to point out that it is for the Member States to strive to reduce inflationary pressure in sectors where it occurs, notably in the service sector."
"It is also for the Member States to create the conditions in which the social partners can initiate a wages policy."
"This should be a policy of collective negotiation, keeping nominal wages in line with inflation and not allowing them to rise above it."
"It would also keep real salaries in line with productivity."
"We are all tasked with ensuring price stability, even though the European Central Bank is specifically charged to do so and will take the lead."
"In the context of the broad economic guidelines we also underlined the need for coherence and consistency across all economic policies if we are to pull ourselves up out of the hole we are in."
"Monetary policy is handled by the independent Central Bank."
"Budgetary policies must be consistent across the Union too."
"They remain within national competence, but are governed and bound by the Stability and Growth Pact."
"They are also subject to monitoring by Union institutions, including Parliament."
"These assess stability and convergence programmes, on which we have made recommendations."
"I referred earlier to wages policies."
"They also need to be in line, though they are part of national competence."
"All short-term supply policies required to deal with the economic crisis should be in line too."
"They must not be allowed to disturb the economic balance."
"That must be protected at all times by the European Central Bank as regards monetary issues."
"The Union's institutions and the Member States will ensure coherence with the Stability Pact is maintained."
"I imagine Mr Friedrich will mention this too, but we are pleased to note that the candidate is to be appointed for an eight-year term."
"This should be time enough to see the programme through."
"We are pleased to note too that the candidate may not stand for re-election, so her independence is guaranteed."
"On behalf of the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs I strongly recommend the Council to appoint the candidate and offer her our congratulations."
"Madam President, the Commission is not directly involved in the appointment of members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank."
"I would however like to say how delighted we are that Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell has been nominated as a candidate for membership of the Executive Board."
"We have come to know Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell well in her capacity as Deputy Governor of the Austrian Central Bank and also through her active involvement in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"We believe she is an outstanding candidate for the post and offer her our unreserved support."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you have before you a unanimous resolution by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to appoint Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank and to support this recommendation."
"Who is this lady?"
"As we observed in the committee - and I am also responding to the critical comments voiced by my fellow Members - she is certainly not a media product."
"Nor is she a token woman."
"She is certainly not a cloned version of other comparable bank directors either."
"Mrs Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell is her own person with rough edges, principles, experience, demonstrable results and intuition."
"This was why, after the hearing in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 29 April, we all concluded that she merits description as frank, competent and a consummate professional."
"I have six demands to make of the new member of the ECB's Executive Board."
"Firstly, Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell, please strengthen the independence of the European Central Bank and boost its defences against populist and politically motivated interjections and apportionment of blame, including from politicians!"
"In doing so, however - and this is my second point - do not hide behind the ECB Statute; instead, step up the dialogue on economic and monetary affairs with politicians, with Parliament, with the media and with the citizens of Europe."
"Thirdly, explain the economic context and background to the decisions more fully."
"By doing so, you will help to enhance the transparency and comprehensibility of monetary policy decisions."
"Fourthly, Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell, please also have the courage to make demands and even challenge the politicians - despite, or perhaps even because of, your independence and the variety of tasks on the agenda."
"We need this competition of ideas, this intellectual rivalry, in order to intensify the economic and monetary policy debate."
"Fifthly, Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell, you took a leading role in coordinating the preparations for Austria to join the economic and monetary union."
"I would ask you to place your experience at the disposal of the EU Member States who are not part of the eurozone."
"Our goal must be to make the euro the home currency of all citizens in all the EU Member States and ensure that it is seen as a strong brand for the most competitive internal market in the world."
"Sixthly - and a number of speakers have alluded to this - I would ask the new member of the European Central Bank's Executive Board to uphold the principle of price stability and adhere to it rigorously."
"Price stability produces low inflation and interest rates and is thus the prerequisite for growth, employment and an economic policy leading to prosperity."
"The candidate will join the ECB Executive Board at a very dynamic and exciting time."
"There is EU enlargement, which means that we will have more Member States outside the eurozone than in it."
"There are the different economic cycles, the cyclical and structural problems within the European Union, which we have just been discussing, the absence of economic dynamism, the lack of a pro-active approach and the lack of confidence in politics and economics, the forthcoming conclusion of the Basle II Accord and the drafting of a directive, and also the issue of whether Europe will become the financial centre of the world compared with other continents, regardless of the narrow-minded provincial outlook."
"All this requires a very self-confident, objective and persuasive personality capable of engaging in the debate, not only within the ECB."
"We are convinced that you are this person and can achieve the levels of performance required."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports your candidacy and wishes you every success."
"We look forward to what will undoubtedly be very constructive cooperation."
"Thank you, Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be fairly brief."
"The hearing we have had with Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs showed that this lady was very competent and certainly capable of maintaining her crucial role on the European Central Bank's Executive Board."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists will therefore vote in favour of Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell, and we wish her much success in her very difficult work."
"Allow me a more general remark which has nothing to do with Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell's candidacy."
"Until now, all the governors of the European Central Bank have come from the inner circle of central bankers."
"They therefore give the impression of having come from the same mould and sometimes take the same line, and one which, while it is very often sound, does not always reflect the economic realities of this world."
"I know that many MEPs, both in my own and also in other groups, would like to see governors from the financial and commercial worlds, and perhaps even from the world of politics, at the heart of the European Central Bank."
"We should also like to see a lot more women there in addition to Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell alone."
"I would therefore express the wish that, when appointments are next made, the profile of candidates be deepened a little so as to ensure rather more balanced representation within this crucial institution."
"The European Central Bank has so far done some excellent work."
"It has in actual fact made good its wager when it comes to stability."
"That being the case, the ECB's task is not only to maintain stability but also to combat deflation."
"Although it may have defined its stability policy, it has no point of reference for judging when it is necessary to combat recession."
"For my part, I should like the European Central Bank to conduct a much more pragmatic monetary policy on the model of the American Federal Reserve, which combats not only inflation but also recession and which contributes to other American economic policies."
"Madam President, let me begin by saying that Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell is an outstanding candidate for this post."
"It is quite obvious: she has great charisma, she has high-level and demonstrable expertise, and she has a wealth of experience in the field of monetary policy."
"She meets all the requirements to perform her new role in the service of our monetary system and the euro."
"What I particularly liked was that when she was responding to the questions from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, she excelled with her brief, concise and persuasive answers."
"What is also important is that she supports the European Central Bank's basic policy direction, with price stability as the primary objective, and also the new shape of the European Central Bank's pillar structure."
"Mr Goebbels, let me tell you that even the new constitution - in its present Article 21 - states that the European Central Bank must guarantee price stability as its primary objective."
"Of course, it contributes to the achievement of the Union's other goals as well."
"In this respect, the European Central Bank has performed outstanding work to date."
"The euro is a stable currency at domestic level, while its value on the external markets is currently amazing almost the entire financial world."
"What is more, the euro is already making a significant contribution to stabilising the world currency markets."
"The Maastricht Treaty has also proved its worth inasmuch as re-election is not an option, which means that Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell will be appointed for eight years."
"What is particularly appealing is the fact that we will have a lady as the successor to the outgoing female member from Finland; this demonstrates that we are attempting to ensure that women are appointed on an equal basis to high-level positions."
"I am wholeheartedly committed to the central importance of the European Central Bank's objectives."
"In Germany, the largest Member State in the monetary union, it would be a great mistake if we tried to address our acute problems through the simple but extremely dangerous strategy of taking on further debt and raising taxes."
"Of course, I cannot rule out that the time may come when a further cut in interest rates, as part of the European Central Bank's policy on interest rates, may reduce the gap with rates in the United States and stimulate business investment and performance."
"Since the candidate - as Mr Goebbels has indirectly pointed out - also meets the main requirements laid down in the Treaty, namely recognised standing and professional experience in monetary and banking matters, I believe that we can support her appointment with a clear conscience."
"I would like to wish Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell every success, so that Europe can genuinely develop into what we need, namely the most dynamic economic area in the world, offering job opportunities for our young people."
"Madam President, by virtue of the rules of the EC treaty, we on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs heard Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, the Council's recommended candidate for the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, as successor to Sirkka Hämäläinen."
"Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell's curriculum vitae would indicate that she is an excellent choice in terms of the main requirements laid down in the EC Treaty for membership of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, namely personal integrity and recognised standing and professional experience in the monetary and banking field."
"In addition to these formal qualifications, however, there are three factors that would especially favour the choice of Mrs Tumpel-Gugerel for this job."
"Firstly, her enormous experience and impressive levels of expertise were natural prerequisites for the job."
"Even excellent individuals do not succeed on their own merits, however, if their background is felt to be less than favourable."
"It is likely that Austria's good reputation as a competitive Member State driving responsible policies under the leadership of its present government helped in making the choice."
"The Member States of the Union together committed themselves to the Stability and Growth Pact ensuring European competitiveness and economic success."
"The challenges are largely the same in all the Member States: a damagingly inflexible labour market that allows mass unemployment to continue in the Member States of the European Union, and the need to balance state income and expenditure."
"An ageing population will put intolerable financial pressures on our pensions and social welfare systems unless we implement the necessary changes in time."
"The Austrian Government has taken the first important steps to safeguard its public pensions system."
"I wish the Austrian Government luck and success in this work, in spite of the considerable resistance to change."
"The immense importance of public pensions systems is indicated by the fact that it is our poorest citizens in particular who need them most of all to provide for their retirement."
"Secondly, the choice of Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell especially supported the notion that the European Union is a forum of collaboration between Member States of different sizes."
"To ensure that the Union is equal and functions properly it is essential that experts from the small Member States can also participate directly in decision-making."
"As a Finn, I know that the choice of Mrs Tumpel-Gugerel, an Austrian, was the right decision from this point of view also."
"Thirdly, it was not a foregone conclusion that a woman would be chosen to succeed Sirkka Hämäläinen."
"I am pleased that female representation in the European Central Bank's main decision-making body was allowed to continue, and obviously with no compromises being made with regard to expertise and professional skill."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is quite certain that Parliament will confirm Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell's appointment, and will probably do so unanimously."
"I believe that this is a good basis for setting new objectives in this key area of economic policy in future as well."
"At the hearing, we were told that she will work on developing new structures for the future of Europe."
"I met her in person at the debates on Basle II, and there too, she was able to assure us, very competently, that this issue is being taken seriously and that the European Central Bank is certainly also preparing analyses on this topic."
"I think that the issue of Basle II, especially as regards the creditworthiness of small and medium-sized enterprises and the securities they are required to provide, and the introduction of Basle II must be properly prepared, and the European Central Bank will play an important part in doing this."
"For this reason, the inclusion of the social partners in this area is also essential so that the requisite preparations can be made by common consent, for liquidity is naturally very important for the enterprises."
"After all, the wages have to be paid at the end of each month and in many cases, financial arrangements with the banks must be made as a matter of great urgency, and this can only be guaranteed if appropriate securities are provided."
"That is why we want best practice and benchmarking in tax policy as well, so that in future, adequate risk and own capital can be made available to the companies."
"Thank you, Mr Rübig."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon"
"We shall proceed to the vote shortly."
"Mr President, I should like to draw the attention of our Assembly to certain provisions of our regulations that we are going to flout in the next few minutes."
"We are concerned here with Rules 1, 2 and 3 of Chapter 2 of the provisions in force since 1 July 1998 and governing the holding of meetings in parallel with our Parliament's plenary sittings."
"The basic principle is that our Parliament should not organise any meeting of its Members when the plenaries are being held, the rare exceptions being mentioned in Rule 3 and no exception being tolerated in the case of the crucial sittings at which votes are taken."
"I would point out to you that quite a few of our fellow MEPs that are members of the Convention - in theory, 32, consisting of 16 representatives and 16 deputy representatives - have for the most part had to leave this Chamber in order to be present at the important work of the Convention which will begin this afternoon on the premises of our Parliament, but in Brussels."
"So that our fellow MEPs might have done their work both as members of the Convention and as legislators, it would have been enough for the work of the Convention - which our Parliament happily has the privilege of hosting - to take place for once in our Strasbourg buildings."
"Due to our absurd petty squabbling, this morning's votes are going to be tainted with irregularity, because any votes that are passed by a majority lower than or equal to 32 may be suspected of having been distorted."
"I leave it to you to be the judges of the possible legal and political consequences of this."
"In conclusion, I would also point out to you that, if we do not take steps, this same regrettable situation is going to occur again at our plenary on Thursday 5 June."
"Mr Onesta, I think a copy of your speech should be sent to the Chairman of the Convention, Mr Giscard d'Estaing."
"Personally, I do not share the opinion expressed in the second part of your speech regarding the conformity of the votes we are about to take."
"The next item is voting time."
"There is a problem with the report by Mr Schmitt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the prevention of money laundering by means of customs cooperation."
"I propose, pursuant to Rule 111(2) of the Rules of Procedure, to deal with it without a debate and put it to the vote later."
"Mr President, there is absolutely no reason for this."
"The fact is that time was scheduled for this afternoon."
"The report was supposed to be dealt with this afternoon and the speakers have been listed."
"I see absolutely no objective reason to postpone it."
"Mr Schmitt wishes to take the floor to explain his reasons."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Posselt, in agreement with the shadow rapporteur, Mr Schmid from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we felt it was more appropriate to vote this afternoon when most of the Members are here."
"There was a lengthy discussion on this matter in the committee and this report is largely uncontentious."
"After all, there are no further proposed amendments, and that was why I felt it was sensible, and would ask the plenary to agree, that the vote be held this afternoon when all the Members are still here."
"Mr President, I just want to say that this sets a dangerous precedent."
"We can propose in advance that the report be dealt with without a debate if it is uncontentious, but a debate on the report was envisaged and so a debate should take place."
"The House has decided, Mr Posselt."
"I do not consider a decision by the House to be a dangerous precedent; it would seem to me to be a perfectly normal way of proceeding."
"Mr President, I would like to spring to Mr Posselt's aid."
"There have been other precedents, dangerous precedents, which were agreed by plenary."
"The mere fact that plenary has decided something does not mean that it is not a dangerous precedent."
"Mr President, I have just two comments to make."
"Firstly, the German translation of recital A is incorrect, so please use the English version here."
"A further point is this: in our calls to the Commission, a mistake has crept in to paragraph 2."
"I would ask you to delete the following words, as they make no sense in legal terms. After the words 'WIPO Treaty', the following four words - 'on Performances and Phonograms (WPPT)' must be deleted."
"It is incorrect."
"'WIPO Treaty' should stand, and the following four words plus the parentheses must be deleted."
"Mr President, this involves replacing the English sentence 'that do not reduce' with the following sentence 'in order that they do not reduce'."
"That is all."
"- (ES) This involves replacing the adjective 'High', qualifying the noun 'representative', with the adjective 'Single'."
"The phrase would then be: 'Single representative' and not 'High representative'."
"That concludes voting time."
"I have received from the Conference of Presidents the list of observers appointed in Parliamentary committees."
"The list of names will appear in today's Minutes."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
". (PT) The European Central Bank (ECB), a symbol of the monetary orthodoxy that we have witnessed in Europe, is one of the least democratic institutions, not only because its policy-making is free of any democratic control, but also because it is the only Community institution in which not all Member States are represented on the Executive Board."
"The recent changes to its decision-making procedure, establishing a rotating system, have removed permanent voting rights from members of the Central Bank's Governing Council, distancing some countries, such as Portugal, even further from decision-making on monetary policy - an approach that we reject."
"We therefore hoped that replacing one member of the Executive Board, in this case by Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell, an Austrian, might help to change the current situation."
"If we study the answers she gave to the parliamentary questionnaire, however, what emerges is her unconditional support for the monetary and budgetary orthodoxy in force."
"She believes, for example, that the best contribution she can make to the economy is to apply the Stability Pact and insists that the ECB focuses on price stability."
"This means that everything will carry on just as before."
"Money laundering is a major problem because it is a method used by criminal groups and terrorists to finance their activities."
"We Moderates have today voted against Mr Schmitt's report because we believe that the stated legal basis is inadequate."
". (PT) We have become increasingly concerned about money laundering, which constitutes a source of funding for international terrorism and crime."
"We know that cash is crossing borders as a result of the absence of controls that would allow movements to be monitored along the entire length of the Community frontier."
"The directive on money laundering lays down controls on transactions carried out by financial institutions involving sums of EUR 15 000 or more but not on cash movements."
"This must be achieved by other means, such as introducing controls over cash movements across the Community border, creating uniform rules, plugging loopholes and seeking to balance the need for these controls with the need to protect the internal market and the free movement of capital."
"What is required is a Community-based approach, but one which respects, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, Member States' freedom to choose the procedure that suits them."
"Defining the objectives and rules to be complied with should be done at Community level, but the way in which these are implemented should be left to the discretion of each Member State."
". (PT) The lack of mechanisms for monitoring the unrestricted movement of capital, the creation of instruments for obviating prudential rules and the presence of considerable sums of money in tax havens all contribute to the abuse of the financial system and facilitate the laundering of money that represents the proceeds of crime, especially trafficking in drugs, arms and human beings, making the role of organised crime in today's capitalism abundantly clear."
"In 1995, the World Bank estimated that money laundering accounted for between USD 300 billion and USD 500 billion, not counting estimated tax evasion."
"More recently, the IMF suggested a figure of between 2% and 5% of world GDP, in other words, between USD 600 billion and USD 1500 billion."
"Combating money laundering requires, specifically, the political will to control and effectively tax international movements of capital."
"Although this proposal is limited, it is a step in the right direction, promoting the harmonisation of customs procedures, with the aim not only of supplementing the supervision of cross-border fund transfers by financial institutions, but also of monitoring cash movements at or above the threshold of EUR 15 000, which warrants our support."
"British Conservatives have been in the forefront of the fight against international criminality including previous anti-money laundering initiatives."
"However, we believe that these measures go too far and are too restrictive on the freedom to transfer small sums of money and securities across European borders."
"The proposal's negative impact on legitimate transactions on this occasion outweighs the suggested benefits against money laundering."
"Therefore, British Conservatives will abstain on the final votes."
"- (DA) The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is able to support many of the proposed measures in the directive but is not in favour of its being possible to sell milk and meat from vaccinated animals within the common market on the basis of current technological capacity. We also believe that consumers are entitled to opt not to buy vaccinated meat."
"The change from the current policy of non-vaccination to one permitting emergency vaccination also requires the international agreement to be strengthened that guarantees full utilisation of the regionalisation principle, so that exports from EU countries not affected by foot-and-mouth disease can continue."
". (PT) Where farming is concerned, 2001 was marked by the speed and the scale of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the EU, in particular in the United Kingdom."
"We recall the burning pyres and the mass slaughter of animals which, apart from the environmental, economic and public health consequences, caused enormous social disruption in the countries affected."
"Two things are clear: health policy cannot be determined by commercial issues and a strategy for combating the disease that provides only for preventive culling, ignoring new scientific developments, is unacceptable from the ethical point of view."
"This outbreak, in conjunction with the other food and health crises that have beset the EU (BSE, dioxins, sewage slurry, nitrofurans, etc), demonstrates the bankruptcy of the current model of agricultural development and the consequences of a CAP based on exports, on bringing prices down and on opening up the markets."
"The transport of live animals, the closure of local abattoirs, the lack of border controls and the elimination of production at local level are only some of the problems."
"Hence our broad support, reinforcing our budgetary proposal, which is intended to establish an agricultural disaster fund, acknowledged in part by the rapporteur when he suggests that a European animal health fund should be created."
". (EL) The new proposal for a directive presents important differences in comparison with the perception that has applied to date for combating foot-and-mouth disease and moves in a more positive direction."
"The most basic difference is that the use of vaccines as a basic measure for combating foot-and-mouth disease is permitted, while measures to isolate, ban movements and culling, which were the only measures allowed to date, are treated as supplementary measures."
"Similarly, it establishes the marginalisation of the countries in which the disease appears and requires even greater veterinarian monitoring and more staff with the necessary flexibility."
"We are opposed, however, to the provision which allows the European Commission to decide about vaccines or refer the matter to a Community body for a decision to be taken on its own, even without the assent of the Member State in question."
"The Member States and the competent national services are the only authorities competent to evaluate the problem and promote measures to deal with it."
"Space science and technology have offered mankind a great deal, in the form of both new knowledge and advanced technology and everyday applications (telecommunications, surveys of the earth and the atmosphere, navigation)."
"European countries have made a particularly important contribution along the way: to launching systems, to research, to applications."
"However, further development is threatened by the fact that the driving force is the commercial exploitation of space services and applications."
"Thus, operating under the conditions and the rules of the free market and liberalisation, the aerospace industry in Europe is in danger of shrinking as the result of competition from mainly American companies."
"Many people forecast the development of military space applications within the framework of the EU's common defence and security policy."
"The ?U also often cites the requirements of the space industry in order to justify the military use of space."
"The Communist Party of Greece is categorically opposed to any such prospect, which will result in further militarisation of space with the ?U leading the way."
"We are in favour of the exclusively peaceful use of space and public funding for the relevant activities."
"Further development cannot be accomplished within the framework of the market; it must have as its incentive not commercial profit but the development of activities for the benefit of mankind as a whole."
". (PT) Space is a unique platform from which we can carry out observations and experiments that are of the utmost importance to our understanding of nature, to promoting people's well-being and to protecting this blue planet of ours."
"Research and technology must not be developed under conditions imposed by competition and the market."
"Public investment and the public sector are crucial to ensuring that the achievements and advances made are designed to serve the common good and that everyone benefits from them."
"Space-related activities must serve only peaceful purposes, and we therefore reaffirm our opposition to the militarisation of space (in particular under the CFSP and ESDP) and call for policies that use space to be based on the non-proliferation of weapons and on renouncing the use of weapons."
"We support the development of a space policy based on cooperation and on the coordinated efforts of various countries, particularly in Europe, and we therefore believe that the European Space Agency must retain its independent nature, and not become an EU institution."
"We also believe that public investment in this field must be increased."
"I would just like to explain why I abstained in the vote on the resolution on the search made of the headquarters of the Human Rights Association of Turkey."
"It is true that Turkey is flouting human rights under the pretext of combating terrorism. It is doing so, as you are quite aware, in the Kurdish issue."
"I am a friend of the Kurds and I consider this search to be scandalous."
"Why did I abstain, then?"
"I abstained because we need to put our own house in order."
"Exactly the same thing is happening in Spain and in the Basque country in the name of combating terrorism, and Parliament is turning a blind eye."
"We have not managed to hold a single debate on the banning of the only Basque newspaper, Egunkaria."
"This newspaper was banned and its journalists thrown into prison by a magistrate on the pretext that they were collaborating with ETA, but this claim is absolutely unfounded."
"Egunkaria is merely a newspaper."
"Therefore, let us put our own house in order."
"That is why I abstained."
". (PT) We are extremely concerned at the situation in Turkey, where the population is fighting to attain democracy."
"We condemn certain unacceptable situations, such as the recent bans on activity by political organisations, the existence of countless prisoners accused of fighting for democracy and to end the military dictatorship in Turkey, the repression of demonstrations and the constant intimidation, threats and persecution to which progressive activists and organisations are subjected. One example is the recent repressive action against the Human Rights Association of Turkey."
"Once again, we wish to express our solidarity with the Turkish people and we will pursue our attempts to contribute, particularly in the context of activity undertaken by the GUE/NGL Group, to stepping up actions to support the struggle being waged by progressive forces in Turkey."
"We reiterate the call for the immediate release of Leyla Zana and of three other Kurdish former members of the Turkish parliament who are undergoing a re-trial in Ankara, which opened on 28 March 2003, following the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights."
"It should be noted that our group has followed this trial from the beginning, with the European Parliament deciding to do so only later."
". (FR) I refused to vote for the joint resolution, which is the product of non-transparent bartering between groups."
"We cannot discuss EU-Russia relations without mentioning the situation in the Caucasus."
"Do we need the results of the ad hoc committee to condemn the abuses in Chechnya?"
"Is there any meaning left to the Tacis Democracy Programme when the Russian authorities organised an undemocratic referendum (90% in favour) in Chechnya?"
"The electoral campaign was not pluralist because voting 'no' was considered by the federal troops to be supporting the terrorists."
"The electoral process was marked by numerous failures to comply with democratic rules."
"Several thousand Russian soldiers voted. Pressure was put on the inhabitants and refugees to force them to vote 'yes'."
"We must establish as conditions for political cooperation with Russia a cease-fire, an end to the bloody oppression by the Russian army and a negotiation process with a view to putting an end to military operations and seeking a political solution."
"Lastly, the European Parliament must stand absolutely firm regarding the fate of the Chechen refugees in Ingushetia."
"They are being threatened with being forced to return to Chechnya, in violation of the rights recognised by the Geneva Conventions on war refugees."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Although it is already a reality in the EU, as proved by the Directive on emissions trading, the Kyoto Protocol needs to be ratified by Russia in order actually to enter into force."
"Unfortunately, Russia, unlike more than 100 States, has not yet kept its promise to ratify the Protocol."
"The damaging consequences of delaying the Kyoto Protocol's entry into force with regard to alleviating the effects of global climate change, and also with regard to the competitiveness of businesses are obvious."
"The more States that are involved, the lower the cost of complying with Kyoto will be."
"The carbon economy must be a reality throughout the world and not only in Europe."
"I therefore hope that the EU, which in Bonn and Marrakech was able to rescue the Kyoto Protocol from certain death, will also be able to give the utmost priority to the need to convince Russia to ratify this Protocol."
"Mr President, Mr van den Berg has tabled a scholarly, competent report on the Commission proposal on education and training in the context of poverty reduction in developing countries."
"I could not fail to vote for the report, so that education can be provided and poverty reduced in developing countries."
"I would point out to the President and the House - so many Members are present, as always, during my explanations of vote - that there are poor countries with a few wealthy inhabitants and wealthy countries with a few poor inhabitants."
"I would like Europe to help, in particular, the poor inhabitants of the poor countries and the poor inhabitants of the wealthy countries, for they all have the right to assistance, and I would especially like Europe to check up on what happens to the money given to them."
"Most of all, however, I would like to inform the House that retired teachers associations throughout Europe are offering their disinterested, free help, offering to teach, to pass on the knowledge that they have acquired over a lifetime's work to all those in the developing countries who wish to learn in order to increase the prosperity of their states."
". (EL) No one doubts the role of education in reducing poverty."
"The problem lies in how to safeguard the access to education of hundreds of millions of children, how can education be made to serve development."
"The Commission communication and the report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, despite the positive findings and proposals, are no more than a wish list."
"Even if, as proposed, aid is increased, it is just crumbs, a philanthropic gesture, in the face of the real needs of developing countries."
"The development of the grass-roots movement against globalisation and poverty has resulted in frequent discussion of the situation in developing countries."
"The ?U wants to show that it is listening to the protests, that it is interested in combating poverty, in order to improve its image in the eyes of the people, in order to wipe out old and new crimes."
"However, there is no discussion of who is responsible, nothing is heard about the consequences of long-term colonialism or of how natural wealth continues to be plundered and people robbed."
"The attempt, through the WTO, to impose terms which benefit big business is undiminished."
"Nothing is said about foreign debt."
"The Communist Party of Greece does not believe in the charity of the ?U. It is the fight of the peoples itself which will get them out of poverty and lead them to development."
". (PT) The European Union played a leading role at the Johannesburg Summit."
"The ongoing credibility of this leadership depends, however, on the rigour and the speed with which the Johannesburg commitments are met, in terms of eradicating extreme poverty, of promoting access to drinking water and sanitation, of changing standards of consumption and production, of reversing the loss of biodiversity and of funding development."
"If, however, we wish to be credible partners in the eyes of the developing countries and if we wish to narrow the shocking divide between living conditions in the two hemispheres, we must also take action on training and education, on debt relief and funding for the poorest countries, on eradicating trade barriers and on gradually eliminating our subsidies to agriculture, fisheries and energy."
"In this regard, the European Union can get a head start, setting an example by reforming the common agricultural policy, but must not fail to exert pressure on the United States to do the same with regard to its own farming subsidies."
". (PT) This initiative by the European Parliament's Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport is timely and warrants our support."
"As a matter of fact, it is hard to understand why the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Treaties and Conventions dedicate an enormous range of rights and protection to musical authors, performers and producers and even to radio broadcasting organisations and do not do the same for audio-visual performers, who have no international rights other than a single payment for their work."
"This lack of protection abroad is due to the absence of any international harmonisation of international rights and it is regrettable that the WIPO Diplomatic Conference, held in December 2000, ended without a final agreement being reached on this matter."
"We have therefore agreed with the EP resolution not only with regard to the Commission providing information on the current state of WIPO negotiations, bearing in mind the informal meeting of June 2003, but also for the Commission to 'take action to reach the adoption of an effective WIPO-Treaty in favour of audio-visual performers' rights' and to encourage, more generally, the protection of performers' rights."
"We have chosen to vote in favour of the report on the Broad Guidelines of the Economic Policies of the Member States and the Community."
"The report as a whole is sound."
"We do not, however, agree with certain of the points, to the effect that there must be greater wage flexibility and that it would be good to reduce the overall tax rates in the EU."
"Nor do we support the view that the Commission and the other institutions of the EU must be given further executive influence over the Lisbon process and economic policy."
"We are also opposed to the appointment of a high representative of the euro area."
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr Posselt has the floor."
"Mr President, I did not want to say anything about the Minutes, but before you come to the Minutes, I would like to come back briefly to the procedure adopted this morning in respect of the vote."
"During the lunch break, I checked again to see which of the Rules of Procedure could be the basis for holding the vote on the Schmitt report - which was firmly on the agenda for this afternoon - at midday without a debate."
"I failed to find in the Rules of Procedure any rule which, in my view, would cover this procedure."
"I therefore wish to request the Bureau to notify me formally which article in the Rules of Procedure formed the basis for this morning's decision."
"Mr Posselt, Rule 111(2) of the Rules of Procedure is relevant to your concern."
"This paragraph states 'Once adopted, the agenda may not be amended except in pursuance of Rules 112 and 143 to 147, or on a proposal from the President' I believe this clarifies the issue."
"Mr Wieland has the floor."
"I would like to take up the matter raised by Mr Posselt."
"The President's phrasing - and I will take the liberty of checking the Minutes from this morning - did not imply that the President endorsed the proposer's concern."
"The phrasing was this: 'Does the House have any objectives?'"
"That means that the precise case described in the Rules of Procedure did not apply."
"As a Member of Parliament, I refuse to be passed around this House like a surplus tomato in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I have groups to attend, we have invitations, and we have meetings."
"Votes and other matters are constantly being postponed, especially on a Thursday."
"I do not think that we should simply rely on decisions by the Administration which are ultimately whispered in the President's ear."
"We even have votes - every Member from every group has been affected by this - where there is an asterisk and a note saying 'This proposal is out of order under paragraph so and so', so no vote is taken."
"Who is making the decisions here?"
"We - the people looking at you - are the European Union's elected representatives."
"Apart from you, distinguished President at the front, the people looking at us are supposed to be reporting to us."
"'Reporting to' does not mean making decisions for us."
"I therefore fully support Mr Posselt on this issue."
"Yes, your comments have been noted and will be dealt with appropriately."
"Mr Korakas has the floor."
"Mr President, before the order of business I must announce that the riot of criminal attacks being carried out by the Israeli army in Palestine and the occupied territories included a savage attack at midnight on 10 March on the offices of the Palestinian People's Party in Ramallah."
"This attack is not the first."
"There have previously been similar attacks in Nablous, Toulkarem, Salfit, Kalkilia and Jenin."
"The Jordanian Communist Party has announced that the Israelis' objective is to hit the Palestinian People's Party, which is fighting and is continuing to fight for a fair solution to the question on the basis of the UN resolutions against Israeli aggression, the occupation and the war crimes being perpetrated by the Israeli army."
"We agree with or subscribe to this announcement and express our solidarity with the Palestinian People's Party and the Palestinian people in general, who are being given a particularly hard time at the moment by the Sharon regime, which is taking advantage of the fact that the world's attention has turned elsewhere, including to Iraq, in order to promote and complete its crime."
"Mr President, I call for your and Parliament's support so that there is a reaction and this sort of arrogance stops."
"Mr President, I apologise for coming back to the issue I raised before."
"Thank you very much for precisely citing the article to which reference was made."
"However, like Mr Wieland, I take the view that this refers to other articles, all of which I have read and which have nothing to do with the procedure adopted this morning."
"Then there is the option of a proposal by the President."
"I would like to know whether what happened this morning was a proposal by the President and was based on a decision by the Bureau, or whether the President decided to move such a proposal spontaneously."
"We must recognise one thing: the Rules of Procedure deliberately make amendments to the agreed agenda difficult, for after all, they should not occur all the time."
"On the other hand, obstacles are deliberately erected and, as we must acknowledge, there are minority rights as well."
"If, for example, the Conference of Presidents decides that no debate should take place on an issue, it is possible to counter this with 32 votes."
"In other words, very carefully balanced rights exist which also make it possible to proceed against a short-lived majority."
"These obstacles are deliberate."
"The only possible exception is 'a proposal by the President'."
"Here, the question which also arises is whether that is correct."
"I therefore request you to clarify, firstly, whether this was a proposal by the President, and, secondly, whether it was based on a decision by the Bureau."
"Thirdly, I doubt whether this is an adequate legal basis for this procedure."
"Mr Posselt, I understand this was done further to a proposal from the President, pursuant to Rule 111(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr Schmitt had previously consulted the President."
"There was in fact a sufficient majority to take the decision."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission, referring to postal services:"
"B5-0090/2003 by Mr Simpson and Mr Savary, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists; and"
"B5-0093/2003 by Mr Sterckx, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"Mr President, I should like to apologise for Mr Sterckx's absence."
"I wish him well in Sunday's elections."
"I do not like nuclear options, to use the term adopted by someone in Mr Bolkestein's cabinet to refer to Mr Monti's proposal to force the postal market to split its activities."
"Only recently did I find out that nuclear options or nuclear explosions are not always dangerous."
"Thailand is about to decide on digging a canal right across the country, just like the Suez or Panama Canal."
"This mechanical excavation work would certainly cost 20 billion."
"The Japanese are very interested because this would save them USD 300 000 annually if oil tankers heading for Japan would no longer need to pass through the perilous strait of Malacca."
"The Japanese subsequently suggested helping to build it by removing a number of difficult mountains along the way by means of a few friendly nuclear explosions."
"This would cut down the building costs to 3 billion."
"As you can see, the nuclear option does not always cause as much damage as we imagine."
"The Commission has applied Article 86 before, notably in the early nineties, to the telecom sector."
"This worked well then."
"The liberalisation of the telecom sector is still known as one of the most appealing successes of European policy of the nineties."
"To me, Mr Monti's proposal is therefore aimed at the Council, which will now have to take some serious decisions concerning the liberalisation of the postal services."
"The fact that the EP is being by-passed with this proposal is not easy for me, and cannot be dismissed just like that."
"Nevertheless, together with the European Commission, I am turning my gaze to the Council, for they are the ones that matter in this case."
"With regard to the universal provision of services by postal companies, Mr Bolkestein once mentioned the compensation fund which could be a purely mechanical way of solving the problem of cross-subsidisation at the coalface."
"It will therefore remain possible, Monsieur Savary, to send a letter to the remotest corner of Provence."
"Does the Commission intend to table further proposals in this area?"
"Would a compensation fund of this kind then be able to run parallel to the Commission's recent proposal?"
"As for the plans to impose VAT on public post office services, I should like to point out that these post offices can also deduct the VAT from services they would need to pay for."
"In addition, the plans provide for the possibility of charging a lower VAT rate."
"With reparations and new-fangled proposals of this kind, we will not achieve a sufficiently effective and decisive policy in Europe in a hurry, not to mention the Lisbon objectives."
"Surely we wanted a dynamic Europe?"
"Let us, then, try to send out a signal that the European Parliament will make every effort to give this economic sector in Europe, which is currently in difficult waters, a shot in the arm."
"I do hope that we will stand united and attach more importance to the goal that we want to achieve than to these methods, which may be needed just once to make true progress."
"Thank you very much Mr Vermeer."
"I am sorry, but I had two minutes more for you later during group time."
"In any case, you have already used three minutes."
". Mr President, promoting competition in the postal market to the benefit of consumers is one of the declared priorities of the Commission."
"I am pleased to have the opportunity, speaking also on behalf of my colleague, Mr Monti, to summarise and explain our policy to Parliament today."
"In its work programme for this year, the Commission had, subsequent to recent competition decisions regarding the postal sector, foreseen to reflect on introducing more transparency in the relationship between incumbents' activities inside and outside the universal service in the postal sector."
"The Commission is at present still evaluating this question."
"However, as you know, the Commission will be publishing in the coming months a Green Paper on services of general interest."
"Given the wide debate which has already accompanied this initiative and that will certainly follow the publication of the Green Paper, the Commission would like to re-evaluate its proposal for a directive on transparency in postal services in the light of the results of the above-mentioned debate."
"Therefore, the Commission has decided to withdraw it from its work programme for 2003."
"In any event, whatever the result of this further analysis, should the Commission decide to go on with the project, this evaluation will not result in the introduction of new, substantive obligations for postal operators but only in transparency obligations to enable the Commission to monitor anti-competitive practices throughout the Community."
"Mr President, I would not normally rise to speak on this issue, which is handled very competently by my colleague Mr Ferber, who is one of the most vigorous champions of postal service liberalisation, but who also works tirelessly to ensure that the customer's interests and rights and consumer protection are taken seriously in the European Union."
"I have risen today because I believe that we really must press hard - as my fellow Members have pointed out - to ensure absolute transparency."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for the plans that she has announced."
"However, it must be said that such transparency has often been, and continues to be, sorely missed in both the Commission and especially the Council, although, of course, we also demand absolute transparency from the postal services as well."
"Moreover, and I fully endorse what my fellow Members have said on this issue, we of course need Parliament to be in a strong position in terms of its legal status."
"We need codecision."
"We must be quite clear about this, because no one else, apart from this House, represents the interests of postal service users adequately."
"I would like to make one thing quite clear: the reports which have appeared in the media in the last few days - my fellow Member has already mentioned them - which claim that value added tax is to be imposed on postage stamps really are designed to generate anti-European feeling among European Union citizens."
"I really do urge you to bury these plans as swiftly as possible."
"I do not mean that you should play them down, I mean that you should bury them."
"I do not think that it is the European Union's task to put forward this type of proposal, which is completely half-baked and really only has an impact on consumers."
"Secondly, let me say this: we must ensure - and this too has already been mentioned - that the postal services, notwithstanding all the liberalisation which we are trying to achieve, of course also continue to have a key social function."
"As we know, our society is increasingly fragmenting into those who can make dynamic use of modern technology and those who cannot."
"We must not forget the people in peripheral regions, the socially weak, and the increasing numbers of old people."
"The age pyramid is turning on its head."
"In many Member States, the postal systems seem to combine all the disadvantages of the old state monopolies with the shortcomings of the new liberalised market, instead of creating synergies by drawing on the positive aspects of both new systems."
"This clearly demonstrates the problems associated with the current transition period, especially for customers, as well as the serious lack of transparency."
"Let me give you just one example: Deutsche Post removed large numbers of post boxes throughout Germany by stealth."
"In my electoral district, there is a hotel called 'Zur Post', which has provided postal services for centuries."
"Overnight, its post box was dismantled, causing damage to the building's façade."
"The licensee, whose family has operated a posthouse in conjunction with the hotel for centuries, was deliberately not informed."
"Just imagine the scenario: so many post boxes have been removed that the ones in Munich are now overflowing."
"It has actually become impossible to post a letter in the city centre at certain times of the day: the number of post boxes has been cut back to such an extent that they are completely full by the afternoon."
"That is not competition."
"That is not customer-friendly conduct."
"It shows that there is also still a tendency to think in terms of the old monopoly structures while ruthlessly ignoring what was perhaps their social dimension, namely the provision of a service to citizens and a service to customers."
"I therefore believe that we need as much market as possible, as quickly as possible."
"We need as much transparency as possible as quickly as possible."
"However, we also need minimum standards of consumer protection in areas where the market alone cannot regulate the problems that arise, which means the areas I have described, in particular."
"I therefore believe that it is essential to press ahead with this process, not only through communications and Green Papers and so forth, but by working in close cooperation with the European Parliament on a legal basis which enables us, the only legitimate representatives of the European citizens and hence the postal service users, properly to monitor this complex process, which profoundly affects the life of every individual, and ensure that it is economically profitable, socially just, and compatible with people's needs."
"Mr President, for the sake of clarity, I would like to repeat that we do not intend to present a proposal on this subject in our work programme for 2003."
"However, the whole debate will continue within the context of the launching of the Green Paper."
"I would also like to clarify that this initiative was launched against the backdrop of competition concerns regarding the postal sector brought to light in recent European case law and by the Commission."
"From the outset, this initiative was conceived as a means of enforcing competition law and not as a legislative measure."
"We are fully aware of the limits of the power of the Commission and of the European Union in what we can decide in this case."
"More generally, the Commission considered on the one hand that the situation in the postal market could engender various forms of abusive behaviour by public postal operators."
"On the other hand, it considered it would be worth exploring whether extending the transparency requirements in question to all incumbents might adequately assuage these concerns."
"The debate will definitely continue."
"I will of course also make sure that my colleague, Mario Monti, is informed of all your best arguments, and we will have an opportunity to come back to this discussion."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The next item is debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following draft resolutions on the Democratic Republic of the Congo - Ituri Region:"
"B5-0241/2003 by Johan Van Hecke and Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the situation in the Ituri Region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo;"
"B5-0243/2003 by Nelly Maes, Didier Rod and Marie Anne Isler Béguin, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the situation in Ituri (DRC);"
"B5-0249/2003 by Thierry Cornillet, Philippe Morillon and Bernd Posselt, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the state of human rights in the Ituri region of the DRC;"
"B5-0252/2003 by Francisca Sauquillo Pérez del Arco and Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the situation in Ituri (DRC);"
"B5-0257/2003 by Joaquim Miranda, Fodé Sylla, Jonas Sjöstedt, Luigi Vinci and Armando Cossutta, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the situation in the Ituri region of the DRC;"
"B5-0258/2003 by Isabelle Caullery, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on the situation in the Ituri region, DRC."
"Congo is a jungle where people behave like animals and where only the law of the jungle applies."
"The country is massive, rich in resources and has virtually no state structure that can guarantee stability and security for the population."
"Foreign troops and national militia, with countless child soldiers among them, have free play to plunder the country of its assets of gold, uranium, oil and diamonds to their heart's content, destroy fields and villages, rape women and girls on a massive scale and assist one ethnic population group in massacring another."
"The last shred of civilisation has left Congo."
"Even animals do not behave like this towards each other in the animal world."
"The human suffering is too awful for words: more than 2 million casualties and many times more injured, traumatised women and countless AIDS and malaria victims."
"How does the international community respond?"
"It sends a handful of lightly-armed UN soldiers, described by Uganda's President, Mr Museveni, as constituting a worthless mission."
"According to him, they stay in their cars while, 50 metres further along, people are being gunned down."
"On the diplomatic front, agreements are made about the withdrawal of troops and national reconciliation, but these result in precisely more fighting and more irreconcilability."
"Since the Ugandan soldiers left Ituri, massacres, plundering and rape have become the order of the day there too."
"This must stop at all costs."
"A well-equipped international armed force must be set up to assist MONUC and with an extensive mandate to protect the population as a matter of extreme urgency."
"We certainly do not only need French soldiers."
"Only far-reaching federalisation of the country with strong, regional governments can provide an answer."
"The European Union must insist on this."
"Without drastic reforms, without an actual, working state structure, the Congolese population is at the mercy of the wild animals among people, and only the rule of the jungle applies."
"Mr President, the massacres in Ituri are extremely serious events and should indeed be one of the subjects in our debate on human rights."
"We in the Group of the Party of European Socialists denounce once again the use of the rape of women and girls as a weapon of war and the recruitment of child soldiers."
"We denounce the problems concerning access to humanitarian aid and the presence of foreign troops on the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
"Finally, we denounce the neighbouring countries supporting the armed groups operating within the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
"I would also like to draw attention to the peace process and to the urgency of supporting it, further to the so-called Final Act adopted on 2 April in South Africa."
"We must not fail to see the wood for the trees."
"These massacres must not deter us from working for peace in the long term."
"The government of national unity provided for in the peace agreement must be formed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
"The country needs an integrating government able to compel armed groups to withdraw."
"The best means of achieving peace is to form a solid and stable integrating government."
"The peace agreement timetable provided for the formation of the government of national unity on 28 May."
"The parties and the rebel groups have presented their lists to the Government."
"Paradoxically however, it is Mr Kabila's government that is dragging its feet."
"Once again, I would urge the Congolese authorities to comply with the terms and timetable in the peace agreement."
"Similar problems are delaying the formation of a Parliament."
"The measures required to form a Parliament by 10 June, the date set in the peace agreement, are not being taken."
"Further, it has become evident that the mandate of the United Nations Observation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) must be amended, as was previously proposed."
"The United Nations has a mere 5 000 men deployed in a huge country."
"The MONUC mandate needs to be extended to allow UN troops to intervene between the warring parties."
"At present they are only there as observers to monitor the cease-fire."
"In addition, UN troops should be allowed to intervene to protect the civilian population if necessary."
"This must however remain a United Nations mission."
"Under no circumstances should foreign troops be deployed, especially troops from countries with interests in the Great Lakes region."
"French troops must also abide by the MONUC mandate."
"Clearly, the presence of foreign troops in this area has been at the root of many of the conflicts that laid waste to the region, including the Rwandan genocide."
"Consequently, it is necessary to ensure that the United Nations alone is responsible for guaranteeing peace."
"I therefore believe the House must continue to insist on this."
"I would like to take this opportunity to call upon the Commission to direct as much humanitarian aid as possible to help the civil population of the region."
"These people have been suffering for a very long time."
"Mr President, it seems that Africa is neglected by the UN and the rest of the world."
"Two tribes, the Hemas and the Lendys have been fighting in the town of Bunia in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"Hundreds of people have been injured."
"Many people have been killed and yet, despite the presence of French troops and UN troops in DRC, they are still fighting, they are still killing and there is much trouble and displacement of the population."
"The key to all this, as I have said many times before in Parliament, is that until rural areas in Africa have security in terms of land, the economy, rural assets and rural development, there will always be conflict."
"There will be no democracy in Africa until people have something they can call their own, a stake in the local economies."
"We are trying to encourage democracy in these countries."
"Democracy cannot filter from the presidential palace down to the rural areas."
"It has to grow from rural areas and until we improve the economies of the rural areas, until we provide security for these people through land tenure, through police, a chamber of commerce, political representation, local schools, local hospitals - assets that they can call their own - conflict will continue."
"We seem to turn a blind eye to this."
"I have been an MEP now for four years."
"I have lived in Africa for many years."
"My family has been there for 170 years and I know what it is like in the rural areas."
"It is about time the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers recognise that Africa is not like the US or Europe, where democracy can be understood."
"You knock on any mud hut in any part of Africa and tell the inhabitant that you have come from the European Parliament."
"Tell him: 'here are your rights, rights for your women, rights for your children, rights for you to assemble, to worship, to have democracy in your parliament.'"
"As I found out with Mr Goebbels and Mr Van den Bos when we went to Ethiopia, these people ask only for water, seed, peace and security."
"At the moment they have no stake in their economies."
"Any rebel leader can come along and say: 'I will give you a hundred dollars, come with me, let us go and plunder, let us go and loot, let us go and fight', and they of course fall prey to that."
"We see this in Uganda, we see this in Somalia, we see this in Ethiopia and Eritrea, we see it in Kenya, we see it in Central Africa."
"Mr President, the wars going on in the Congo are tribal wars - ethnic wars - which, in terms of their duration and the devastation they cause, are basically comparable to Europe's religious wars of the seventeenth century, such as the Thirty Years War."
"The Congo has been called a continent in a continent and the disaster there is indeed taking place on a continental scale."
"The Ituri region should be one of the most beautiful in the world."
"If peace were to prevail, it could be a centre of tourism and prosperity."
"That is why - and I would like to make this very clear - our task is not to point the finger arrogantly at others but to provide help by attempting to deploy our troops in the country as part of a robust peacekeeping mission."
"We really cannot leave this task to the French, no matter how grateful we should be to them."
"At present, we spend a great deal of time arguing over the role of the UN."
"We are moving towards an odd situation in which major powers want to create legitimacy and the UN, with all its shortcomings, is expected to provide the instruments."
"It has to be the other way round."
"The UN must provide legitimacy and the world's major stabilising factors must attempt to supply the instruments."
"For example, a politically and militarily united Europe, in partnership with the United States, can be a peacebuilding factor there, but a group of troops slung together arbitrarily without a mandate cannot."
"This is not an isolated or indeed a minor problem."
"In Africa, survival is the problem, and the Congo is its most acute manifestation."
"These conflicts are also inflamed, not least, by vested interests in the country's resources."
"We cannot leave the task to the Congo's neighbours, for in many cases, there are ethnic groups in these countries who also have an interest in fanning the flames of conflict in the Congo."
"As we have seen, the borders are artificial, with ethnically homogeneous peoples living on both sides of them."
"If there is to be peace, there has to be a new order, and we must make a robust and substantial contribution to achieving this at last."
"Mr President, too many people have died in this conflict, killed in a war of fratricide and poverty: out of three and a half million inhabitants two and a half have been dispersed, there are rapes, summary executions and enforced conscription of children to the army and military groups."
"This death and destruction weigh like lead weights on our consciences too."
"We cannot fail to feel responsible for the neglect, the indifference, the interests of our multinationals who are greedy for this large country's resources, the colonial heritage, the misdeeds of the international and native communities which are, in reality, mixed, for neither is blameless."
"We must act."
"The peace agreements are in jeopardy, and the different parties fighting are to blame for this in a number of ways, particularly where the various countries have failed to withdraw troops."
"There must be no more massacres like that which claimed hundreds of victims on 3 April 2003."
"Kofi Annan has reminded us that the perpetrators of criminal acts must answer for their actions to the international community."
"That is why we too must step up our efforts to create an international criminal court to try the perpetrators of such crimes."
"In my opinion, it is necessary to support and give effect to the calls of various social groupings and movements for MONUC to be given more power and a higher profile."
"It must fulfil its mandate by taking practical action, implementing peacekeeping measures in the territory, to ensure that there are no more massacres and to guarantee the security of the people, so that the situation in Ituri, where MONUC did nothing and was unable to act although informed of the potential danger of a massacre, is not repeated."
"I believe we need the boldness and transparency of a common policy which denies support to regimes which promote war and investigates the allegations made in the UN report against multinational and European firms which are unlawfully exploiting the Congo's wealth."
"The report records both unlawful funding of the militia and unlawful exploitation of gold, diamonds, oil and coltan."
"It is no coincidence that so much gold, more than the country's mining capacity, is exported from Uganda, as are so many diamonds, which are not mined in Uganda at all."
"I genuinely believe we need to act as quickly as possible to bring peace and development in Uganda: the people need it."
"We must therefore launch a policy which is genuinely rigorous and transparent."
"Mr President, this debate is prompted by the massacre in the East Congolese town of Bunia on 6 May."
"Sadly, this massacre is only the most recent in a long series of massacres in the east of the country."
"Beyond the Congo's borders, too - in Burundi and Rwanda - we have witnessed African genocide on a massive scale."
"Other major features are marauding militia who recruit child soldiers and devastate entire regions, and the ruthless exploitation of natural resources in the region, above all gold, uranium and, indeed, oil."
"This exploitation is carried out either by troops invited into the country - including some from Zimbabwe, for example - but also by non-invited troops, for example, from Uganda, who seize the country's wealth."
"We must ask ourselves one question. Why are Europe and the world looking away?"
"It cannot be because of the oil or gold or other natural resources."
"In other regions of the world with plentiful natural resources, as in the Gulf, we have an interest in stability, regardless of how we might choose to achieve it."
"Yet in Africa, we apparently prefer to leave almost everything in a semi-chaotic state in line with the concept of 'might is right'."
"What I want is for all of us, within the European Union, to put our heads together for once and think about how we deal with Africa."
"Formal summits on Africa staged by individuals really are not enough."
"It may be appropriate to ask how we facilitate development in Africa through market access within the WTO framework."
"That is a debate which we should also engage in for once, and we should not only call for a robust mandate for the United Nations; we should also bring ourselves to the process."
"The resolution before us is almost a bit too restrained for my liking, for it makes very few demands of the Council or the Commission."
"It simply says at one point that we welcome ECHO's humanitarian role."
"It is indeed to be welcomed, but I think this is really not enough under the circumstances."
"If we call on the United Nations to do something and welcome the signing of an agreement in Pretoria in South Africa on 6 March, we ourselves must also send our own forces there in order to make our own contribution."
"I call on the Council and the Commission to take this step."
"Mr President, I thank you for these well-informed statements, which demonstrate the European Parliament's commitment to protecting human rights and fighting to secure peace in the Congo."
"Mr Khanbhai expressed very well what this is all about on the ground, and also the frustration that we all feel about not being able to move from words to deeds fast enough so as to be able to stop all the violence that is taking place."
"The Commission is extremely concerned about the continuing violation of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly in Ituri and the east of the country."
"We welcome the attention Parliament is drawing to this situation in its resolution this afternoon."
"It is clear that thousands have lost their lives in the past eight months in Bunia and the surrounding Ituri province in fierce inter-ethnic fighting."
"Over the past few days, there have been reports that up to 30 000 people have gone into hiding following further executions and massacres in Bunia."
"We share the concerns expressed by the United Nations Secretary-General about the danger that the situation might spin out of control."
"The Commission supports the work of the Ituri Pacification Commission and has been actively trying to bring the parties together."
"The withdrawal of foreign troops from the region is, in principle, to be welcomed, but it is clear that the recent withdrawal of Ugandan troops from the area of Bunia has led to a dangerous power vacuum for the moment."
"The UN peacekeeping force in the Congo is gradually reinforcing its presence in Bunia, but it is clear that currently it has neither the mandate nor the military resources to provide security for the civilian population."
"What security means and what it often takes to ensure security should not, as many of you have said, be underestimated."
"We would welcome the deployment of additional peacekeeping troops in Ituri."
"There are undoubtedly links between efforts to secure peace in the eastern Congo and the current efforts in Kinshasa to form a transitional government for a reunited and peaceful country."
"Long-term peace and stability for eastern Congo will depend in large measure on the success of this transition."
"The Commission, in its assistance programme, is fully involved in these efforts, whether through humanitarian or development funds."
"It is essential for all parties to the conflict to protect human rights and to respect international humanitarian law in the areas under their control. It is also necessary to end the impunity of those responsible for violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, given that the Democratic Republic of Congo is a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court."
"Finally, the Commission appreciates the reference to ECHO's work and will of course pursue its humanitarian efforts."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following draft resolutions on Taiwan's observer status at the 56th World Health Assembly:"
"B5-0240/2003 by Ole Andreasen, Bob van den Bos and Graham R. Watson, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on Taiwan's observer status at the 56th World Health Assembly;"
"B5-0245/2003 by Brigitte Langenhagen and Georg Jarzembowski, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on Taiwan's observer status at the 56th World Health Assembly;"
"B5-0248/2003 by Per Gahrton, Joost Lagendijk and Nelly Maes, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on Taiwan's observer status at the 56th World Health Assembly;"
"B5-0254/2003 by Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on Taiwan's observer status at the 56th World Health Assembly;"
"B5-0261/2003 by Gerard Collins, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on Taiwan's observer status at the 56th World Health Assembly."
"Mr President, I believe that especially in view of the spread of entirely new diseases and epidemics in East Asia - SARS is sadly only the tip of the iceberg - it is a matter of urgency that Taiwan, a highly industrialised state which is visited by many people and has great experience in politics and administration, should be integrated into the World Health Organisation, something that this House has demanded on various occasions."
"I think it is very regrettable that this matter - which, in the age of globalisation and world travel, is important not only for Taiwan but for everyone - is not being pursued vigorously enough."
"Of course, we know that Beijing is blocking this; that stands to reason, but I do think it is very regrettable that whereas the Commission has taken, and continues to take, a clear stance here - and I thank Commissioner Wallström for the Commission's exemplary commitment on this issue - the Council can only be described as faint-hearted."
"On a serious issue such as health and epidemiology, this faint-heartedness on the part of the Council can cost lives."
"I therefore appeal to the Council of the European Union, to the governments of our Member States, to act resolutely so that Taiwan can join the World Health Organisation at last, and to ensure that these artificial obstacles are overcome."
"This is not a question of prestige; people's lives are at stake."
"Mr President, I can only agree with the previous speaker."
"I am convinced that increased representation for Taiwan and opportunities for it to participate in various ways in the UN and in the work of other international organisations would contribute to peace and security in the region."
"The Commission and, in particular, the Member States must pronounce themselves emphatically in favour of such an arrangement."
"The first opportunity to take action will be the impending meeting of the World Health Organisation in Geneva."
"It would be unfair if Taiwan, which is one of the countries affected by SARS, were not to be able to make its voice heard and not to be represented in Geneva."
"It is gratifying that the European Economic and Trade Office has been set up in Taiwan, something which I think indicates that the EU wants to see increased cooperation."
"In this context, it is also important for the EU institutions and the Member States to declare themselves in favour of Taiwan's needing to be able to make its voice heard in all the international forums."
"Mr President, I join in the chorus."
"We are very much in agreement in this House that the spread of the SARS virus has made it more crucial than ever to ensure that we have safeguards to combat epidemics and that these safeguards are as comprehensive as possible."
"The SARS virus has also served to highlight the difficulties caused by non-country status, as in the case of Taiwan."
"In the early stages of the outbreak of SARS in Asia, I understand that the Taiwanese authorities could get very little information from the Chinese, which allowed the virus to spread rapidly across the region."
"For this reason the Taiwanese have no alternative but to ask the World Health Organisation for help."
"In a crisis situation such as this, countries or regions in dangerous situations should not be barred from being helped by the international community."
"Although Parliament has been right in consistently supporting a one-China policy, we must work to ensure that this commitment does not put people's lives in danger because of bureaucratic wrangling."
"A pragmatic approach is needed to these problems when new challenges present themselves."
"We must change our institutions to deal with these new global realities, and this is one example why."
"Therefore, in this resolution we call for observer status for Taiwan at the World Health Assembly to be held in Geneva later this month."
"It may be that Taiwan will not be recognised as a country, that it cannot be given such a status."
"However, even if this is the case, we must push for the increased involvement of Taiwan in the Assembly so that at least it has the chance to participate in discussions and in the taking of decisions that affect its own people."
"Mr President, it remains to be seen how serious the growing threat of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome will become, but Taiwan has already demonstrated a willingness to respond expeditiously to the outbreak, in full cooperation with the WHO."
"This contrasts favourably with the abysmal response of the authorities in Beijing, whose first response was to find refuge in denial, misinformation and obfuscation."
"That response led quite rightly to the resignation of China's health minister and to the open admission by the Chinese Government of the seriousness of the outbreak."
"Nevertheless, Chinese television has so far found it impossible to ask the kind of searching questions which one would expect in a Western democracy."
"Sadly, China remains a secretive, repressive, Communist state in spite of free market reforms."
"Already there is talk of a new glasnost in China."
"That change is to be welcomed."
"The initial reaction of the people has been shock and disillusionment, but in time China will be stronger for its openness."
"Greater honesty with its people and greater debate will help China realise its enormous potential."
"An attempt to go back to the old ways would simply hinder that process."
"China can also learn from Taiwan in cooperating fully with the WHO, whilst observer status in its assembly for Taiwan will be of great benefit not only to the organisation itself but also to China."
"Cooperation is the politics of the future."
"We should also reflect in Europe on the need to give powers to public health authorities to contain those with the disease, so that any mass outbreak in Europe can be effectively contained."
"In that respect, I have to say with regret that the British Government appears to have followed the example of China's former health minister by pretending there is no problem to deal with in our country."
"We have a right to expect better than that from our elected representatives and their officials."
"Mr President, the issue now under our consideration is actually both urgent and one of human rights, because no human right is more important than the right to health."
"The attitude adopted by this United Nations body borders on the absurd, because this mission, which took place at the beginning of May, was only undertaken as a result of immense pressure by Taiwan."
"This almost makes me want to ask the United Nations and its Health Organisation whether they think that the virus is aware of their positions on Taiwan's presence or otherwise in the United Nations."
"Only those who believe they can control this type of phenomenon with bureaucratic measures could adopt such a position."
"I therefore wish to congratulate those who have proposed this initiative and I should like to associate myself with their concern that Taiwan should be granted this observer status as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, the Commission in principle supports Taiwanese efforts to participate in the work of international bodies and organisations, provided that Taiwan's participation adds value in terms of the objectives of the organisation in question."
"However, such participation must be compatible with Taiwan's status and the European Union's one-China policy."
"In the case of the World Health Organisation, our view is that the first criterion is met."
"Taiwan has made considerable achievements in the field of public health and is increasingly engaged in international aid and health activities."
"Moreover, the recent outbreak of SARS, also in Taiwan, shows that Taiwan needs direct channels of communication with, and assistance from, the World Health Organisation."
"This is also in the interests of the wider international community, including China."
"All affected areas need to be kept in the loop and the concerted efforts of all are needed to combat this deadly disease."
"It should be possible to find a pragmatic formula for some sort of Taiwanese participation in the World Health Organisation which does not involve issues of statehood or sovereignty and is thus in line with our one-China policy."
"There are precedents for the participation in the World Health Organisation of other non-state bodies or organisations and this shows that solutions can be found, even where WHO rules do not expressly make provision for this."
"For Taiwan, one possibility could be participation via an NGO."
"We are currently examining, together with Member States and other major partners, what sort of arrangement could be feasible."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place after the debates."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on freedom of expression and religion in Vietnam:"
"B5-0239/2003, by Bob van den Bos and Graham R. Watson, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on freedom of expression and religion in Vietnam;"
"B5-0242/2003, by Patricia McKenna, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on freedom of expression and religion in Vietnam;"
"B5-0244/2003, by Hartmut Nassauer, Hanja Maij-Weggen, Bernd Posselt and Thomas Mann, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on freedom of expression and religion in Vietnam;"
"B5-0253/2003, by Richard Corbett and Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on freedom of expression and religion in Vietnam;"
"B5-0255/2003, by Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on freedom of expression and religion in Vietnam;"
"B5-0256/2003, by Jonas Sjöstedt, Luisa Morgantini and Marianne Eriksson, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on freedom of expression and religion in Vietnam."
"Mr President, I believe that there are many of us who are deeply concerned about what is happening in Vietnam."
"The European Parliament too has expressed its concern on previous occasions."
"The tendency is to want to break people down and frighten them into silence."
"There are regular and constant violations of the conventions on freedom of expression, religion and association signed by Vietnam."
"The list of methods of oppression includes the draft law designed to abolish the right of small farmers to demonstrate peacefully in pursuit of their rights."
"It is particularly serious when the laws are exploited to oppress people."
"If Vietnam is to call itself a state governed by law, the laws must protect people's right to express themselves and freely to practise their religion."
"Vietnam must also stop detaining and harassing dissidents and journalists, and its prisoners of conscience must be released."
"In this connection, I want especially to mention the UBCV."
"One of this organisation's leaders, Quang Do, has also been nominated for the Nobel Prize in 2003."
"I genuinely wish to assent to this resolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the restrictions on freedom of opinion and religion in Vietnam have assumed alarming proportions."
"Protestants, Buddhists and the members of the Hoa Hoa and Cao Dai groups are being persecuted, threatened and arrested for practising their faith openly."
"Church dignitaries are being placed under house arrest for years at a time."
"Information is being deliberately suppressed on a massive scale."
"For over a year, there has been a directive expressly prohibiting citizens from receiving satellite television broadcasts, and the Ministry of Information is harassing the owners of Internet cafés to log the on-line activities of their customers."
"The number of journalists and dissidents being intimidated and arrested is steadily mounting."
"Vietnam has signed the 1996 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was sponsored by the United Nations."
"Yet national decrees are being adopted to circumvent this voluntary commitment by the back door, enabling penalties to be imposed on anyone who allegedly poses a threat to national security."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats calls on the Vietnamese Government to fulfil its obligations under international law, and to tolerate and guarantee full freedom of belief and opinion at last."
"Persecution, harassment and imprisonment of believers and regime critics must stop, and the free flow of information must finally be guaranteed."
"When human rights are violated on a sustained basis, the sovereignty of the states simply remains on paper, further proof that such governments lack something that is essential to act on a truly sovereign basis."
"Unless Parliament's demands are met in the near future, there is only one option: that will be for the European Union to suspend its financial support to Vietnam."
"I very much hope, Commissioner Wallström, that the Commission will endorse this position."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to address my opening words to those Members who were involved in tabling this resolution on Vietnam, representing the various political groups."
"I believe that we now have a text that stands out for its rigour in condemning religious persecution and for its boldness in defending human rights in that country."
"Secondly, I wish to offer a word of solidarity and of faith to the Buddhist leaders and those of other religious convictions who are fighting for their inalienable right to express themselves in complete freedom and independence from political power, and to the enormous number of victims of the repression and arbitrariness of the regime, including citizens who have expressed their political disagreement by peaceful means, sometimes only through email, as well as small farmers, indigenous Christian minorities and journalists."
"Almost three decades have passed since the fall of Saigon and since the reasons which, according to some people, could justify limitations on human rights, freedom and democracy have no longer applied."
"This is not how things have worked out, however, with the totalitarian regime that installed itself having survived even the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"Democracy and human rights are on the agenda in every country in the world and must accordingly also be on the agenda in Indochina."
"As suggested in the joint resolution that has been proposed, the recent meeting held between the Vietnamese prime minister and the leader of the unified church of Vietnam is a positive sign, must be put to good use and is a good reason for extending the cooperation agreement between the European Union and that country."
"We must be clear, however, on the need for the human and democratic rights laid down in Article 1 of the agreement, which form the basis of the agreement, to be respected."
"We will not accept a merely rhetorical interpretation of this article and we believe it represents real progress in these fields, without which the agreement cannot continue indefinitely."
"In our view, the Commission must draw up an action plan and a precise and realistic timetable for the Vietnamese authorities to undertake urgent and fundamental reforms, release political prisoners, authorise freedom of worship and rescind recent initiatives that introduce further restrictions to freedom of information, such as access to satellite television."
"We therefore hope that the Vietnamese authorities heed the call represented by this resolution and quickly provide signs that they are willing to remedy the current situation."
"Unless they do, we in the European Parliament will be forced to draw the necessary conclusions."
"Mr President, in the opinion of the Communist government in Vietnam, the situation in the fertile Central Highlands is increasingly getting out of hand."
"After all, that is where the call for independence is louder."
"The Vietnamese Government itself is to blame for this last-ditch, political cry for help on the part of the original inhabitants of the Central Highlands, namely ethnic minorities."
"It is responsible for discrimination against indigenous peoples by the ethnic Vietnamese, the so-called Kinh."
"It is also responsible for land robbery by the Kinh at the expense of the ethnic minorities."
"In the Central Highlands, the Vietnamese Government is also adopting a repressive policy against officially unrecognised Protestant churches."
"This mainly concerns indigenous peoples of the Bana, the Ede and the Zarai."
"The security services are extremely active in those areas."
"Soldiers are also billeted with the villagers."
"I would therefore question what remains of personal freedom and of any religious freedom in the private sphere."
"Not for nothing have the Vietnamese authorities stationed senior party members from Hanoi, outsiders in other words, in the three Central Highlands provinces."
"I am certain that the European Union can do something about this oppressive, explosive situation."
"First of all, the Union should couple stringent, political conditions to the large sums of money it injects into Vietnamese government projects."
"In the final analysis, Hanoi has committed itself by international treaty to enforcement of the basic freedoms of expression, association and religion."
"In addition, following the example of the Dutch Government, for example, the European Commission should, via co-financing organisations, support projects which truly benefit the oppressed ethnic minorities in the Central Highlands."
"This is at present a major failing in European aid to Vietnam."
"The Vietnamese Government refuses to put indigenous peoples from the Dac Lac, Gia Lai and Kon Tum provinces on an equal footing with the Kinh."
"It does not take them seriously, in other words."
"It is up to the European institutions to set an example which is worth imitating."
"Finally, Council and Commission, in order to have any impact, the European Union should, however, insist upon the Vietnamese authorities' opening up the Central Highlands to foreign observers."
"Mr President, considering the suffering, the sacrifices and the dignity of the Vietnamese people in their fight for sovereignty and independence in the face of colonialism and US military intervention, which has destroyed life and nature for future generations with chemical and bacteriological weapons, they do not deserve a government which continues to oppress them and prevents freedom of expression and demonstration."
"Of course, progress has been made towards political, economic and democratic openness, including the trade agreement with the United States, the release of prisoners, the announcement of free elections and the Internet. However, this facade of renewal conceals the tragic reality."
"The Internet, as other Members have reiterated, is actually used for control purposes and satellite broadcasting is banned. Freedom of religion, confirmed formally for both Buddhists and Montagnard Christians, is actually far from being implemented: religious leaders have been imprisoned, there are house arrests and the faithful are under strong pressure to forsake their religion."
"People are not just being oppressed for their religious belief, however: the rule of law is being violated in the name of national security, a concept we are very familiar with by now."
"With our joint resolution, we call upon the European Union to continue its work and to pressurise the Vietnamese Government to pursue dialogue with the religious groups, to put an end to all oppression, to release prisoners and to allow the practical development of political and humanitarian organisations and NGOs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is willing to support the Vietnamese people in progressing towards a society in which democracy and the rule of law are the core principles."
"Vietnam has already made significant advances along this path which deserve to be recognised."
"Nonetheless, there are still some very worrying developments."
"The ASEAN delegation attended the AIPO General Assembly in Hanoi last year and was prepared to visit the Vietnamese authorities and parliamentary colleagues for talks."
"However, when we were denied access to religious leaders, we felt we had no option but to cut short the visit."
"That is precisely the point that we want to highlight."
"There are worrying restrictions on human rights, especially religious freedom."
"The issue of religious freedom has nothing to do with how Vietnam conducts matters of state."
"It is wrong to seek to define the exercise of religious freedom as a threat to national security."
"We are not interfering in Vietnam's internal affairs."
"Vietnam can decide for itself which path it wants to take."
"That is not our responsibility."
"However, there are fundamental and universal rights which are binding for all of us, and they include the right to practise a religion."
"There are eminent representatives of Vietnam who, for example, have been here in Europe, in the European Union, and now occupy key positions in the Vietnamese parliament."
"They know exactly what our positions are."
"They know that we have no desire to interfere in Vietnam's domestic decisions, and they know that we are prepared to provide help."
"However, we must insist that political and religious prisoners are released."
"That is what this House demands."
"Mr President, Mr Nassauer is absolutely right."
"There has been some progress, but quite frankly that progress is not enough."
"We are talking about fundamental and universal human rights."
"I stand here as an atheist, but defend the right to freedom of religion, freedom of belief, freedom of association and the freedom to exchange ideas."
"What do we have to fear from people who have different ideas or different beliefs from us?"
"We must call upon the Vietnamese Government to do what is absolutely right, which is to respect universal human rights and release prisoners of conscience, to stop detentions and to allow journalists to go about their business, which is to report and criticise."
"Let me refer to what was said by my colleagues Mr Mann and Mr Casaca with reference to the cooperation agreements and our association agreements."
"We have to enforce these human rights clauses otherwise we will never be taken seriously by the international community."
"We must state clearly that these are our standards and our principles, and that they are non-negotiable."
"Mr President, the Commission's overall policy towards Vietnam is to encourage and support continued progress on human rights and democratisation and to raise concerns where abuses occur or where a deterioration in the situation becomes evident."
"The Commission works closely with EU Member States in monitoring human rights developments in the country and participates in all démarches to the Government of Vietnam on human rights issues."
"I can assure honourable Members that the Commission and EU Member States have repeatedly urged the government of Vietnam to strengthen its respect for political and religious freedoms and to further strengthen economic and social freedoms."
"Article 1 of the European Community and Vietnam Cooperation Agreement of 1995 states that respect for human rights and democratic principles is the basis of our cooperation."
"This reference has given the Commission increased possibilities to discuss human rights issues with Vietnam, for example in joint committee meetings held under the agreement."
"With the aim of encouraging and supporting the continued commitment of the government of Vietnam to human rights issues, the Commission is currently considering proposing a further reinforcement of the relations in this field."
"This could be done through the establishment of a mechanism for a structured human rights dialogue, taking account of the experience gained with dialogues that the EU has already established with other countries."
"Let me recall that the Constitution of Vietnam guarantees freedom of belief and religion and that the Vietnamese Government officially recognises six religions."
"The Constitution also specifies that it is forbidden to violate freedom of belief or religion or to take advantage of it, or to act against the laws or policies of the state."
"This provision is attributed to the desire of the Vietnamese authorities to control the pace of change and to maintain cohesion in their society during the process of transition to a market economy."
"However, it may also be used against non-approved religious groups which, according to the Vietnamese authorities, engage in political activities or are potential elements of disunity."
"Reports of harassment of Christians in Vietnam, especially the Montagnards and Hmong Christians, have increased since the violent uprising in the Central Highlands in 2001, in which some religious groups were reportedly implicated."
"A number of so far unconfirmed reports since then have alleged repeated actions by local official forces aimed at forcing highlanders to renounce their faith."
"Commission President Prodi and Commissioner Patten discussed the situation in the Central Highlands with Vietnam's Prime Minister, Phan Van Khai, during his visit to the Commission last September."
"They agreed that the Commission would explore, under its financial cooperation programme, specific activities involving, inter alia, ethnic minorities to reduce poverty in the Central Highlands and thus to deal with some of the root causes of problems in the area."
"A preparatory mission of experts is currently in the field."
"As Mr Dupuis has already mentioned, recent, promising, positive signals have been sent out by the Vietnamese Government regarding the still unrecognised Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam."
"There has been a meeting between Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and the Supreme Patriarch, the Venerable Thich Huyen Quang."
"A meeting between the Patriarch and the Venerable Thich Quang Do, another prominent leader of the Unified Buddhist Church, has also been authorised."
"Although no change with regard to the church's legal status has so far taken place, we believe that these events, as mentioned, are encouraging steps towards enhanced tolerance of religious freedom in Vietnam."
"Let me conclude by emphasising that I am convinced that what is needed in Vietnam is continued and more rapid progress in the country's reform programme so that the administration would learn to deal with a wider range of use and appreciate the value of accommodating dissent in the system of government."
"I thank all honourable Members of the European Parliament for their very valuable and good speeches."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place after the debates."
"We shall now proceed to the vote on the questions of violation of human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 15 May 2003."
"I have a number of announcements which I would like to make to the House"
"As regards the calendar of part-sessions for next year, I have received from the Conference of Presidents a proposal to hold an eleventh part-session from Monday 3 May to Thursday 6 May 2004."
"The deadline for tabling amendments to this proposal is tomorrow, Tuesday, at 4.00 p.m."
"The vote is scheduled for Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Mr President, I would just like to ask you to check whether, for legal reasons, a fully valid part-session is possible at all after 1 May, as the new Treaty of Nice stipulates 732 as the fixed number of Members."
"However, as far as I am aware, there are 788 of us."
"I would be interested to know how the qualified majority is meant to be worked out if there is a part-session in May."
"I would ask that it be checked whether this proposal is at all legal."
"Thank you."
"The point which you raise is perfectly correct."
"In the discussions in the Conference of Presidents it was agreed that since we will then be in an election period it would be appropriate to deal with political rather than legislative matters."
"If we were to deal with legislative matters then the question you raise would be unavoidable."
"The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Wednesday 28 May 2003 has been distributed."
"The following changes have been proposed:"
"Wednesday"
"As regards the oral questions to the Council and the Commission on a transatlantic partnership tabled on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I propose to extend the deadlines as follows:"
"motions for resolutions: 12 noon on Thursday 12 June"
"amendments and joint motions for resolutions: 12 noon on Tuesday 17 June."
"The proposal is thus have the debate this time, and the vote at the next part session."
"Mr President, the matter I raised on Wednesday's agenda is linked to the Council's non-participation in the debate on the Nigerian elections, at which the Commission will be represented."
"We cannot understand why, when the Council is represented in the Chamber, it will not participate in a debate during which it just so happens that the Chairman of the Delegation of Observers, Mr Van den Berg, who was proposed for that appointment by the Council, is going to report."
"It is surprising that Council should not want to make a statement about such an important matter, even more so since it is represented in the Chamber."
"I ask you to repeat Parliament's request that the Council participate in this debate."
"I am happy to repeat the request, and should like to inform the House that to the best of my knowledge the Council will indeed be present."
"Under current indications, it does not intend to participate in this debate."
"I shall reiterate the request made in the Conference of Presidents which you have repeated here today."
"Mr President, I wish to raise another matter, although I leave it to your wise judgement as to whether, if it gains majority support in this House, it should be dealt with on Wednesday or during the short sitting on Thursday."
"I refer to the need for information from the Commission concerning the events surrounding Eurostat."
"These cases of fraud - which I will describe as matters of suspicion - have not yet been considered by the Members of this House, although they are receiving blanket coverage in Europe's media."
"Our group requests that we should have a communication from the Commission, on the basis of which we could discuss the Eurostat problem, either on Wednesday, or during the short sitting on Thursday."
"Mr President, I understand that the Group of the Party of European Socialists' proposal has been accepted, which is to say that the Commission will participate in both debates, on the Middle East as well as on the illegal small arms trade."
"Is now the moment to talk about the point Mr Poettering has raised, or will he submit it later?"
"It seems to me that the most appropriate way to deal with this would be to take it as a proposal to the Conference of Presidents this week, to see what the groups wish to do, and then to choose to invite the relevant institutions to be here."
"Mr President, I think it would be appropriate for the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control to participate, since it is essential to respect the work of this House's committees."
"When preparing the Conference of Presidents for this week, could the groups please consult the Committee on Budgetary Control and see whether there is a consensus to move forward with regard to Mr Poettering's suggestion."
"Mr President, as you are aware, on 14 June the Convention will conclude its work, on 20 June there will be a Summit in Thessaloniki and we, most appropriately, will be holding a mini part-session in the week between the two events, on 18 and 19 June to be precise."
"My group therefore felt it was important that we should hold a preliminary debate on the outcome of the Convention, maybe inviting the Chairman, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, to be present."
"I would stress what Mr Barón Crespo said, namely that this does not mean there would be any less need for a more in-depth analysis after the Thessaloniki Summit, carried out according to whatever procedure Parliament decides to follow."
"Given the public nature of the Convention's work, I believe it would be politically appropriate to discuss it in this House, even if we are not the first to do so, publicly and transparently at least, and, if possible, in the presence of the Chairman, but even without the Chairman if he is not available."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having considered this matter, our group supports this proposal."
"We would very much have appreciated it if the resolution of the Conference of Presidents, which was - as I recall it - unanimous, could have been acted on this week, and if the Chairman of the Convention could have visited Parliament this week."
"I do not know why this has not been done."
"The reasons for this remain to be clarified, but I would very much welcome it if the Chairman of the Convention were to join us for our short sitting."
"Mr President, I thank you for proposing that we deal with the Eurostat affair next Thursday, as well as the flax case, which is also under discussion in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and is attracting public attention."
"In relation to Mrs Frassoni's point, I think that, since the members of my political family are in Amsterdam and will be continuing their work in Brussels, we could consult them to gain a fuller knowledge of the facts, and then discuss the issue at Thursday's Conference of Presidents, when we could also repeat our request to the Convention President."
"I feel that we should debate this on Thursday rather than take a decision at this precise moment."
"Mr President, I would like Mr Barón Crespo to clarify for us the relationship between the flax case, which is being tried in Spain, and the Eurostat affair."
"It is akin to my asking us to debate the result of the Madrid city council elections now."
"There were winners and losers in those elections, but, to be quite honest, I can see no connection between the two points."
"Please reply, Mr Barón Crespo, and then we will move from this Spanish tennis match back to our European agenda."
"I would like to thank Mr Galeote for his desire for information."
"Council elections in a country are one thing; financial irregularities affecting the Community budget, which have given rise to reports in this House and related legal actions, are quite another, Mr Galeote."
"I believe that this does indeed fall within the competence of the European Parliament and that you, who are as concerned as I am for there to be no financial irregularities affecting the Community budget, will also support this proposal."
"Furthermore, you will support the involvement of the Committee on Budgetary Control and of Parliament in this matter."
"Mr President, quite frankly, I believe it is the European Parliament's duty to be the first to hold a public debate on this subject."
"Politics, I regret to say, has its idiosyncrasies, and so I do not feel it would be very wise to put this proposal to the vote now, for it would certainly be rejected."
"We will therefore wait for all the various exceedingly important decisions to be taken within the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and then we will see whether we shall be able to convince the Socialists to launch the debate, with or without the Chairman, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing."
"I would stress that it is not so much a question of deciding our position on the Convention as carrying out an initial assessment of the outcome of the Convention as soon as its work is finished and before the governments can do so."
"I feel that this is the very least we can do politically, not least for the sake of public opinion."
"Mr President, let me just reiterate the point that, as I recall it, the Conference of Presidents resolved unanimously - something it very rarely does - to ask the Chairman of the Convention to join us for this part-session."
"I do not know whether an official summons or invitation was issued, or whether it was declined."
"That may well be the case, but I would like clarification - which we are not going to get right now - as to whether, if the Conference of Presidents' resolution was unanimous, that resolution was implemented as regards our procedure, and I would be obliged if we could be given more precise information on the subject on Thursday morning."
"I can only offer you the facts."
"He is not here and he is detained doing the work that he is meant to do: chairing the Convention."
"These are the facts of the matter and I do not want to make any interpretations as regards his willingness to engage with us."
"I suggest that we put this item on the agenda for Thursday's Conference of Presidents meeting."
"We should take note of it from today and then try to make a recommendation, hopefully on a consensual basis, on how to proceed on Wednesday 18 June or Thursday 19 June in Brussels."
"The order of business was thus established."
"Mr President, as Chairman of the College of Quaestors, I have been asked to help arrange transport to Parliament tomorrow for assistants coming from Brussels."
"I would be grateful if colleagues whose assistants are experiencing difficulties in their travel arrangements and, indeed, colleagues in the same predicament, could contact my office as soon as possible."
"A train leaves Brussels at 7.20 a.m., and we are considering the possibility of arranging transport from Luxembourg, where the train arrives at 10.00 a.m."
"Could I ask colleagues who have problems with this to contact me in my office here as soon as possible."
"For colleagues who are not aware of it, there is yet another general strike in France tomorrow, so the trains will not be able to get here."
"I presume the planes will not be able to get here either."
"Mr President, I should like to ask your help once more regarding a very human problem: the problem of the Roma refugees from Kosovo."
"The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other international organisations admit that these refugees cannot go back to their home country."
"They are also being deported from Germany and Belgium."
"My question is as follows: around 600 refugees in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have been turned out of a reception centre."
"They made their way to the Greek border and requested political asylum, but received rough treatment at the hands of riot police."
"Could you use your authority to contact not only those international organisations, but also the Commission, to confirm that these refugees cannot return to Kosovo?"
"They also have problems in connection with their property in Kosovo and with asserting ownership of that property."
"The Roma are human beings belonging to the European Community, but are repeatedly being reminded in an inhuman manner that they are second-class citizens."
"Can we not use your authority to do something about this?"
"I should be grateful to you for your intervention."
"I will take up the matter, Mrs Maes."
"Thank you for raising it."
"Mr President, I endorse the remarks that have just been made."
"When you write to the Council perhaps you could also point out how hopelessly ineffective the Council's own sanctions have been in respect of Zimbabwe and how they need to be toughened up."
"I would like to say a word about the situation in Cyprus."
"For a long time many of us who have wanted reconciliation in Cyprus with due regard to the interests and concerns of both communities have called for some serious confidence-building measures on the part of the international community in relation to Turkish northern Cyprus."
"In particular, measures need to be taken to lift the wholly unfair international embargo on the north, which has been imposed for so long and which has been directly responsible for holding back economic development."
"I wish tentatively to welcome proposals which are anticipated from the Commission to provide a goodwill package of economic assistance, along with measures apparently to lift the embargo."
"I trust these measures are being made on a genuine basis and that they have been worked out in full concertation with the Turkish Cypriot authorities."
"Furthermore, I hope that the easing of travel restrictions by the Turkish Cypriot authorities between the two parts of Cyprus will be reciprocated by the Government of the Republic to enable the free movement of all people coming from the north."
"Mr President, I would like to draw Parliament's attention to a case of blatant discrimination that is about to take place in the county of Northamptonshire, which I and my colleague, Mr Helmer, represent."
"The Labour-controlled county council has decided in its wisdom to cut the number of free school bus passes it gives out."
"However, instead of doing this fairly and across the board, it has vindictively decided to target denominational and single-sex schools."
"This Labour council conducted a listening consultation exercise with parents across the county and, out of over 1 120 replies, only 17 concurred with their plans."
"At this point, 119 parents complained that they felt this policy amounted to either religious or sexual discrimination."
"Many of these parents have now decided to petition this Parliament."
"Mr President, through you, I ask that the Committee on Petitions investigate these complaints as soon as possible, as I am sure that no one in this House would like to see such discrimination tolerated."
"Mr President, following on from the comment made by my honourable friend on Cyprus, I should like to say that we must not forget that the northern part of Cyprus has been under Turkish occupation as a result of the invasion in 1974."
"Now to my point: just as official spokesmen are admitting that Iraq's famous weapons of mass destruction were no more than the pretext for the invasion, new threats to world peace are emanating from the metropolis of imperialism."
"The United States Congress has in fact given its approval for research into so-called mini nuclear weapons and for new nuclear weapons that penetrate the ground, causing ten times as much damage."
"This development comes just 18 months after the Nuclear Post Review calling for ways to be found so that nuclear weapons can be used within the framework of the new American preventive strike strategy."
"At the same time, Mr Bush himself is making headlines on the continuing campaign against Cuba, with his well publicised message on 20 May, while the United States of America are jamming the country's radio and television network in order to broadcast their cheap propaganda."
"As I condemn the foregoing, I wonder what those who directly or indirectly supported and support imperialist aggression have to say."
"I also wonder to what extent those who called American agents in Cuba human rights activists will articulate even one word in protest against the new escalation of aggression against the island of the revolution."
"Mr President, on Wednesday 21 May 2003, I was sent as a European Parliament delegate to the United Nations in New York to speak at the Permanent Forum of indigenous peoples from all over the world, which meets once a year in the UN headquarters."
"I did, of course, convey the greetings of the European Parliament, and I emphasised the consideration we have given over the past three years to all the indigenous and aboriginal races of the United States of America, Canada, South America, Africa, Oceania and so forth, and all the representatives of the world's indigenous peoples asked me to inform the European Parliament that they are waiting for us to speak out resolutely to support them and to provide practical aid to promote respect for their human rights."
"Above all, however, they are waiting for Europe to make its voice heard so that it is not just the United Nations which takes any notice of them, for we all know that the Europe of yesterday was responsible for situations which are causing them to suffer today."
"I hope that you, Mr President, will listen to me personally when I pass on to you the requests made by these peoples to the European Parliament."
"Mr President, during the European Union-Russia Summit in St. Petersburg, we faced a cornucopia of totally unacceptable statements from the Council, but even more so from the Commission."
"At this summit, indeed, Mr Prodi drowned the Chechen question in vodka and caviar."
"These positions are fundamentally opposed to those of the European Parliament."
"I am astonished (I address these remarks to chairmen of groups, and of course also to you, Mr President) that the question of a report by President Prodi and the Council on Chechnya, and on European Union-Russian relations in general, is not on the agenda either for this part-session or for the Brussels mini-session."
"Mr President, I would like to point out that the Andalusian fisherman Agustín García has been held in prison in Faro by the Portuguese authorities since 8 May last."
"I would like to point out that the means used to arrest him were entirely disproportionate and that he was subjected to excessive violence and poor treatment."
"A simple offence was handled as if it were a terrorist act."
"It should be noted that he has been held in preventive detention since then, among dangerous criminals."
"Furthermore, he is unwell and has not received adequate medical treatment."
"The imprisonment of Mr García has already led to a general strike by the Andalusian fishing community and I believe that Portugal is trying to make an example of Mr García, making a simple fisherman, who has only committed this one offence, carry the can for a lack of political will."
"Mr President, I would ask you to intervene in order to solve this problem."
"Perhaps you might be able to contribute to resolving this lamentable situation."
"Mr President, there is one problem whose urgency is clear for millions of workers in the European Union: attacks on pensions."
"This problem is not limited to the workers of France, who will be on strike and holding demonstrations tomorrow: it also concerns the workers of Austria, Germany, Greece, Italy and everywhere in Europe, where governments are trying to raise the retirement age while reducing pensions."
"Raising the retirement age means that people who have retained their jobs to the end will die in harness, and that people no longer wanted by their employers will finish their active lives on the dole."
"What can the reason be for this retrograde step on the part of society?"
"Can the European Union have become such a poor and underdeveloped region that it cannot provide for the twilight years of those worn out by work?"
"I maintain that it is possible to provide proper pensions for all, if more taxes are imposed on employers."
"I should like to pledge solidarity with all those, throughout the European Union, who refuse to favour capital and who do not agree that it should be possible to possess capital at the expense of salaried employees."
"Mr President, I am pleased that Commissioner de Palacio is here, because this will perhaps be of interest to her."
"I should like to draw attention to a series of serious accidents involving lorries that have occurred in Belgium on the E17, that is, the motorway from Antwerp to Lille, in recent weeks."
"The cause is always those lorries using cruise control, which is a kind of autopilot enabling drivers to drive without keeping their feet on the pedals."
"Careless lorry drivers are driving into traffic queues because their reactions are too slow."
"The balance sheet for the last 7 weeks shows 6 dead and 13 seriously injured, indicating that this is very bad technology."
"Problems and accidents involving cruise control can be seen all over Europe."
"The relevant directive on technical regulations for heavy goods vehicles must be amended to contain a provision banning this."
"Belgium wants to ban cruise control on its territory and should be given the chance to do so."
"I think that the Commissioner should take the necessary steps."
"Mr President, it is with great concern that I note - as do many of our fellow citizens - a decision taken by the US Congress, which makes the implementation of an aid package for Aids amounting to USD 15 billion in value conditional upon the willingness of the recipient countries in Africa to accept supplies of genetically-modified food."
"Although this composite measure is not legally binding, it is clear to me that it puts African countries under a great deal of pressure."
"This, in my view, amounts to a trade policy pursued at the expense of the poorest, and that is to be repudiated!"
"This decision by the US Congress has made that plain, and one wonders how much leverage the biotechnology and agriculture lobbies, with their business interests, are exerting on the American administration's humanitarian aid policy."
"There is no doubt that recent decades have seen many millions of dollars poured into the development of genetically-modified seeds, and now, as I see it, every market is to be pressured into opening up to them."
"Humanitarian aid can, however, be effective only if it does not play second fiddle to commercial interests, and so I would like to ask the Commission what it is contemplating doing about this, or what view it takes of such a development in this area."
"Mr President, the rich and powerful of the world gathered in Evian in order to discuss international security, development and economic stability."
"Basically, they want to coordinate in the face of the crisis plaguing the capitalist system and leading to huge unemployment, poverty and exclusion."
"They want to consolidate their authority and take further measures to concentrate the wealth of the planet in their hands in any way they can, even with the fear of fanaticism and terrorism which they have created."
"The eight are concerned not for the poor and how they live, but with how to stop them rising up against them, against miserable exploitation and injustice, which is why they also took harsher repressive measures, preventing thousands of protestors from coming to express their opposition to the globalisation of capital and their predatory exploitation."
"The Presidency and the Commission must make a statement to the House both on the content of the discussions in which they participated and on the repressive measures taken against the protestors, the same and perhaps worse measures that are also being taken for the European Council in Thessaloniki."
"Mr President, I believe it is my duty to draw attention to the fact that, only today, 12 African migrants have disappeared, and must surely have died, while they were trying to reach the Spanish coast close to Africa, looking for work."
"Once again, I think that the European Union will have to take the necessary political steps, doing everything possible to avoid such frequent, terrible disasters."
"Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the situation in Guinea-Bissau, which is extremely serious and has been dragging on for some months."
"The parliament was dissolved last year; the elections scheduled for April have now been postponed until July, and it is expected that they will be delayed further."
"The situation is extremely delicate and sensitive: the country is experiencing a general crisis - economic, financial, social, political and even military."
"I would like to express my regret at the discourtesy of certain groups, who proposed that Guinea-Bissau be replaced on the agenda by Zimbabwe without communicating any of this to us; I received this surprise in my office just after I arrived from Brussels."
"For that reason, I was unable to take the floor just now."
"I understand the feelings of some of my fellow Members on Zimbabwe."
"We have always shown our solidarity with those fellow Members over this problem, which is very serious and which we have already discussed four or five times in Parliament."
"It is important for us to remember, however, that Zimbabwe is not the only country with problems: other countries have them too, and we must find time to discuss them."
"We will reschedule this important debate for July; I would appreciate the understanding of my fellow Members."
"I am certain that a gesture by Parliament will be timely and effective in this very sensitive case of Guinea-Bissau."
"Mr President, respect for human rights has proven to be the most effective mechanism for democracy anywhere."
"This formula asks for an improvement of the actual implementation of the rule of law, meaning respect for such fundamental freedoms as political association and peaceful assembly, the independence of the judiciary, the right to a fair trial and the exclusion of all forms of torture and ill-treatment."
"This must apply everywhere, the Basque country included."
"Now, in a telegraphic manner, I shall put forward some other recent outstanding events concerning human rights in the Basque country, in addition to those you mentioned, Mr President:"
"Last Wednesday, 28 May 2003, the suicide of a young Basque in a French prison; the case of Jesús María Etxebarría, who has already lost 20 kg and is in the 41st day of his hunger strike; the refusal of several Basque prisoners to use the toilets for almost two months in order to attract the public's attention to their situation - Mr President, you will remember Bobby Sands and his colleagues; the arrest and imprisonment of the Mayor of Ondarrua, Loren Arkotxa, and other elected representatives of Udalbiltza; the Amnesty International report 2003, which refers to the period from January to December 2002, during which Spain kept prisoners incommunicado, a situation which facilitates torture; resolutions of the Bilbao and San Sebastian Lawyers' Associations, denouncing ill treatment in police headquarters; and the banning of 225 local lists of candidates for the municipal elections."
"Apparently, it makes no sense in this House to mention the outlawing of Batasuna."
"Mr President, I do not know whether Mr Gorostiaga has something to do with this and is also trying to restrict my freedom of speech."
"I am very happy that Mr Gorostiaga is concerned about the right to freedom of speech and assembly and I hope that from now on he will also be concerned about the representatives of my party and the Socialist Party assassinated by a terrorist group supported by his political group, which thank God is now defunct."
"I am sure, therefore, that from now on he will also defend the rights of my political party and the Socialist Party to assembly and freedom of speech."
"It is incredible that you are able to speak in this House following the assassination of two members of the national police force, carried out by the terrorist group that you are unable to condemn."
"I am able to condemn and regret all the deaths that have occurred, including the deaths of the prisoners, whose rights I recognise, except for the right to restrict our freedom of speech and assassinate us in such a despicable manner."
"Mr President, I would like to remind the House that elections should have taken place very recently in Northern Ireland and regrettably, unlike in Scotland and the Welsh Assembly, those elections did not go ahead."
"I would like this House to urge the participants to please come together and hold those elections as soon as feasible."
"Nature abhors a vacuum and while, hopefully, we will not go back to condemning killings and burying the dead on the island of Ireland, undoubtedly street events will occur with increasing frequency if we do not hold elections."
"We are all agreed that the way forward is through the democratic process."
"I hope we can see those elections held very soon."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report (A5-0193/2003) by Willi Rothley, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the adoption of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are nearing the end of a long journey, an odyssey that has, from time to time, seen us wandering far afield and sometimes finding ourselves in choppy waters."
"The attempt has been made to persuade us that this statute was about nothing more than reforming the reimbursement of travel costs, that it was about money and nothing else."
"A statute dealing only with money, with its reimbursement, and with costs, is not, though, the sort of statute that the European Parliament needs at the present time."
"We were told that primary legislation would run aground on the cliffs of the Council, and that our ideas on tax law would drag us down to the depths of the ocean."
"Now, if I may pick out these as examples, I think that we have good arguments on our side."
"The two problems that remain to be resolved are taxes and primary law, and - as far as taxes are concerned - the Council thinks it can leave it to each individual Member State to decide whether or not it wants to levy an additional national tax."
"It so happens that, in 2000, the three legal services - those of Parliament, the Council, and the Commission - met to discuss this issue."
"The minutes of their deliberations record their conclusion that they could find no justification for a derogation for a Member State, and then they continue in the following terms:"
"So what the Council is now proposing to us is precisely what the three legal services unanimously ruled out."
"It is obvious that we cannot go along with this!"
"There is a similar situation as regards primary law."
"Why is it that this House is in this difficult position?"
"It is because, in 1976, when the Act concerning the election of the Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage was introduced, the Council fought shy of harmonising the general conditions applicable to the exercise of the mandate."
"It found that too much of a hot potato."
"That is why the European Parliament retained the structure of a parliamentary assembly even after it started to be directly elected, a structure it retains to this day."
"The object of this statute is to break down this parliamentary assembly-style structure and for us to become a real Parliament."
"That is what the Statute is for!"
"The fundamental issue is of whether this European Community is a real community or an international organisation."
"If it were merely an international organisation, then the Council would indeed have the prerogative as regards Members' privileges and immunities."
"The question as to whether or not we should now regulate MEPs' privileges and immunities boils down to the question of whether this European Community is a community or an international organisation, of whether we are a parliamentary assembly or a parliament worthy of the name."
"That is what it is about!"
"(Applause)"
"The rules we have now date back to 1965, when the Protocol was introduced."
"In that year, Charles de Gaulle beat Mitterrand to win the French presidential elections, and it was in that year that the first contraceptive pill was put on the market."
"(Laughter)"
"And now the Council - it is apparently the Council, although I am unsure, as it used to be only the Permanent Representatives who dealt with these matters - is trying to tell us that it is these rules by which Parliament should continue to be governed in the future, almost a quarter of a century after it was first directly elected."
"If we do not get to grips with this issue now, then when is it going to be dealt with?"
"After all, it is not as if the Council thought that the system of privileges and immunities had to be reformed."
"It expressly confirmed that only last year, when the uniform right to vote was introduced."
"It is clear that the Council sees this as a long-term solution, and of course Parliament cannot accept that."
"As I have said, the Council has not previously given this issue its serious consideration."
"The governments are showing themselves to be something less than interested in it."
"That is why it is no bad idea to say that the Statute should enter into force at the same time as the European Union's new constitution."
"We would then have a guarantee that both the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference would do intensive and serious work on this topic, and also that the issues of taxation and of primary law would be discussed at intergovernmental level in an appropriate way."
"If we now dispense with these rules - which we do not want to come into effect, something they can of course do only after those provisions in the Protocol that are contrary to them have been suspended - then we will remain, for an unforeseeable period of time, in the Council's Babylonian captivity."
"That is what this Statute is about!"
"I am very grateful to the Bureau for coming up with rules on the reimbursement of costs, general expenses, the daily subsistence allowance, and the lump sum for staff."
"That was very helpful and a step in the right direction."
"I am very grateful to you, Mr President, generally, for having taken more trouble over this Statute than any previous President."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the PPE-DE Group's Mr Lehne,"
"(Applause)"
"who, with his criticisms, his solidarity, and his reliability, has been with this project every step of the way."
"Many thanks for that, and many thanks to you all!"
"(Applause)"
". (ES) Mr President, I shall be very brief."
"I would like to say that this is a complex issue."
"Clearly we are talking about an issue which has not changed since 1965, despite the spectacular progress which has been made in the institutional elements of European integration and particularly with regard to the capacities and duties of Parliament, such as its means of election."
"Nevertheless, we have been unable to adapt the Statute for Members of the European Parliament to today's circumstances."
"As a former Member of this and other parliaments, I understand the importance and the implications of the Statute for Members and of the report presented to us today by Mr Rothley."
"I would like to congratulate him on his work and, on behalf of the Commission, wish him the best possible results."
"We hope that tomorrow there will be a concrete response so that we can vote on this matter."
"Our objective is to cooperate actively so that, ultimately, we achieve an agreement that might be accepted by the Council, because otherwise we all know that it will serve little purpose."
"We hope to be able to achieve this agreement once and for all."
"Mr President, I would just like to start by expressing my gratitude to Mr Rothley, who has, with almost boundless patience, steered this tanker through the sandbanks ever since 1998, and has done so in a way that commands admiration."
"I also think that, without him, this tanker would have ended up on the rocks more than once."
"Mr Rothley, in his speech earlier on, addressed in a few words the important issues, some of them of a constitutional nature, that this statute raises."
"I would like to say something about some rather more down-to-earth problems."
"I also believe that the statute, as it has emerged, is a very balanced piece of work."
"In the Committee on Legal Affairs, we were, essentially, guided by the instructions that we had been given by the experts and wise men that Parliament had mandated."
"The fifty per cent of a judge's salary that is at issue here corresponds, more or less, to what an Austrian, French, German or British MEP currently receives, after health insurance and old age pension contributions have been taken into account."
"It is less than what our Italian Members currently get, and so I would like to express my thanks to them for their understanding and for their willingness to accept a reduction in income, as it were on behalf of future Italian MEPs and in the interests of common European rules."
"In addition, I would like to thank MEPs from the Greens, the European United Left and the Liberals, who have not, in this part-session, submitted any amendments aimed at reducing the 50% or resubmitted the amendments put to the Legal Affairs Committee, as I believe there to be no objective argument against what it has produced."
"This has been unequivocally confirmed by the wise men, from whom we received clear guidance."
"There is, however, one amendment tabled by a number of Members who basically want future MEPs' salaries to be based on those of their national counterparts."
"I regard that amendment as nonsensical, to put it mildly."
"The fact is that the whole point of the statute is to create equal conditions for this country's parliamentarians in accordance with Article 190 (5)."
"It follows that those who submit such amendments must, in order to be consistent, be opposed to the statute as a whole, in that they in fact seek to retain the legal status quo."
"Let me turn now to the issues of primary law."
"A number of Members have tabled amendments - Amendment No 28 is one example - aimed at adding to the Statute the old protocol on privileges and immunities."
"That, though, makes no sense."
"For example, Amendment No 28, which I have just mentioned, refers to MEPs' customs privileges, which, as we are living in an internal market, no longer exist."
"That shows how old this law is."
"This issue calls for new law."
"I might add that it is also the case that the way is now at last clear for us to have transparent rights to indemnification."
"This is something on which the Bureau will decide."
"I will conclude with an appeal to the Council, which now has a real opportunity to ensure that we get a forward-looking Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"Putting it simply, it must act swiftly to approve what this House has decided, and it should not block a decision by using flimsy and superficial arguments on tax law that have all been conjured up from nowhere."
"What I expect of the Council is that it should, as soon as possible - by which I mean before the elections - decide in favour of what Parliament demands."
"Once we have taken our decision tomorrow, the next move will be for the Council."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I am very happy to be here today to support the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, and I would like to join Mr Lehne in thanking Mr Rothley for his work."
"As Mr Lehne has said, Mr Rothley's proposal is balanced and received the support of a broad majority of the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"I believe it should be adopted in plenary."
"A total of 36 amendments have been tabled in plenary."
"Mr Lehne has referred to them."
"There are not too many for a subject such as this, but the Group of the Party of European Socialists has decided to support the rapporteur's direction as a whole, with some of the amendments which the rapporteur has also suggested to us in plenary today, so that we might remedy some of the flaws that were still present in the final version of the proposal."
"As the rapporteur has said, the aim here is essentially to create a Statute that allows Members of the European Parliament to be recognised, not as an extension of the various national parliaments, but as representatives of the peoples of the European Union as a whole."
"Mr Rothley said that the European Union is more than simply an international organisation and that, consequently, the Statute for Members of the European Parliament should be based within a Community framework rather than a national framework."
"That is what we are currently addressing."
"It is not a simple decision on remuneration."
"Our current, somewhat flawed, system supplements the flaws in national legislation with Community legislation on allowances, which has been the subject of a great deal of criticism."
"I believe that if we adopt the rapporteur's proposal, if the Commission also adopts it and, in particular, as Mr Lehne has said, if the Council adopts Parliament's proposal, we could soon have a Statute which would effectively allow Members of the European Parliament to be differentiated from members of national parliaments, with their own status, which would be appropriate for the kind of European Union that we are currently trying to create."
"Mr President, I hope we do not have to come here again to talk about our employment conditions."
"When I looked at the UK press over the weekend I could not recognise myself or indeed any of my colleagues in the lurid descriptions of our supposed lifestyles and endless perks."
"Many journalists have telephoned me with the opening line 'Oh, so you are about to vote yourself a 25% pay rise.'"
"When I explain the whys and wherefores, they suddenly lose interest, it is not an interesting story any more."
"Surely this is the point."
"Our conditions of employment and our expenses should not be the story, they should be transparent, a matter of public record: proper recompense for a job well done and reimbursement for monies paid out in doing that."
"Colleagues, I believe this is our last chance to reach the stage where we are no longer the story, but our work is."
"We have a package before us that in most ways represents a compromise for all of us."
"It is a package that should get through the Council if we are reasonable regarding items of primary law, but the Council too must compromise over tax."
"Some Members of this House may be uncomfortable about the level of salary: for some it is too much, for some too little, but finally we seem to have a figure that we can all just about live with."
"Then the expenses: again at last we seem, thanks to your work, Mr President, to have a proposed system that is much more transparent than hitherto."
"For some it may not go far enough, but it is a vast improvement."
"There will have to be some compromise and understanding on all sides."
"What we will have finally established, the big prize, is a single statute for MEPs."
"This is our last chance."
"It was hard enough to get here, and the circumstances will not arise again."
"We have a chance for interest in this House to focus on our work and not our pockets."
"I hope sufficient numbers of us will have the courage to bend a little and vote for this package and the amendments by the ELDR and other groups."
"Quite frankly, colleagues, although I pay absolute tribute to the work of our rapporteur, I do not want to listen to him in committee meetings on this subject for another five years."
"His very considerable talents and our time could be much better employed on other legislative work which directly benefits all Europe's citizens."
"It is now five years since Parliament embarked upon the negotiations concerning the Statute and, for some of my fellow MEPs, this is a significant political process that, at one and the same time, secures Parliament's power and legitimacy, with Parliament's right to adopt its own statute an expression of a federal, European democracy."
"For others, however, it is a farce of almost surrealistic dimensions."
"Behind the democratic principles of parliamentary self-determination, we in fact find another agenda, one as prosaic as MEPs' personal financial interests."
"It is difficult to make democratic principles credible when the real agenda is MEPs' own money."
"This Parliament has no impressive, democratic legitimacy to begin with."
"The turnout in every single election has been low."
"In a democracy as rich in tradition as Sweden's, turnout at the most recent election was less than 35%, and in the UK was less than 24%."
"I can assure you that this shaky legitimacy would be further undermined through the adoption of the proposed Statute. At least in the Nordic countries, people find it completely baffling that the Members of this Parliament are to be paid significantly more than national parliamentarians, especially when we are also safeguarding the possibility of maintaining or reintroducing the absurd expense systems which, in the Nordic countries, have been central subjects of criticism."
"Certainly, the Praesidium decided last week that travel expenses would be reimbursed as per account rendered, but Article 29 states clearly that the current absurd systems can be reintroduced."
"I would also observe that the issue of the national taxation of remuneration has now entered its final phase."
"At least for the Nordic governments, that is a crucial issue."
"The point is, of course, that national taxation would possibly be in conflict with EU law, and so the problem has not been solved."
"Those of us in the Danish People's Movement are unable to cooperate."
"Mr President, I only partly agree with Mr Krarup."
"I agree with him in the sense that there is a democratic crisis."
"This Parliament is in a crisis because we come under permanent attack by many of the public media in all the Member States for the indefensible state in which we are made to work at the moment."
"We all know that people in this House doing exactly the same job are paid a huge range of different salaries for it."
"There is only one thing which has made this tolerable. That has been an expenses regime which would otherwise be totally indefensible because it is absolutely untransparent."
"We are greatly indebted to Mr Rothley for bringing us so far down the road."
"We must take the step that will make it possible for this Parliament to stand tall and stand legitimate with a proper scheme on a common salary and a common, defensible and transparent expenses regime."
"Putting it quite simply, I would like to see to it that we have a system that can be understood, that pays people the costs they incur and that pays us all a fair day's wage for a fair day's work."
"It should be slightly smaller but it would just have been gesture politics to retable the amendment we put in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market since it was obviously not going to be carried."
"I respectfully disagree with Mr Rothley on the issue of privileges and immunities."
"I would like to see it in the Statute in something like the way he suggests, but frankly the provisions there strike me as much too sweeping, covering far too much."
"Immunity in these Berlusconi days is a difficult concept and we should not challenge our electorate."
"It is better to stick with the regime that we have, with the primary law that we currently have."
"Most of the amendments that we, the liberals and others have put forward seek to keep that basis for immunities."
"With these crucial amendments, the resolution can be carried."
"Finally, with great respect to everybody here, I do not regard myself here as an employee of the European Union: I am a representative of my constituents."
"I do not ever wish to pay tax on my income at a different level or on a different basis from my constituents."
"The permissive Belgian compromise that would let Member States bring a Member's taxation liability to the level of his constituents is a good one."
"I hope that we can find a way of making it legally valid."
"Mr President, the debate on a Statute for Members has now been running for five years, since the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Before the European Parliament elections in 1999, Parliament and Council seemed unable to agree."
"In a year's time the elections are coming around again."
"Will there be unambiguous rules in place regarding the legal position of Members then?"
"I fear that that will possibly not be the case."
"The Rothley report still contains elements which are controversial as far as the Council is concerned, but, even worse, there are amendments which would postpone entry into force until 2009."
"Does the European Parliament really think that this is the way to seek the confidence of the electorate in May and June of next year?"
"The rapporteur has shown himself to be a tough negotiator over all these years."
"Why is he putting the matter on the line, however, by describing not only the position regarding primary and secondary law, but also the privileges and immunities, because the latter constitute primary law."
"It would be a good thing if a majority tomorrow supported the series of amendments by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and others to abolish these."
"What is really important is that all Members receive equal remuneration."
"As far as we are concerned, reimbursing travel costs on the basis of the costs actually incurred is even more important."
"The latter is essential if we are to be able to face the electorate, and therefore we must do something about this quickly."
"What do we see, however, but amendments proposing waiting for a new Treaty, or until 2009."
"With all due respect, this does not make any sense."
"25 years after the first direct elections, it is high time we cut the Gordian knot on this issue; it is high time we put the interests of Parliament's work above our personal interests."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you are all aware, the issue of the Members' Statute has been on Parliament's agenda for countless years now, and, like other Members, I am doubtful whether, despite tomorrow's vote, we will succeed in resolving the matter completely under your presidency, President Cox - which is not to say that I do not hope it will be possible."
"We Radicals have consistently maintained - and continue to do so - that, with the Members' Statute, we need to look beyond the scope of Mr Rothley's report, to look beyond the administrative, bureaucratic status of European Union employees, to use Mr MacCormick's expression, and consider the rights of MEPs, first and foremost."
"It is intolerable, for instance, that, after 25 years of direct election, MEPs should still be forced to bear the consequences of the decision on the location of Parliament's seat. It is intolerable that they continue to be denied the same rights as national members of parliament, such as the right to visit prisons and other rights related to the electoral mandate to represent the European people."
"I hope that, pending the outcome of the European Convention, the Rothley report will spur us on to launch a wider debate on the need for the MEPs of the 25-Member State Europe to be granted, in addition to administrative status, rights which make them genuine elected representatives of the European people."
"Mr President, a Committee chairman can only feel great satisfaction at seeing colleagues congratulate each other, as Mr Rothley and Mr Lehne have done, on work carried out under his guidance."
"I am genuinely pleased because we have been working on this project for years."
"In actual fact, when I had the honour of taking on the chairmanship of the committee, I found areas of strong disagreement which it has only been possible to resolve through debate."
"As you can see from the speeches, we have worked together harmoniously, never losing sight of two important things: on the one hand, our desire to support the constituent process which is to give shape to a Parliament, its rights, responsibilities and privileges, and, on the other, the fact that the provisions of the Treaty are antiquated and obsolete, as Mr Rothley explained clearly, dating from the sixties, when Parliament was just a consultative assembly."
"Mr Rothley's draft, which we are about to adopt, seeks to lay down a new legal framework for the European Parliament and rules governing the exercising of its mandate."
"I too want to stress that it really is a Statute for a genuine Parliament, which covers not just the financial side of things and, if I may be so bold as to mention it, remuneration, which were fairly minor issues on which the debate in committee had reached an impasse, but the structure and organisation of Parliament's function, role, characteristics and mandate as well."
"I would like to be able to quote a major point of a report dating from 1986, which was tabled by Mr Georges Donnès, a great liberal."
"As far back as 15 years ago, this report stressed that the European Parliament was an institution destined to play a crucial role in the Community's activity and in the process of producing Community documents, and that there could therefore be no opposition to changes deemed to be necessary for the Community bodies."
"Even then, it was clear that some bodies would have to undergo a process of change."
"As regards the possibility of genuinely equal conditions of immunity for all the Members of Parliament, the author of the report wondered whether it would not be possible to define a position of genuine autonomy and immunity for Members of the European Parliament as such, for as long as the current distinction made in Article 10 of the Protocol - which we are now attempting to amend - was preserved."
"It can be inferred from the report I have just mentioned that such equal treatment is necessary not just to avoid the negative psychological effects of there being first and second class MEPs, but also because it is the fulfilment, a good sixteen years later, of a dream, a plan: making the Parliamentary institutions independent of other powers through the protection of the individual Members."
"This protection concerns our work and the image we want to give Europe of MEPs who, after many years, first and foremost after this Parliamentary term, through and under your presidency, are establishing a firm point of reference, which, not least, can only benefit enlargement by giving MEPs the effective role they should have."
"Mr President, this report is all about bringing respect back to this House."
"We should not forget that this is only the halfway stage, because when this report leaves here it has to be approved by the Council."
"The principle behind this report is good: equal pay for equal work."
"However, I have to ask whether we are all equal."
"According to some of the amendments tabled, I do not think we are."
"One of the amendments talks about the considerable economic differences which exist between the existing Member States and the accession countries."
"Is it not the case that there are considerable economic differences even within the 15 Member States?"
"So when we set out the principle of equal pay for equal work, the 10 accession countries do not fit into that principle."
"So we have got this wrong."
"The big issue for me is the whole question of the expenses."
"I congratulate the working group on coming up with a formula."
"Transparency in expenses is essential."
"We must stick to the principle of travel at cost."
"That is an issue which is in our hands and we can approve it without going to the Council."
"Let us not squander it and let us not waste it."
"Mr President, our aim today is to remove all those rules that make our work ridiculous."
"We must also appreciate the work done by our President to improve Parliament's reputation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore appeal to you not now to permit the use of legal quibbles, hair-splitting and primary laws to prevent what in this case is most important, namely that everyone who votes in the European election in 2004 should do so with pride and that our work should be easy to understand and our rules transparent."
"That is what is most important."
"Even though we all believe there are details that are not quite perfect, we must adopt a global perspective and take the opportunity that now exists and that many previous speakers have said will not perhaps be there again."
"A vessel runs aground if its crew has a false perception of the seabed."
"I am afraid that many people have a wrong idea of what is possible."
"We must use a proper map, a genuine maritime-style map."
"The correct way forward in this case is to approve the liberals' and others' amendments."
"That is the right course to follow."
"Mr President, what this boils down to is that this Statute for Members of the European Parliament, with which we are dealing, is a never-ending story, and the way in which it has gone backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards, in this House for years on end, actually passes all understanding."
"I cannot do other than agree with the rapporteur when he says that, politically speaking, the core issue is whether we are a parliamentary assembly or a Parliament."
"If we consider how it is that the European Convention is discussing the Constitution, while we have for decades been unable to sort out the issue of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, then the public will have every right to ask just what is actually going on here."
"It has often been my experience that the public are quite amazed by the differing salaries paid to MEPs for their work, and, above all, by how large the differences are."
"I am certainly in favour of this one House, by way of a Members' Statute, adhering to the principle of 'equal pay for equal work'."
"It goes without saying that I also expect the Council to take up this issue and very speedily take the decisions that will enable the Members' Statute to enter into force with the minimum of delay."
"I wish to associate myself with those speakers who have made reference to the issue of reimbursement."
"The fact that, in future, it will be our actual travel costs that are reimbursed is something that I see as being a core issue in terms of the credibility of the work done by this House and by us ourselves."
"I want briefly to discuss Article 20 of the Statute, which deals with old-age pensions."
"Our group has very lively discussions around this issue, as we, of course, cannot do other than note that discussions are going on in many Member States about raising the retirement age, and by a substantial margin."
"This goes hand in hand with an attack on social security systems."
"The proposal for the Statute, however, provides for us to have a retirement age of 60, which is low indeed."
"I believe this to be a contradiction, and one that we will be unable to explain to the public, and I see the application of differing standards to the pensionable ages of Members of this House and members of the public as amounting to privileged treatment."
"Mr President, this report is not about drafting the most ideal version of the Statute for Members."
"It is now about taking the negotiations with the Council a step further, and I am starting to despair of this."
"The Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, said that spectacular progress had been made in other fields, but that that was not the case here."
"In my opinion, that is very true."
"Why was the Belgian Government's compromise involving a supplementary national tax rejected?"
"Why do the major groups persist in wanting to regulate the new immunity and rules in this Statute?"
"Why must the language regime, too, come up for discussion in this Statute?"
"This contamination makes the negotiations too difficult."
"Objections of principle are all very well, Mr Rothley, but an acceptable agreement is even better; not only for the sake of principle, that is to say, a European rule for Members of the European Parliament, but also in order to put an end to the current questionable expenses practice."
"Last week, the Bureau adopted a new rule which will enter into force when the Statute does."
"My group grades the present rule an emphatic 'unsatisfactory', but gives the new one a good seven out of ten."
"It is true that we find the tiredness surcharges absurd and regrettable, but we welcome the fact that travel costs would be reimbursed only on the basis of the costs actually incurred."
"That is a considerable step forward."
"If an agreement on the Statute is rendered impossible, we are back to square one as regards the travel costs, too."
"That cannot be the intention ... can it?"
"I do not wish to intervene in the debate, but when that issue of the time allowance was discussed at great length in a working party, the idea was first commended to the working party by the Eminent Persons' Report to this House in June 2000."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I see this debate and the resolution as being about self-respect."
"This Parliament has been directly elected for twenty-four years."
"In a year's time, these direct elections to Europe's citizens' chamber will involve the citizens of twenty-five Member States of the European Union."
"In a few weeks' time, the Convention on the Future of Europe will be presenting a draft treaty for a European Constitution, and the next Intergovernmental Conference will be getting underway."
"There are important roles to be played by parties - including European parties - by the European Parliament as the only EU institution directly elected by the European public, by the citizens' representatives, all of which are an important part of the European project."
"To this day, nevertheless, there is no Statute for European Political Parties; despite that fact, there is to this day no Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"The time for them has come; indeed, the resolution is overdue, and I tell you that today's debate is important, because it is not only the Council that needs to do its homework on many issues - we do too, transparently, determinedly, comprehensibly, and in full awareness of our responsibilities, and, if the game of ping-pong is to be brought to an end, then it has to be spelled out that we decided that seven hundred MEPs were sufficient; it was the Council, in Nice, who arbitrarily increased our number."
"We are enacting the Statute for Members of the European Parliament on the basis of a report produced by outside experts."
"So far, the Council has not made the choice as to whether to go for a uniform European Statute or twenty-five differing assessments of the same work, and so, to put it briefly, our development from a parliamentary assembly into a European Parliament has not yet been completed."
"The public nature of this debate also means that we have to openly address the point that no member of a national parliament - exceptions prove the rule - travels as much as we do."
"No national parliament has more democratic freedoms than we do."
"No national parliament is as consistent as we are in increasing the amount of work it does."
"Although nobody can say that he does not need to improve, to become more efficient and more professional, most of us in this House do good work, work that has a value of its own and requires framework conditions specific to itself."
"In the coming weeks, the new European order will come into being."
"This will also involve a new role for the European Parliament and the revaluation of its freely elected members."
"All these things justify a transparent and uniform statute for the Members of the European Parliament."
"There is nothing to be said in favour of deficient self-confidence or of populist self-laceration, nor indeed of superciliousness or arrogance."
"It is important and right that the fundamental issue that Mr Rothley and I have raised should be decided rather than continuing to be postponed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us, with all the representatives of the Member States, not be afraid of making decisions or of the decisions that may be taken."
"Mr President, it seems that this time we are genuinely making progress and we are going to take an important step in solving one of the most flagrant anomalies that characterise the functioning of this House, by achieving something as simple as each and every Member being subject to the same system."
"It goes without saying that the text proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, whom I congratulate most sincerely, is a balanced text and naturally we are going to give it our full support."
"This fact, however, does not prevent me from making a few comments."
"In my country we say that military justice is to justice in general what military music is to music."
"There are times when I think that this Parliament is to a parliament what military music is to music."
"Tell me, ladies and gentlemen, if in any parliament of any Member State you are subject to the rules to which we are subject in this Parliament or whether it would be acceptable for any parliament to be subject to the degree of control and monitoring - for example in areas as important as drawing up its own rules - to which we are subject with the intervention of the Council."
"This, therefore, is not acceptable."
"I understand that there is cause for debate here, such as the subject of tax, and I believe we could debate this within this House."
"What I would like, however, is for the result of this debate to be the final decision, rather than, regardless of what we decide here, always having to be subject to the will of a body, the Council, which, ultimately, is only partially legislative, and to the will of the governments of the Member States."
"Mr President, the starting point of this debate is incredibly simple. It is that the terms and conditions of Members of this House are not satisfactory, either from a Member's or from the public's point of view."
"Not only should MEPs receive a fair day's wage for a fair day's work, we should be taxed on the same basis as those who send us here."
"As a number of speakers have already said, we are not civil servants - we represent the citizens of the four corners of the European Union, here at its centre."
"The arrangements put in place should be appropriately drawn up and transparent, and the expenses regime which is back-to-back with them should not be disguised remuneration, and in particular travel should be reimbursed on a cost basis."
"Although politically, expenses and remuneration are two sides of the same coin, their legal bases are distinct."
"We must not be pompous, hypocritical or self-serving about this."
"For obvious overriding political reasons the Council and Parliament must reach a political agreement about the two together."
"If either steps back from this it is breaking faith with the electorate and is culpable of wrecking the process."
"As a Member, I am sick and tired of cheap jokes about the 'gravy train': let us recall that the basic salary we, the UK Members, receive is, so I am told, about the same as that of a decent-sized supermarket manager in a provincial town."
"Such jibes degrade Parliament as an institution and the European Union as a political process."
"Quite simply, I say, let us stop the talk and sort it out, because if we do not, we demean ourselves and degrade the process of which we are part."
"As far as the contents of the Rothley report are concerned, we British Conservatives have deep reservations about some of them."
"The only way to break this impasse is to vote for the report as a whole, to take the process a step forward."
"We shall continue to work for a final outcome which will meet with our stated policy requirements."
"The immediate priority is to stop talking incessantly about the Statute and take some steps to do something about creating it."
"Mr President, the new rule the Bureau adopted last week stipulates that only travel costs actually incurred will be reimbursed."
"That is good news, and is also largely thanks to you."
"There is a fly in the ointment, however."
"The new rules will only enter into force when the Statute does."
"The chance of that ever happening is very small."
"The draft Statute provides for a common salary for all MEPs, but the proposal also stipulates that MEPs will pay European income tax from now on."
"That is unacceptable to many Members, myself included."
"I live in the Netherlands, I was elected by Dutch people, I use Dutch public services, and I therefore wish to pay Dutch taxes."
"Two years ago, there was a consensus on that point between the Council and Parliament."
"Member States would be given the freedom to supplement European taxes with national taxation."
"The rapporteur has swept that compromise off the table, however."
"Thus, the proposal does not stand a ghost of a chance, and everyone in this Chamber knows that."
"Last week's decision by the Bureau will not enter into force, therefore, and we will be back to square one."
"At a time in which budgets are under pressure and citizens are having to tighten their belts, we are opting to live it up, with outdated expenses rules."
"Although it may have been naïve of me to think that it would indeed be possible and that the political will existed, I sincerely hoped that within my own group, of all groups, a majority would opt in favour of the public interest and against self-interest."
"Unfortunately, that is not the case."
"Mr President, it is important for the European Parliament to obtain a Statute governing MEPs' conditions."
"It is also important for us to obtain a system that is transparent and that our electorate can scrutinise."
"What, above all, have been stumbling blocks for us, as Swedish Social Democrats, are the cut-and-dried travel allowances, the salary level, the Community tax and the lack of transparency."
"We have set down a number of absolute requirements as conditions of our supporting a new Statute for Members: firstly, that we can continue to pay tax in Sweden; secondly, that there be reformed travel allowance systems based upon actual expenses; and, thirdly, that we obtain a system that is open, that can be monitored and that our electorate can scrutinise."
"The proposal now before us contains a great deal of what we wished for, but it departs from what we want on one crucial point, namely when it comes to the possibility of paying national tax."
"In the vote, we shall support an amendment aimed precisely at retaining the right to pay national tax."
"If this proposal is rejected, we shall unfortunately be forced to vote against the whole proposal."
"Mr President, on behalf of the French socialist delegation, I offer our full support for the draft Statute for Members proposed in Mr Rothley's report."
"The success of the enlargement process renders the adoption of this report even more urgent."
"We approve of the approach taken in it and its underlying principles, above all those of openness and equal pay."
"The transparency of the system through which Members are paid must be increased: citizens are far from unconcerned about this issue."
"They demand answers from us."
"We should, moreover, apply the principle of equal pay for all Members as rigorously as possible."
"In order to put this principle into practice intelligently, allowances need to be adapted to reflect differences in living standards among the Member States."
"This is the means by which we will achieve truly equal pay."
"Similar mechanisms for adjusting pay according to the location of the workplace already exist for European officials, and are considered fair."
"The French socialist delegation has accordingly tabled an amendment to Article 16 of the draft Statute to this effect."
"We invite you to join us in supporting it."
"Please allow me to make an appeal to caution: democracy has a price, as we all know, and citizens must understand that."
"I would like to close by saying to you that this Statute, although not perfect, is a step forward, a step towards true European democracy."
"I hope that the Council will respect Parliament's work."
"I should like to thank all those who have taken part in the debate and the Commission for the positive tone of its contribution."
"In particular, I thank the rapporteur for his endless endeavour on behalf of the House in this regard."
"The vote on the draft decision will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, at 12.30 p.m. and the vote on the motion for a resolution will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that today's debate is an important one."
"We are about to enter the final phase of the legislative process relating to the range of measures on the internal energy market."
"I would insist that I consider it important to bear in mind that this package is emblematic within the Lisbon process, the objective of which, we must remember, is to create a more competitive Europe, with an economy which by 2010 will place the European Union at the cutting edge of international economic activity, with a knowledge-based society, full employment and also respect for the environment."
"I would particularly like to stress the extremely positive role the European Parliament has been playing throughout this procedure, in the quest for the result which I hope we will achieve during this part-session."
"The European Parliament has always firmly supported the Commission in its efforts to create a competitive and integrated internal energy market, which furthermore means moving beyond national markets."
"I would sincerely like to thank the three rapporteurs, Mr Turmes, Mr Rapkay and Mr Mombaur, for the fantastic job they have done."
"And I would also like to mention the shadow rapporteurs and the other members of the committee who have participated actively over recent months in particular in order to achieve this positive result;"
"I would particularly like to express my gratitude for the efforts of the delegation which has been negotiating within an informal tripartite dialogue so that we could hold this discussion today and on Wednesday reach an agreement in this Parliament allowing us to achieve a definitive text."
"The compromise we are reaching does not differ substantially from the Commission's initial proposals."
"What is more, these proposals have subsequently been reinforced by a series of points following first reading by Parliament, particularly with regard to the public service aspects laid down in the Directives."
"Once this series of measures has been established, all European Union consumers will be able to choose their provider from 2007."
"Small consumers will not therefore be deprived of this right and of these internal market advantages."
"From a structural point of view, many of the obstacles to fair competition will be removed, in particular the lack of independence of system operators and the absence of effective rules."
"At the same time, the public service requirements have been reinforced, largely, I would insist, at the request and on the initiative of this Parliament, with the universal service obligation in the electricity sector and strict protection measures for vulnerable consumers."
"The range of measures includes an essential component relating to the internal electricity market, that is, the Regulation on cross-border electricity exchanges which lays down clear rules in order to facilitate trade in the European Union."
"Although Parliament and the Commission would have liked to have made quicker progress with regard to a series of points, such as the opening up of the market and legal separation, I consider it essential that the directives establish unconditional dates and that the regulatory framework is clear for the industry."
"Everybody now knows what the rules are going to be and I would therefore insist that this is a very important step forward."
"The common positions have improved the results of the parliamentary amendments, above all with regard to labelling and the competences of the regulatory authority."
"The degree of influence of the parent company over the activities of the network operators has also been clearly defined."
"There is an aspect which I would like to deal with expressly this afternoon, because it is one of the most controversial aspects."
"It is of course the issue of the funds for decommissioning nuclear power stations."
"We all know that it is an essential part of the agreement reached."
"So much so that the last Conference of Presidents has included it as a specific point in this afternoon's debate, Mr President."
"I would like to present the Commission's positions with regard to it."
"Firstly, as I said on the occasion of the debate on these texts at first reading, the Commission fully shares Parliament's concern that the funds reserved for decommissioning and waste management should be spent as they were intended to be."
"On 30 January 2003, the Commission adopted two proposals for directives relating to a Community strategy and standards on the safety of nuclear power stations and the treatment of waste."
"The first of them focuses specifically on the issue of funds for nuclear decommissioning."
"I would like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that I committed myself to this before Parliament at the first reading of the legislative package, and that in January 2003 I gave the response I had committed myself to at that time."
"Secondly, following our contacts during the tripartite dialogue, we have reached an agreement amongst the co-legislators on the basis of an interinstitutional declaration and a Commission declaration on control and transparency in the management of those funds."
"In particular, Mr President, and in accordance with the request of the Conference of Presidents, I would like to refer to the statement which the Commission will make, a statement which corresponds to the Commission as a whole and which has been debated within the College of Commissioners."
"In the statement, the Commission points out the importance of guaranteeing that the funds established for decommissioning and waste management activities relating to the objectives of the Euratom Treaty are managed transparently and used solely for those activities."
"Within this context, and within the limits of its responsibilities in accordance with the Euratom Treaty, the Commission intends to publish an annual report on the use of the funds for decommissioning and waste management."
"In particular it will stress the need to guarantee the full application of the relevant provisions of Community law."
"Therefore, the Commission will review the situation of the funds and their use in an annual report, which will be transparent and will be communicated to this House."
"Thanks to the specific directive and the Commission's report, I am satisfied that this issue is coming to fruition and that it will impose greater transparency in relation to these funds because, ladies and gentlemen, although you proposed it here, in Parliament, I believe it is something that concerns all of us, and that in the meantime the facts have proved us right with regard to the need to deal with this issue, and I am thinking specifically of something that happened over recent months in a company in Great Britain."
"Mr President, I would like to repeat that the Commission accepts all those amendments which are in line with the agreement reached."
"I would like to end by thanking Parliament once again and in particular the three rapporteurs and the delegation which has participated in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission within this informal tripartite dialogue which we have carried out and for the constructive work they have done with regard to all these measures."
"I believe that, without this fundamental contribution, we would not be on the point of creating the most integrated internal energy market in the world, a market which means, furthermore, implementing the Community model, that is to say, liberalisation together with regulation, something which previously was thought to be contradictory, but which, as we in Europe are demonstrating, can be combined: the advantages of the market and the maintenance of a cohesive society, from which nobody is excluded, which not only looks after the weakest, but which also thinks of the future, of future generations and specifically of the protection of our environment."
"Mr President, after three years of intense debate, Parliament will this week vote on the second directives on the electricity and gas markets."
"What did Parliament and the rapporteurs try to achieve?"
"Instead of focusing only on the quantitative aspects of market opening, Parliament and the rapporteurs have made efforts to ensure that equal importance is given to the qualitative aspects."
"I am proud to be able to say today that we have managed to re-regulate and to make this market 'greener' in many areas."
"Those who are sceptical about the process of liberalisation will have to admit that this second directive on electricity implies a much better regulatory environment than was the case with the first directive from 1996."
"What have we achieved?"
"The objectives of the market today give equal status to competition, security of supply and the environment."
"Secondly, we have stronger regulators and we have taken the first step on the way to unbundling the separate interests of grid generation and retail."
"We were able to strengthen the public service obligations and impose stronger obligations on grid companies to ensure the necessary investment."
"There are strong requirements on the suppliers of electricity to inform customers in the contracts."
"I am particularly happy that we have obliged the suppliers to give full information on the mix of electricity and on the environmental consequences of their production."
"This will allow consumers in Europe to make an informed choice."
"It will also allow society to continue the debate on energy services."
"We also have a universal service, but not only that, we now also have the obligation to establish a supplier of last resort."
"All these measures will not be enough, however, to ensure that small customers will receive the benefits of the liberalised market."
"A single domestic customer will have to compete with big industrial consumers to get a fair price."
"It is only because we will favour and encourage small customers to bundle together in order to form sales communities that small consumers will now be able to get a good price."
"We were also able to strengthen the status of decentralised energy producers."
"We managed to establish the concept of long-term avoided costs."
"This will mean that the practice in certain countries, where you pay as much to transport energy for 200 metres from a co-generation unit to a neighbour as you pay to transport energy for over 500 kilometres will change and this will give small generators a real chance."
"It is the small generators, the innovation which we have through the miniaturisation of engines, the intelligent grids we have through the development of software, together with new independent power producers, that will be the panacea of the market."
"But these innovations will only come onto the market if, as politicians, we have the courage to impose a real level playing field."
"Innovation will not come from dinosaurs."
"Therefore we have to be careful over the next few years to ensure that the large integrated companies are not allowed to play too many games."
"We need ownership unbundling."
"We need ring-fencing of the decommissioning funds."
"It is absolutely nonsensical to speak of a level playing field if we allow the EDF to use EUR 30 billion, Eon EUR 12 billion and RWE EUR 10 billion from the decommissioning funds in the market."
"We also need a much more stringent merger policy against these oligopolies which are coming onto the market."
"Finally - and probably the most important point - we need one competition policy for one market."
"We cannot allow double standards in a single European market and we therefore need the DG Competition competences under the EU Treaty rules on competition."
"The game which the Commission, and especially Mr Lamoureux, as head of DG TREN played with the Council and Parliament over the last weeks is not right."
"This was an attempt to remove the decommissioning funds from Mr Monti's competences on competition policy."
"Commissioner, you did a good job on ensuring the establishment of an internal market."
"The games must stop."
"We as a Parliament will not accept double standards on competition policy."
"Finally, I want to thank all the rapporteurs for their good cooperation."
"Often it was trust in the rapporteurs that secured this important piece of legislation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by making the point with which my friend Mr Turmes concluded his speech, namely that we owe a debt of gratitude to our fellow rapporteurs and to the shadow rapporteurs."
"We have a total of two years of work behind us, and I have found the cooperation between the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs right across the groups to be highly collegial, very frank and full of trust, something I believe to be reflected in the outcome that we have achieved."
"I think this is a good result."
"Let me make four observations following on from what Mr Turmes has just said, with which I can only agree."
"Firstly, this legislative package opens up the way for more competition in Europe's energy markets."
"In opening up the way for a truly integrated internal market in energy, we are making a contribution - our contribution - towards our shared goal of making the European Union the most competitive region in the world."
"We have to make use of the efficiency gains arising from an integrated internal market and its capacity for bringing about political integration in order to achieve this goal, but also especially so that our small and medium-sized enterprises should benefit from this internal market, and so that other consumers benefit more than they have done in the past from its outcomes and from its positive effects."
"Secondly, the essential consequence of previous directives on the internal market was that markets were opened up in an unbalanced way."
"They certainly brought about greater competitiveness, enhanced efficiency and reduced prices, but the unbalanced development of the opened markets and substantial deficiencies in the detailed rules mean that we now have to enact specific measures to speed up the process of opening up markets still further."
"This means that we have to ensure equal conditions for all participants in the market, minimise the danger of the market being dominated, and, as far as possible, put a stop to predatory practices, for example those engaged in by the big players to the detriment of small enterprises."
"The fact is that we are not aiming at the replacement of public monopolies by private ones, but at a wide-open internal market in energy."
"My third point is, therefore, indisputable."
"An essential component of what we have submitted to the vote in this House is to lay down an ambitious timetable for the complete opening-up of the market."
"The timetable that we have now laid down jointly with the Council is ambitious, and, if we can make it work, this will be a great leap forward in comparison with what we have had so far."
"My fourth point is that the access of third parties to the network - competition, in other words - has to be regulated, with transparency but without discrimination."
"One of the essentials for this is unbundling, the use of company law to unbundle the network from production on the one hand and retailing on the other."
"We need one or more regulatory authorities with supervisory capacity, with the capacity and obligation to report, but, above all, the power to give instructions and the capacity to impose sanctions."
"We have also established the need for the State to be able to impose obligations for the general benefit without at the same time nullifying competition."
"Although the basis on which this will be done is laid down in an appropriate way in the directives that we will be voting on the day after tomorrow, it remains incumbent on the Commission to keep a very watchful eye on market developments."
"It is the Commission that must take appropriate measures to prohibit anti-competitive conduct by companies, and, above all, the Commission that must see to it that the Member States transpose the directive properly and promptly."
"It must be conceded that the Council has, in the informal trilogue, moved some way from its original position and closer to that of Parliament, but that was urgently necessary in view of the fact that a number of detailed rules in one or more of the Common Positions were, in my view, somewhat problematic, containing openings whereby competition might be nullified."
"The tight time-frame therefore means that prompt transposition is of the essence; everything has to be transposed into national law within the space of a year."
"With reference to this, I want again to make it clear that it is for the Commission to monitor the market and the terms of competition."
"Let me again underline what Mr Turmes has just said, that the internal market in energy must be subject to Treaty competition law and must be evaluated by reference to it."
"The Treaty instruments must be applicable to it, especially where state subsidies and the control of mergers are concerned, and I think that, on this issue, the Commission can depend upon the political support not only of my group - I can promise them that - but also of this House as a whole."
"Mr President, I have to start by making a statement in addition to my speaking time as acting chairman of the responsible committee."
"The voting lists for Wednesday that have been circulating here so far are wrong, or at least misleading."
"Let me say, referring to my own report, that Amendments Nos 1 to 5, are not the compromises they are described as in the lists."
"The Committee officially withdrew them."
"Amendments Nos 7 to 10 are compromise amendments, but Amendment No 6 is not, contrary to what is stated on the prepared voting list."
"Amendment No 6 is not part of the compromise; indeed, as I see it, it is out of order."
"I ask the Bureau to check whether it is out of order, so that Wednesday's vote can proceed in a correct manner."
"Mr President, please do not include this in my speaking time."
"Mr President, I would like to start by reiterating, with reference to the legislation on cross-border exchanges in electricity, that this law uses a number of measures to benefit a truly EU-wide internal market."
"There are to be funds to compensate transit networks for their services."
"In the Member States, charges on producers in respect of cross-border exchanges in electricity will be harmonised in order to avoid different competition conditions prevailing in different states."
"Bottlenecks in the networks will be apportioned in accordance with the laws of the market rather than on a territorial basis, and tariffs will no longer be determined by the distance between the contracting parties, but solely on the basis of the physical flow."
"It is also a good thing that this law opens the way for new electricity plant to be properly sited, specifically in the vicinity of centres of consumption, and not, for example, where the primary energy used is especially cheap, thereby giving rise to massive new transport networks."
"Taken together, all three laws that we are adopting are milestones for the EU's internal market."
"After fifteen years of discussion, they are putting into practice the freedoms in the area of energy that the Union's citizens were guaranteed in the Treaties - freedom of establishment, free movement of goods and freedom to provide services."
"These directives make these quite explicit."
"Moreover, they mean that the competition will put pressure on European firms to perform well, and it is to be hoped that these will soon, to an ever-increasing extent, discover their roles and capabilities in the global market."
"Let me make it abundantly clear, however, that those who make laws can do no more than grant citizens freedoms; it is the adult citizen alone who can make use of them."
"It is like an election."
"Voting in one is a right, but it is for the citizens to decide whether or not to exercise it; the reciprocity of supply and demand in the areas of electricity and gas is likewise something that the public have to understand and of which they have to avail themselves."
"This legislation hinges upon the question of how the remaining technical monopolies - the networks - are to be brought to market in such a way as to make competition possible."
"These laws contain important provisions for this purpose, in that, firstly, they put the networks themselves under the aegis of their own companies; secondly, they create regulatory systems in the Member States to guarantee neutral management of the networks; and thirdly - something that has been particularly important to Parliament - they govern the way in which these regulatory authorities in the Member States cooperate with one another and with the Commission, so that we do not end up with fifteen - and soon as many as twenty-five - different approaches in the Member States' regulatory authorities."
"There is one thing I want to make perfectly clear, and in doing so I am following on from what Mr Turmes said."
"If, after a number of years, Parliament or - Madam Vice-President - the Commission should find that this legislation has still not brought about a truly Europe-wide internal market in electricity and gas, then let nobody be surprised if the concept of a European regulator is mooted and then actually brought to fruition - which we are not doing right now - along with the unbundling of property rights over the networks, which we are not doing now either."
"Both these options are still under consideration."
"It is now for the participants in the market to avoid the situation in which the legislature would have to take such action."
"In view of that, my hope is not only that the legislation will be adopted, but also that the participants in the market, the consumers and service-providers, will bring it to life in a tremendous way."
"Finally, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs and draftsmen, who have worked together in a quite remarkable way on these issues for years on end."
"Likewise, Madam Vice-President, I thank the Commission, you yourself and all its members."
"Many thanks to all my fellow workers, whom I congratulate on doing a difficult and first-rate job."
"I would ask Mr Mombaur to provide the Presidency with a written version of the initial statement he made regarding errors in the voting list, in order to avoid further errors."
"Mr President, as regards the written text, I believe that I am no longer able to do that, as, firstly, the coordinators and rapporteurs agreed everything verbally, and, secondly, members of the Committee's secretariat were present, and they will certainly be able to sort this out."
"I will see to it that this is done."
"Fine."
"Let us trust that everyone will act correctly and that tomorrow there will be no problems."
"Making the internal market in electricity and natural gas subject to regulations applicable to the whole of Europe is a fundamentally sensible approach."
"The European Union's energy supply will be a central issue over the coming years and decades, one that will be ever-present and will demand our attention."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy takes the view, and environmental considerations demand, that the primary objective of any directive dealing with the generation and supply of energy, or with trade in it or the distribution of it, should be that the primary energy used should be, and be capable of being, derived in as socially compatible a way as possible and that its ecological aspects should be acceptable."
"That the generation of energy is, in itself, a fundamental ecological problem, is an important insight, one that is reflected in this directive and, above all, in the rapporteur's and draftsman's positions and reports."
"It is therefore incumbent on Parliament, the Commission and the Council to ensure that the conditions under which electricity is produced in the medium and long term are such that the primary energy is derived exclusively from renewable energy sources, such as wind, water, sunlight and biomass."
"The same goes for the production of gas, where we should do everything possible to replace the old system of gas supply, with all its weaknesses, with indigenous biogas derived from non-food crops."
"This will work if we succeed in compensating for the present disadvantages of renewable energy sources in competition with current fossil and nuclear energy sources, and if we manage to make the production and use of energy reflect the costs involved."
"Mr President, I must say first of all that I find it an absolute disgrace that the services were not able to present a package of compromise amendments with which to communicate with the public and the press."
"I hope and expect, therefore, Mr President, that you will instruct the services to ensure that we have the right package tomorrow."
"It is really disheartening for something like this to happen."
"The importance of the issues we are discussing was expressed eloquently by the Commissioner, and I shall not repeat it."
"I should like to give sincere thanks to my fellow Members, the rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs, and the Commissioners, too, of course - everyone who contributed - for this result."
"Above all, however, I also wish to commend the Greek Presidency - as it has not yet been mentioned for its tremendous commitment, because it has done sterling work."
"We in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have fought hard with the Council."
"In all fairness, I must say that Parliament has invested a great deal of effort, and I was not expecting the result that we have now achieved."
"I believe we owe this to the flexibility, commitment and constructive approach on everyone's part."
"Let us focus on a couple of points."
"Parliament has invested a great deal of effort in strengthening the position of the supervisory body."
"We want the supervisory body to be independent not only of the industry, but also, as far as possible, of the national authorities, because we want to avoid the PET problem, as it was then known."
"In any case, we have increased the gap between supervisory body and government."
"We have tightened up the competences of the supervisory body, and we have obliged it to contribute to the development of the internal market and the creation of a level playing field, in order to avoid the prospect in many people's imaginations of there being 25 partial markets instead of a single internal market."
"My colleague Mr Mombaur also pointed this out earlier."
"The second point for which we have fought hard is of course unbundling: functional unbundling, obligatory as from July 2004, and legal unbundling, obligatory by 2007 at the latest."
"It has been made clear that not one Member State may deviate from this, because there is a requirement for the Commission to produce an amended directive, which then has to pass through the whole parliamentary and Council process once more."
"This is the way it should be, too."
"I am also very grateful that we have strengthened the independence of the subsidiaries, that is to say, the transportation undertakings, from the parent company, so that the parent companies, that is to say the production or distribution companies, cannot just dip into the coffers at the expense of the maintenance of the networks, thus de facto frustrating a level playing field in Europe."
"The third point is that a great deal more attention has been paid to the level playing field."
"We have fought with the Council, and the Council has been well-advised enough to take over specifically those compromises that we have reached in the electronic communications sector."
"That will be the crux of the matter."
"The question - the key question - will also be whether the Commission is able to look into whether that level playing field has been achieved on an annual basis, by means of concrete analyses."
"There is an enormous amount of anxiety that we will end up having perhaps five, six, seven, eight oligopolistic undertakings - large undertakings - in Europe."
"On that point I throw down the gauntlet to the Commission to take hard action in cases where there is a lack of 'fair play', in cases of market distortion."
"Only then will we be able to convince our citizens that liberalisation is a good thing."
"I also think that the compromise on the decommissioning funds was a very significant achievement."
"I still do not understand why Member States do not dare to simply put down on paper, in legislation, that a decommissioning fund must be transparent, that it must be used for the intended purpose and that the normal competition rules are to be applied."
"Mr President, why do Member States not dare to put that down on paper?"
"I still do not find convincing the legal drivel - forgive me - to the effect that all this belongs in the Euratom Treaty."
"I can endorse the interinstitutional agreement, I welcome the new declaration by the Commission, but the Member States that prevented that from becoming law, from being incorporated into the directive, have got a lot of explaining to do to their citizens."
"We also welcome the fact that, as regards the public service obligations, there is not just an incredibly long list to be seen, but also a provision preventing public service obligations constituting a barrier to newcomers."
"This seems to me to be another important point for the Commission to note."
"In summary, I think that we have achieved an excellent result."
"Of course, as a parliamentarian, one wants more, but, given the point of departure, we have achieved an enormous amount."
"We can be proud of this, and if we do have any explaining to do to our citizens, it is that there are going to be improvements in quality and in service provision."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Europe will soon be alone in continuing to advocate total liberalisation of the electricity market."
"Even the United States is recovering from the California and Enron affairs."
"In Latin America, liberalisation has been marked by failure."
"In the United Kingdom, the state is facing the bankruptcy of British Energy."
"In Sweden, prices rose this winter by over 50% because of tensions between supply and demand."
"Electricity is a sector which requires long-term investment."
"It is concerned with security of supply, environmental protection and providing a public service."
"It cannot be governed by market forces and competition alone."
"In a number of our countries - my own, for example - the public electricity service means, in particular, equal pricing, access for all households, whatever their rate of consumption or geographical location, to low-cost electricity at the same prices."
"The mandatory total liberalisation planned for 2007, which you are proposing to us, will not allow preservation of the social and pricing adjustment mechanisms which safeguard this equal pricing."
"That is why we are going to vote for an amendment rejecting the motion which we, the French Socialist delegation, have tabled together with the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Belgian Socialist delegation."
"We believe that the plan to open up the market in two stages, without even an assessment of the first stage - the 2004 stage applying to all non-residential customers - being carried out before the sector is then opened up to competition for all residential customers in 2007, is an approach to liberalisation that is more dogmatic than pragmatic."
"Moreover, as regards competition, what we are witnessing is more a powerful trend towards concentrations of companies and the establishment of a market of oligopolies and cartels rather than of a genuinely competitive market."
"We consider it to be absurd that total liberalisation is being forced on us when the debate on the Green Paper has just been opened and we have not even had time to examine the possibilities of creating a framework directive to safeguard public services."
"Mr President, I am standing in for Mr Clegg, the rapporteur."
"I have just spoken to him."
"He is ill in bed, but, you will be glad to know, he will be with us again shortly."
"He wanted me to say that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes this very strongly because it is a major breakthrough in the single market and for the Lisbon agreement into a sector which has previously been closed."
"We welcome strongly and fully support the compromise on labelling and unbundling and on the dates of market opening."
"However, the principal point that the Liberal Group would like to make is about the funds for decommissioning in the nuclear sector."
"We want to support and thank the Commission for its revised declaration."
"Previously the Commission had told us that funds from the Euratom Treaty would be sufficient for the decommissioning."
"However, as everybody knows, the Euratom funds are not subject to proper transparency and accountability."
"Now that the Commission has told us that the competition provisions will apply fully in this sector, we are extremely pleased because this means openness and transparency and proper rule for the single market."
"My group will vote in favour of this tomorrow."
"Mr President, I would like to warmly congratulate all who have been involved in the hard work of bringing these reports to a coherent, positive and even strong conclusion."
"I particularly welcome the demands that nuclear decommissioning funds be fully subject to EU competition law."
"The management of nuclear decommissioning funds should never have been used or misused by the utilities as a form of state aid and as an excuse for going on a buying spree across Europe for other utilities."
"We risked this acceleration and creation of cartels."
"Therefore, I welcome the Commission's assurances here today."
"Neither the Commission nor the Council has covered itself in glory in the past on this issue but we have a more consistent approach now."
"In particular, although many Member States ring-fence these funds, France and Germany are allowed to set aside the funds for waste management and use them for acquisitions."
"This amounts to a clear misuse and even corruption with regard to them, and I welcome the fact that competition law will now apply."
"It would otherwise have had a very distorting effect on the energy market across Europe."
"How can we have a free market when there are three companies with EUR 10 billion or more at their disposal to buy up other companies?"
"I am glad that logic has obtained and that these funds will be subject to competition law."
"I also very much welcome the inclusion of sustainability objectives and the equal status given to sustainability together with competition and with security of supply."
"In particular, renewable energies need to be promoted throughout Europe."
"For too long they have been the poor relation, particularly to the vast funds that the nuclear lobby has been able to access by fair means or foul, as I have already outlined."
"I hope that more funds will be available for renewables in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although separate reports, at the request of Parliament, Mr Turmes and Mr Rapkay's reports amending the gas and electricity directives respectively have prompted me to table an amendment rejecting the common position in both cases."
"In effect, although I am not calling into question the work of my colleagues, I cannot resign myself to accepting proposals from a Commission which is becoming increasingly liberal, especially where energy is concerned."
"As in too many cases, the Commission is blindly following the dogma of the opening up of the markets to competition."
"Indeed, the Commission does not have the courage to create a universal energy service at European level and to explain how it is to be funded."
"Without this universal service, however, which is an essential prerequisite, there should never have been an attempt to challenge, at European level, the public service missions defined in the Member States."
"These missions follow definitions and methods of funding decided and guaranteed according to specific territorial, legal or constitutional requirements."
"Under the principle of subsidiarity, according to which measures are to be taken at the most effective level, only the Member States are capable of carrying out these missions to meet the demands of their citizens."
"I would point out, moreover, that even the rapporteur seems to have reservations as to whether the effects of opening up the electricity market to competition will be entirely beneficial."
"Therefore, I cannot endorse a Parliamentary debate which does not provide a solution but continues to destroy what does exist."
"Furthermore, it is inconceivable that we should presume to pursue the opening up of the energy sector to competition by extending to individuals a system originally designed for companies."
"It is irresponsible of the majority of the Member States to have given way to the Commission's proposals in the end."
"It is true that the primary responsibility lies with the Commission, which has sole right of initiative and is disregarding the negative economic, social and territorial consequences of its proposals in its endeavours to create a single market which is subject to competition alone."
"In conclusion, in view of all these considerations, I confirm my opposition to these proposals seeking to finalise the opening up of the energy sector to competition."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the constructive cooperation of the European Parliament and the other European institutions, we are now on the threshold of the opening-up of the energy markets in Europe."
"Many of our fellow Members have dedicated themselves to this for years."
"At the very least, then, the result can be described as commendable."
"In the first place, the long-awaited liberalisation should provide benefits for the consumer: I am thinking in particular of improved service and more competitive prices."
"I should like to point out that there is a paradox inherent in this."
"In my view, liberalisation will come at a price."
"It is a price which, paradoxically, will primarily be borne by the consumer."
"Particular attention will have to be paid to the way in which the distribution network is to be used, therefore."
"The price that the consumer will have to pay is of course the sum of the generation price, the tariff for transportation via the high-voltage network and the distribution tariff, plus all the levies on distribution and transportation."
"Distribution costs are the largest cost item on the bills of customers of the distribution networks."
"Besides, the chance of the average consumer seeing his or her electricity bill go down significantly as a result of the liberalisation of the electricity market is very small in some Member States."
"The reason is obvious."
"The limited increases in efficiency in the sector are too small to compensate for the new levies."
"On the other hand, account must also be taken of the fact that the scant connections between the various national networks are not designed for importing or exporting large quantities, but rather as mutual support in the event of the unexpected failure of generation units in one country."
"There is still a considerable lack of commercial intercapacity, therefore."
"If a genuine internal market is to be achieved, there is an urgent need for us to effect a significant increase in this commercial intercapacity."
"In conclusion, it can be said that an important step has been taken in the opening-up of the energy markets in the European Union, but that a close watch will have to be kept over the way in which this opening-up is realised, on an ongoing basis."
"Mr President, the energy reports up for discussion today must be understood as an integrated whole, which will have an important impact on the viability of the energy market in Europe."
"The European-wide energy networks will heal the market's spine and skeleton."
"The liberalisation package will, moreover, improve the market's circulation and digestion."
"Liberalisation must be continued and the network improved."
"In the first round of enlargement the new Member States must also be involved more fully."
"We have really had to wrangle with the Council over both issues."
"With regard to the energy networks, a compromise was eventually reached that will guarantee there is the necessary flexibility to amend Annex III, while at the same time ensuring there is sufficient parliamentary monitoring."
"Achieving this compromise has not been easy."
"The liberalisation of the energy markets is not any dramatic breakthrough, at least not from the point of view of the Nordic countries, although it is good that they are indeed being liberalised."
"This is definitely a step in the right direction."
"If necessary the Commission will probably make new proposals for further liberalisation of markets."
"Contrary to what some of our Socialist friends think they know, the free and open markets of the Nordic countries are functioning well."
"Freedom of choice for the consumer has grown, prices have fallen, services have improved and things run more efficiently."
"The market mechanisms have been working perfectly."
"It has to be accepted that prices can sometimes also rise in a free market."
"Rarely, however, are there situations where the same year sees one of the century's driest summers together with one of its coldest winters."
"What is most crucial in the liberalisation of the energy markets is that unhindered access to the networks is guaranteed."
"Consequently, the clear unbundling of network activity and the fact that the tasks of the regulatory authorities should be sufficiently harmonised are two of the most central elements in this package."
"Without them we can forget the word 'competition' when we talk about the electricity and gas markets."
"Now is the time to bring the debate on the package to an end: the compromises before us are completely acceptable."
"The package is an essential, albeit inadequate, condition for a viable market."
"We are now establishing framework legislation, but its implementation must also be monitored."
"The Commission must be equipped with the proper tools to monitor the viability of the markets."
"It will also be crucially important to ensure there is sufficient investment in the future."
"Finally, thank you again to all those of you who have been involved in working on this package."
"This has been a long, challenging and arduous process."
"Mr President, let me start by saying something to my friend and colleague Mr Désir, who spoke before me because he had a plane to catch."
"Much as I respect him, the great majority of our group backs this resolution, this compromise that we have reached."
"I might add that we also take the view that this directive safeguards the service publique or - as we would say - services of general interest."
"Indeed, what results from it is a new legal certainty."
"Services of general interest are compatible with competition, and, should the public interest so require it, the Member States will also be able to decide on derogations from the law on competition."
"What the French may, however, find painful is the fact that péréquation will come to an end, so that prices will not be the same everywhere, but I wonder what disadvantage is involved in the possibility of prices falling in one part of a country?"
"That is precisely the effect we intend competition to have."
"I would remind you, by the way, that one of the reasons why we started this debate on the liberalisation of energy markets at the beginning of the 1990s was that prices in Europe were very high, so that it was not only the companies, but also we ourselves, who were complaining that we were at a competitive disadvantage against the USA, our main competitor."
"These directives, in fact, represent the end of a long process."
"Having been in this House for a long time, let me point out that this process actually began at the end of the 1980s - with the absurd variation, incidentally, that the White Paper on the internal market made no mention of energy - and that, at that time, it was by way of the European Court of Justice that the attempt was made to open up the internal market."
"We said at the time that we did not want to leave the opening-up of the market to judges, but wanted to make it a political process, and that political process has now been concluded at European level by the resolution on these directives."
"What comes next?"
"That is the question."
"Transposing this directive into law will not be straightforward."
"It will affect the companies, and - as national enterprises become European enterprises - the work of trade unions as well."
"This liberalisation will entail new legislative tasks, especially as regards our obligations in the areas of environmental and climate policy."
"We will also have the important task of introducing elements of these into liberalisation, in that it will be a new task to make climate policy compatible with competition policy as embodied in these two directives."
"It will, not least, be important to involve the candidate countries in this process."
"I too would like to end by thanking all those who have played their part in this."
"Let me say this: it is not often that we work together in such a collegial fashion!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have expressed our complete and categorical opposition to the liberalisation of energy being promoted by the European Union on numerous occasions in the past."
"The proposed restructuring only benefits the strong monopoly groups and has adverse repercussions on the cost to the average family, national energy planning and the position of the workers in this specific sector."
"The Communist Party of Greece considers that energy is not simply a consumer product, but a sector of strategic importance to development and, as such, it cannot be the object of business activity and speculation, but should belong to the public sector."
"Consequently, we refuse to discuss the details, the terms and the speeding up of liberalisation and the relevant rules of competition; instead we shall support the proposals for overall rejection tabled by our political group."
"Allow me, however, a few comments on the regulation for the networks, which is being used to promote increased exports from strong Community monopolies which will benefit from the reduction in actual transportation costs."
"At the same time, it safeguards high profitability by passing the new financial burdens on to the average family, while the increase in exports will limit the development of generating stations in the weaker Member States in order to make use of domestic energy sources."
"In addition, control of national grids is being shifted from the Member States to the Commission, thereby cutting the potential for national energy planning in order to reduce energy dependency and ensure the needs of each Member State are satisfied."
"Cross-border exchanges in electricity can be used to reduce energy dependency, safeguard cheap energy and make use of domestic sources."
"However, the precondition for this is a policy of mutually beneficial cooperation between countries, quite unlike that being promoted by the regulation and the policy of the European Union in general."
"Mr President, I cannot help observing that we have ended up with two directives after all, just as we suggested at the beginning."
"May I congratulate all my colleagues on their hard work with the Commission and Council in achieving this compromise result."
"It is a tribute to the effective working of our committee."
"We have not achieved all we want."
"Past experience on previous directives shows that a foot in the door can and does lead to more opening than expected."
"My particular interest is in the interaction between market opening and liberalisation and the issue of security of supply."
"It needs to be said that more effective markets make for more efficient use of energy, and that is an essential element in maintaining security of supply."
"We should also stand back from the details to remember the purpose behind these measures."
"First and foremost, it is about choice, better value and better service to consumers of energy, both domestic and commercial."
"Experience shows that competition drives these objectives forward, and we have seen the benefits in lower prices and improved service in the UK."
"We need to see more improvement throughout Europe before we can say that we have done enough."
"We have learned over the past 15 years that progress in liberalisation cannot be achieved all at once and a step-by-step approach is more likely to lead to a better outcome in the end."
"I would like to advise the Commissioner that the Kangaroo Group working party on energy liberalisation is presently discussing the next steps we need to take in order to address the shortcomings not fully addressed in the current proposals."
"We must not think these directives and regulations are the end of the process."
"Mr President, we believe that the liberalisation of the energy markets illustrates once again the conflict between the European institutions and the peoples of Europe."
"It is highly likely that Parliament's vote will serve only to support the strategy for the - rapid - liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets and of the public service sector as a whole."
"The exaltation of the alleged positive effects of competition, namely transparency, lower production costs and increased job possibilities, is being contradicted every day by reality."
"In actual fact, what are most apparent are non-transparent decisions, the diversion of public funds into private interests, whatever the status of the undertakings, the rapid increase in prices for users, the granting of benefits to unethical private groups and the abolition of hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe, while, as for workers' statutes, they have gone right out of the window."
"For us, energy is an absolutely essential requirement and access to it a fundamental right."
"We believe that only genuine public, democratic control would allow us to streamline energy production and consumption while still guaranteeing respect for the environment and flat-rate adjustments."
"This would be an initial step towards a European public service which meets the needs of users and employees today."
"Parliament appears to be disregarding this concern."
"If it is to fully shoulder its responsibility to the citizens of Europe, Parliament must reject the directives on the energy sector and launch a genuine democratic debate on the actual effects of the policy which seems to be taking root in the European Union today."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of the energy market is, above all, to the advantage of consumers and for Europe's citizens."
"Why is it to their advantage?"
"It is because they can buy on the market the service that is best for them."
"Not only, as they did before, can they differentiate quantities, but now also in terms of quality and, in future, they will be able to do so as regards prices."
"I believe that one tremendous thing we have been able to achieve together has been with regard to labelling, in that public utilities will, in future, be under an obligation to indicate the source of the electricity, which will in future be independently monitored by the Commission, with the establishment of a group of European regulatory authorities which will share their experience with one another and thereby promote competition, to the benefit of consumers and of Europe's citizens."
"The fact is that competition means service, and that is what the public want; they want service and freedom of choice."
"In future the mix of energy sources will have to appear on the bill every year."
"What that means is, quite simply, that I, the consumer, will in future - or at least after 1 July 2007 - have the right to choose an electricity company, 100% of whose electricity is generated from hydropower."
"I think that is a great leap forward for all of us, and that, in future, greater transparency will result from this as a matter of course."
"Energy imports will have to be monitored by the Member States, and their sources will have to be certified."
"Ultimately, we regard the full application of Community law as having most especial priority."
"We believe that the decommissioning funds, together with the interest they yield, should be applied only to their original purpose, so that the costs must be borne by the form of electricity generation from which they result."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is all too good to be true."
"The energy market is different from other markets."
"On the one hand, there is a natural monopoly in the distribution and transport networks, which reduces competition."
"On the other hand, it is a sector in which the lack of adequate regulation means that price variations can be huge, given the rigidity of demand and the impossibility of storing electricity."
"Lastly, access to energy for all citizens must be seen as a genuine right, which brings us back to the question of public services."
"Of course, the texts do include the public service obligations but they do not go far enough."
"Indeed, the Member States are given too much leeway to organise and define these public service obligations, which means that the behaviour of the Member States which attach least importance to social cohesion requirements and citizens' rights will be legitimised."
"In consequence of that, free competition between operators will take precedence in these texts over public service obligations."
"This is happening at a time when the Commission, with its Green Paper, is launching the debate on services of general interest!"
"Why could we not have taken a little time to take stock of the sectoral liberalisation process and to make this issue the focus of a European policy?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those of you who know me will not be surprised to hear me confirm this evening that, not considering energy to be just another commodity, I and my group are firmly against the new proposals to liberalise the gas and electricity markets."
"Despite the procedural precautions and despite the undeniable eloquence of our Commissioner and our rapporteurs, we believe that these proposals run counter to the need to save energy and, therefore, to environmental protection."
"They will lead to job losses and, above all, to further deterioration of public services, and to the deterioration of energy networks and price adjustments, which are land-use planning tools."
"They will run counter to the diversification of energy sources, even though these are becoming more and more vital."
"They will favour short-term vision and calculations."
"The logic of the internal market is thus particularly inappropriate for the energy sector."
"I will end by reiterating that, far from harking back to the days of state control, I am in favour of a regulated world and a future for which we have prepared."
"In this sense, energy is a major tool, maybe even the most important tool."
"Thus, I dare to hope that, mindful of what is at stake, we will ultimately, one day, progress from a simple market logic to a political vision based on the concept of citizenship which is worthy of the heritage which we will leave our children in this field."
"Mr President, without wishing to detract from the huge accomplishment of our fellow Members, this is a subject on which there will never be an end to analysis and debate."
"I would like to focus briefly on the electricity market."
"The situation in Europe reveals structural differences which I believe the launching of the liberalisation process will not alone suffice to overcome."
"The electricity market in Europe has been concerned with linking markets but not with creating uniform conditions for access to generation, institutional systems and symmetry in fuel choices, with a view to establishing competing symmetrical conditions in the generation sector."
"The cross-border regulation, through market mechanisms such as specific auctions, for instance, in countries penalised by internal production conditions, prejudices the situations of economic advantage for the end consumer deriving from the availability of imported energy."
"Given the differences in cost and the congestion caused by a demand for energy which is considerably higher than supply, the effect will ultimately be convergence of the external and internal prices."
"The nuclear issue would exacerbate the situation, creating the strange situation where some people are called upon to contribute to the cost of decommissioning in other countries when they are not actually in a position to benefit, because of the market-based mechanism provided for by the cross-border regulation, from energy produced by nuclear plant."
"While we feel that the cross border flow efficiency mechanisms proposed can be endorsed in the long term, we consider that applying them in the short term would be extremely harmful."
"Therefore, we would support the raft of directives only if this were achieved by means of phasing-in the market mechanisms, for the cross border regulation cannot produce identical positive effects for the end consumers of the Member States when there are disparities in trade flows."
"Mr President, I am an advocate of an integrated market in the network industries which will serve as the basis for a competitive European economy and for social inclusion, particularly by means of interconnection, but on two essential conditions: that the joint networks are treated as public goods and that we are capable of managing a common energy policy."
"I endorse and welcome Mrs de Palacio's work to this end."
"However, I can see that neither our states nor our institutions are taking on board the concept of public goods as yet, nor are they adopting the idea of a common policy."
"Moreover, the Treaties do not give them competence to do so and the outcome of the Convention with regard to this matter is extremely uncertain."
"The sectoral directives are undeniably seeking to move towards public service obligations, focusing on universal service, the environment, interconnection and security of supply, but they are only recommendations to the states."
"As we are quite aware, we have no legislative authority to enforce a European right."
"Without a doubt, we are entering the realms of a regulation too, and by a regulation I mean a public measure allowing us not just to introduce genuine competition but also to bring it into line with public service obligations."
"Basically, competition needs to be developed further."
"Some Members want to force this."
"It is easy to criticise dinosaurs, my dear Mr Turmes, and overlook the contribution made by historic operators and what they did for consumers."
"It is easy to call for ever-increasing 'deintegration', but absolutely nobody has any idea as yet how to regulate a 'deintegrated', multinational competition system properly."
"It is ten times more difficult than regulating a national integrated monopoly system."
"We have not taken into account the Californian experience, price volatility or the inadequacy of long-term contracts."
"We are not capable of securing development investment."
"In particular, I noted the obligation, which I believe is premature, of separation in respect of distribution, with regard to which the Members are trying to outdo the Commission, for they want to go as far as separating ownership."
"We are not the only ones to want to create a retail market for household electricity supply."
"There is fierce debate in the United States and Canada."
"Do the gains offset the costs?"
"What are the gains?"
"Maybe the price of a pizza for an average household once a year."
"And the disadvantages?"
"All the transaction costs and lack of security."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, customers in my own country, Austria, have had a free choice of electricity suppliers since 2001 and of gas suppliers since 2002."
"It is now time for regulated liberalisation to be succeeded by a period of further deregulation."
"Rather than the pressures of regulation, we want more competition."
"That is why we say 'yes' to the internal market."
"Where this is concerned, I start by asking myself why it is that, in most cases, it is still by reference to the national market that competition is assessed."
"Does this old thinking bear any relation to cross-border exchanges in electricity and gas, or to the realities of the networks?"
"I would say, no, it does not."
"Does it not foster distortion of competition in favour of the larger states and energy-producing companies as against smaller ones?"
"I would say that it does."
"Reconsideration of this is necessary and appropriate."
"Turning to my second area of concern, I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Mombaur, and the Committee for taking on board the concerns of the Association of European Transmission System Operators and of Vorarlberger Illwerke AG."
"These have to do with the way in which the definition of cross-border flow is being changed to refer to regulated zones instead of to the borders of the Member States."
"The old definition is national rather than European and hence contrary to the promotion of cross-border exchanges in electricity through the integration of the internal market in electricity."
"It is something that we have to change."
"Thirdly, I would like to have something clarified."
"We keep talking about the regulatory authorities of the Member States concerned."
"By this, we should always mean the competent authorities - for it is not always necessarily the regulatory authorities that are competent."
". (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank the three main rapporteurs, Mr Turmes, Mr Mombaur and Mr Rapkay, most sincerely once again for their superb work and their speeches."
"I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their speeches and say that perhaps Mr van Velzen - one of the shadow rapporteurs along with Mr Linkohr and Mr Clegg - summed up best what most speakers have said here, in other words, that we would like more."
"I agree."
"The work that has been carried out here, however, has been superb and has led to the result we have now achieved."
"Perhaps it is not perfect, but it is sufficient to represent a spectacular change or step forward in the electricity and gas sectors, and will boost these sectors and contribute to the internal market."
"It will also address an extremely important issue, and here I am referring to what Mr Linkohr, amongst others, has pointed out, as has Mrs McNally, namely the problem of symmetry created by the current situation of partial liberalisation."
"What we are trying to do here is establish a European market rather than 15 markets - 25 as of May 1 - that is more or less open to competition."
"What we are trying to do is create an internal market and, in this regard, I would like to say, as has already been pointed out, that we do not want uncontrolled liberalisation, but regulated liberalisation, as I said at the start."
"Furthermore, Mr Herzog spoke of the problem of networks."
"I am going to discuss these by referring to Mr Clegg's report."
"I would like to thank the Greek Presidency once again, in particular, for the work carried out with regard to the liberalisation of gas and electricity in these two Directives and this Regulation."
"I shall now address the matter of networks, which Mr Herzog quite rightly raised."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has just voted on the amendments concerning subjects relating to the financial regulation and in this regard, in this context, I would like to state on behalf of the Commission that in our report to the other institutions we too shall present the reasons justifying increased support for any individual project."
"As the Commission proposed in revising the financial regulation, the possibility of such increased support should be clearly justified and should be an exception."
"Why do we need to establish trans-European networks?"
"Mr Herzog said that there is no Community logic in the networks, which is clear in some cases, and that in order to establish this internal market in the gas and electricity sectors we do not just need regulatory standards, but also infrastructures that support this idea of an internal market, and security within this internal market that allows sufficient capacity for peak demand points; extraordinary increases or extraordinary situations."
"I believe that in this regard the regulation we are adopting today represents a model for something we have been discussing for some time, which is the public service aspect of certain issues."
"This is the regulation that most takes account of the public service concept in addressing the issues of protection and support for the most vulnerable customers, security with regard to the service itself - in this case security of supply - and also quality of service, by drawing up minimum basic requirements for all the Member States in order to guarantee security in practical terms, not only in terms of production, but also in terms of transport, which are essential when we are discussing energy."
"With regard to these networks - Mr Clegg's report - I would like to raise two further matters."
"As regards the amendment on presenting regular reports, the Commission can accept a reporting period of two years."
"With regard to updating projects, all important updates will continue to be the responsibility of Parliament, and I would stress this, while the Commission will simply retain the capacity to introduce technical changes into the projects."
"I would also welcome the compromise achieved in this area by Parliament and the Council, which will enable us definitively to adopt trans-European networks in the energy sector, completing the entire framework."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Greek Presidency for the superb work that has been carried out and express my sincere congratulations."
"In particular, I would also like to thank and congratulate Parliament, the three main rapporteurs, plus Mr Clegg and all the shadow rapporteurs who have carried out this work that has led, even if we might perhaps have wished for more, to this superb result."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner de Palacio."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0144/2003) by Mr Wilhelm Ernst Piecyk, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 417/2002 on the accelerated phasing in of double hull or equivalent design requirements for single hull oil tankers and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2978/94 (COM(2002) 780 - C5-0629/2002 - 2002/0310(COD))."
". (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the sinking of the Prestige oil tanker off the Galician coast on 18 November last clearly demonstrated, once again, the insufficiencies of international maritime safety legislation specifically regulating oil transport by sea."
"This accident highlighted, in particular, the urgent need to adopt the measures presented by the Commission following another similar accident involving the Erika."
"Some weeks after the sinking of the Prestige, therefore, the Commission sent the European Parliament and the Council a new Regulation introducing three urgent measures into current legislation."
"First of all, an immediate ban on the transport of heavy oil grades in single-hull oil tankers bound for or leaving ports, offshore terminals or anchorage areas in the Member States of the European Union."
"Secondly, a revision of the scheme for an accelerated phasing out of single-hull oil tankers, by reducing the maximum permitted age of vessels and bringing forward the deadlines for abolishment with regard to those originally proposed by the measures in the Erika I package, in order to increase protection of the marine environment, thereby incorporating the Commission's original proposals in the so-called Erika I package."
"Thirdly, a more general application of the special inspection regime for oil tankers, in order to assess the structural integrity of single-hull vessels over fifteen years old."
"All this means that the new Regulation aims to change the current situation radically, making it obligatory to transport fuels with the highest pollution risk in safer vessels."
"By means of the new system, the European Union intends to apply legislation as stringent as that applied in the US since 1992 following the Exxon Valdez disaster."
"Lastly, this legislation increases technical inspections of oil tankers that have not yet reached the maximum age limit."
"All single-hull oil tankers, including small vessels - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would emphasise this point - that were initially exempt, will now, as of fifteen years of age, have to comply with condition assessment schemes (CAS)."
"Vessels that fail the strict inspection controls will be immediately held in any port of the European Union."
"As you are well aware, in March the Ministers for Transport reached a unanimous policy agreement concerning these measures."
"Examination by the Council made it possible to introduce a number of amendments that improved the initial proposal."
"For example, the Regulation now comprises a clearer definition of what is meant by heavy oil grades, for the purposes of applying the bans contained in the proposal."
"The definition is based on technical parameters that are well known to the sector and the authorities will have no difficulty in applying it."
"Account is also taken of the situation of the fleet of small oil tankers operating in our ports, islands and coasts, which requires an additional adaptation period, but which should also be the subject of adaptation and improvement in terms of safety."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Greek Presidency, and in particular the Minister for the Merchant Navy, Mr Anomeritis, for its excellent work throughout this process."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the key points of our proposal."
"Its final objective is, as we have repeated many times, to prevent another Erika, another Prestige, another Aegean Sea, another Amoco Cadiz, or any other disaster of this kind in our waters."
". (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we vote on this report this week, we will, I believe, have achieved in record time something that the people of Europe and the public at large have been awaiting with urgency."
"It is, after all, self-evident that, after the accidents involving the Prestige and the Erika, something had to happen."
"When it comes to transporting oil, we are giving old, unsafe, and dangerous ships no more chances."
"At the same time, Parliament and the Council are directing that bulk shipments may now be transported from and into EU ports only in double hull tankers."
"By combining these factors, which I see as the most important - heavy oil into and out of European ports from now on only in double hull tankers - and by significantly speeding up the scrapping of the old single hull tankers, we are making the sea and European waters safer to a substantial degree."
"Only a few months have elapsed between the Commission's initiative and the first reading here in Parliament, and this first reading will also be the last, as that is what has been agreed by Parliament, the Council and the Commission, who have, so to speak, taken a united approach."
"For that reason I would like to extend very warm thanks to the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, for playing their part in this process, as well as to the Greek Presidency, which - as Commissioner De Palacio has already mentioned - has gone to a great deal of trouble, and also to the Commission, for doing such a good job of bringing the Council and Parliament together so promptly to do this."
"This fast-track procedure was possible because the political will to find a consensus was there and - for we have to be honest - because the Prestige disaster made the need for action even more pressing."
"Let me just make the following points about the preferred timescale for scrapping."
"Single hull tankers in category 1, that is, ships built before 1982, may not be operated for longer than 23 years and must be taken out of service by 2005 at the latest."
"Single hull tankers in categories 2 and 3, built between 1982 and 1996, may be operated until 2010 at the latest."
"In this, the Council and Parliament have gone even further than the Commission, but I think that there is justification for putting categories 2 and 3 together, as there is no difference between them apart from their tonnages."
"Small tankers between 600 and 5 000 tonnes are rightly included as regards the carrying of heavy oil, and here too we have reached a compromise, as, in view of their small number and in order to maintain supplies, we have agreed on 2008, which means that, from that date onwards, only small double hull tankers will be able to be used to transport heavy oil."
"In this connection I would like to emphasise the international dimension."
"We know, of course, that shipping is international, and that European rules on their own cannot cover everything."
"Without European rules, though, we would make no real headway through the International Maritime Organisation, which is very heavy going, and so it is a good thing that the IMO is holding a conference on this subject at the end of this year, at which the Commission and the Council will attempt to have European rules made applicable internationally, in doing which they have Parliament's full support."
"It is also, of course, the case that double hull tankers on their own are not the safety factor on which everything depends."
"Other safety factors include port State control, the way in which a ship is maintained, a well-trained crew, and good navigation, often also with the help of pilots in difficult waters."
"The oil industry's argument, as set out in the 'Neue Zürcher Zeitung', that a well-maintained old single hull tanker with a good crew could be much safer than a sloppily-maintained double hull tanker with a sub-standard crew, may well have some truth to it, but it is hypocritical and somewhat stupid."
"Nobody, after all, asserts that a fifty-year old car is worse than a brand-new Rolls-Royce whose brakes work and whose driver doesn't fall asleep."
"For the oil industry to adduce such an argument is pretty dubious."
"We, on the contrary, agree that it is a combination of diverse factors that makes a ship safer."
"Let me address a couple more aspects."
"A Chinese freighter has sunk off the Swedish coast, and oil is leaking from it - 400 tonnes of it so far."
"That is why we will, in future, also need rules covering how fuel and engine oil are to be made safer even on double hull tankers."
"Old ships are to be taken out of service, and must be safely disposed of."
"If that is to be done in an environmentally friendly way, that cannot mean scuppering them somewhere in the South Seas."
"My final point is that Europe has a particular need for new and better ships, which - in view of the dumping that demonstrably goes on - must, for God's sake, not all be built in Korea."
"Whilst this is not a discussion about subsidies, the Commission and the Council do need to come up with imaginative initiatives on this, for the building of better ships in European shipyards certainly makes more economic sense than what happened on the coast of Galicia."
". (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, allow me firstly to make a very personal observation."
"The week before the Prestige accident, my party and I organised a conference on maritime safety in the Bay of Finland, that is to say on precisely those issues referred to by, for example, Mr Purvis."
"You can appreciate my feelings when I then suspected, and was finally able to have it confirmed, where the Prestige actually came from, and understood that the situation could have been precisely the same in the Bay of Finland as off the coast of Galicia."
"At the same time, we know that we can presumably expect the amount of traffic through the Baltic to increase tenfold."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has been closely involved in this issue."
"We are also trying to improve Parliament's reputation."
"We perhaps had something to hide where the Erika package was concerned."
"The opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy also emphasises the importance of neighbouring countries' subscribing to the same rules because, as Mr Purvis also pointed out, these tankers sail close to our coasts, even if they do not put into EU harbours."
"We also support the proposal for having 2010 as the final phasing-out year, a proposal that the Council had come up with and that we are now prepared to agree upon."
"We also propose that the inspection requirements be looked at."
"We should have liked to have seen the inspection requirements apply irrespective of age."
"We are now talking about 15 year-old vessels, but it is important for a vessel, irrespective of age, to be of a good class and standard and to be well maintained."
"Our experience shows that what the EU has agreed upon is in fact translated into the rules of the IMO."
"We saw this most recently in connection with the oil fund."
"What worries me is why we have not at this stage been able to adopt the proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that there be a paragraph stating that we must demand ice-strengthening."
"I want to ask the Commissioner why the Commission has set its face against our adding a paragraph introducing ice-strengthening requirements, in addition to the requirements for single hull vessels to be phased out and double hull vessels phased in."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Loyola de Palacio for her excellent work, and my colleague, Mr Piecyk, who, in a very short space of time, has produced a well-thought out and, in my opinion, very high quality piece of work seeking to improve the text of the proposal."
"I would like to focus on two points, firstly legislation."
"It is true that Europe has adopted a large number of measures, but it is equally true that public opinion is currently increasingly doubtful that they are being implemented."
"Over and above this report on double hulls - we must not, in any case, allow the examples it quotes by way of illustration to mislead us as to the impact, for we know very well that double hulls will not remove all maritime risks and that there is no such thing as zero risk - we believe that it is extremely important that the European Union ensures that the Erika I and Erika II packages are actually being enforced."
"In this regard, I have to say to the Commissioner that I compiled a detailed account for the port of Bordeaux last year, after the Prestige disaster, that is."
"Eight old tubs featuring on the European blacklist entered the port without the French maritime authorities being able to confirm that they had been properly controlled."
"I suppose that what happened on a small scale in this minor port is representative of a much larger scale situation across Europe and, in my view, what our citizens now want is for Europe to make the Member States directly responsible, as directly responsible as possible, for we know that they are not all progressing at the same rate and that some are more willing to cooperate than others"
"My second point concerns reparation for damage linked to disasters such as that of the Prestige."
"I have to tell you, Commissioner, that there is great disillusionment in France."
"The IOPCF is providing no more than 15% and the Structural Funds will not contribute any more than what is provided for under the FIFG."
"In my opinion, this will do a great deal of harm to the image of the European Union as a whole and to the image of the Commission, in particular."
"Lastly, again with regard to reparation for damage, we would like to receive accurate information on the progress made in dealing with the wreck and on what is likely to happen in the future."
"Are we facing chronic pollution, which will last for years, or is a solution emerging?"
"There has been no response from the authorities for some months now."
"We need accurate information and we must, if possible, reassure our fellow citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank the rapporteur and the Commission for making haste and bringing this proposal about so quickly, and also, in particular, for the soundness of the proposal on the accelerated phasing out of single hull tankers in European waters."
"It is sad that the Prestige accident proved necessary for us to take action once more, and to finally convince the Council that we have to make policy together and that it was necessary to strengthen the Erika packages with the present measures."
"I myself have another two amendments, which concern the Annex to this proposal."
"Firstly, as a liberal, I do not like to see a discussion on State aid to the shipping sector in an important proposal such as this."
"I recognise that action is badly needed, preferably through the WTO, to put an end to the dumping of ships on the world market by countries in the Far East."
"I hope that the European Commission also appreciates the necessity of this."
"I firmly believe in the strength of the European shipbuilding sector, however."
"Short-term aid does not seem to me to be efficient."
"I think that my own amendment concerning recital 7a is a good supplement to the otherwise excellent report."
"My second amendment expresses the great responsibility that I feel regarding the consequences of the accelerated phasing out of single hull tankers by this EU policy."
"I firmly believe that this must be accompanied by binding rules requiring all EU shipowners and all EU flag State ships to actively scrap phased-out tankers in a responsible manner."
"In the case of cars we have an end-of-life vehicle directive."
"I think that something like that must also apply here."
"In short, see recital 5a. Storing surplus oil tankers on the coast of Bangladesh and India causes greater disasters and has greater consequences than the Prestige disaster, and that was terrible enough."
"There are already initiatives enabling the commercial scrapping, on market terms, of ships in Europe in an environmentally responsible manner."
"This is waste management."
"The practice of disposing of ships out at sea and the rotten scrapping of these in poor regions must be a thing of the past."
"I hope, therefore, that double hull tankers will in future really be safer, partly also as a result of port State controls."
"I personally endorse, as does my Group, the Commission's aim in introducing this regulatory measure, which, in any event, we support."
"We have to say, however, that it has been a long time in coming, since we have already endured the Prestige disaster, which happened when the ship should no longer have been at sea according to the terms of the Commission's initial proposals."
"The measure is overdue and falls well short of what is required."
"The Union should adopt political and legislative measures to ban single hull ships carrying dangerous goods such as petroleum derivatives from sailing anywhere in waters under European Union economic control, and not just ban such ships from entering Community ports and using Community anchorages, as the Regulation does."
"We would like, furthermore, to see 'sensitive coastal areas' defined in this Regulation, and entry to them restricted for oil tankers posing a particular risk."
"In any case, we must be aware - and the blame lies with certain Member States of the European Union and with this House - that, over and above the proposals for double hulls, which we support, there are no political and legislative measures either in place or envisaged capable of preventing a fresh disaster if a new Prestige case were to occur."
"We Galicians are vividly and painfully aware of this fact."
"After this Regulation, and even in spite of it, a new Prestige may once again sail off the shores of Galicia and other affected countries; there is no law to prevent it."
"Mr President, in its Resolution of November 2002 and following the sinking of the Prestige oil tanker off the Galician coast, Parliament called for the Council and the Member States to speed up the application of the measures adopted within the context of the Erika I and Erika II packages, such as the introduction of double hull vessels."
"We therefore welcome the draft Regulation presented to us by the Commissioner, but we still feel that the gradual introduction of double hull vessels by the Union is an insufficient, if necessary, measure."
"So far nobody has explained to us the percentage reduction in maritime accidents depending on whether the vessel is single or double hulled."
"Nor has anyone explained what percentage of vessels involved in serious maritime accidents recently had double hulls."
"We believe this is a good thing and we are prepared to support the Commissioner in her personal crusade, but we do not want to fail to see the wood for the trees and we do not believe that double hulls are the solution."
"If only they were, Commissioner."
"Although they are not the solution, we do feel they offer advantages which, in our opinion, have not been emphasised enough."
"Two such advantages are that double hulls force us to assess the condition of our fleet and also force us to renew it."
"Increasing maritime safety involves financial costs."
"That is another matter that we feel is somewhat lacking in the Commission proposal - a little more clarity with regard to funding."
"We still think, however, that, although age affects the general condition of a vessel, all the experts emphasise that maintenance is a better determining factor than age."
"Like so many European citizens who have approached us, therefore, we believe that double hulls will only be effective if accompanied by the corresponding investment in improving the current system of inspections and penalties, which obliges vessels' owners to invest in their maintenance and in improving the social aspect in this sector, as we sometimes have the impression that the Commission would like to tiptoe around this issue."
"In this regard I would pass on to the Commissioner the question on everyone's lips: why, in disasters relating to the maritime transport of fuel, are the regions worst struck by this kind of tragedy those that are most closely linked to the sea, relying on commercial, fishing and naval construction ports?"
"In both Brittany and Galicia the shipyards have all but vanished, leading to industrial desertification of entire areas, and yet, the way things are, it does not seem as though these shipyards are going to benefit most from this Regulation."
"Korean shipyards, which are more competitive and have no problems regarding compatibility and State aid, will benefit most."
"This means that public opinion has the impression that the Commission is being inconsistent."
"Yes to double hulls, therefore, but only if the requirements and quality of renovated vessels comply with European construction quality standards, environmental standards, social standards and quality standards."
"I would also ask whether Korea meets these requirements, which are increasingly compulsory for our European citizens."
"What is a dirty vessel?"
"Will we find, due to the application of this Regulation, some recently built dirty vessels with double hulls?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly and most importantly I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on the efficient, proper way in which he has proceeded with this report."
"When it comes to this problem of marine oil pollution, the citizens of Europe, as well as the environment and the maritime sector, expect a Europe that takes strong action."
"I think that we have succeeded in this."
"I think that the proposals on the table here are the most attainable."
"In the longer term, I should also like to see the other proposals my group has presented return in the form of a directive."
"They are as follows: redefining heavy fuel oil as waste, establishing a European coastguard service, and an obligatory percentage of ship inspections per port and not per Member State: otherwise, in 15 years' time, we shall have the same problems with the double hull tankers."
"I have two further remarks."
"The first of these relates to shipbuilding."
"The European shipbuilding sector is doing particularly badly."
"Tightening up the Erika package has the potential to breathe new life into the sector."
"The Commission can present proposals on this."
"Secondly, I share the concern of my fellow Member Mr Vermeer regarding the worldwide measures."
"There is the danger of this leading to Europe exporting oil slick disasters."
"I therefore advocate banging our fist on the table at the International Maritime Organisation to press for single hull tankers to be phased out for good worldwide, ahead of schedule."
". (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, once again for his wonderful work and also for his speed."
"There is no question that we have all pooled our efforts, because we are all aware that it was urgent for us to do so."
"We rather have the feeling that the Erika I and Erika II packages have unfortunately come late, and that we must try to prevent being too late for a new Erika, a new Prestige or a new disaster."
"We must do everything we can to prevent this happening again."
"In this regard, I would like once again to thank the rapporteur."
"I must reply and make it clear that we are prepared to accept all the amendments proposed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, though with some modifications to the wording."
"Amendment No 3 requires the Council and the Member States to issue the Commission with a mandate to negotiate with the International Maritime Organisation; the honourable Members are aware that, although we do not formally have full powers within the international Maritime Organisation, we are coordinating the latest actions."
"I would remind you that we have had considerable success recently, multiplying the FIPOL fund by 5."
"A moment ago Mr Savary told us how clearly insufficient it was in relation to the damage caused by the Prestige accident, and it was also insufficient in relation to the damage caused by the Erika, but in the latter case Totalfina took a responsible attitude and contributed to some of the costs, something which the people responsible for or owners of the cargo are clearly not going to do in the case of the Prestige."
"That is now crystal clear."
"But, in the end, within the International Maritime Organisation, we have managed to increase the FIPOL funds by 5, to some EUR 950 million (more than a billion dollars at the current exchange rate) compared to 170-180 million dollars previously."
"That is a good result."
"We are in agreement with Amendment No 3, although there will have to be some modification of the wording."
"Amendment No 6 requires the Commission to present a new proposal, in as short a time as possible, in relation to the fuel all ships carry for their own propulsion."
"This requires an agreement within the International Maritime Organisation, which we are prepared to promote for newly built ships."
"This amendment therefore also needs some correction of its wording."
"Amendment No 7 refers to the shipbuilding industry."
"Several of the honourable Members have referred to it and are well aware - and my colleague Mr Lamy is here, and it is he who is handling the negotiations - that we have the problem of the clearly unfair behaviour on the part of Korea."
"We are implementing a series of measures to try to prevent the disappearance of European shipbuilders at a time when Korean shipbuilding and shipbuilding in certain other countries is growing as a result of the substantial state subsidies they receive, leading to entirely unfair competition."
"This support for our shipbuilders must clearly be provided by means of the World Trade Organisation and by means of certain types of specific action, but always guaranteeing compliance with the rules on state aid laid down in the Treaty."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take up some of the issues raised here today."
"Firstly, Mr Piecyk said that this is not a panacea, a point which has been repeated by Mr Purvis and other speakers."
"Unfortunately, replacing single hull oil tankers with double hull oil tankers will not guarantee that we do not have another sea disaster, either in Europe or anywhere else in the world."
"But it is one more measure which will allow us to increase safety."
"Safety depends on a range of measures, all aspects of which must be applied coherently."
"In this regard, Mr Savary was absolutely right when he said that the first thing we have to demand is that the Erika I and Erika II packages be applied."
"As the honourable Members know, the Maritime Safety Agency is operational, with a provisional headquarters, but operational nonetheless, and one of its functions is to guarantee that, in all ports of the European Union, appropriate controls are carried out; that the classification societies carry out their appropriate control obligations."
"These are elements which must be implemented with all the new requirements and standards we have demanded of both the port authorities and of the classification societies."
"The implementation of the Erika I and II packages and the Regulation we are discussing today is simply going to guarantee us a level of safety equivalent to that of the United States."
"Let us not allow a situation such as the one we have been in for many years, for too many years, which I believe to be inconceivable: that the citizens of the European Union have enjoyed less safety on their coastlines than the citizens of the United States."
"Following the Exxon Valdez the United States took quick decisions, while in the European Union we have been dragging our feet and not because there had not been other disasters before the Prestige or the Erika."
"We had the Aegean Sea, the Amoco Cadiz and many others."
"So what we are doing here is creating equivalent levels of safety."
"But that is not enough, and Mr Purvis and Mrs Thors were right about this."
"We must negotiate with Russia, in particular, but also with our Mediterranean neighbours, and persuade them to introduce systems which are equivalent to ours."
"I have faith in the crusade referred to by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, and I believe that I am not alone, but that I am accompanied by all the honourable Members and many people outside who have the same concerns as me."
"We must therefore promote the participation of our neighbours, of Russia firstly, but also of all the Mediterranean countries."
"The other day at the Euro-Mediterranean meeting of energy ministers the issues of the double hull, of port controls and of maritime safety were raised and there was support for this issue."
"And this weekend at the European Union Summit with Russia, Russia has committed itself to supporting the case for double hulls, not only in its own territory, but also, like the Mediterranean countries, in the International Maritime Organisation, because it is of little use if the disaster is caused by a ship in transit."
"Finally, the International Maritime Organisation must take steps in relation to the responsibility of the flag state, preventing flags of convenience, which unfortunately often disguise a complete lack of controls and guarantees."
"We must make progress on the human factor, which is always key and essential - in shipping, in the maritime sector, as in any other sector - and this means, as Mrs Miguélez said a moment ago, and there are proposals on the table, that the issue of the qualifications and abilities of crews is essential, not only within the Community, but also within the International Maritime Organisation and the International Labour Organisation."
"Eventually, legislation will have to be modified at international level, at the level of United Nations maritime law, so that the rights of coastal states and coastal populations are better safeguarded and taken into account in a more balanced fashion."
"We cannot allow freedom of the seas to become simply uncontrolled freedom to sail genuine ecological time bombs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are taking a very important step forward, but it is not enough; we must continue to move forward and a key element is the application of what we have already approved."
"Commissioner, you pointed out that a range of measures is required."
"As we have heard in this House, ice-strengthening is also required in certain marine areas."
"Is the Commission prepared to support this regulation's introducing a binding condition concerning this matter?"
"Or what other measures is the Commission prepared to take?"
". (ES) Mr President, at the request of the Finnish delegation, account has been taken of oil tankers in areas of ice formation in the Baltic."
"We have not only raised the issue of ice strengthening, in other words, specific safety measures for oil tankers in areas of ice formation, particularly, amongst others, the Baltic sea, with regard to a specific regulation in the European Union, but also within the International Maritime Organisation."
"We have also raised the issue of sensitive areas within this forum, as requested by some of the ladies and gentlemen here present, as well as the issue of prohibiting the carriage of heavy oils in any single-hull ship, not simply, as is currently the case, with regard to our ports and anchorage areas, but also with regard to any other international port."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner de Palacio."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0115/2003) by Mrs Erika Mann, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on regional free trade areas and trade strategy in the European Union (2002/2044(INI))."
". (FR) Mr President, this own-initiative report by Mrs Mann on regional free trade areas addresses two central aspects of the Union's trade policy."
"The first is the issue of trade policy being used as a strategic tool within external relations, particularly where development policy is concerned."
"The second concerns the relationship between the multilateral approach and the bilateral approach."
"Before addressing these specific points, I should like to thank Mrs Mann for her excellent report and for the spirit of cooperation in which she has worked, which has made it possible for us to exchange ideas and information over a considerable period of time now, something which I believe has enabled us both, Parliament and the Commission, to move forward in our thinking."
"As Mrs Mann has just said, our approach continues to be based on the Amsterdam Conclusions of June 1997."
"The Union's trade policy works on two complementary levels: the multilateral level first, that of the World Trade Organisation, and the bilateral level next, which is now increasingly regional."
"These two levels are justified, firstly by the fact that unilateralism is not an option for the European Union, and this is something that we have known for a long time."
"Secondly, since our priority is multilateralism, regionalism - or our bilateral agreements - complement this multilateral choice, the second level being as it were subordinate to the first."
"Seen in this light, regionalism is not a kind of ersatz multilateralism, but complements a fundamental choice, which is that of the World Trade Organisation."
"We actually believe that the globalised markets need common rules and global institutions to regulate them."
"The Union's faith in the multilateral approach, which it had ten years ago, is even stronger today."
"We want to manage globalisation; we want to reduce the destabilising effect of a number of factors."
"That is why an approach based on a multilateral trading system is our priority, as moreover is reflected by the agenda that was adopted in Doha."
"On this basis, I think that there is a very broad consensus between the position expressed by Mrs Mann and that of the Commission."
"For the time being then it is the multilateral approach that is our number one priority, and that is why we have postponed any decision to launch new negotiations on free trade areas until the round that we began in Doha is completed."
"In addition to this time constraint, we think that any new initiative in this field should be duly justified and meet a number of conditions."
"Firstly, it must be compatible with the WTO, and Mrs Mann reminded us of the rules in this respect."
"Secondly, a bilateral agreement should provide added value compared with the WTO, and when I say that I am thinking of the value of the WTO at the end of the Doha round."
"Thirdly, and finally, a new initiative should not distract us from our multilateral priority."
"Does this mean that we are neglecting free trade areas?"
"No."
"The Union has been a major user of these regional negotiations."
"Moreover, we are working very actively on a number of them, with Mercosur and with the Gulf Cooperation Council, and we recently concluded agreements with Chile and Egypt, amongst others."
"These agreements, both the ones that we have concluded most recently and those that we are in the process of negotiating, have some characteristics that are rather new compared with the traditional concept of a free trade area."
"We have as it were moved on a generation."
"Moves to liberalise trade in goods and services now increasingly go hand in hand with the adoption of new bilateral rules that go beyond multilateral rules."
"A second characteristic of this new generation of agreements is that the Union is increasingly seeking to develop region-to-region relations."
"Examples are Mercosur and the Gulf Cooperation Council, but also the Andean Community, Central America and South-East Asia - I will come back to this in a moment - or even the regional negotiations that will shortly be getting underway in Africa."
"We actually think today that it is this regional approach, bringing together several of our partners, that may bring greater economic benefits, since as it were the regional integration of our partners increases the market potential and makes the regulatory work more cost-effective."
"This is what Mrs Mann a moment ago called deep integration and it is initiatives of this kind that we are in the process of launching, including with South-East Asia in the form of the very recent cross-regional EU-ASEAN initiative launched just over a month ago in Laos, in Luang Prabang."
"Our intention is to start an action programme focusing on the main regulatory priorities of the two sides."
"This is also the approach that we have adopted in our relations with Canada and it underpins our work with the Andean Community and Latin America."
"To summarise the Commission's position on this point, I will say that the fact that President Prodi has not launched any new initiatives for free trade areas is not a sign of passivity but a deliberate choice."
"This is clearly explained by the priority that we have accorded to Doha, but also by our conviction that free trade areas in the traditional sense of the word are not really the right instrument for opening up trade in the twenty-first century and that we now need to modify this format."
"This, by the way, is also what guides us in our relations with developing countries, something to which Mrs Mann devotes considerable space in her report."
"We think, like her, that although there are advantages to opening up trade, these advantages only become a reality if several conditions are met."
"Firstly, market access is necessary for developing countries, but it is clearly not enough on its own to bring direct benefits in terms of growth and employment."
"A decisive ingredient needs to be added, which is aid to strengthen trade capacities."
"That is what we are providing at multilateral level."
"We are also providing it in the preparations for the negotiation of regional economic partnership agreements with our ACP partners."
"Are we entirely in agreement then?"
"Not quite."
"And since we do need to identify a few areas where we differ, I have looked very hard and will mention two before concluding."
"The first concerns the idea mentioned by Mrs Mann of opening negotiations with Singapore with a view to creating a free trade area."
"We are not convinced at this stage that such an initiative would indeed boost momentum in the region."
"For the reasons that I have just given, Mrs Mann, our preference is therefore still for a joint approach with the ASEAN countries."
"We are also hesitant about the idea that you put forward in your report that the Union should undertake to fill the gap in the budgets of developing countries caused by the reduction in customs duties."
"For the time being there is no proof of customs duties being lost, especially if the volume of trade were to increase as we hope it will, both in a South-South direction and in a North-South one."
"We are not ruling out this idea, but in the light of the data that is currently available it does seem premature."
"These are the two minor reservations that I should like to voice on behalf of the Commission."
"Nevertheless, it is clear that our reaction to your report is dominated to a very large extent by areas where our views converge."
"I would add that it is a great advantage for the Commission to have its strategy and positions supported by the European Parliament in international negotiations."
"For all of these reasons, I see this report as confirming the high quality of our working relations and would like to thank Mrs Mann once again for her excellent report."
"Mr President, first of all I would also like to congratulate Mrs Mann on her report."
"We are all aware of the fact that trade relations are a factor in economic growth, but it is equally true that not all countries have been able to integrate into the world trade system and take advantage of the opportunities it offers to improve their development, which has increased inequality between rich and poor countries."
"There is therefore a clear need to manage globalisation by means of multilateral standards drawn up from a policy perspective in order to make trade relations at world level a beneficial force for all, which contributes to the objective of eradicating poverty and achieving fair, sustainable development."
"It is therefore important for the European Union to define a trade strategy that places the specific needs of less developed countries at the heart of trade negotiations, in order to make possible the gradual incorporation of these countries into the multilateral trade system."
"In fact, the right of access - including non-reciprocal access - of poorer countries to the markets of developed countries is vastly insufficient for guaranteeing genuine development of trade flow if - as you yourself pointed out, Commissioner - we do not simultaneously strengthen their capacity for industrial and agricultural development, respect for the rules in force in the importing countries and familiarity with trade circuits, as well as their administrative capacities and their financial institutions."
"For precisely this reason, the Committee on Development and Cooperation fully supports the incorporation of the development aspect into the Doha agenda and welcomes the impetus provided to this end by the European Union, and specifically yourself, Commissioner Lamy, in order to promote this development aspect."
"At the same time, however, it considers that it is vital to ensure coherence between multilateralism and regionalism, between the rules established by the World Trade Organisation on the liberalisation of regional trade and the development of areas of free trade, including the proliferation of agreements between countries and regions with very different levels of development, because it believes that only this way, with this coherence, will we be able to make trade relations a genuine factor in development for all peoples and finally eradicate poverty."
"Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express the firm support of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for Mrs Mann's report on regional free trade areas and trade strategy in the European Union."
"Let me add a few observations."
"By means of this report, we are setting out the principles by which we trade and cooperate commercially with the world's regions."
"Of course, it also gives direction and a specific character to the many possibilities open to us there, which we also have at regional level."
"Our group works on the fundamental assumption that we are thereby able to build up free and fair global trade, and that those countries that have not so far had sufficient opportunity to engage in trade, have the chance, through the establishment of their own free trade areas, to share in this development."
"I see this - not only in view of what Commissioner Lamy said - as an important guide to the timeframe within which, in the aftermath of Doha, a renaissance of regional trade agreements around the world may perhaps come about."
"I get the impression the cooperation with certain countries - such as Singapore - can also be the key to regional free trade agreements with regions that are themselves not yet in a position, or not sufficiently advanced, to take partnership further."
"That is why we should be using the idea of cooperation with Singapore as the prelude to greater cooperation with ASEAN."
"The specific characteristics of the region present us with a broad spectrum of diverse possibilities, which must of course remain subject to the World Trade Organisation."
"The development of, for example, the West African market also requires, not only that we open our own market, but that West Africa should be put in a position to do better business with Central Africa and Southern Africa, as Mrs Mann pointed out in her report on South-South trade."
"Mr President, the own-initiative report by our fellow Member Mrs Mann makes a particularly interesting contribution to the fascinating debate on the relationship between regionalism and multilateralism."
"I am very much in favour of the multilateral approach, but I also remain convinced that regionalism and multilateralism can strengthen and supplement each other in many respects."
"I agree with the rapporteur when she says that the European Union must also continue to support and promote regional cooperation and integration in the future, therefore."
"In addition, the idea of using the establishment of free trade areas as instruments of development seems to me to be a very interesting train of thought, provided that they form part of a general package of reform measures."
"I should like to point out, however, that, for the benefit of the developing countries, we have to beware of ending up in an inextricable tangle of regional and multilateral initiatives."
"In my view, today the multilateral approach still deserves to take priority over regional initiatives."
"In other words, the top priority of the European Union must at this moment be the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda."
"The discussion on regionalism and multilateralism, as important as it is, must be postponed until then."
"In any case, Mrs Mann's report constitutes an interesting contribution to this, and for this I thank her."
"Mr President, the motion for a resolution that is proposed to us in Mrs Mann's report includes, in paragraph 21, a call for European trade policy to be brought fully within the Community system as such, with exclusive competence for the Community, majority voting in the Council and codecision with the European Parliament."
"We cannot go along with this Community fundamentalism, which is based on the idea that only supranational mechanisms are appropriate for this policy, so as to foster greater openness at global level and to sideline the nation states."
"But opening up world markets, as useful as it may be, is not everything."
"We also have to recognise that the Member States have societal models and fundamental interests to protect."
"We therefore need to leave them the means to do so and strike a fair balance between European policy and national interests, between supervision by the European Parliament and supervision by the national parliaments."
"In our opinion, Mrs Mann's report does not strike this balance."
"In particular, there is a need to recognise that taking decisions by a qualified majority in the Council may not always have the desired effect."
"Let us take a topical example: the Convention on the Future of Europe is reflecting on the possibility of making our entire trade policy subject to the majority rule, thus doing away with the derogations recognised by the Treaty of Nice for certain essential services, in particular cultural services, that this Treaty states continue to require unanimity."
"The French Government has protested and requested that unanimity be maintained because it provides greater protection."
"We approve."
"But as an aside, why accept this here and not elsewhere?"
"At the same time, an association of large, mainly American, companies, the International Communications Round Table, is obligingly writing to the Convention and to the Commission to sing the praises of the majority rule."
"This illustrates the fact that in practice this rule would make it possible to ignore opposition from individual nations in specific areas and thus bring down our defences."
"That is why we are asking the Convention to look at the bigger picture and to take a more balanced view."
"First, we need to increase the involvement of national parliaments."
"Secondly, the majority procedure should only be used for adopting safeguard measures."
"On the contrary, whenever it is a question of reducing our protection, decisions should be taken by unanimity so as not to damage anyone's interests."
". (FR) Mr President, I had not intended to respond as, until Mr Berthu's speech, all of the speakers had essentially confirmed our deep-seated agreement on the principles."
"I should just like to say a few words in reply to Mr Berthu on the subject of whether trade policy should be decided by unanimity or a qualified majority."
"Today, Mr Berthu - and this will probably be increasingly true in the future - we live in a world of elephants and in this world power struggles, particularly over trade matters, are largely determined by the weight of the participants."
"If the Union wishes to bring its full weight to bear then unanimity is not the way to do so."
"Experience has shown this."
"The situation is very simple: in this field either we want to carry weight in the world in which we live and will continue to live, and in that case in a Europe of 25 we need qualified majority voting, or we do not want to - and I certainly understand that this might well be Mr Berthu's point of view; it would not surprise me in the least - in which case we should indeed maintain unanimity."
"The idea that unanimity is the best guarantee of sovereignty is something that Mr Berthu has just reiterated."
"I am not surprised by this and I wanted to draw your attention to it."
"It is true today where cultural matters are concerned, as it is in other areas."
"Mr President, just a few words to say to Mr Lamy that I am not a self-appointed advocate of unanimity in all cases."
"I did say that majority voting could be useful when safeguard measures were being taken, because in such cases all of the countries have to show solidarity."
"But when it is a question of reducing our protection, unanimity is, I believe, useful, because it is not right that a majority should be able to impose measures that damage the interests of a minority of Member States."
"The next item is the report (A5-0192/2003) by Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the implementation of macro-financial assistance to third countries."
"Mr President, the own-initiative report that Mr Belder has just presented is both exhaustive and forward-looking."
"It will certainly give the Commission food for thought where macro-financial assistance to third countries is concerned."
"We share the view that Mr Belder has just expressed that we are currently suffering from a genuine lack of flexibility and from the fact that all aspects of the decision-making process in the field of macro-financial assistance to third countries are extremely cumbersome."
"He is right to stress that these cumbersome procedures and this lack of flexibility are due to there being no specific legal base or framework regulation setting out the criteria and conditions for granting macro-financial assistance to third countries and that this gap forces us to have recourse to Article 308 of the Treaty on a case-by-case basis."
"Clearly this is a serious disadvantage, even if in practice the instrument itself has proved - once the decisions have been taken - to be an effective tool for supporting adjustment and reform in those countries that have benefited from this macro-financial assistance: this is confirmed by the recent Court of Auditors report on macro-financial assistance."
"On several occasions we have explored the possibility of putting in place a framework regulation, as the report suggests, which would define the conditions for granting macro-financial assistance and as it were put this instrument on the same footing as other instruments for providing financial assistance to third countries."
"Unfortunately, so far these attempts have failed because for this type of assistance - no doubt because it also implies having recourse to borrowing and lending - the vast majority of Member States wish to retain a decision-making process that requires unanimity on a case-by-case basis, which all sounds very familiar."
"The Commission therefore shares Mr Belder's view on this issue of the legal base."
"Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the Council of Ministers, which, in this case, has the last word."
"That explains the current situation."
"We do not think, to be perfectly frank, that it will be possible to bring about any change in the situation before the conclusion of the Convention's work and the next intergovernmental conference."
"As far as voting by unanimity or by a qualified majority are concerned, our hopes are therefore in the hands of the Members of the Convention, once again."
"In the meantime, we will have to continue to manage this instrument, taking into account its inherent constraints, in as flexible a way as possible."
"To do so we will need Parliament's cooperation: sometimes we feel a little tempted to insist on this absolutely correct legal view and we do not wish this to be to the detriment of this instrument or to complicate it further when we have already said that it is too cumbersome."
"A difference of opinion over how this macro-financial assistance is decided on - which is certainly justified - should be no reason for us to deprive the partner countries of the benefit of this tool when they need our assistance and are striving to create stability and implement reforms."
"Its legal base is no good; it is too cumbersome and too complicated, but the aid reaches those for whom it is intended and we would not want these countries, bearing in mind the hopes that they put in the Union's ability to offer them this assistance, to be disappointed by these quarrels, which are admittedly justified, but which are so petty compared with their own hopes."
"We are therefore counting on Parliament, in its wisdom, to share this difficulty that we both have to live with, of an instrument that can only evolve if majority voting replaces unanimity in the decision-making process."
"Mr President, we on the Committee on Budgets have been drawing people's attention to how the use of the Guarantee Fund mechanism is a very cheap way for the EU to provide external financial assistance."
"The guarantees allow countries in difficulties to acquire credit on the international markets more cheaply than they would at normal market rates."
"As the guarantee has meant that the EU has not suffered any losses owing to defaults in recent years, it shows the criteria for assistance have been working."
"The forms of financial assistance provided under the Guarantee Fund have in recent years been macro-financial assistance and blanket loan guarantees given to the European Investment Bank."
"A ceiling is set for their use, the Guarantee Fund ceiling, which is provided for in the financial perspective."
"The Committee on Budgets has been surprised to note that the Commission and the EIB did not take full advantage of the potential of the Guarantee Fund last year."
"The resources used were wasted and poor countries were not helped."
"The use of this aid instrument could be added to the guarantee clauses with small technical amendments that will not in practice cause any problems for the Union's budget."
"All the institutions are prepared to reduce the provisioning rate of credit from the present level of 9% to 8%."
"That way we could lower the amount that has to be covered by a corresponding Guarantee Fund transfer for each credit transaction."
"We could likewise reduce the blanket guarantee given for EIB loans from 65% to 50% of the amount of the loan."
"This measure would have the same impact on the use of the Guarantee Fund as reducing the provisioning rate."
"These changes would mean there would be more to distribute out of the same allocation of funds defined in terms of its ceiling."
"The Commission should promptly propose such measures."
"Mr President, it is mainly in the detail that madness - political madness in particular - becomes apparent."
"Today sees the start of the Public Prosecutor's investigations."
"Five years in jail is the threatened penalty, and the scrutiny is rigorous, for the case has a basis in law."
"I am talking about Mannheim and the arena for World Cup football that is being built there."
"It appears that, two years ago, work was started on it illicitly, thus - or so those who have brought the case are arguing - putting field hamsters at risk."
"Although there is no evidence of any single field hamster having died, the machinery of a functioning state under the rule of law is in motion, in a way that you might describe as over the top."
"The Lord Mayor, against whom the case has been brought, fears for his political future."
"Taking up Mr Belder's interesting report, I do not have to quote all the things he lists in it."
"It mentions money, although none gets spent, and we can quite soberly describe this as inefficient, ineffective, and devoid of any solid legal basis."
"What is going on?"
"This is a blatantly typical example of how this Europe of ours does not yet fit together."
"Reforms are urgently needed, or else how many more dentists, how many more Eurostats, are there going to be for the Commission to stumble over?"
"The next item is the report (A5-0114/2003) by Yves Piétrasanta, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the annual report on the MEDA 2000 programme (COM(2001) 806 - C5-0524/2002 - 2002/2235(INI))."
". (FR) Mr President, I should first like to thank my colleagues who have worked so hard on this report, in particular Mrs De Keyser for her work on behalf of the AFET Committee and also Mrs Zrihen."
"I should also like to thank the European Commission and Mrs Gonzalo, who gave us all of the information that we needed."
"I would remind you that the MEDA programme is the tool through which our Mediterranean policy, as formulated in the Barcelona process in 1995, is implemented."
"The first phase was carried out by the MEDA I programme (1995-1999) and the second by the current MEDA II programme, which was shaped by my and Mr Valdivielso's reports in the year 2000."
"This new regulation entered into force on 15 December 2000 and we have been able to analyse how it has worked up to the end of 2002."
"The conclusions on MEDA I had given rise to numerous concerns, the overall payment-to-commitment ratio between 1995 and 1999 being only 26%."
"The main causes of this relative failure were identified as the length of the negotiations, the complexity of the programme's procedures, the multi-annual nature of some projects and the limited administrative capacity of the MEDA countries, together - it has to be said - with a lack of administrative resources in the committee in charge of managing this programme, obliging it to delegate work to Technical Assistance Offices, whose involvement proved to be ineffective."
"MEDA II is not restricted to fostering the creation of a free trade area in the Mediterranean by 2010, but enhances the previous economic cooperation in the Mediterranean with a social, cultural and environmental strand."
"For the period from 2000 to 2006 this programme has an overall budget of EUR 12.75 billion, made up of European Union funds and loans from the European Investment Bank."
"In summary, having analysed the situation in the documents that we have tabled, we would draw the following conclusions."
"Firstly, we note that MEDA II represents a marked improvement on MEDA I, thanks to the creation of the EuropeAid Cooperation Office in the External Relations DG."
"Thus, we have moved from an overall payment-to-commitment ratio of 26% in MEDA I to 37.4% in 2000, 53% in 2001 and 92.9% in 2002, an overall ratio for MEDA II of 59%."
"To achieve this, the Technical Assistance Offices have been dismantled and eight delegations have been set up (in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the West Bank), with a representation only in Gaza."
"These delegations can take action more readily, as they have Commission representatives and clearly identified resource centres in each country."
"Secondly, the comitology has been simplified."
"A methodological guide was published in March 2002."
"Thirdly, as we have recommended several times, Parliament is very mindful of the links that need to be established between the granting of aid and the respect of human rights by the various countries, and we ask for an annual report on this."
"Fourthly, we want there to be regular monitoring of the observance of democratic principles when projects are chosen, not just through the bilateral negotiations between the Union and the countries concerned, but also involving civil society and NGOs in this process and ensuring that the gender criteria, in particular regarding the participation of women, are respected."
"Fifthly, we stress the need to further develop South-South relations and not just bilateral relations, which even today absorb more than 85% of funds."
"Sixthly, we take into account the work underway in the European Convention seeking to meet the five challenges for the MEDA countries: demography, employment and migration, globalisation, diminishing natural resources and the environment and human rights."
"Seventhly, we suggest that the sixth framework programme of research should be used for carrying out research in the fields of the environment, agriculture - with the aim of ensuring food sovereignty - and in particular water management, and suggest that more emphasis be put on renewable energies."
"We recall that the Mediterranean Basin has the greatest variety of agricultural specimens and seeds of all temperate areas: these must be preserved."
"We want more attention to be paid to agrodiversity and to implementing projects involving farmers, tradesmen, consumers and SMEs."
"Finally, we want all of the opportunities afforded by the information and communication society to be developed, in particular electronic communication."
"Finally, let us note that all of this work under MEDA is currently being done against the difficult background of the post-war situation in Iraq, the resolution of difficult problems in the Middle East, the peace process, in particular between Israel and Palestine, and the new balance established by the Treaty of Nice with enlargement to 25, and here we need to continue our efforts to ensure that this is not a pretext for sidelining Mediterranean cooperation."
"That is why we support the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean foundation for dialogue between cultures and civilisations, as well as a monitoring centre for migratory flows, a Euro-Mediterranean investment bank and a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly, which would play a decisive role in formulating a properly implemented and well-integrated Euro-Mediterranean cooperation policy."
"(FR) Mr President, I should first like to thank Mr Piétrasanta for the important work he has done in drafting this report, which mainly concerns the year 2000, a year of transition for the MEDA programme, as he has just pointed out himself."
"Generally speaking, we agree with the remarks that he has just made on the substance of the report."
"I will first make two comments on the political issues he has just mentioned before moving on to more operational considerations."
"On the political points, and in particular the link between this type of programme and improving the situation in terms of political reform, we agree that we need to continue our efforts along the lines that he has just indicated, and that is why the Commission has just adopted a communication that seeks to give fresh impetus to the work being done in the field of human rights and democratisation in cooperation with our Mediterranean partners."
"Moreover, this communication also constitutes a partial response to the comments made in the Arab Human Development Report - a document that UNDP was brave enough to table last year - and proposes strengthening the political dialogue on this subject and drafting action plans on human rights and democratisation with our Mediterranean partners, the initiative as a whole being supported by the MEDA programme."
"We also agree with a second political point that was mentioned by Mr Piétrasanta: the objective of greater participation by civil society in MEDA."
"We have, for instance, extended the Tempus programme to our Mediterranean partners, encouraging exchanges in the field of higher education, and we wish to support the efforts being made by non-governmental organisations to formalise the contribution of what we call civil forums to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership as a whole."
"So much for the political issues."
"As far as implementation is concerned, the Commission is pleased with the progress that Mr Piétrasanta has just emphasised."
"The MEDA programme at issue, MEDA II, has indeed greatly benefited from the reform begun by the Commission in 2000 in the external aid sector with the aim of improving the quality of our projects, their financing and the speed with which they are implemented."
"Testimony to this - as Mr Piétrasanta has just said - are the efforts that have been made to devolve power and dismantle the Technical Assistance Offices, in which we are aware that this Parliament has for many years taken a keen interest."
"In fact the devolution process in the Mediterranean area is now almost complete, with the exception of the West Bank and Gaza, for reasons which are, alas, obvious."
"In any case, in Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, work to devolve power will be complete at the end of this year."
"Another notable effect is the progress that has been made on implementing the budget, be it the utilisation rate for commitment and payment appropriations - in 2002, 100% of the available funds were used - or the payment-to-commitment ratio, which increased to 75% in 2002 compared with 25% over the period from 1995 to 1999."
"Finally, concerning past commitments and amounts still to be paid, they had been reduced to EUR 200 million by the end of 2001."
"At the end of 2002, the amount still to be paid had been reduced by a further 50%."
"Clearly then the efforts that have been made have paid off and Parliament's support, which contributed to the Commission gaining increased administrative and human resources in this sector, has not been in vain."
"You have been able to see, and Mr Piétrasanta quoted similar figures to mine, that the investment you have made, that the Community taxpayer has made through you, has paid off."
"That is a good thing."
"It is a great encouragement to the Commission to continue to pursue this policy, as it is to the departments that have worked to implement it, and we do not doubt that the European Parliament will be able to see further progress when it scrutinises the results for 2001 and 2002."
". (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Piétrasanta and I worked together in perfect cooperation: you will not therefore be surprised to hear the same points stressed again in the few comments that I would like to make."
"Of the various points made by the AFET Committee in its opinion, two seemed to us to be particularly important."
"The first - and you have reassured us, Commissioner - was the need to ensure that the democracy clause in the association agreements is respected and the need to carry out regular and transparent checks on the impact of the MEDA programme on human rights, and this on the basis of an annual report provided by the Commission in accordance with clear criteria, a precise agenda and training in this field for European officials."
"The second point was the importance of establishing an open and tolerant civil society in these Mediterranean countries, in particular by supporting the independence of small NGOs, and in this respect the AFET Committee regrets the fact that so few Mediterranean countries have been selected in the horizontal democracy programmes under the EIDHR and that, for example, neither Morocco nor Egypt, where civil society is active yet still fragile, will benefit."
"This was and still is Europe's vision of a transition towards more democracy in the countries of the Mediterranean, a transition supported by MEDA funding, by various different instruments, but also by a dialogue, in the form of a forum today and perhaps a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly tomorrow."
"The report was presented in March 2003."
"A few days later war broke out in Iraq: it represented another vision of the democratic transition, a brutal and tragic vision that many people do not share."
"The Euromed dialogue is struggling to recover from this war."
"It will take more than a MEDA programme to get it back on track."
"Let us hope that the adoption of the Middle East roadmap by the Quartet will be the first step towards doing so and a genuine sign of hope."
"Commissioner, we would like to thank you for drawing attention to two political points."
"Mr Piétrasanta's report on the MEDA programme is widely supported and a joint effort: we really do have the same aims."
"The two political points on which you based your speech are, firstly, the importance of the role of the Mediterranean as a European border and also as an area which is the focus of a substantial chunk of our Union's foreign policy, and, secondly, the fact that the Commission certainly made its measures very tangible and more timely in the transition from MEDA I to MEDA II."
"Indeed, in our meetings with the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, we have been constantly reminded of the need for different administration timetables."
"In this connection, we note that the Commission is making a considerable effort."
"I will not, of course, list the points already mentioned by the rapporteur."
"I would like to focus on a number of political requirements which go hand in hand with the action programme."
"We certainly need to identify new social action programmes and, above all, we need to concentrate on protecting people with disabilities as well as new forms of cooperation concerning the protection of children."
"In the context of the situations on which you, Commissioner, are focusing, we would point out the need, with a view precisely to foreign policy and the role of the European Union, to insist on the conclusion of the Syria/EU negotiations in order to complete the network of Euro-Mediterranean association agreements, just as we must proceed as soon as possible with the selection of the funding programme planning projects which is at present suspended in Israel and Palestine, for they could play a very important role in this part of the Mediterranean region."
"I will end by stressing the need for a parliamentary assembly, for that is the political forum in which a solution could well be found to many of the processes currently in progress."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, seven years after the Barcelona Conference that launched the Euromed partnership, the European Parliament has an opportunity, through Mr Piétrasanta's report, to take stock of MEDA, this policy's financing instrument."
"I would like to take the opportunity to underline the excellent cooperation that we have enjoyed in the drafting of this report."
"The tense international situation provides further evidence every day that the economies and societies in the Mediterranean Basin need to evolve to become more prosperous, more socially cohesive and more democratic."
"This is in fact the only way, we are convinced, that we can work effectively to increase the stability of these regions and combat terrorism in the long term."
"The twofold reform that has taken place, that of MEDA - now MEDA II - and the structural reform of external aid management, has been the source of many new and very promising initiatives, including the creation of the EuropeAid Cooperation Office."
"Similarly, we have high expectations of the various strategic documents, multi-annual programming exercises and new shortened and simplified procedures."
"Nevertheless, we would stress the importance of assessing how the resources allocated to the programmes are managed, something which should be guided by a principle that is simple and yet, it would seem, so difficult: the amounts budgeted should actually be spent and spent well."
"The Barcelona process is also a project to create a vast free trade area."
"The new situation gives rise to new questions."
"Will the momentum behind the European Union's Mediterranean policy survive enlargement?"
"What is happening about South-South cooperation or interregional cooperation?"
"Finally, we should not forget that it is in our interests for the funds to be distributed in such a way that they target in particular priority areas, such as social cohesion, the development of democracy, human rights, support for civil society, the specific situation of women, culture, youth and sustainable development."
"Over the next few years we will therefore continue to assess progress along these lines under the Commission's attentive gaze."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Piétrasanta, and the Commission itself, because of all the MEDA programmes that have been presented on this subject, of all the proposals, this is perhaps the most realistic and practical and, to a large extent, the one which demonstrates that it is dealing with reality."
"In this regard, for example, I believe that for the first time we have distinguished terrorism as such, as an act that is distinct from government responses - which should also be condemned."
"Terrorism has been identified as a phenomenon that should be condemned in its own right and eradicated."
"It is very interesting that the road map and other measures to support Iraqi integrity have been raised."
"However, I would like to say, and in this I agree with Mr Piétrasanta, that our Mediterranean policy has a number of black holes or black spots and is essentially unbalanced."
"I feel we need to make an effort to render it more coherent."
"For example, like Mr Piétrasanta, I feel there has been very little investment in capacity building and the structure of certain administrative bodies that could achieve democracy."
"Given the structure of the countries, and of many of their economic administration services, amongst others, it is very difficult, because democracy does not consist of holding elections, but of building an entire system, which needs to be far more visible and systematic."
"Furthermore, we need to help the Mediterranean countries with which we are going to cooperate, and which receive a great deal of aid, to understand that the aid must go hand in hand with a deep sense of responsibility, within game rules that do not allow maximum, but minimum tolerance."
"I am referring, for example, to the administration of the funds received, just as other funds might often also be misused or used to finance oppression."
"I believe we need to show that democracy means a consolidated, transparent State."
"Without this there can be no democracy, let us not delude ourselves."
"I would say the same for the Assembly we are trying to create."
"We must be demanding and set democratic conditions that must be fulfilled. Otherwise we will only achieve unbalanced representation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.20 p.m.)"
"Guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States"
". Mr President, it is a pleasure to participate in this debate on behalf of the Commission and, above all, on behalf of Mrs Diamantopoulou, who regrets that she cannot be here today because she is attending a meeting of the Social Affairs Council in Luxembourg."
"We have now reached the final stage in our joint effort to reform the European employment strategy."
"All the institutions have worked together to reach a good compromise that is now fully in line with the European Council's conclusions, that takes on board most of the European Parliament's views and that is, whilst less ambitious, close to the Commission's initial proposal."
"Our ambitions should reflect the scale of the challenges we face."
"Firstly, full employment: to deliver full employment we need to create up to 22 million jobs if the Union of 25 Member States is to reach the 2010 Lisbon target."
"As far as quality and productivity is concerned, this means ensuring not just more jobs but also better jobs."
"We must take a positive approach to managing economic restructuring and we must reverse the slowdown in productivity growth."
"As regards cohesion and inclusion, we must tackle increasing social inequalities and persistent regional disparities."
"This, of course, will be an even more challenging ambition within an enlarged Union."
"These challenges can only be met if we ensure that all relevant players are closely involved in the employment strategy and that they all work together."
"What are the main elements of reform?"
"Firstly, stability."
"Through this reform we have to respond to the short-term challenges of the slowdown in our economies, and face up to the longer-term challenges of reform."
"A more stable set of guidelines covering the period up to 2010, with a mid-term review in 2006, should help us to respond to both short- and longer-term challenges."
"In principle, these guidelines should remain unaltered for at least three years."
"We have also been successful in presenting more focused, simpler and results-oriented guidelines that concentrate on a limited number of major priorities and set out clearly the results we are aiming for."
"The focus on results rather than process means more emphasis on the use of targets and indicators to benchmark progress."
"We have received considerable support from Parliament in this respect."
"Whilst we could have gone further, I welcome the fact that a reasonable number of well-focused targets remain."
"Emphasis on results also demands that more importance is placed on the recommendations to the Member States."
"In streamlining the employment guidelines and the broad economic policy guidelines it is also important to recall the advantages of this new streamlining of the employment policy coordination and the broad economic policy guidelines."
"We have to make sure that the simultaneous timetable for the two sets of guidelines fosters complementarity and creates a more coherent policy coordination at European level."
"I now turn to the new priorities."
"I am not going to refer to all the specific guidelines, but I would like to refer to the three main challenges they address."
"Firstly, the adaptability of people and enterprises must be promoted."
"Adaptability requires a good balance between flexibility and security in the labour market."
"It also requires investment in entrepreneurship and in helping people and enterprises to cope better with the effects of economic restructuring."
"Secondly, in order to achieve full employment, we must see how we can increase the labour supply further."
"We must better exploit the potential of all groups of the population."
"We must increase the participation of women and older workers on the labour market."
"We must fully integrate immigrants into the labour market."
"We must transform undeclared work into regular employment."
"Parliament's support was extremely important in securing an agreement on this specific issue."
"We now send out a clear signal that we want not just more employment but also better employment."
"Thirdly, investment in human capital is increasingly at the heart of the issue of creating more and better jobs."
"It is crucial for more employment, more productivity and also more inclusion."
"This calls for redirecting resources in favour of investment in human capital."
"Let me now address the views of this Parliament."
"I regret the timetable difficulties which Parliament has had to face."
"I understand your concerns and I know that both the Council and the Commission have done their utmost to take account of your views."
"Despite those difficulties, the revised guidelines I am presenting today strongly reflect the views of Parliament."
"Indeed, your views have provided significant added value in a number of notable areas."
"First of all, a reference to reducing unemployment."
"Parliament fought hard to include a reference on the need to reduce unemployment."
"I agree that it is vital to illustrate to Europe's citizens that these reforms aim to tackle directly the areas of most concern to them."
"I am happy to report that we now have such a reference in the opening paragraphs of the guidelines, even though Parliament's request went further in suggesting a new target relating to full employment."
"The second area concerned is that of a fourth over-arching objective on equal opportunities."
"As a result of Parliament's opinion we now have a stronger set of guidelines giving a higher profile to gender issues."
"The revised text does not go as far as including a fourth over-arching objective, but in two important areas the guidelines have been strengthened: firstly, the introductory text makes it clear that equal opportunities and gender equality are vital for making progress towards all three objectives; secondly, we now have a more complete specific guideline addressing gender equality as such."
"Concerning a higher profile for the entrepreneurship priority, the Commission very much welcomes Parliament's comments that the scope of the entrepreneurship guidelines should be widened to cover support for all SMEs, rather than just new start-ups."
"This proposal has been taken on board."
"As regards a more visible role for local and regional actors, the new proposals better reflect the importance of ensuring the close involvement of local and regional actors in the employment strategy."
"In line with Parliament's request, we now have a specific guideline on regional disparities that recognises the crucial role played by local and regional actors in addressing those disparities."
"The discussions on governance were rather difficult."
"It is obvious that this is a very sensitive issue for Member States."
"However, it is important to stress that the success of the new European employment strategy ultimately relies on improved delivery and better governance."
"This is even more vital when we account for the needs of the new Member States, who have openly recognised the crucial importance of the issue."
"This is yet another area in which we very much welcome the strong support of the Parliament."
"The guidelines now clearly express the important contribution of parliamentary bodies for improving the governance of the employment strategy."
"Despite the fact that this falls short of your proposal that national parliaments should adopt the national action plans, it does however reflect important progress in ensuring a better governance strategy."
"I believe that in taking on board many of your expectations, these revisions now reflect the shared views of all parties."
"The revised guidelines present concrete objectives, priorities and targets and strengthen the delivery and governance of the strategy as a whole."
"As such, they are an excellent basis to support national employment and labour market policies for the years ahead."
"Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino."
"Mr President, it was gratifying to listen to Commissioner Vitorino."
"Our work can have practical results, something which is needed."
"We have economic stagnation and growing problems in the labour markets in the EU."
"The resulting antagonisms concerning 'the right policy' are increasing, something we have noticed in this Parliament too."
"It has been my great ambition throughout my work as rapporteur to try, despite the difficulties, to unite Parliament behind a common policy."
"The basis for this policy was the Lisbon strategy, according to which economic and technological development should be combined with a concentration on work of good quality, cooperation between the parties, production and, especially, solidarity with weak groups."
"We have therefore put forward a range of proposals."
"I am able to summarise them very briefly now, because Commissioner Vitorino has already commented on some of them."
"Firstly, we have proposed increased attention to unemployment."
"That is important, for it is not enough just to increase levels of employment, as is done in periods of prosperity."
"That is not the same as combating unemployment."
"There can be access to the labour market at the same time as the long-term unemployed remain long-term unemployed."
"There is therefore a need for attention to be paid to this area as an important measure of renewal."
"Secondly, we have placed considerable emphasis on the fact that, in an economic situation like the present one, new jobs and new businesses are needed, something that certainly also requires political initiatives."
"We are now presenting a programme for entrepreneurship and new jobs that is much more comprehensive than the one contained in the Commission's guidelines."
"At the same time, we are maintaining and emphasising our demand for quality, sustainability and a perspective upon the future."
"Thirdly, we focus much more intently upon the equality perspective than the Commission's proposal does."
"Above all, we propose that equality be made into an overarching objective alongside the three objectives proposed by the Commission."
"The Council is clearly not ready to adopt this as yet, but we should no doubt continue to exercise pressure."
"It is not the last time we shall have that opportunity."
"Fourthly, we have put forward clear demands for regional and local employment strategies."
"I am pleased that there are clear responses to these demands, for it looked rather bad for a time when this feature had disappeared from what was the last guideline."
"Now, it has been reintroduced, which is important, because there is a need to be able to mobilise people and businesses from below if we are to be able to create the 22 million jobs talked about by Mr Vitorino."
"Finally, we have agreed to recommend that the Member States' parliaments adopt positions on the national action plans."
"They can then be more firmly rooted and combined with national employment policies."
"The problem has been that European employment policy has not been linked up with, or integrated into, the national policies."
"There has therefore been a considerable lack of efficiency."
"I appreciate that the Council is not ready for this, either."
"Perhaps we ought to go via the Member States and ask certain Member States at some point to raise this issue in the Council."
"They will then have Parliament's support."
"We have also agreed about other issues, a fact I think we can be proud of."
"We made no less than 16 compromises in the committee and reduced more than 160 amendments to a relatively manageable number."
"I should naturally be disappointed if, after all these compromises, it emerged that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats were still not completely satisfied."
"There therefore remains a certain lack of agreement, something upon which I wish to comment shortly."
"Firstly, the PPE-DE Group wishes to strengthen the Commission's wording on immigration and immigrant labour and does not want this matter to be addressed in the guidelines."
"Yes, this is a 'hot potato' in a number of Member States, but that cannot be helped."
"Irrespective of whether they border upon the EU or are in a particularly exposed position, all European countries face a common global reality whereby we are seeing increased immigration across our borders, something we must deal with in a document on employment policy."
"I am therefore opposed to Amendment No 62."
"Another disagreement concerns tax policy."
"There are quite a few amendments about this."
"I think that tax systems are very national in character."
"If we are to come up with views on this, we must express ourselves in very general terms."
"It is impossible to produce practical proposals on tax policy for 25 countries."
"I am therefore opposed to Amendment No 66 by the PPE-DE Group, which is very radical and demands a general reduction in tax for both individuals and businesses in all the Member States but says nothing about how the financial position is to be regarded."
"In my own country, Sweden, reducing the tax burden is not at all the thing to do, but I appreciate that matters are different in Germany and other countries."
"In conclusion, I just want briefly to say that the Liberals' amendments on tax issues are of a quite different character."
"They are interesting, but very drastic."
"It is a question of shifting the tax burden from personal taxation to environmental taxation and taxation of consumer goods."
"That is something I consider to be worthwhile, but it is not something we can probably decide in this type of document."
"In conclusion, I want to say that we have, in general, reached agreement."
"It is very important for us to be able to agree upon a document so that we have an answer to give to the Council that is sitting and waiting and will listen to what we are to say today."
"Mr President, there are too many states in the European Union in which the economy is stagnating, and many areas in which reforms have not been implemented."
"The coming year's enlargement from fifteen to an expected twenty-five Member States presents us with an additional challenge."
"The Lisbon strategy is an ambitious one, and its implementation must take account of these realities."
"It follows that we need to set other priorities for the European employment policy guidelines."
"As Commissioner Vitorino has already mentioned, this is about increasing the employment rate."
"It is also about increasing the value of products and raising the level of productivity."
"It is about reforms to the various systems of taxation and social security benefits - which, Mr Schmid, are in fact matters for the Member States - where a balance is to be maintained between flexibility and security."
"It is about activating those who are willing to work and capable of work, and about better involvement of the local and regional stakeholders. Finally, it is about mounting a more determined attack upon the black economy."
"Mr Schmid was prepared to take on board many of my group's amendments."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I thank you for your good cooperation."
"Our proposals are reflected in what are now sixteen workable compromises, including on the use of educational and training methods to create workplaces of high quality, on increasing the level of investment in enterprises, on strategies for lifelong learning in accordance with the requirements and abilities of those involved, on the abolition of subsidies to industries which have no viable future, and on job creation in regions with a high level of unemployment."
"Despite this, a number of our core points are absent from the areas of the setting up of new enterprises, monetary policy and taxation."
"Firstly, one of the essential aspects of the European Employment Strategy's approach is the practical support for the setting up of enterprises, which goes beyond simplified administrative procedures and involves the extension of information networks for those starting new businesses."
"If these - and as a result, new jobs - are to be created, there needs to be easier access to credit on favourable terms, so we need more dependable equity capital finance - an area where the European Union differs to a marked degree from the United States."
"If there is sufficient liquidity, then competitiveness is ensured."
"Secondly, we cannot accept the renewed attempt at marginalising the Stability Pact, on which, in the eurozone, the confidence of economic decision-makers and consumers depends."
"It cannot be put to one side, even if, in certain Member States, ministers make so bold as to negotiate exemptions for their portfolios."
"The logical consequence of undermining the Stability Pact, which is so important, would be the loss of public confidence and the weakening of the euro, which is, thank God, a strong currency."
"Thirdly, there must be incentives in law to make employment more attractive to workers and employers."
"This should involve reducing the tax burden on work to such an extent that the creation of new jobs ends up being less costly, which will make it possible to combat more effectively the black economy, which is booming."
"Overall, we should be working towards reducing the tax burdens in the Member States - for it is at that level that they are imposed - to such an extent that the public can again afford more and enterprises can at last get back to being more entrepreneurial."
"I very much hope that these amendments from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which we again discussed last night, will be approved by the plenary at noon today."
"Only then, Mr Schmid, will I be able to recommend to my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that they should endorse this report - only then!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Herman Schmid for the unusually constructive cooperation that went into preparing this proposal, which I think is important."
"Employment policy is important on the whole."
"We now have a new framework to operate within, concerned with tighter coordination with the economic guidelines, more long-term thinking and more concentration upon the result of implementation in the Member States."
"We fully agree with this strategy."
"I wish to emphasise how important it is for the employment strategy to be put on the same footing as the economic guidelines so that they carry the same weight in this process."
"Allow me to say something about the overarching objectives."
"We have abandoned the pillar structure."
"The fact that we now have full employment as an objective is particularly important."
"It is also important, as Mr Herman Schmid says, to supplement the employment objective with an objective relating to unemployment."
"Even if these are two aspects that run approximately in tandem, they do not do so one hundred per cent."
"It may be the case that employment is increasing but that there still remains a high degree of unemployment."
"Another objective is work of good quality."
"In the future, Europe will not compete through cheap labour but through the quality of the products and services we are able to produce."
"For this, we need a properly educated labour force."
"Educating the labour force to make Europe competitive is clearly linked to lifelong learning."
"A third important issue is integration."
"It is not only a question of integration between regions, leading to a high level of employment - or full employment - throughout Europe, but also of there at present being groups that are, to a large extent, outside the labour market, for example people with disabilities and people from other countries."
"That is important."
"The equality aspects have already been talked about, and it is important that we highlight them."
"They had a pillar of their own in the previous strategy."
"It is also important that the national parliaments be involved and that it be possible to supplement the overarching common objectives by national objectives."
"Allow me briefly to say something about the disagreement."
"We need to resolve this in the committee."
"We have slightly different views of flexibility and security, but we shall succeed in agreeing on this point and saying that we need a balance."
"When it comes to the tax issue, I do not share Mr Mann's view."
"You only have to look around in the European Union. Some of those countries that have the lowest unemployment and the highest levels of people in work do in actual fact also have the heaviest tax burden."
"This suggests to me that the tax issue is somewhat more complicated than appears from Mr Mann's amendment."
"The level of employment is determined by a large number of factors."
"It is an over-simplification to say that, generally speaking, a reduction in tax is also good for employment."
"The fact is, it is not."
"I wish, however, to say that I shall vote in such a way that we preserve unity in this House."
"What would be worst of all is if we in Parliament were not to express our view, now that we have an opportunity to do so."
"I shall be guided by that consideration in the vote."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Schmid for his hard work and for the way that he has succeeded in forging compromises across the political groups."
"His report has our broad support."
"That said, we have some concerns."
"First, we feel that too much detail may have crept both into the main report and certain amendments before plenary."
"Second, we wonder about some of the provisions on childcare and the reconciliation of work and family life."
"Are they fully compatible with sound public finance?"
"In specifying the public sector, do they not ignore other means of delivering the same objectives as, for example, through the social partners?"
"On plenary amendments, we think that Amendment Nos 65 and 66 may send the wrong messages, respectively by implying a reduction in wages and by suggesting a one-size-fits-all approach."
"We prefer our own Amendment No 58."
"On the positive side, we applaud the references to people with disabilities and hope that a proposal for a horizontal directive will soon be forthcoming."
"We endorse the objective of gender equality and recognise particularly the need for special support for women returning to work."
"I add my own particular concern about the continuing gender pay gap and call for a concerted effort to close it."
"Finally, we fully agree with the need for all stakeholders to be involved, including the parliaments within the Member States."
"Some are, and we welcome the initiative of others, such as the European Committee of the Scottish Parliament, to become so."
"But this should simply be the norm."
"The drive for more and better jobs is something in which we should all be directly engaged."
"Mr President, social and employment policies are affected by economic policies."
"For this reason, a debate distanced from the economic guidelines is meaningless, as is unfortunately the case with the debate now taking place, despite all the rapporteur's efforts to the contrary."
"The Commission's spring forecast predicts that GDP growth in 2003 will not rise above 1% in the Euro area. This will have negative effects on employment, which will fall by 0.1%, causing a rise in unemployment, which will reach an average of 8.8%."
"This situation should alert us to the need to change the Community's monetarist policies, and in particular to review the Stability Pact, in order to give the highest priority to public investment and other means of promoting employment and social inclusion."
"The only problem is that, instead of this, the same old solutions are being put forward yet again. This makes it difficult to draw up credible employment strategies and targets for social inclusion."
"Consequently, although I still entertain the gravest doubts over the feasibility of the targets and goals proposed in this report, given the well-known positions of the Council, the Commission and the governments of most of the Member States on the possibility of changing the economic guidelines or of any revision of the Stability Pact to prioritise growth in high-quality employment giving the right to social inclusion, I would underline the positive (though inadequate) proposals which aim to improve employment strategy."
"I would also emphasise the point that all Member States must define quantifiable national targets to be included in the first national employment plan that they draw up in accordance with the new guidelines; the need for these targets to be debated in national parliaments; and the need for them to contribute to achieving better results, in terms not only of creating employment, but also of reducing unemployment, of equal opportunities and social inclusion."
"The present situation, however, demanded much more."
"We must check the rapid growth of unemployment stemming from fundamental public sector liberalisation and privatisation, from the restructuring and relocating of multinationals, from the increasing difficulties facing micro-, small and medium-sized businesses and the lack of support they receive, from insistence on the supremacy of monetarist policies as well as restrictive ones which limit public investment and hinder the growth of workers', retired people's and pensioners' buying power, and finally from an insistence on raising the retirement age, which punishes workers and does not create more jobs for young people."
"The only problem is that neither the majority in this Parliament nor the Council accept such proposals."
"On the contrary, they insist for the most part on policies which worsen the current situation, as we saw in the last part-session during the debate on economic policy guidelines, and as is happening again here, whenever anyone tries to go a little further, as Herman Schmid, the rapporteur, has done."
"Of course, advocating improved working conditions is a positive step, but proposing an overall reduction in the incidence rate of accidents at work of only 15% (25% in high risk sectors) throughout the Member States by 2010 does not mean a great deal, especially for a country like Portugal, which has the highest rate of accidents at work in the European Union, with an average of one death every working day."
"Attaining these aims, however, requires not only political commitment but also substantial changes to economic and monetary policy, which we have unfortunately not achieved up to now."
"Mr President, I wish to add my group's congratulations to the rapporteur on the great amount of work that he has done on this report in an extremely short space of time."
"However, we regret the lack of proper coordination within this Parliament with the broad economic policy guidelines and hope that we can rectify that in the future."
"We welcome the general thrust of the report and the Commission's proposals about the coordination with other strategies of the European Union, for example social inclusion."
"However, there is still a great underestimation of the importance of the sustainability strategy within this overall package as well."
"We also welcome, however, the increased emphasis on the role of women in the report, and indeed the Commission's response to that, but we regret its removal as an overarching goal."
"We also welcome the increasing emphasis on the work-life balance."
"However, men will not achieve that until women have truly equal treatment in the workplace, and that includes equal pay."
"We have a degree of sympathy with some of the remarks made about the cost of employment in terms of the costs to employers."
"However, the level of wages is also important and we are well aware that in certain Member States and some of the accession countries even the national minimum wage is effectively a poverty wage."
"Employers need to be looking at that dimension and not just the costs of employment."
"To return to the issue of coordination with other polices, another one which should be included is our trade policies."
"We are working for a trading system which effectively drives production costs down and which encourages companies to relocate in search of competitive advantage."
"Therefore, we also need to examine the goals of our trade policy and the way they work with our employment policy because we are not convinced they are travelling in the same direction at all."
"Mr President, the proposed guidelines for employment policies presented by the Commission for Parliament's consideration are rich in pious generalisations: improving overall employment rates, improving employment rates among women and the elderly, improving quality and productivity of work, strengthening social cohesion and integration into the job market - all of these are generalisations which we have already heard a hundred times, which teach us nothing and which will surely teach the governments of the Member States nothing either."
"Nevertheless, the coordinated employment strategy might have been useful, if it had gone into more detail, spoken of more precise problems and compared countries - if it had been pointed out, for example, that the unemployment rate in the countries of the euro area is approaching 9%, while in 'non-euro' countries it is in the region of 5%."
"Are there really no conclusions to be drawn from this fact?"
"Even within the euro area, the disparities are very great."
"Leaving Luxembourg, an exceptional case, to one side, we see Austria on 4.2% and Ireland on 4.5%, at one end of the scale, with France on 9.3% and Spain on 11.9% at the other end."
"Faced with such differences, can we really extrapolate universally applicable guidelines without regressing into abstraction and even artificiality?"
"For my part, I would rather see more respect for the spirit of open coordination - of diversity, of the exchange of good practice - and talk in concrete terms of successful experiments, which should be passed on."
"Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur for the tremendous work he has done under very difficult circumstances to bring this report to us today."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner for what he said and for the effort which the Commission has made to accept amendments from Parliament."
"I know the Council is doing the same and is standing by waiting for us to adopt our opinion today, so that it can go ahead and adopt the employment guideline package."
"That presupposes, however, that we will adopt this report today."
"In that respect, I would like to make an appeal to the PPE-DE Group, because that group has a tendency to seek revenge for the rejection of the Thomas Mann report on the spring summit some two months ago."
"That group has made it known that certain amendments are regarded as key amendments and if they are rejected in the House today then that group will vote to reject the whole employment guideline package."
"That would be a tremendously damaging blow."
"We have already dislocated the streamlined coordinated process, involving the employment and economic policy guidelines."
"I hope we can get the whole exercise back on track and I hope that group will pull back from this brinkmanship."
"The amendments its members regard as key amendments are causing us some difficulties."
"For example, Amendment No 64 concerns the stability pact."
"They are placing considerable emphasis on that point."
"That is strange because not even Mr García-Margallo y Marfil from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs places such emphasis on this point in his report on the broad economic policy guidelines."
"Amendment No 66 calls for a reduction in the overall tax burden on individuals and companies."
"A number of Members have made reference to this amendment already."
"This is a fundamental ideological point and is causing some difficulty for a number of my members."
"The emphasis that the PPE-DE Group members are placing upon this suggests that they have a determination not to seek consensus and to look rather to create problems for the adoption of this package."
"This amendment on the overall reduction in the tax burden is incompatible with the one they have tabled on the stability pact and it also concerns an area of responsibility that is reserved for the Member States themselves."
"I cannot believe that if that amendment were rejected the PPE-DE Group would reject the whole package but I am assured by Mr Mann that would be the case."
"I hope the group will pull back."
"Reluctantly I am urging my members to abstain on Amendment No 66 in the hope that it will get through - although I disagree with it."
"If I fail and they lose that amendment, I again would appeal to the PPE-DE Group to pull back and not reject this package."
"It is simply not worth it."
"My final point, which is very important, is on Amendment No 23 on the social economy."
"Last month I mentioned in the debate on the Cooperative Statute that the social economy had disappeared from the employment guideline package."
"I hope we can bring it back in as a result of this amendment."
"Mr President, quite a few speakers have already today pointed out that, in many countries, unemployment has taken a turn for the worse and is rising."
"That is due to the generally poor economic situation, but also to the fact that insufficient efforts are being made to promote adaptability in the labour market. Moreover, the demands for adaptability will not lessen over the next few years."
"Training has an important role to play in this process, and I should like today to call for employment policy also to be seen in the context of the initiatives launched jointly by the EU's education ministers with a view to improving the quality of training schemes through their open coordination."
"This will be of great importance to our longer-term competitiveness. A report, summarising the situation, will of course be produced by the autumn and debated at the Spring Summit in 2004."
"We are all agreed that the objective is full employment and that this objective cannot be achieved without a basically sound economy, healthy public finances, a promising investment climate and keen competitiveness - all key elements when the idea is to create jobs."
"There is nothing contradictory about this, as parts of this Parliament perhaps appear to believe."
"I think that the Council has done a good piece of work in simplifying the employment guidelines."
"There was a need for this."
"Many of the guidelines were cobbled together without a thought for what they really needed to contain, which simply means that, in the case of many of the guidelines, the whole process has become less comprehensible and more perfunctory."
"I should therefore like to have seen Parliament be more sparing with the welter of amendments, even though our rapporteur has made great efforts to boil matters down to something comprehensible."
"The more guidelines that are crammed into employment policy, the greater the risk of their being viewed as immaterial."
"We need to focus on the objective: more employment and more jobs in Europe."
"Mr President, I should like to make a few short remarks in connection to what Mrs Lambert said."
"The fact that Commissioner Vitorino is here rather than Commissioner Diamantopoulou is due to the fact that Commissioner Diamantopoulou is attending a meeting of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council."
"That is a good thing, too, as we are voting today, and it is very good to hear that the things which we have already decided in the Committee, and which we hope to have adopted today and here I back the appeal by Mr Hughes to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are being discussed there so that we can reach further decisions."
"I should like to call for a number of things."
"First of all, I think that the general mainstreaming we are calling for is very important, and that this could in fact be extended still further, because I think that the whole equality arm, as it appeared previously in the European Employment Strategy, should still be formulated as a kind of objective."
"I would also call for the development of two action plans."
"The first is an action plan against unemployment."
"Everyone knows what the problem is: unemployment is on the increase, and the recession is growing rapidly and is also set to last a long time - and something must be done about this."
"There is no balance between the long-term strategy of increasing employment participation, for example, and the short-term strategy in a number of other spheres."
"The second action plan is an action plan for improving quality at work and increasing productivity."
"Modernisation of work organisation, in particular, is urgently required."
"By way of conclusion, I think that it is important that we take the local and regional approaches and the involvement of national parliaments very seriously."
"Mr President, I confess that I have little faith in the usefulness of this kind of document and I feel that the situation which is developing with regard to the Lisbon objectives is cause for thought."
"It is easy to agree on the principle of significantly reducing unemployment by 2010: I would challenge anyone to find a single European citizen - whether right-wing, left-wing or centre - who would vote against that principle."
"It is easy to agree on the principle that policies should contribute to reducing poverty by 50% by 2010 - we could have said 'eliminate' poverty while we were about it."
"I feel it is too easy to reach agreement on objectives of this kind."
"The problem arises - and it is a problem which we are failing to address - when it comes to defining options, taking decisions or calling for specific decisions to be taken."
"It has already been observed that employment increases with the growth of the economy - as is shown by a number of recommendations which I fully endorse on the quality of employment, equal rights for men and women, jobs and so forth."
"Since the labour market and policies relating thereto can encourage economic and employment growth in Europe, we need to introduce flexibility and liberalisation into the employment and employment agencies sector wholesale."
"With regard to the tax burden, we need to take into consideration the burden of contributions for pensions systems."
"Young workers - Germans, Italians and Europeans in general - are paying through unemployment for excessively large pensions to be provided for workers retiring too early."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the employment policies of the Member States should focus on clear priorities, taking into account the current economic climate, the requirements of an enlarged European Union and better implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"Lifelong learning, employment for the elderly and combating undeclared work are all priorities which must be emphasised, as the rapporteur, of course, rightly states."
"Although it outlines the importance of common priorities, this report approaches certain areas less successfully. These areas are:"
"Firstly, the Stability Pact: applying the employment strategy is the responsibility of the Member States, who should ensure that sufficient financial resources are made available, bearing in mind the need for sound public finances in accordance with the broad economic policy guidelines and the Stability Pact."
"The Stability Pact is an essential instrument for guaranteeing good public finance management on the part of the Member States and for ensuring sustainable growth and the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union."
"Reference to the Pact and compliance with its provisions is thus crucial to European employment strategy."
"Secondly, immigration as a response to the overall job creation strategy should be strictly regulated."
"Recruitment of immigrant workers should be done selectively."
"Checks must be carried out to see if the conditions for entry, residence and employment prescribed by the relevant legislation have been fulfilled, in order to avoid uncontrolled immigration."
"Illegal immigration into the Member States is the object of extremely uneven national legislation and has been on the increase in recent years, bolstered by the traffic in human beings and the activities of facilitators."
"It should be left to the discretion of each Member State to define the type of qualifications needed, as well as the number of workers it intends to recruit, based on the needs of its labour market, its population trends and its ability to integrate immigrants."
"Furthermore, the battle against undeclared work should be joined with renewed vigour, reducing labour costs and making the creation of new jobs less burdensome."
"Thirdly, the definition of targets such as, for example, reducing unemployment or increasing the participation of women in the labour market, should be challenging but realistic, and the different starting points of the various Member States should be taken into account."
"These aims should be thought of as progressive steps to take rather than as levels to attain."
"Otherwise, we run the risk of their becoming unacceptable and badly implemented in national employment plans."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino, who expressed very well the need for a balance between security and flexibility as essential factors for competitiveness and productivity in Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank the Commission for its proposal for guidelines and the Commissioner for his words. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, for I feel that he has endeavoured in a short space of time to take into account all the different viewpoints in the House, without compromising on quality objectives."
"I would like to focus on a number of considerations."
"If we take into account the economic climate and the experience we have gained in recent years on the European employment strategy, it would appear that the Commission has already endeavoured in its proposals to define specific objectives which I consider to be particularly important because they are in line with the recommendations made by the Commission on the basis of the evaluation of national employment plans."
"I therefore believe that this strategy is becoming increasingly specific."
"If the Community institutions are to foster this tendency towards specific measures, we need firmer support from many Member States."
"In this regard, I would like to focus on a number of points."
"The Commission, the rapporteur and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have defined precisely a number of aspects of the Commission's communication, such as the need to invest in quality and services to make female employment a reality. In all the countries, some of them in particular, this aspect of the employment situation is distressing, in that there is both a high inactivity rate and a high unemployment rate."
"Matters can be improved by providing training for women and the services necessary to make the market favourable to female employment."
"The amendments adopted in committee are along these lines."
"Then we need a more effective partnership at Member State level involving governments, national Parliaments and local authorities in their respective roles."
"I feel these are tangible goals."
"This is a point on which we all agree but which is incompatible with cutting taxes across the board, for we cannot have it both ways: either we have investment resources or we reduce taxation."
"Mr President, the Treaty states that there must be guidelines concerning the Member States' employment policy."
"Even though I am very dubious about the value of EU guidelines, there is no point in discussing the whys and wherefores of them right now."
"I shall therefore concentrate on the Commission's proposed guidelines and, above all, comment on Mr Herman Schmid's report, as it appears following the vote in committee."
"There is much that is good in the Commission's proposal, although even that is too detailed."
"The debate in committee has led to further detailed requirements and measures having been added."
"If guidelines are to be of any value, they must be firmly established in the relevant Member State."
"It does not make sense to cite, as now in this proposal, an ever-increasing quantity of measures and detailed objectives."
"At present, it is a question of 15 Member States; tomorrow, of 25."
"Offering at least 33% of children under three years of age childcare is, in my view, an issue that EU guidelines should have no bearing upon whatsoever."
"Apart from the general defect of being too detailed, the report before us has the fault of containing points that I very much doubt could do any thing at all to help increase employment."
"The rapporteur writes that responsibility for implementing a successful employment policy lies with the Member States."
"That is quite true for, as long as the governments of the Member States are not themselves prepared to take the necessary measures to reform the labour market, employment will not significantly increase."
"I am thinking mainly of reforms aimed at making it easier to employ staff, but also at reducing staff numbers."
"It is unfortunately the case that, for a small company to venture to employ one further person, its managers must know that, if it were to become necessary, they could reduce the number of staff."
"Germany is an example of what happens if a rigid labour market is not reformed."
"Unemployment has increased very considerably, partly because of rigid labour law."
"The fact is, too, that the longer the delay in reforming the labour markets, the more difficult the situation becomes."
"It perhaps seems odd that, as a Swedish Moderate in this Chamber, I am going to refer to something said recently by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, but what he said is worth quoting."
"He said that structural reforms are needed if the European economy is to be given new impetus, that more trade liberalisation is required and, above all, a liberalisation of labour markets by means of fewer regulations and healthier levels of labour protection."
"There are at present 13 million people within the EU who do not have any work to go to."
"Chancellor Gordon Brown thought that flexibility was not a threat to full employment but the prerequisite for increased employment."
"The guidelines should therefore be more overarching and concentrate on measures that, together with the economic policy guidelines, genuinely lead to economic growth and consequently to more people employed and thus to the provision of resources for things like education and health care."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur at the outset on his tremendous work on this report."
"Given the short deadline, he has made a very reasonable and consensus-based approach towards getting an opinion from this Parliament that can be presented to the Council meeting."
"Of course, we have a right to be consulted under the Treaty obligations and we should always utilise such opportunities to put forward the ideas that we as representatives of the citizens of the European Union wish to see promoted."
"I have difficulty with some aspects of the report, in particular regarding the introduction of issues related to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I do not believe that we need to expand further on what the Commission has already said on this matter."
"Ultimately our role and our aim should be to try and create more and better jobs for people and to ensure that the guidelines as laid down are more focused; that they are flexible in the sense that they can respond to new opportunities which arise; and that they are based on competitiveness to ensure that companies are encouraged to take on more people and not to move their production abroad or outside of the European Union."
"One of the key areas with regard to creating more jobs, if you look at the empirical evidence, has been sound public finances with a proper tax regime, to ensure that people are rewarded more for their work and entitled to keep more of their money in their pockets, rather than being penalised for working."
"This does not just apply to workers, it also applies to companies that employ those workers."
"We have to ensure that the social partnership model, which has been so successful in creating industrial harmony, is maintained and strengthened."
"We must also in this year, the European Year of Disabilities, take account of people with disabilities, some 70% of whom are unemployed."
"New innovative measures and research must be promoted to integrate people with disabilities into the labour market."
"I commend this report to the House and also thank it for supporting my amendments to it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur for his proposals, which are supported by our group as well."
"In our view, there is a need to put forward ambitious objectives and pragmatic specific measures, with new and innovative approaches and more local and regional initiatives - all of which you have included in your report."
"For a long time, we have been passing resolutions demanding that the national parliaments be more involved - not only Denmark's and Scotland's, but those right across the European Union."
"However, the fact that the European Employment Policy allows national objectives and decision-making leeway is another indicator of how astute it is."
"What I would like to tell the honourable lady Member from Sweden is that the German labour market might well be in need of reform, but there is not one Member State of the European Union in which the removal of protection against dismissal has helped to create jobs."
"I want to say, though, that there are two points on which we are critical of the Christian Democrats."
"One, which has already been referred to, is Amendment No 62."
"The Commission has proposed the use of immigration policy to govern the way in which the potential labour becoming available through immigration is used."
"I think there is a need for the Christian Democrats to face up to this fact and for this not to be taken, as it were, ad absurdum by means of special bilateral arrangements between the Member States, with conservatives remaining silent in the face of this practice."
"We cannot support tax cuts across the board, and I find it regrettable that this amendment is being treated as the most important."
"Europe's entrepreneurs expect something different: their expectations are for the security that makes it possible to plan for the long term, for qualified workers, the best possible infrastructure, promotion of science and research, the weeding-out of rules and regulations, and investment."
"There is a need for such measures, and they cannot be brought about by tax cuts across the board."
"Mr President, the adoption of the guidelines on employment is of particular importance to Parliament, especially today with the Commission presenting a revised proposal with a limited number of objectives, which constitute the pillars of the European social model in the new economy."
"In this light, the adoption of the rapporteur's report by a broad majority in Plenary is not just the only way forward, but is also an obligation towards the European citizens whose interests we represent."
"The initiative taken by the Commission appears to confirm the priority of quality competition, which is bound up with the quality of employment and the quality of public services."
"The policy of promoting not just cheap labour but cheaper and cheaper labour, which the amendments by the PPE-DE will bring about, is a non starter because, while it brings about a gradual reduction in the standard of living, it also facilitates the survival of companies with low productivity and little growth capacity, as the rapporteur also rightly underlines."
"So instead of insisting on the link with the stability pact, which restricts initiatives for interventions in the labour market and measures to modernise public services, without which they will be handed over to the private sector on a plate, we should be calling consistently for other guidelines."
"Thus, we should be calling for maximum coordination with the European Charter for Small Enterprises, which places emphasis on promoting enterprises based on knowledge and innovation, and urging a rapprochement between industrial policy and the demands of the European social model."
"Industrial policy to date, instead of following this direction, marginalises employment-related matters."
"It would be a pity if the PPE-DE stood by its initial choices which, instead of resulting in the exploitation of the competitiveness of quality, which is the advantage of the European economy, insist on more and more exploitation of cheap labour."
"Finally, I should like to congratulate the Commission, which is placing particular emphasis on very close, more active participation by the national parliaments and on the mobilisation of local societies, with corresponding, specific commitments to increase employment, an idea which I too have supported in the past."
"In this way, we shall achieve not only a broadening of responsibilities on employment issues, but also the development of healthy competition between the individual regions of a country."
"Mr President, I am going to use the time allocated to Mr Andria and Mr Mantovani too, who have asked me to express their regret because they have been detained in Italy by strikes and other such serious matters."
"I shall briefly summarise their views too, insofar as I am able."
"The task of the European ruling class, and the European Parliament in particular, is to rewrite the model of the social market economy, to modernise it, to revise it without reducing the social undertaking."
"Job security must no longer be sought on the basis of acquired rights but through skills, hard work and lifelong learning."
"Wage differentiation, which has consistently been advocated in theory but has often been disregarded in practice, must become a genuine goal for Parliament, which must specify clearly and resolutely the process to be followed to achieve it."
"This commitment to reform must be upheld first and foremost by the active parties, in other words by all the social elements who will have to make responsible commitments to promoting training, innovation and flexibility, without, however, subsequently going back on them when the time comes to implement them."
"The dialogue on the bargaining structure will have to reinforce both the company level and wage differentiation; where the company level is reinforced, productivity is enhanced and individual contributions are appraised."
"Clearly, in order to achieve these goals, it is necessary to match bargaining at national level with bargaining at company level."
"In order to provide secure jobs, we need, however, above all, as has already been said, to boost investment, the real spearhead, especially in future initiatives targeting the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Joint ventures are another way of boosting SMEs, which, we must not forget, provide over 90% of jobs in Europe."
"When applying flexibility, care must be taken to ensure that it does not become an easy option for certain companies which would like to exploit this solution by creating atypical jobs such as collaboration contracts, which do not represent a secure future, especially for young people."
"If we abuse this instrument, we will be in danger of creating future generations of precarious, insecure workers, but also, above all, of creating low-income future pensioners, in other words poor future pensioners."
"We must therefore avoid giving way to populism in these major reforms and endeavour to take resolute, practical, achievable steps forward."
"Mr President, I too wish to thank Mr Herman Schmid for his constructive work on this report."
"For the benefit of Commissioner Vitorino, I wish to mention a couple of amendments that we Christian Democrats, including myself, have been involved in wording."
"It is a question of the demographic challenge which, in Stockholm in March 2001, was identified as one of the Union's most important issues for the future."
"It is estimated that, by 2050, the European Union will have 40 million more pensioners than at present and, thus, 40 million fewer people of working age."
"This is stated in Amendment No 1, as an important part of Mr Herman Schmid's report."
"I want to ask Mr Vitorino how he regards the crisis in the pensions system in relation to economic development and the survival of whole districts within the European Union against the background of the serious demographic trend."
"It is encouraging that a number of amendments, including Amendments Nos 28 and 38 concerned with the reconciliation of family and professional life, are now part of Mr Herman Schmid's report."
"This is an incredibly important issue, but it is not good that Amendment No 43 states that work and family life will be reconciled notably through commitments to develop childcare services."
"It should be more a question of children having the right to more time with their parents than of our necessarily having to develop a form of childcare that gives children less time with their parents."
"Amendment No 9 is also important."
"It is about the need to strengthen the taxpaying ethic, about competition on equal terms between companies and about stepping up the fight against undeclared working."
"Allow me in conclusion to put in a good word for Amendment No 60, which emphasises the value of families, family enterprises and the transition from one generation to the next."
"If we are to do anything towards creating long-term jobs, the issue of how such transitions are carried out needs to be resolved."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A5-0172/2003) by Mr Hernández Mollar on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the EU-USA agreements on judicial cooperation in criminal matters and extradition ((INI)2003/2003)."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Parliament, in particular Mr Hernández Mollar, the chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for this report on such an important and sensitive issue."
"I welcome the fact that the draft agreements have been declassified and that the opportunity has been given to the European Parliament to examine them in parallel with the examination by national parliaments in the Member States."
"One must recognise that these agreements under Articles 24 and 38 are negotiated by the Council."
"The Commission is not the negotiator of these agreements in the external arena."
"Therefore, in this debate the Commission participates as it is associated to the negotiating process, but the Council of Ministers has the final word."
"We would like to recognise the efforts made by the Belgian, Spanish, Danish and now the Greek presidencies to launch these agreements following the decision taken by the European Council after the events of 11 September 2001."
"On the basis of this authorisation, and the directives for negotiations that were adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, the Commission welcomes the fact that this consultation procedure should be concluded in time to allow for signature by the European Union and the United States of America during the summit at the end of this month."
"Pursuant to the authorisation given by the Council to the presidency to negotiate the agreements with the United States in April last year, the Commission assisted in the negotiations from the beginning, so it is particularly well-placed to appreciate the real difficulties experienced therein."
"We understood that the Commission's role was to help to reach a positive result."
"Like Parliament, in its draft recommendation, the Commission is of the opinion that stronger solutions would have been preferable on a number of points covered by these agreements."
"I had the opportunity to have a constructive discussion on a number of the concerns raised by Parliament in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, together with the Greek Minister of Justice."
"The Greek minister also discussed a number of these concerns in the debate that took place in plenary last month on the EU-US agreements."
"Let me stress that the United States side did not get satisfaction on a number of points of major importance to them and which were strongly opposed by the Union, such as the extradition of European Union nationals and the limitations of the political offence exception to extradition."
"We now need to make an overall assessment of the result of the negotiations."
"One of the criteria for this assessment is the added value of a Union agreement compared with the situation that currently exists on the basis of bilateral agreements between Member States and the United States of America."
"This assessment has to be made taking due account of the fact that this is, as the President mentioned, the very first Union agreement in the field of Justice and Home Affairs, and it will be a historical precedent."
"In addition to the incontestable advantages that the agreements on extradition and mutual legal assistance with the United States will bring in terms of concrete judicial cooperation in criminal matters and the fight against organised crime and terrorism, I would focus on the following, trying to address some of the major concerns raised by this Parliament."
"Regarding protection against the death penalty, the draft extradition agreement compares with the strongest anti-death penalty clauses that can be found in existing bilateral treaties, whether an agreement with a Member State or one with a candidate country."
"This means that as far as all the other bilateral agreements are concerned, this anti-death penalty provision is stronger in the current European Union agreement than in the vast majority of others."
"In addition it allows the invoking of all grounds for refusal available pursuant to a bilateral extradition treaty between a Member State and the United States, and will open the possibility of consultation in the event that constitutional principles or final judicial decisions binding upon a requested state may impede the fulfilment of an extradition."
"This provision, combined with specific references in the recitals to individual rights, fair trial and an impartial tribunal, offers significant guarantees."
"I would insist that Member States be bound by the European Convention on Human Rights and its protocols."
"Nothing in these draft agreements should lead to decreased compliance with these international obligations."
"It is also my deep conviction that the European Convention will conclude positively on the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future constitution, thus giving it a legally binding and constitutional status."
"As regards Article 10 of the draft extradition agreement, and in particular the situation of an extradition request that conflicts with a European arrest warrant, a Member State confronted with such a situation of conflicting requests shall take into account a number of criteria in order to take a decision that widely corresponds to the lists of such competing requests already provided by the framework decision creating the European arrest warrant."
"The designation of the competent authority is left to the requested Member State."
"This can be a judicial authority unless the existing bilateral treaty between the Member State in question and the United States foresees an executive authority."
"In addition, the final wording of the agreement drafted very recently at the last negotiation session has improved in the sense that it better underlines the fact that the framework decision on the European arrest warrant could be amended in the global context of further European Union integration."
"This might in turn lead to the adaptation of the agreement with the United States in line with the natural evolution of the legislation on the European arrest warrant."
"Finally, regarding data protection provisions, the relevant provision in the draft mutual legal assistance agreement with the United States is modelled on the two most recent European texts: the European Union's Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters of 2000 and the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the agreements under discussion today are important and positive, as already pointed out by both the Commissioner and Mr Hernández Mollar, who has produced an excellent report on this matter on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"As has already been mentioned, this is the first time that extradition and legal cooperation agreements have been concluded between the European Union and a third country."
"Closer cooperation between the United States and the European Union is also to be welcomed, since this will make the fight against international crime more effective, as well as providing appropriate protection for our democratic societies, our common values and our citizens."
"I add my voice to those critical of the secrecy surrounding the negotiations, and of the Council's attempt to classify the text of the agreements as confidential, thus excluding Parliament."
"This attitude is incomprehensible, since we are dealing with something which is going to have a direct impact on the fundamental rights of our citizens."
"Fortunately, the Council reconsidered this absurd and unacceptable classification."
"Overall, we support the two agreements before us, but there are certain aspects which it is essential to safeguard."
"Firstly, the treatment received by the United States in relation to the European arrest warrant must never be the same as the treatment given to Member States of the European Union, since the US is subject neither to Community law, nor to the Convention on Human Rights, nor even to European data protection legislation."
"Secondly, any request for execution of a European arrest warrant or for attendance at the International Criminal Court should take precedence over requests for extradition to the United States."
"Thirdly, there should be a guarantee that extradition to the United States cannot take place if the defendant could be sentenced to death, or tried in exceptional or military tribunals."
"Fourthly, there should be an explicit reference to Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union, as well as to the European Charter on Fundamental Rights."
"Fifthly, a demand for effective and proportionate data protection provisions, to guarantee, at the very least, the same level of protection as that provided by the Council of Europe Convention."
"I hope the necessary guarantees will be made in these areas when the agreements are signed at the European Union-United States Summit on 25 June."
"Mr President, it obviously makes sense to smooth out the difficulties involved in making two sets of legal systems work together to catch criminals and terrorists."
"Often in the field of law enforcement and intelligence different agencies are jealous of their patches and prerogatives, reluctant to share information because knowledge is power, and bureaucratic requirements must be examined critically."
"However, it is another matter altogether to justify brushing aside legal safeguards, defendants' rights and privacy concerns in the name of the war against terrorism."
"We have objections to these agreements on grounds of both procedure and content."
"As others have said, the degree of unwarranted secrecy imposed by the Council has been utterly scandalous."
"I am sorry to see that the Council is not here today."
"No adequate explanation has been given."
"The only possible explanation is the wish to avoid accountability to Parliament."
"The failure to consult the European Parliament formerly is a disgrace, and the justification for this democratic deficit - that the agreements fall under foreign rather than justice policy - is thin in the extreme."
"I very much hope the new EU Constitution will stop this ever happening again because we will have future agreements of this kind."
"I wish the European public could understand - and one day they will - that the real threat to their rights comes not from this Parliament or the Commission - the Community institutions - but from the arrogant, executive powers wielded in intergovernmental cabal by the Council."
"I just hope Commissioner Vitorino is right that the preamble and the text will ensure that no extradited European citizen or resident will face the death penalty, and that no European will end up in Guantánamo Bay without charge or without trial or will face a military tribunal which has the power to impose a death penalty without appeal."
"I also hope time will prove that the Member States' obligations to the International Court are not compromised, because otherwise there really will be outrage in the European public."
"We must solve the disgrace of Europeans in Guantánamo Bay before ratifying this agreement."
"I do not have the confidence in the Council that I have in Commissioner Vitorino."
"I am sorry the Council is not here today to hear our objections."
"Mr President, my group has grave concerns about the agreement that the Council wishes to conclude with the United States."
"Problems arising as a result of greater police and judicial cooperation are being glossed over for political reasons."
"Greater cooperation does of course enable us to catch wrongdoers more effectively, and that is a good thing."
"However, this cooperation has to be subject to strict conditions regarding the rights of suspects, because, otherwise, people's trust in the authorities is undermined."
"We must make sure that we do not shoot great holes in our rule of law in order to please the Wild West."
"My concerns regarding the legal system of the United States extend beyond excrescences such as the death penalty and Guantánamo Bay."
"My concerns go to the heart of the US system."
"Upwards of 92% of all convictions are based on plea bargains."
"This means that, in more than 92% of cases, evidence is not examined, but, rather, punishments are negotiated with suspects driven by the fear of absurdly severe sentences."
"That is not a fair process, and indeed I welcome the reference in the resolution to the European Convention on Human Rights, because that prescribes a fair process."
"Another positive aspect of the report by Mr Hernández Mollar is that it emphasises that there are alternatives to the extradition of European nationals to the United States, particularly with regard to crimes committed on European soil."
"The United States just passes the evidence against a suspect on to the competent EU Member State, then we can try our citizens according to our own traditions, with our own guarantees, and people can serve their time close to home."
"That is what I would call a testament to constructive cooperation between equal partners."
"Mr President, Mr Hernández Mollar's report is full of good intentions and we will no doubt approve it. It also, however, suffers from a most curious naivety."
"How can we conclude legal agreements - or even discuss the law - with a state, the United States, which has no concept of or respect for the law, for the very notion of the law?"
"How can we contemplate extraditing our nationals to a country, a state, which does not obey the same legal conventions as us, or does so less and less?"
"That is the question asked by this report."
"For, in the final analysis, we are negotiating with a state which enforces the death penalty, and to which we are thinking of extraditing our nationals; a state which does not respect fundamental human rights, particularly in relation to anti-terrorist legislation; a state which submits ever more cases to its military tribunals, so that we may perhaps see our own nationals judged by a US military tribunal; a state whose personal data transfer legislation is in flagrant contravention of our laws."
"Ultimately, we might ask ourselves, in view of all this, why we pass laws on these matters, and on many more besides, if we are then to put ourselves into the hands of a state which deliberately breaks those laws."
"Lastly and most importantly, this state behaves like an ancient tribe, kidnapping our nationals, imprisoning them without even taking the trouble to charge them (I am thinking, of course, of Guantánamo Bay, but I believe there are other examples) and even, in all probability, indulging in a few acts of torture, sadly far from the prying eyes of any journalists."
"In fact, the state in question does not respect the law, and, in my opinion, we do not have to honour any legal ties, or at any rate judicial or penal ones, with it."
"I doubt, however, that the European Union will be capable of taking a firm stand, since it has sprung this trap with its own hands and behaves towards the US with a type of passivity which will sooner or later end up by leading us into ruinous situations."
"I might add that we are seeing the first signs of some examples of this."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate our chairman, Mr Hernández Mollar, on the contortions he has had to perform in order to bring this text to plenary."
"It has not been an easy task."
"If we are to understand the importance and, above all, the scope of the agreement, we must remember what prompted this initiative."
"It was not the emotion immediately after September 11 so much as the urgent need, following those tragic events, to create a network to monitor and combat the terrorist organisations operating throughout the world."
"To quote the resolution adopted by Parliament in December 2001, any agreement on judicial and police cooperation signed by the European Union must respect the Convention on Human Rights."
"The primary concern - as has already been said - is not to permit the extradition of prisoners who would be liable to face the death penalty in the United States."
"Now, without prejudice to this principle, I cannot see what other concerns there might be."
"We feel it would be excessive in any case to presume to make the implementation of this agreement conditional upon an undertaking to do something about the situation at the Guantánamo base."
"We can demand clarity and transparency from the United States with regard to what is happening at that base, but we must not hinder the progress of an agreement whose effect is much wider than that, which is, in other words, in the interests of world security, not just US security."
"That is why we voted against the amendment on Guantánamo in committee, seeing it as a separate issue which can, if necessary, be addressed on its own."
"As for accusing the United States of being a country which fails to respect human rights, all I can say is I would not want to be the council for the prosecution. We must remember that the United States was the first genuine democracy to be created in the world in the history of civilisation."
"My opinion is that some views are to be considered to be decidedly partisan."
"The agreement is a major step forward in combating not just terrorism but financial crime, the drug trafficking multinationals, money laundering, cyber crime and the trafficking of human beings too."
"These may appear to be unrelated issues, but they are, in actual fact, linked by the urgent need for resolute, timely, unconditional action."
"Mr President, Mr Vitorino said at the beginning of this debate that it is important and sensitive legislation."
"Nobody would dispute that."
"Equally nobody would deny that in today's climate there is a need for strong international cooperation, sharing ideas, thoughts, data and intelligence."
"But I hope that Council will look at the report of this debate and will not use this legislation to ride roughshod over accepted values and practices in the European Union."
"Mr Hernández Mollar, the rapporteur, said that we cannot accept standards lower than those we would demand ourselves in the European Union."
"Mr Coûteaux a few minutes ago echoed these ideas."
"I believe that we are not just talking about Europeans - we are looking at the fundamental rights of people in the United States too."
"A number of Members in this House have serious reservations about that, and that is why we are concerned about some elements in this piece of legislation."
"President Bush has promised that the United States will always stand firm for equal justice."
"If that is true, he and others must call an immediate halt to the practice of executions in the United States."
"Over the last 25 years over 840 people have been executed following many of the murders in the United States."
"Murders are carried out equally by white people and black people, and yet some 15 times as many black Americans have been executed as white people."
"Black people are often tried before all-white juries, so we should have great concern about any Europeans being extradited to the United States and we must question even more the whole American legal system that allows that."
"My second point regards Guantánamo Bay, Camp Delta, a kind of US-run gulag for foreign captives held indefinitely without being charged."
"Mr Santini says we should leave that to another time."
"Mr Santini, your PPE-DE Group voted against this in committee, and you represent the Christian Democrat party."
"I have looked at all the details of Guantánamo Bay and I cannot see that it satisfies any Christian or democratic principles."
"I am surprised that you voted against it in committee."
"I hope you will think again when you come to vote on it in this vote today."
"Mr President, there are three fundamental questions to be answered: does this agreement make the fight against crime any more effective, will it strengthen the European Judicial Area, and is there any added value with regard to guarantees for the accused?"
"These questions cannot yet be answered in the affirmative, in my opinion."
"That is partly due to the procedure followed."
"Commissioner Vitorino said that this is the first Union agreement."
"It is a milestone, but milestones require a different procedure."
"Back-room discussions, confidential documents and a lack of appreciation of the European Parliament and the national parliaments - that is not the stuff milestones are made of."
"The fault for this lies entirely with Europe."
"The Justice and Home Affairs Council deserves to be graded an emphatic 'unsatisfactory'."
"It beggars belief that here in Europe we have to fight for fundamental democratic rights such as parliamentary scrutiny."
"The subject matter of the agreement also raises a lot of questions."
"In itself there is nothing unusual about this, but, that being the case, one has to be able to discuss them."
"For example, who ultimately takes the decision on extradition: the judges or the Ministries of Foreign Affairs?"
"Who is extradited?"
"How do we deal with the system of plea bargains?"
"Mrs Buitenweg went into detail about that."
"For example, an in-depth analysis of the impact of the recent Homeland Security Act on data provided by the Union or its agencies is lacking."
"There is a risk of undermining the International Criminal Court."
"There is still no clarity as regards legal aid or the use of data for other purposes."
"Then there is the point about Guantánamo."
"Various speakers - Mr Hernández Mollar, Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, in particular - have spoken wise words on this subject."
"Something really has to be done about this."
"In short, this is an agreement that cannot just be rushed through."
"The Council started in plenty of time, but has systematically had its back turned to both the national parliaments and the European Parliament, in contrast to the United States, which at least still consults its Congress."
"Is this a milestone, then?"
"Not yet."
"The agreements between the United States and the EU are, of course, really about integrating the EU countries' and the United States's criminal law and rules of criminal procedure or, at any rate, essential aspects of these."
"The agreements should provoke protests from any serious politician specialising in the law."
"These agreements represent the current low point in the development of the EU's legal policy."
"In the Nordic countries, specialists in the field thought that the low point had been reached with the two framework decisions concerning the European arrest warrant and measures for combating terrorism, but matters are now still worse."
"Note that the only professional investigation implemented by the institutions of the EU concerning these crucial issues of legal policy are open to serious criticism on the grounds of principle due to the fact that, in the context of the rights that are a crucial part of our democratic basis of values, the EU's acts violate a range of basic principles in the fields of criminal law and procedure."
"We are concerned here with what is termed the EU network of independent experts in basic rights which, on 31 March of this year, issued a comprehensive report on, as they put it, the balance between freedom and security."
"Has anyone within the EU system attended to the criticism by the group of experts that the acts compromise legal certainty?"
"Definitely not."
"As I say, these agreements make matters still worse."
"The EU system and the Member States will now, in the first place, accept the extradition of citizens of the Member States for criminal prosecution and imprisonment in the United States, which is a banana republic in terms of legal policy."
"Quite a few speakers have referred to the scandal in Guantánamo Bay, where EU citizens are being detained and mistreated under circumstances that decisively violate international law and basic legal principles."
"It is incomprehensible that an agreement can be entered into with a juridico-political banana republic."
"The American investigation services will, moreover, subsequently be permitted to operate within the Member States."
"A year's secret negotiations were conducted in advance and, as the Council put it, protecting the Council's negotiations was a more important interest than democratic scrutiny."
"Can we sink any deeper?"
"I also refer to the minority opinion on the report, which I have been a party to issuing on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I regret that the Council is not present, because the Council is the one that does the negotiating, and it could at least listen to what Parliament has to say."
"Clearly there is reason to go on the offensive against internationally organised terrorism and internationally organised crime by means of cooperation."
"However, the question facing this Parliament at this moment is: have the conditions under which this cooperation is to take place been satisfactorily fulfilled?"
"I think that Parliament - through the voices of the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Hernández Mollar, and very large numbers of fellow Members - has indicated the minimum conditions which are required by Parliament and which really must be fulfilled."
"For example, there must be no cooperation with exceptional or military courts, and no extradition if this could lead to the death penalty."
"Parliaments must be consulted on the procedure for concluding the agreement and regarding the scrutiny of its implementation."
"I have heard quite a few questions, and I concur fully with these, for example regarding the unilateralism which is displayed by the United States in its foreign policy and which may result in extraditions, too, displaying a unilateral aspect, and in European countries having very little to expect in return."
"Mr President, the Hernández Mollar report provides an excellent commentary on the content of the extradition and readmission agreements between the US and the EU."
"The report rightly supports the two agreements, but the tone of the resolution with regard to the United States is too critical."
"It is true that the legal systems of the EU Member States and the US are different, but the US, too, is a democratic nation that safeguards human rights."
"The sense of moral superiority exuded by the resolution and this debate, too, is therefore inappropriate."
"Finally, I should like to say a few words about democratic scrutiny, another target of criticism in the resolution."
"The agreements have to be approved by all the national parliaments before they can be ratified."
"If, say, their content contravenes the existing bilateral treaties between individual Member States and the US or the human rights conventions, I am confident that the national parliaments will be capable of exercising their democratic rights."
"There certainly will be scrutiny, therefore."
"Mr President, the present text of the resolution leaves nothing to be desired as regards clarity."
"The European Parliament's message is: the draft agreements must not be concluded unless the Council removes some fundamental objections on the part of Parliament."
"I continue to hope that the Presidency will duly take these objections into account, as, after all, it is obliged to do on the basis of the European Convention."
"It is the first time that the EU as such is concluding an agreement with a third country regarding judicial cooperation in criminal matters, but it is setting a bad example."
"In future, the Council should involve the elected representative bodies of the Member States and the European Parliament in the negotiations at an earlier stage."
"The texts of the draft agreements have been kept secret for too long."
"That is inadmissible, especially as fundamental civil rights seem to be squandered under the pretext of the United States's fight against crime."
"Stating this fact has nothing to do with a sense of moral superiority or anti-American sentiment."
"The administration of justice in the United States does not provide sufficient guarantees for the rights of suspects."
"The negotiated procedures common in criminal proceedings mean that it is not precluded that suspects may be convicted although innocent, or convicted on insufficient evidence."
"This situation is exacerbated by the new legislation and practices in the United States since 11 September."
"If the European Union wishes to take its own legal protection seriously, it must only conclude the two agreements with the United States once the guarantees called for by the vast majority in Parliament have been incorporated into them."
"The Council has to redo its homework, and it is an illustration of the weakness of the democratic system in Europe that the Council has up to now been able to take the liberty of ignoring the views of the elected representative body - but of course we are not stupid."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although these agreements on judicial and police cooperation are extremely important, our values must still be respected."
"I would like to ask two questions."
"Given that the death penalty still exists in the USA, even if we conclude an agreement that would prevent it from being carried out, the problem remains: the death penalty is counter to our values."
"Given that, if crimes are committed, there is a hierarchy between US citizens, who cannot be tried before the International Criminal Court, and European citizens, who can be extradited to the USA in order to be tried before the US judiciary, such discrimination is also counter to our principles."
"The case of the Guantánamo Bay prisoners is the most flagrant illustration of the fact that the USA does not respect fundamental rights, insofar as it has brought these men before special courts and completely violated their right to defence."
"They are suffering degrading, inhumane treatment, counter to international law and to the universal declaration of human rights."
"In these conditions, do you truly think it possible for the Union to accept extradition to the USA of any individual, regardless of their nationality?"
"In conclusion, what guarantees do we have that the USA will in fact respect an agreement signed with the Union, when it does not respect its international obligations, ignores international law, and considers itself above the law and entitled to take unilateral decisions as shown in its attack on Iraq?"
"Mr President, the events of 11 September were tragic and deeply unforgivable."
"No one wishes to see them repeated, but it would be almost as tragic to see them exploited for the purposes of violating fundamental human rights and guarantees of legal certainty by which, as EU citizens, we are normally protected."
"As the minority opinion rightly points out, the agreements between the EU and the United States do not merely contain dubious measures for combating terrorism; the agreements are a slippery slope towards extradition and legal cooperation on criminal matters generally."
"According to the agreements, European citizens who are alleged to have committed a crime carrying a sentence of at least one year may be extradited to the United States - a country that, as many have pointed out, practises the death penalty."
"In no way can I support the thinking behind these international agreements, and I am therefore voting against the report, but I should like to call for support for the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"Mr President, I wish to say that it is indeed infuriating that the Council is absent from a debate such as this, especially when the European Parliament had already given the Council advance warning during the previous Plenary."
"It would be good if the Commission and the Council were to pay attention when the European Parliament gives advance warning, especially on such important issues."
"Perhaps the Council's only justification for not being here would be if its President-in-Office were locked away somewhere reading the Amnesty International report for 2003, which tells us that the big threat to rights today are the measures being taken by the United States at global level on the pretext of 11 September in the aim of undermining and withdrawing citizens' democratic and other rights."
"The case we are examining now in connection with the agreements on judicial cooperation and extradition is an export from the United States of restrictions on rights, notably on the question of the death penalty."
"The United States are exporting them to us and we, with no shame whatsoever and, unfortunately, with a Greek Presidency, are importing them under these agreements."
"I should like to ask Commissioner Vitorino to give us his opinion."
"Commissioner, as long as you are here and are not yet Secretary General of ????, why in your opinion in Article 13, which refers to the question of a request for a person who may face the death penalty to be extradited, does the agreement read: 'the request for extradition may be denied' by the European Union to the United States of America rather than ' will be denied'?"
"Why?"
"Please explain it to us in terms we can understand."
". Mr President, in this debate the Commission acted like an amicus curiae because it was not the negotiator, it assisted the successive Council presidencies in their negotiations."
"Therefore, I will just try to clarify some of the points raised and give the Commission's opinion on those points."
"I shall begin with Article 13."
"I shall try to make myself clear."
"The US-EU agreement is a bilateral agreement that regulates the relationship between the European Union and the United States of America."
"It does not regulate the relationship between the Member States of the European Union among themselves or the obligations that Member States have under other international legal instruments."
"All the Member States have subscribed to the European Convention on Human Rights and to the specific protocol that forbids the death penalty."
"This means that, acting in accordance with their international obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, Member States will refuse extradition where the death penalty is concerned."
"That does not derive from an obligation between the European Union and the United States of America."
"It derives directly from the obligation of the Member States to be in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, with the protocol and, I hope, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union that will have constitutional status and be legally binding after its inclusion in the new Constitutional Treaty."
"When it comes to the International Criminal Court, I would draw your attention to the fact that Article 10 of the agreement does not apply to the International Criminal Court because that court is not a state and Article 10 only regulates the criteria to be used when there is simultaneously, in regard to a same person, a conflicting request by a third state - like the United States of America - and by a European Union Member State."
"It does not deal with requests from the International Criminal Court."
"Therefore, nothing prevents the Member States from deciding what they want to do as far as a request from the International Criminal Court is concerned, irrespective of any bilateral agreement with the United States of America."
"When it comes to the European arrest warrant as such, I can even agree with Parliament."
"However, unfortunately, the Council did not adopt the Commission's proposal on the primacy of the European arrest warrant."
"Therein lies the problem."
"We are not talking today about a fully comprehensive primacy of the European arrest warrant over any other request for extradition."
"It does not exist."
"The framework decision on the European arrest warrant already recognises that when there is a demand under a European arrest warrant and a simultaneous demand for extradition by a third country, there are a number of criteria that will have to be taken into consideration in order to decide which demand has primacy."
"So we are not changing the legal system of the European Union."
"The Commission regrets that this primacy was not recognised in the past when the Council adopted the European arrest warrant."
"However, today this primacy does not exist and therefore cannot be affected by the terms of a bilateral agreement with the United States."
"What we were careful to say was that the possibility of recognising in the future the primacy of the European arrest warrant could not be undermined or limited by this kind of bilateral agreement."
"There is a specific provision on the revision of this kind of bilateral agreement with the United States in case we decide to recognise the primacy of the European arrest warrant in the future."
"I hope that sooner or later we will do that."
"Finally, on the matter of special courts. It must be said that the key issue for me - and I have always said this to Parliament - is not the nature of the court, it is not the question of special courts as such - even some Member States have special courts in the European Union."
"The question is one of due and fair process and guarantees, so that extradition is only granted where there are guarantees that the requesting Member State will follow a due and fair process."
"There are two recitals in the agreements that address this issue."
"The first one concerns due regard for the rights of individuals and the rule of law; the second one concerns the guarantees and the respective legal systems which provide for the right to a fair trial of an extradited person."
"Above all, there is Article 16a on non-derogation, which in paragraph 1 maintains all grounds for refusal relating to a matter not governed by this agreement available under a bilateral extradition treaty in force and which in paragraph 2 calls for consultation where the constitutional principles of the requested state may pose impediments to the fulfilment of its obligation to extradite."
"In my interpretation, everything that might be considered as a demand for extradition to a court where the rule of due process is not respected can give leverage to the application of this Article 16a on non-derogation."
"Finally, I sincerely hope that in the future Constitution we will have specific provisions not only on consultation of Parliament concerning these kinds of agreements, which will become more frequent in the future, but also concerning the competence of the European Court of Justice to guarantee the full compliance of these agreements with the future Constitution of the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A5-0137/2003) by Mrs Roure on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal from the Commission with regard to the adoption of a Council directive (COM(2002) 548 C5-0502/2002 2002/0242(CNS)) on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of study, vocational training or voluntary service."
"Before we embark on the debate, I would like to ask you all to keep strictly to your speaking time, or otherwise we will have difficulties when it comes to the votes."
". (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin, first of all, by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Roure, for the work she has done, and by thanking her for the admirable spirit of cooperation she has shown in preparing this important report."
"With this text, which complements the other three proposals, on family reunification, economic immigration, and the status of long-term residents, the Commission brings to a close the legislative work aimed at laying the foundations of a joint legal immigration policy, since we have decided not to table a proposal designed to cover all individuals not included under the previous proposals."
"I welcome the fact that Parliament has responded to the Commission by adopting this report so quickly."
"This proposal targets migration by third-country nationals for the purpose of studies."
"This is a special type of immigration to the extent that it is temporary and lasts no longer, in principle, than the educational course itself. It also brings reciprocal benefits for both the countries of origin and the host countries, not to mention, of course, the migrants themselves, who profit directly from it."
"This proposal integrates immigration policy but should also be viewed in the context of Community action in the field of education."
"Clearly, our aim is to promote migration for educational purposes, above all by accepting the greatest possible number of third-country students into higher education."
"The proposal for a directive was devised in this spirit."
"The entry conditions anticipated in it were rendered as objective as possible, in order to guarantee the quick and easy processing of applications. They are also phrased clearly and thoroughly so that the Member States can combat attempts to abuse them."
"This is also, I believe, an innovative proposal which fits into the context of the growing internationalisation of education, especially the recognition of students' right to move to another Member State to continue their studies, after previously being admitted into a first European Union Member State."
"The proposal also covers the vocational training sector, setting entry conditions for unremunerated trainees such as those who come to take up a placement with a company."
"It is thus designed to complement the proposal for a directive on the admission of workers that covers remunerated traineeships."
"Following meetings held with non-governmental organisations, provisions on secondary school pupils and volunteers arriving in the European Community were introduced into our proposal."
"The aim is to facilitate exchange programmes for secondary school pupils."
"Encouraging the discovery of culture by pupils who will later be tempted to return as higher education students will reap enormous benefits for the Community."
"In addition, a provision regulating the admission of volunteers was added to the proposal, protecting such individuals from a potential legal loophole."
"It must be obvious that the Commission did not lose sight of public security considerations."
"The proposal contains a public order and security clause providing Member States with enough room to manoeuvre for them to take precautions against the terrorist threat, in particular."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by way of introduction to my speech, I would like to thank most sincerely all the shadow rapporteurs from all the groups."
"Thanks to the work we have carried out together, we can send a strong signal in this highly sensitive field."
"I would also thank the Commission for its support, which was particularly welcome."
"It is vital that our countries offer an appropriate welcome to foreign students, just as it is vital to have a common policy on this welcome."
"In this way we can contribute in a positive manner to the training of future executives in third countries and increase cooperation with these countries in terms of education in order to meet the challenge of the internationalisation of teaching."
"This proposal for a directive would make it possible to achieve significant progress that we can all support."
"We would point out that a legal basis has at last been provided for volunteers. We would also point out that this instrument might enable us to catch up with the United States, where residential study programmes are broadly encouraged and facilitated."
"We are entering into a strategy that aims to increase cooperation with third countries in terms of teaching as set out, for example, in the Erasmus World programme."
"The votes in committee allowed a few clarifications to be made and I shall now cite some of these."
"We would call for the introduction into the directive of researchers, who are no longer students but do not carry out paid work."
"We would also emphasise that we wanted to contribute to the fight against brain drain from South to North."
"Receiving third-country nationals for study purposes must not lead to an increase in brain drain from these countries."
"We would similarly like to see an improvement in procedural guarantees and we therefore propose reducing the deadline for notifying applicants of decisions on applications for admission or renewal from 90 days to 60 days."
"We also propose greater flexibility concerning the student residence permit."
"Where the study programme is shorter than one year but longer than nine months, like many programmes, it would be a shame not to grant a one-year residence permit to enable students to work during the holidays preceding or following the study programme in order to earn some of the money required for their stay, or to improve their knowledge of their host country for a few weeks."
"The proposal for a directive grants students and unpaid researchers the possibility of working for a maximum of 10 to 20 hours per week."
"This right is essential in order to allow third-country nationals to boost their income in order to live decently."
"Furthermore, with regard to unpaid researchers, I believe it is very important for trade union representatives to be informed of their specific situation in order to be able to monitor compliance with the provisions of the directive."
"Withholding the right to work in the first year of residence or withdrawing the right to work if students do not make sufficient progress in their studies is unjustifiable and would tend to encourage illegal employment and exploitation of these nationals."
"Where there is insufficient progress in studies, attested to by the teaching establishment, the Member State could possibly have the option of reducing the number of working hours so that the student could devote more time to their studies."
"That is why I believe the amendment tabled to that effect to be satisfactory."
"We have the concerns of some Member States about the possible effects of the right to mobility and the right to work granted to students."
"I understand these concerns, but the proposal for a directive itself contains responses to this, in particular with regard to the mobility of students, which is very clearly defined, with specific conditions, in Article 7."
"Thus, the proposed directive does not apply to the mobility of students wishing to exchange student status for immigrant worker status."
"This status, granted by a working residence permit, is the subject of the Terrón i Cusí report that we adopted in plenary last February."
"A change in status from student to immigrant worker is of course possible, but is outside the scope of the directive in question."
"We would point out that the Commission is simultaneously for an open policy with regard to the admission of students from third countries, in accordance with the wishes of the Member States, and for a policy of firmness with regard to persons or networks which voluntarily abuse the system."
"I therefore believe, ladies and gentlemen, that we should seize the opportunity to send a strong message to the Council calling for it swiftly to reach an agreement on this important matter in order to ensure a welcome that is worthy of our Member States."
"Mr President, I should first like to thank Mrs Roure, the rapporteur, for her hard work."
"In particular, I should like to pay tribute to the great effort she made to reach a consensus across the political groups."
"As stated previously, this Commission initiative supplements others regulating immigration for reasons of employment, self-employment or otherwise."
"It also supplements the directive on family reunification."
"In so doing it contributes to approximation of national legislation in this area, as recognised at the Tampere European Council."
"Students enjoy ever-greater mobility."
"They are always on the go, and third-country student exchanges certainly contribute to our cultural enrichment."
"It would therefore also be beneficial to promote exchange visits by European Union students to third countries, although this is not the aim of this directive."
"It is undoubtedly beneficial for Europe if third-country students undertake part of their studies here."
"Europe certainly gains, but it is also important to ensure those students receive the best training so that they will be able to make a useful contribution to the development of their countries of origin."
"Whenever there is discussion of immigration from developing countries it is always stated that promoting growth and development is the best way of combating illegal immigration."
"I therefore share the concern expressed by the rapporteur."
"I believe the European Union must grant entry to immigrants wishing to study here."
"It is however essential for those students to return to their countries of origin on completion of their studies. They should be able to put the knowledge they have acquired to good use."
"We must not be party to creaming off the most able individuals from developing countries."
"Turning to the entry requirements we are currently considering, namely specific requirements to regulate immigration for study purposes or for volunteering, we should take account of the circumstances of each Member State."
"This is stated in the Commission's proposal."
"A monitoring system is called for, to help combat illegal trafficking networks and exploitation in the workplace."
"Consequently, I support the Commission's proposal to grant Member States authority to order the expulsion of a migrant for reasons of public order, or to refuse to renew a residence permit."
"Immigration for study purposes needs to be regulated to prevent ghost centres from springing up."
"The latter could then set up illegal immigration networks."
"It is important to ascertain that the higher education or vocational training institutions are legally recognised."
"In addition, these centres should be in a position to guarantee quality learning for the students."
"In the case of apprentices, it is also important to ensure that they can gain practical experience in specialised centres or companies."
"Care should be taken to ensure that entry permits for apprentices do not become a cover for illegal employment."
"The centres need to be properly equipped too."
"Turning to residence permits, it is certainly appropriate to be able to renew a residence permit for student exchanges when all the conditions have been met."
"This would allow students to complete more than one academic year in the same institution."
"The period of residence granted could even exceed the duration of the studies, though as Mrs Roure stated, a limit must nonetheless be set."
"My group tabled an amendment providing for a period of residence of one year if the higher education course was of nine months' duration."
"That is the usual length of an academic year"
"In addition, safeguards or restrictions applying to students who fail to make satisfactory progress in their studies must also be put in place."
"Failure to do so would amount to opening the floodgates to students whose sole intention was to come to work."
"There would be little incentive to make good progress on the courses of study."
"My group has therefore also tabled an amendment allowing Member States to reduce the period in which students may work if they do not make satisfactory progress in their studies."
"The rapporteur has included in the report a number of amendments aimed at ensuring that this directive covers third-country nationals who are unpaid researchers."
"I am not opposed to the idea."
"It might however be appropriate to have a specific Commission initiative on the subject."
"Nonetheless, it is certainly the case that unpaid research and vocational training could be dealt with in a similar way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Roure for the work she has carried out, and to underline what Mr Oreja Arburúa has just said about ensuring that the measures we are about to approve benefit their intended targets and are not cynically exploited."
"I would also like to remind you of the Lisbon strategy, approved at the European Council on 24 March 2000, in which the challenges facing the Union in the new knowledge-based economy were set out."
"In that strategy, mention was already made of emerging teaching, research and training needs, which must not be confined within the Union's geographical borders. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that every one of these areas exerts a potential attraction all over the world, as befits Europe's extraordinary cultural and scientific heritage."
"It is thus the responsibility of the European Union and the Member States to implement policies which attract third-country students."
"We therefore welcome this proposal, which is another step towards approximating national legislation on admission and residence conditions for third-country nationals, the final goal being to create a comprehensive legal framework regulating admissions on the basis of the reasons for immigrants' visits."
"The internationalisation of education and the increased mobility of students is in line with the aim of developing quality education, as laid out in Article 149 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community. It helps in promoting inter-cultural understanding, energising European educational systems and attaining high-quality teaching standards."
"For all these reasons, I think that the Commission's proposal is quite positive."
"It constitutes a forward step in strengthening cooperation with third countries and in developing that quality education."
"The admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, vocational training or voluntary service has the peculiar distinction of being temporary and independent of the host State's labour market."
"Mr President, the proposals presented to us aim to encourage further the entry of immigrants into the European Union."
"The most obvious example of this is the last report concerning the right to family reunification, the Fourtou report, in which the concept of family had become unrecognisable, such was the extent to which it had been extended and denatured."
"In its frenzy to allow needy foreigners from all over the world into a Europe that it would like to be respectful of human rights and to have a humanist, not to say humanitarian, vocation, the Commission is planning the death of nations by drowning and suffocation."
"It should be noted, however, that this report, even though it supplements the measures that have already been presented with regard to immigration for the purposes of employment and family reunification, does not take the same approach."
"It concerns students and school pupils who would enter the Union in order to study."
"In this regard, nonetheless, we need to establish the length of stay, methods of monitoring their studies, and procedures for non-renewal of the student residence permit."
"This exchange and this form of cooperation between Europe and third countries is clearly a source of intellectual enrichment between students of the country of origin and the host country."
"Should we not, however, devote our efforts more to aid to development in less advantaged countries, in order to allow these countries to train their elite at home and keep them there, in order to prevent brain drain, which, unfortunately for them, is often inevitable?"
"Of course, this would require a genuine cooperation policy with disadvantaged third countries and a sea change in immigration policy in Brussels."
"Sadly, we are far from achieving this."
"Mr President, this is a very timely report."
"We know the importance of the entry of third-country nationals for temporary periods of study, which brings enormous benefits and advantages for the host country and the student alike."
"The number of students undertaking such international exchanges is greater than ever and demand continues to grow."
"This must be welcomed by all sides, apart from the previous speaker."
"Indeed we need to put into place measures to ensure that the European Union continues to remain a centre of excellence in this field."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on this report."
"It sets a broad framework to encourage third-country nationals to enjoy the best educational facilities available in Member States without over-prescribing and over-regulating."
"Common practices to facilitate the movement of third-country nationals can only be a good thing."
"However, I am afraid certain elements of this proposal are problematic for my country, the United Kingdom."
"Colleagues will be aware that the United Kingdom and the English language have a magnetic appeal for huge numbers of students, not just from European Union countries, but from all over the world."
"Whilst this is welcomed and understandable, it creates special challenges, not least of which are the proposals here and how they affect the national minimum wage in the United Kingdom."
"The national minimum wage is one of the greatest steps forward in the United Kingdom since 1997."
"It requires employers not to take on third-country nationals unless they are paid at least the going rate for the job."
"Unfortunately aspects of this report, referring to volunteers, undermine the minimum wage in the United Kingdom, which seeks to protect the rights of both migrants and nationals, ensuring that those engaged on a voluntary basis, without adequate conditions of service, are not there in place of a full- or part-time worker."
"The concerns are specific to the United Kingdom."
"In general the report is balanced and sensible."
"I shall be voting for it in the hope that the UK will be joining later on, as in other cases."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I shall adopt a technical approach, but please also allow me to make some more general comments."
"The Europe of the future must become a land of exchange, of meetings and mixing."
"What could be more important than knowing our neighbours, their culture and their language?"
"In any case, that is what we say every morning."
"For fifty years, we have been building a multicultural Europe, not a one-sided Europe."
"Our Europe, that melting pot of cultures, languages and people, is possible thanks to free movement and study programmes."
"Furthermore, we would like to build a Europe based on knowledge and lifelong learning."
"However, a knowledge-based Europe can only exist through exchanges, in particular exchanges with third countries."
"As the Nobel Prize-winner Octavio Paz so rightly wrote, 'every culture is born of mixing, meeting and confrontation; quite the opposite, it is isolation that destroys civilisations'."
"Thanks to Mrs Roure's excellent report, we have the privilege of enabling young people from all over the world to come to this old Europe of ours in order to learn a language, study, or hone and share their knowledge."
"As Mrs Roure so clearly pointed out, knowledge-sharing is a source of enrichment both for immigrants and for countries of origin and host countries."
"By allowing easier, more homogenous access for students, researchers and volunteers, we are also allowing Europe and our fellow citizens to enrich and share their knowledge and experiences."
"We cannot, therefore, close our doors to all these people who wish to learn, share and understand."
"All the conditions must be met in order to allow third-country nationals to come to Europe to train or hone their knowledge, because knowledge is the only thing that increases when shared."
". (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I know that we are late for the vote, and will therefore be very brief."
"I want to thank Mrs Roure for her excellent report."
"I want to express the Commission's preference for not including rules for researchers in this directive, since Mr Busquin and I intend this autumn to present a general proposal on third-country researchers in the European Union. The Commission will consider further the rapporteur's proposals on brain drain, the stand-still clause and on reducing the decision period from 90 to 60 days."
"Finally, I would encourage Parliament to seek a broad consensus in favour of adopting Amendment No 37, on conditions of access to work."
"Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"Mr President, on a point of order, yesterday in order to come to Strasbourg I left my home at 6 a.m., flew to Dublin, flew to London, flew to Paris and flew to Strasbourg, arriving at 6 p.m."
"My point is that Air France has cancelled direct flights from Britain to Strasbourg which means that it is now enormously difficult for Members from Britain or Ireland to come here unless they take the whole day to do so."
"I could go to America and back in the same time!"
"For that reason the time has come for this Parliament to consider whether or not it can recreate direct access to Strasbourg."
"If not, then it will have to relocate to a place where it can do so and be more efficient."
"Mr Hume, personally, I very much appreciate your remarks because I come across the same problems myself."
"To add insult to injury I was even stopped by the police for speeding on my way here this week."
"As far as I am aware the Strasbourg authorities are currently looking into the matter."
"I hope that it will be resolved before too long."
"I believe that the more pressure that is brought to bear, the better the result will be."
"Mr Evans, that message will certainly be passed on to the President of Parliament."
"I hope we can look at it within the Bureau."
"Mr President, although I feel it is legitimate for Mr Hume to raise a practical issue, the need to improve air connections, and I support his request, I also find it shocking that a Member of Parliament should challenge the right to strike in the countries of the European Union."
"I would point out that this case is not specific to France."
"On 13 May, Austria experienced its first national strike in fifty years, on the same subject: pension protection."
"If we want to remedy the mistrust that currently separates the European institutions from the citizens, therefore, we should not follow Mr Evans' bad example."
"Quite the opposite, we should show solidarity with our fellow citizens."
"Mr President, I must ask for an oral amendment to be made that has been negotiated and discussed with the political groups."
"Instead of having the quantitative targets found in two of the clauses, that is to say instead of writing 50% etc, we just want to write 'significant reduction'."
"This is noted also in the voting list."
"Mr President, criticism has already been expressed this morning of the ways in which strikes are bringing life in France to a standstill."
"Although, along with the criticism, there has also been sympathy, I do not comprehend how it is that strikes in France are a reason for this House's air conditioning not working."
"All morning, it has been quite impossible to do any work in the offices on the side of the building facing the sun."
"As far as the current temperature in the Chamber is concerned, the union probably would not allow work to be done under these conditions."
"(Applause)"
"I will ensure that the college of Quaestors is aware of what you have mentioned."
"Mr President, I would just like to clarify one point with regard to the voting list."
"I would ask that we vote against the Committee's Amendments Nos 21 and 26 in order to be able to support the compromise amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Mr President, I just want to clarify something in the German text."
"Rather than 'translated', it has to read, 'interpreted'."
"The term has to be incorporated in all versions of the original Article 12."
"The services are aware of the problem."
"They will make sure that the proper definition is used."
"The texts will all be aligned with each other."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 10:"
"Mr President, the adoption of Amendment No 6 makes it necessary to make a technical correction to Article 33 (1) and to Article 34 (1)."
"I take it as read that the plenary is happy that this technical correction should be made by the responsible Committee."
"The linguistic and legal services will ensure that is done."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 23:"
"Mr President, my name has been added to Amendment No 23."
"I did not sign that amendment and do not support it."
"I shall therefore vote against it."
"Mr President, I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"We now have a majority."
"The House has been divided and different groups have had the opportunity to put on the record their preferred optimum solution amongst the options available."
"I came to vote today with my colleagues in the ELDR."
"I departed only once from that list: to show support for what was available."
"Tomorrow, when we vote in the light of a Commission opinion, I would make the strongest appeal to Members of this House to give the largest possible consensus."
"I understand that many people have deep reservations about aspects of what this final statute may contain."
"However, I and the rapporteur will need to go to other institutions, and we have to go fortified by the weight of this House."
"We can go with a 'yes' or we can go with a 'no', but there is no debate on the basis of 'yes, but...'."
"I ask people to reflect overnight and when we come tomorrow to vote in the light of the Commission's opinion, to give to those charged to represent this House the widest, most thorough mandate possible to say: 'This is what is available; this what we bring forward; and this commands the support of a great majority of Parliament'."
"That is my appeal - to reflect overnight and tomorrow to put our collective weight behind what is available, for that is what we shall work with."
". (FR) The European Parliament has just rejected the proposal for a Council decision which aimed to establish practical measures for the application of the directive on mutual recognition between the Member States of decisions that each one might be led to take in order to expel third-country nationals."
"Fortunately, this House was only consulted for an opinion, and this draft can therefore at last undergo the adoption procedure."
"We feel that its content is entirely justified, and that Parliament is trying to start an unreasonable quarrel."
"Most of the House maintained that Article 63(3) of the EC Treaty could not constitute a valid legal base: it does concern the adoption of common measures to repatriate illegal residents, but this provision would authorise measures concerning content rather than procedure."
"This is a specious distinction, which even the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market could not support."
"Here, in fact, Parliament is showing its normal pro-immigration bias: what it does not like about this draft is that it might facilitate the repatriation of illegal immigrants."
"Of course, we did not support it."
". (PT) Due to the need for consistency with the position previously adopted by the European Parliament in plenary session on 11 December 2000, when the French initiative - which lacked any legal basis - proposing the adoption of a directive on mutual recognition of decisions concerning expulsion of third-country nationals, was rejected, I do not feel able to adopt any other stance on this initiative than a similar rejection."
"As was already the case with the Directive itself, the issue is not the proposal's substance or its actual political content, which in fact I consider quite positive, since it seeks to introduce rules and suitable practical methods for correcting any possible financial imbalances resulting from the implementation of the Directive in question."
"In other words, the Member State responsible for the expulsion decision must reimburse the Member State which enforces that decision, on the basis of the real costs of the operation, up to a maximum level, which should be reasonable, comparable and balanced, and should cover transport, administration and accommodation."
"Nevertheless, since we have before us an initiative on the application of Directive 2001/40/EC, which was rejected due to its lack of a legal basis, we are once again unable, by the same logic, to adopt any stance other than a rejection of this initiative."
". (PT) I concur with the position of the rapporteur, who, while substantially in agreement with the proposal's content, advocated its rejection due to its legal basis."
"Fundamentally, the draft directive does not in fact seek to establish substantive conditions for expulsion, but only deals with the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions already in force."
"In other words, it does not specifically cover Community expulsion decisions on the basis of a rule adopted according to the terms of Article 63 of the European Community Treaty."
"Rather, it covers expulsion decisions taken on the basis of national law."
"This directive, then, concerns the applicability of decisions; it does not define the substantive law on expulsion."
"Article 63(3) of the EC Treaty, however, only provides for the latter and says nothing about the mutual recognition of decisions taken on the basis of national law."
"(PT) I voted against this report, because I believe that it says nothing new. It simply synthesises a vision of Community law, in an obviously tendentious manner, and gives voice to expansionist desires which, though not new either, are no less surprising for the clarity with which they are declared."
"In her argumentation, the rapporteur completely forgets the basic principle of Community legal intervention (whether from above or from below): the principle of subsidiarity."
"In doing so, she provides national legal legislators with proof of their own subordination."
"The rapporteur's vision is centralist rather than federalist."
"She reduces national legislations and legal ordinances to an unacceptable level of subordination, in the belief that blanket application of Community law is the panacea which will solve all Europe's problems."
"This is not to mention the subordinate role which the rapporteur unfortunately confers on national parliaments."
"I am profoundly doubtful of the usefulness and benefits of this type of interpretation of the application of Community law. It merely serves to turn the application of the principle of subsidiarity on its head."
"Mr President, last night, I dreamed that the Italian, French, German and Portuguese Ministers for Finance and the Finance Ministers of other countries said to me: 'You see, Mr Fatuzzo?"
"Mr Belder's report on macro-financial assistance provides for aid to be given to states which need money for their budgets."
"Can it be a good thing to have a budget deficit, then?"
"Why do we not do the same here in Europe - we can reward those who have a deficit and launch an infringement procedure against the states which manage to balance their books?'"
"I put the question to the House."
". (PT) I supported this report, which reviews the logic hitherto underlying European Union Macro-financial Assistance (MFA) to third countries, with a view to proposing a more structured approach and, in particular, guaranteeing democratic legitimacy and a fundamental principle of accountability."
"The fact is that we often know nothing about how MFA is handled once it is transferred directly into the budget of the beneficiary country's central bank."
"Above and beyond that, moreover, given the exceptional character of MFA, it should be an occasional, short-term and one-off subsidy, in contrast to current practice in several beneficiary countries."
"I also think that it would be a positive step to make MFA exceptional by definition, for example, and to transform it, through suitable inspection provisions, into a crisis prevention system. Additionally, like the rapporteur, whose approach I warmly applaud, I think that the decision-making process, follow-up and assessment should be carried out with the greatest openness."
"Mr President, I voted for Mr Schmid's report on employment but, as representative of the Pensioners' Party and all pensioners, I would stress before the House - which listens equally carefully to the explanations of vote of all the Members and, in particular, as we know and as we can see, to my own - that it is possible to both balance states' books and increase pensions if we can only manage to administer better the money handed over to the state by workers and citizens during their working lives which is to be restored to them subsequently when they grow old."
"There is too much wastage, too many people interested in receiving money who do not deserve it."
"If we put our finances in order we will be able to have lower taxes and duties, smaller contributions and larger pensions."
". (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats support the proposal for the employment strategy."
"It is important for the European Parliament to give its support to this strategy."
"The proposal contains many positive features. For example, the aspects relating to equality are emphasised, improvements demanded for disabled people in the labour market and full employment declared to be an overarching objective."
"A proposal by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is based on the view that a general reduction in taxes is beneficial to employment."
"We do not share this view."
"The facts show that there is no connection between tax levels and employment."
"We choose, however, not to vote against this proposal, but to abstain."
"The reason is that if the PPE-DE Group does not get this proposal through, that group will vote against the whole report."
"If the whole report were to fall by the wayside, that would be far more serious than this individual proposal going through."
"That is why we are abstaining on this point."
". I have voted for the Schmid report because I believe it supports and makes a contribution to the achievement of the three main goals of the 'European Employment Strategy', namely full employment, increased productivity and greater social inclusion within society of marginalised and disadvantaged groups."
"I believe that the report's addition of a fourth goal, namely, mainstreaming of male-female equality is laudable."
"The implementation of the guidelines on the 'open coordination method' is the correct way forward, as it involves national parliaments fully in the discussions and adoption of national employment plans."
"This will make the report meaningful in constituencies like mine where unemployment is concentrated in small pockets of poverty in London despite the low unemployment nationally of the UK."
". (EL) The spread of flexibility and atypical forms of work, in order to share out unemployment, entrepreneurship, the extension of working life on the pretext of the ageing of the population and sustainable pensions and lifelong learning are the basic Commission guidelines on employment."
"At the same time, by making not only relative but also absolute cuts in wages and linking them to productivity, cutbacks in the welfare state and social protection and the non-application of what are inadequate safety regulations in the workplace are being promoted."
"Unemployment is rising constantly and exceeds 10%, not counting hidden unemployment."
"This situation, especially the large number of long-term unemployed and unemployment among the young and women, who are unable to enter the labour market, is giving rise to acute manifestations of poverty and social exclusion."
"The term employment policy is completely misleading."
"The proposed measures are essentially measures to reinforce the unaccountability of big business by granting it new privileges."
"This policy represents an escalation of the attack on workers' rights, the objective being the further promotion of plans for a cheap workforce, with no employment, insurance, wage or trade union rights, and increased profits."
"The workers are not only rejecting these measures, but are also reacting proactively and en masse against pro-monopoly choices by stepping up their fight."
". (SV) We believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions should be taken as close as possible to those they affect."
"That is why we are actively pushing the issue of a constitution for the European Union in which the distribution of responsibilities is clear to everyone."
"It must be perfectly clear to everyone that the EU must only deal with those issues it is best placed to tackle, namely cross-border issues."
"All other issues should be dealt with at local, regional or national levels."
"Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU should only have limited competence, except where freedom of movement for people within the EU is concerned."
"Every Member State should have full responsibility for determining its own social security systems, together with the right to do so."
"Health care, childcare and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas that are not directly cross-border."
"The same applies to labour market policy."
"That does not, however, prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere."
"At the same time, we wish to emphasise that we fully share our fellow MEP's, Mr Schmid's, commitment to social cohesion, integration and, especially, equality."
". (FR) Lifelong learning, work and the elderly are all highly important subjects that are highlighted in this report, and employment strategies are vital."
"We want more jobs, but also better-adapted jobs."
"The fight against poverty is key."
"We cannot accept that families should still be living below the poverty line today."
"It is a matter of solidarity."
"The objectives we set must be accessible."
"We need to invest in high-quality services so that women can reconcile employment with family obligations."
"We need a more effective partnership between the Member States."
"In order to foster the participation of women in social life and the labour market, we need to define a series of specific actions aiming to provide services that correspond to childcare needs, but which also enable us to provide assistance for families with other dependents."
"It is essential to invest in public services in order to respond to the needs of families and society as a whole and it is vital for all the actors concerned to be involved in implementing employment strategy."
"Furthermore, the existence of high-quality public services requires appropriate taxation."
". (FR) The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs proposes that we ratify the draft Council directive laying down a global employment policy for the European Union for completion by 2010."
"This policy falls within the context of the Lisbon strategy which aims to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."
"The amendments made to this legislative resolution improve the initial text in certain aspects, in particular with regard to gender equality objectives and taking account of qualifications and vocational training."
"The amendments, however, do not challenge the liberal idea of reducing company taxation and flexibility in the labour market."
"What is even more important is that the resolution retains the objective of increasing the average age at retirement by five years at Community level by 2010, while millions of people are demonstrating in France and in other European countries against this idea and to protect their pension systems."
"For this reason, I did not vote for the report."
". (PT) Whilst not playing down the significance of the report's more contentious aspects, I agree with the Commission's view, supported by the rapporteur, according to which this form of immigration is a source of mutual enrichment, both for the migrants directly concerned and for the country of origin and the host country."
"It contributes to promoting intercultural understanding, to the dynamism of training in Europe and to the quest for high standards in education."
"Information sharing and 'best practices' must become a reality beyond the Union's territory."
"The training of students and researchers is a key sphere of action for increasing well-being, information and the quality of life, to which the Union is committed, in particular through the various association agreements and development funds."
"In fact, because of the special contribution it makes to personal development, which will hopefully also benefit the countries of origin, this proposal should be carefully studied by the Member States in the context of their individual immigration policies."
"What is particularly interesting is the Union's commitment to finding jobs for nationals in their country of origin and to regulating the system of voluntary work."
"In the end, I voted in favour of this report, because Amendments Nos 36 and 37 have been adopted, adding considerable balance to the arrangements laid down in Articles 11(1) and 18(2)..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Article 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out, on behalf of all my colleagues in the French Socialist delegation and on my own behalf, our position on the report on the adoption of a Statute for Members."
"The Statute needs to be adopted as a matter of urgency due to the imminent completion of the current enlargement process."
"We are in favour of the principles underlying this step, even though we disagree with certain provisions concerning the sum and taxation of remuneration for Members."
"The compensation system for Members did need to be rendered more comprehensible, but the text proposed does not seem to us to respond fully to this need."
"That is why the French Socialist delegation wished to amend the text by voting for Amendment No 8 to Article 7 of the draft Statute, which it tabled alongside other political groups."
"We feel that intelligent implementation of this principle means that remuneration would be adapted to different standards of living in the various Member States, even if certain inequalities would have to be corrected."
"We are sorry that this amendment was not adopted."
"In the current context, increasing remuneration for Members of the European Parliament would run the risk of causing an unfavourable reaction, at a time when the legitimacy of differences in remuneration between the economic and political elite and the rest of the population is in question."
"When I woke up this morning, Mr President, I thought I was Mr Rothley and, on my way to Parliament in the car with which we are provided, I thought, 'I want to table an amendment to my report' - speaking as Mr Rothley - 'which gives Members of the European Parliament a salary which is twice as large as that paid to judges'."
"When I got to Parliament, however, I looked in the mirror and saw that I was Mr Fatuzzo."
"I had no hope of succeeding and so I had to resign myself to voting for the motion: it is better to be half a judge than to be a nobody."
"Mr President, I would like, first of all, to ask you to take note of the following correction."
"I actually wanted to vote in favour of Amendment No 8 to Article 16, rather than against it, as I am of course in favour of differential weighting of living expenses."
"Now, by way of an actual explanation of how I voted, let me say that I have always been in favour of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament, but the reasons why I voted against the Rothley Report were as follows: I cannot understand why, today, we have not managed to make the actual costs of travel transparent and take them into account."
"Before now, the Statute always had to serve as a pretext for such a rule not existing."
"Now, we want a Statute, but we are rejecting transparency and the accounting for the real costs."
"I find that dishonest; we cannot explain it to the public, who, when they travel on business, can of course claim only the actual costs."
"Nor do I think it right that we have not substantially raised the pensionable age."
"(Applause) In Germany, we have just had a debate on increasing the retirement age for people at large, and I think the same should obviously apply to us."
"Apart from that, I am also in favour of us paying the same taxes as those who elected us, so as not to give the impression that we are establishing special rights for Members of this House."
"That is why I had to go against my original intention and vote against the Statute."
"I think that Parliament?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can, fundamentally, do no other than agree with Mrs Breyer."
"For years already, we have been wrestling with a solution to the issue of MEPs' salaries, and opinions can differ very widely, particularly when it comes to whether the current national system is preferable to one applicable right across the EU."
"The one thing, though, that the creation of a new Statute must not do under any circumstances is to create privileges and new rules that cannot be got across to the public."
"In view of the ongoing debate about how best to secure Europe's pension schemes, people will see the idea, contained in the Statute and in an amendment, of pensioning MEPs off as early as 60 or 63, as a provocation."
"It is not only in my own country that people are, at present, being told that they will have to work for longer; in the European Parliament, on the other hand, the intention is obviously to guarantee politicians early retirement, which is not what social policy demands."
"Neither can I, nor will I, vote for a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament in this form."
"The same goes for the rule on lump sums for expenses."
"In future, the reimbursement of expenses - of whatever kind - must relate only to those actually incurred, and it must no longer be possible to draw additional expenses under any circumstances."
"It is imperative that rules for travel costs should be transparent and comprehensible."
"Mr President, I want to offer an explanation of vote on behalf of the ELDR Group for our final vote on Mr Rothley's report on the Members' Statute on which we mainly abstained."
"We have the greatest respect for President Cox, and this group, under his leadership, and subsequently, has always fought for reform."
"We have been able to compromise on some matters but there are others of principle on which we will not compromise."
"We, therefore, abstained on the following issues: we wanted reform now, not reform later at an uncertain date; we wanted equality for our colleagues from the acceding states."
"If we want to be treated equally here ourselves, why should we offer them a worse deal?"
"We wanted the option of national tax so we could be treated with equality with the citizens we represent; we wanted a clear message that expenses should be transparent."
"Those items did not find favour with the majority in this House."
"Whilst Parliament has given its decision, it pains me as a parliamentarian to say that I hope the Council makes a better fist of it than we have."
". Members of the European Parliament are elected as representatives of the Member States and they should receive salaries and pay taxes similar to members of the national parliaments (MNP)."
"Attempts to differentiate between MEPs and MNPs will not strengthen any links between the two and extreme salary increases combined with EU taxation will alienate voters further."
"We strongly support any efforts to make the remuneration and allowance system more transparent and in accordance with prudent accounting standards."
"At the same time, we believe it is hypocritical to legislate on corporate governance while not being able to apply the same standards to an institution ultimately funded by taxpayers' money."
"We have voted against the Rothley report as a consequence of the attempt to establish the idea of MEPs simply being 'European' and completely removed from their national settings as well as increase salaries substantially, but without a thorough 'cleaning-up' of the allowance system, cf. Article 27."
". (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats wish to account for our reasons for voting against the draft decision in the report on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"We cannot support the draft Statute, since our Amendment No 30 on national taxation has been rejected."
"For ourselves as Swedish Social Democrats, it is extremely important for us to be able to retain national tax, since that is the system to which we adhere and of which we make use."
"Joint funding via income tax is required for funding our common welfare policy."
"We therefore believe that Members of the European Parliament should pay national tax in their own countries."
"Elected political representatives should follow the same rules as everyone else."
"Another key issue has been the way in which travel allowances are accounted for."
"We have demanded that the new rules be based upon open accounts that are easily accessible to public scrutiny."
"That is why we have worked for an open and fair system where allowances are concerned."
"At present, travel and other expenses are paid out on a flat-rate basis."
"We want to see a system in which refunds are made on the basis of actual costs."
"We believe that salary levels too cause offence, since the new levels are very high."
". (FR) Under the aegis of the new Article 190(5) of the EC Treaty, introduced by the Treaty of Nice, this House has just drawn up a draft unified Statute for Members of the European Parliament, which should be submitted to the Council for its decision - no longer to be reached unanimously, but by a qualified majority."
"The text addresses a number of technical issues that needed to be resolved in any case within the context of the recognised autonomy of the European Parliament to organise its correct internal functioning."
"It also goes much further, however, by presenting a statute that standardises at European level all aspects of the situation of members of parliament and cuts essential links with their countries of origin, in particular remuneration."
"As we have said a hundred times, Members of the European Parliament need to be paid - as they are today - by the citizens of their country, who elected them and whom they are supposed to represent."
"Parliament's current actions correspond implicitly to the objective of establishing a super-State, where Members would represent the Union as a whole, rather than the country that elected them."
"This is a fundamental, if surreptitious, change, of which, once again, our voters are unaware."
"Out of honesty towards them, we refused to vote for this draft."
". (NL) Mr President, I should like to make a couple of points by way of explanation of how I voted on the Members' Statute."
"First of all, I believe that our salaries should be the same as the salaries of the members of the national parliaments."
"I consider myself to be a Dutch politician, not a European official."
"This is why I voted in favour of Amendment No 8 as well as Amendment No 5."
"Secondly, I disagree with a net increase in our salary of at least EUR 2 800 per month."
"This amount is set to increase even more if a decision is made in favour of imposing European taxes."
"Such a substantial increase is unacceptable - especially since we hear it stressed on every side how necessary pay restraint is in order to maintain employment."
"Taking advantage of the fact that, as a result of the Nice Treaty, the Council's decision on the 'Statute for Members of the European Parliament' must now be taken under qualified majority voting rather than unanimity, the EP is once again insisting on a proposal that contains aspects with which we disagree."
"One such aspect concerns setting a monthly parliamentary allowance that is the same for all Members, regardless of which country they represent."
"Members of the EP are elected in national constituencies. Consequently, they are, and must remain, bound to these constituencies."
"Establishing a single monthly allowance fits in with a federalist view of the mandate of an EP Member, by seeking to transform today's national Members of the EP into future 'European MPs'. This is a vision that we do not share."
"Furthermore, as we have emphasised, the social realities in the countries of the EU differ greatly, making it inevitable that if this measure is implemented, in various countries, including Portugal, there will be enormous inequalities and disparities between the pay of workers and that of representatives and holders of public office, which would be quite incomprehensible."
"In other words, the salary of Members of the EP must be based on the salary of the Members of the national parliament of the country in which they are elected."
"Hence our vote against the report."
". (NL) The Statute for Members of the European Parliament has for years been the subject of two debates along completely opposite lines."
"One, in which I have joined, is about the way in which we can call a halt to the financial privileges that cause the electorate to regard MEPs in a suspicious light."
"The other is about the way in which membership of this House can be made more attractive by higher salaries, lower taxes and the highest level of Member protection against legal cases."
"I have always been in favour of a uniform salary for all MEPs, provided that this salary is significantly lower than that in France, England and particularly Germany and Italy."
"This uniform salary must remain subject to the national, regional and local taxes in the Member State of residence, as is the case for uniform salaries received by people working for international companies in different countries."
"Guaranteeing the same net income by extremely low European taxes is a completely superfluous privilege for MEPs."
"In addition, immunity must only protect freedom of speech of those elected and not lead to impunity in other matters."
"The EU's enlargement must not affect political diversity."
"The allocation of ever fewer seats in this House to each Member State prevents smaller movements from being represented."
"Unlike some other Dutch people, I have only ever seen a statute as a means to an end, never the main aim."
"Since the final document serves the opposite from what I have upheld, I am unable to give it my support."
". The EPLP is concerned about a number of points in the report as it currently stands: -"
"On tax we are of the view that Member States should be allowed to level tax at national rates."
"On salaries the wise persons' report produced a formula that was acceptable to the majority of Member States and MEPs and we see no reason for the unjustified change to a salary which is 50% of that of a European Court Judge."
"On expenses we firmly believe that the European Parliament has an opportunity to rectify the longstanding anomalies by introducing a system of travel at cost."
"The report's stance on immunities would require changes to primary law and we feel that this is not the appropriate report in which this should be included."
"Finally, on the question of the implementation date, the EPLP cannot accept under any circumstances a possible post 2004 implementation date."
"The EPLP wants to go into the 2004 election campaign with this issue clearly resolved."
"As the European Parliament has just voted for a date beyond that period we cannot support the final vote on this report."
". (FR) At a time when the peoples of Europe are facing so many difficulties (unemployment, social breakdown, insecurity, etc.), I am not convinced that they will truly appreciate Parliament's determination to get its uniform statute for Members of the European Parliament adopted."
"I believe it to be an entirely secondary concern and that it is being pursued for material and ideological reasons."
"So far as the material aspect is concerned, there is no point in going on about it at length, but I think it is obscene to take advantage of the occasion to give MEPs a whole series of excessive sinecures and privileges."
"Regarding the ideological aspect, no one is taken in: this statute's primary objective is to detach the elected representative from his State of origin completely."
"Even though, in legal terms, we sit in this Parliament as the representatives of our respective peoples, they want to make us out to be the representatives of some mythical European people, in other words rootless."
"It all follows on logically from Parliament's earlier vote in favour of a uniform electoral procedure, the principle of transnational constituencies or European political parties."
"This report proves once again that Eurofederalism is divorced from the reality of the man in the street."
"For years now, we have been wrestling with a solution to the issue of MEPs' salaries, and this is something on which opinions can differ. They certainly can when it comes to whether the current national system is preferable to one applicable right across the EU."
"The one thing, though, that the creation of a new Statute must not do under any circumstances is to create privileges and new rules that cannot be got across to the public."
"In view of the ongoing debate about how best to secure Europe's pension schemes, the popular view will be that the idea, contained in the Statute and in an amendment, of pensioning MEPs off as early as 60 or 63, is a provocation."
"It is not only in my own country that people are, at the present time, being told that they will have to work for longer; in the European Parliament, on the other hand, the intention is obviously to guarantee politicians early retirement, which is not what social policy demands."
"Neither can I, nor will I, vote for a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament in this form."
"The same goes for the rule on lump sums for expenses."
"In future, the reimbursement of expenses - of whatever kind - must relate only to those actually incurred, and it must no longer be possible to draw additional expenses under any circumstances."
"It is imperative that rules for travel costs should be transparent and comprehensible."
". (PT) The grounds for establishing a statute for Members of the European Parliament appear, at first sight, to be quite uncontroversial: to meet the need for equality amongst Members and to provide the public with greater transparency."
"Such aims could be achieved, according to the rapporteur, by applying the same legal and financial arrangements to all Members, which would result in there being a single level of allowance and to this being subject to Community tax."
"Adopting the Statute will, however, have significant consequences for the concept of the parliamentary mandate itself, specifically with regard to the nationals of the State in which those Members are elected - an aspect which only the rapporteur appears not to have fully understood."
"A single European system would mean: subjecting Members to tax arrangements different to those applied to the citizens who voted for them; establishing Members as representatives of a hypothetical 'European people'; detracting from their standing as representatives of their own peoples, whereas they are genuine equals of the members of national parliaments, and disengaging them a little further from national and popular ties of belonging to a Member State."
"Consequently, despite having voted in favour of some specific aspects, I have in the end voted against the report, because I wish once again to adopt a position of principle at a time when institutional reform, by autocratic methods, with the Convention at the very centre, appears to wish to develop in a very negative way and balance in the context ..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Article 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (SV) We have today voted against the European Parliament's report on a new Statute for Members, which was however approved by 294 votes, with 171 against and 59 abstentions."
"Without a system of travel allowances in which refunds are made on the basis of actual costs instead of, at present, on a flat-rate basis, the new Statute will not lead to increased openness."
"Certainly, Parliament's Praesidium determined on 29 May 2003 to investigate a new system of travel allowances, but that still does not solve the problems."
"A decision to refund actual costs should come into force automatically at the same time as a new Statute for Members is implemented."
"In future, we should ideally like to see MEPs' salary levels set in relation to salary levels in the national parliaments."
"Because MEPs live in, and represent, their Member States, tax should, in the future too, be deducted on a national basis in order to take account of the cost of living and of social insurance systems in different countries."
". (DE) I hereby declare that I have voted in favour of the Rothley report on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, as I believe it to be essential that there should be, as soon as possible, a uniform statute with the same conditions applying to all Members of the European Parliament."
"This also means that major differences between the salaries of Members from the different Member States are unacceptable."
"In the European Parliament, as elsewhere, there must, in the medium term, be equal pay for equal work."
"I am, moreover, of the opinion that salaries must, as a matter of urgency, be made transparent - it is not acceptable that MEPs should have to use the reimbursement of travel expenses as a way of topping up their incomes."
"I will, nonetheless, not be availing myself of the rule's provisions."
"I took my seat under the conditions that have prevailed to date, and I will, for my own part, continue to be subject to them."
"Mr President, this morning, on my way to Parliament, I dreamed that I met the Prime Minister of Brazil, Mr Inácio Lula, who said to me: 'Mr Fatuzzo, this European Parliament is amazing, these regional free trade areas on which Mrs Mann has tabled a draft are amazing, and I urge you to vote for the motion."
"The extension of this free trade process which you Europeans were the first to implement is so important for us and for the whole world that I dream of becoming the Romano Prodi of Mercursor.'"
"I immediately started to wonder whether Romano Prodi, the President of the Commission, is really Romano Prodi or whether he is Inácio Lula pretending to be Mr Prodi?'"
"However, Mr President, as you know, it was a dream."
"(FR) We voted against the Mann report because it calls for the complete 'communitisation' of the European Union's trade policy, which would be harmful, as I said in yesterday's debate."
"But we also reject this report because of the trade strategy it advocates, which is in our view mistaken on at least two important points."
"Firstly, it says quite clearly that the objective of opening up to international trade is world integration, including 'regulatory convergence'."
"But while it is possible to support the idea of increasing trade to the benefit of all, it should also be added - which the report fails to do - that every country, or every region, has the right to protect its model of society."
"Secondly, it is much too indulgent towards the European Union's trade policy, in particular its all-out adoption of free trade areas."
"Such areas are useful if they reflect a desire for controlled opening."
"But in reality Europe has so many of them and they overlap so much that no one knows what their real effects are and they are causing us to lose control over our trade relations."
"."
"(FR) A trade strategy reflects a particular view of the world: a pure liberalisation of trade exacerbating inequality or a fight for real development?"
"As the Mann report again shows, the chief aim of creating regional free trade areas (FTAs) is to ensure the EU has political and economic stability in its relations with the countries concerned (the 'strategic geo-political interests') so that nothing can get in the way of the sacrosanct free movement of goods, services and capital."
"But what of peoples' access to basic rights?"
"What about an assessment of the social, environmental, cultural and economic consequences of such liberalisation?"
"What about genuine cooperation on equal terms and respecting the distinctive nature of each partner?"
"WTO rules must not be allowed to interfere with the EU's - still privileged - relations with its partners."
"The EU cannot reduce its policy towards countries and whole regions to free trade areas alone; there is too much of that in the Mediterranean, for example, while what is urgently needed is real political dialogue and economic and social cooperation built without any concept of domination."
". (PT) The main aim of this report by the Committee on Industry is to use free trade areas (FTAs) and bilateral agreements as a 'Trojan horse' to ensure the liberalisation of world trade under the control of the WTO and the 'Doha Agenda', and perhaps even to exceed the ambitions of these by including political aims."
"We read in the report that '...the constraint placed by the need to obtain consensus among WTO members complicates and slows down multilateral negotiations."
"By moving faster than the global trading system and sharing its goals, FTAs serve as catalysts for change."
"While FTAs undermine the non-discriminatory principle of multilateralism, as long as they are WTO-compliant and WTO-Plus, they are incentives and complementary models for new global trade initiatives...', putting the EU forward as a model to follow."
"What is the point of these words?"
"The report also claims that the EU institutions should have exclusive competence 'for all areas of trade', and that 'QMV and co-decision should apply to all trade matters', which would clearly make it hard for Portugal to protect its national interests."
"Hence my vote against the report."
". The subject of this report is an extremely important one."
"That is why the Green/EFA Group was one of the instigators of an ITRE own-initiative report on the subject of regional integration, particularly with respect to its potential effects on multilateralism and on efforts to achieve sustainable development."
"However, the final title and scope of this report was much less precise than we had anticipated, and its conclusions are at significant variance from our own."
"Although some amendments that capture a number of our concerns were adopted, many others were not, and much of the report continues to give very uncritical support to ever greater economic integration."
"One of our most important amendments would make the implementation of Free Trade Areas (FTAs) conditional on a prior in-depth sustainability impact assessment, to ensure that the FTA does not exacerbate inequalities among partners, and to establish mandatory rules to promote social justice and sustainability."
"Since this - and amendments in a similar vein - were not adopted, we have been forced to abstain on this report."
". (PT) Recalling what could be called the 'relevance' of trade agreements concluded in recent years, the rapporteur emphasises that these are also driven by the desire to promote political stability, which consequently makes them an integral part of the Union's external policy."
"Although the benefits of these free trade areas are undeniable, because the WTO has not clarified the situation, these areas are developing in a framework which lacks legal certainty. Furthermore, we must bear in mind the potentially damaging consequences of a 'harmonising' strategy in the least-developed countries, whose ability to participate in trade negotiations is sometimes limited and cannot be overstretched, if we really want to see fair results."
"Consequently, although I broadly agree, I feel that more prudent and gradualist guidelines needed to be defined and this is why I was inclining towards abstaining from the final vote."
"The result of the vote on paragraph 21 of the proposal, however, has persuaded me to vote against the report."
"In this field, which is so sensitive, it is crucial to uphold the decision-making procedure that was agreed on by consensus in Nice, as proposed in Amendment No 12."
"By once again imposing the original wording, however, the majority is causing Parliament once again to persist with an approach that I believe to be unrealistic and unacceptable."
"I therefore voted against the report."
". (EL) The report on Euro-Mediterranean cooperation once again conceals the EU's arrogance towards the Mediterranean countries."
"'Civilized' Europe is prepared to teach democracy and the free market to its 'uncivilised' neighbours."
"It is becoming the appraiser of everything, especially when it comes to human rights, at a time when a huge network of dictatorship, repression and police states is unfolding in the EU itself."
"It is disseminating its own version of terrorism, it is imposing special clauses in association agreements, while it has not a single word to say about Israeli state terrorism."
"It is taking advantage of its economic supremacy not to assist in the development of the countries of north Africa and the Middle East, but to impose its terms on trade and on their internal affairs."
"The report goes as far as to call on partner countries to implement policies for convergence with the euro, while pressing for the development of the private sector."
"Despite pronouncements to the contrary, Euro-Mediterranean relations were and remain unequally priced."
"They were and are a vehicle for intervention in the internal affairs of Mediterranean countries, in the aim of supporting the economic, military and political interests of the ?U. This policy will be stepped up given that, following enlargement, the ?U's attention is turning towards the Mediterranean."
"In voting against the report, the Communist Party of Greece is expressing its support for the peoples and their fight, which is the only road to progress."
". (SV) We Swedish Moderates are in favour of the report on the annual report on the MEDA 2000 programme."
"We believe however that, with its major problems in establishing a fixed budgetary framework, the EU cannot, in the current economic climate, take upon itself the increase in costs involved in this activity."
". (FR) With Mr Piétrasanta's report the European Parliament must express an opinion on the state of relations between Europe and its Mediterranean partners."
"This report raises the fundamental questions underlying the partnership and gives pertinent answers which I support, in particular the need to stress the political dimension of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership in order to foster democratisation and peace, support for Mediterranean civil societies, the systematic inclusion of the human rights issue in follow-up, and the establishment of a genuine Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly at the next EuroMed ministerial conference in Naples in December 2003."
"I shall vote in favour of this report in order to give strong backing to the inclusion of these objectives in the MEDA programme."
"But this programme alone is today insufficient to cover relations between the EU and its Mediterranean partners."
"No additional resources have in fact been provided to this day (for 2003 the MEDA regional funding plan will have EUR 32 million and the 'Euro-Mediterranean investment and partnership facility' EUR 25 million), and the discrepancy between Europe's financial effort for the ten new members and its commitment to the Mediterranean is spectacular, not to say scandalous: EUR 185 of aid per capita for the East, half a euro per head for the Mediterranean."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated pursuant to Article 137 (1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (PT) I voted for this excellent report."
"As everyone knows, the main aim of MEDA, which, in 1995 simplified and combined a disparate series of instruments, is 'to reform economic and social structures and mitigate any social or environmental consequences which may result from economic development' in the Mediterranean basin, in three areas: 1."
"The MEDA programme has therefore become the main component of financial cooperation in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership (through non-refundable aid from the Commission or through other instruments coordinated with the EIB)."
"The results achieved by the MEDA I programme and the first two years of MEDA II, however, are such as to indicate that this model of cooperation should be continued and even stepped up (as the rapporteur suggests), substantially for the same reasons that led in 2000 to this successful programme being extended and relaunched for five more years, as the best possible means of achieving the aims of successive European Councils - Lisbon (1992), Corfu (1994) and Essen (1994): to enhance the EU's Mediterranean policy, to enable the Mediterranean Basin to become an area of cooperation guaranteeing peace, security ..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (FR) The EU-USA agreements on judicial cooperation in criminal matters and extradition are entirely necessary, especially in the fight against terrorism."
"However, they raise for the first time the question of the interpretation of Articles 38 and 24 of the EU Treaty, introduced by the Treaty of Nice, concerning the conclusion of international agreements by the European Union in the fields of the second and third pillars."
"Those articles were drawn up and adopted with culpable negligence despite the warnings I gave in my counter-report on the Treaty of Nice."
"We are seeing the consequences of that today: the national parliaments used to have the right to ratify such international agreements, but they have lost that right today and the European Parliament for its part has gained no equivalent right."
"It is true that the States are now trying to find a national power of scrutiny by way of the 'constitutional reservation' that may enable them to go back to their national parliaments."
"But that is far from being a perfect solution."
"We see here the consequences of badly negotiated treaties."
"The Convention on the future of Europe ought to correct that and bring the national parliaments back into play."
"Unfortunately, it seems to want to go in the opposite direction."
". (PT) This is a matter of the utmost importance and one which should fundamentally fall within the competence of each individual country."
"For this very reason, it is unacceptable that the Council should have declassified the text of the two draft agreements with the USA, only one month before these, the first agreements in this sphere between the EU and a third country, were due to be signed."
"These agreements are all the more significant in political terms because they are being signed at a time when 'security' measures are being implemented that endanger citizens' rights, guarantees and freedoms and when the US is holding hundreds of people under arrest at its military base in Guantánamo, without having accused them or put them on trial, or when it demands that other States give it total immunity from the International Criminal Court."
"The current wording of the agreements raises some fundamental issues, such as extradition to a country which still applies the death penalty and which has legislation that in the name of the 'war on terrorism', breaches fundamental rights; personal data protection, applied retroactively, and a lack of control, specifically of the so-called joint investigation teams."
"Whilst criticising some aspects of the agreements' content, the EP's recommendation supports their broad thrust, and so we have voted against it."
"Even the debate on this issue, just a few days after the criminal invasion of Iraq by the British and American forces, constitutes provocation."
"Under this agreement, the ?U can hand the citizens of its Member States and their personal data over, with no strings attached, to the jurisdiction of the USA, the prosecuting authorities of which will do as they please far from any democratic control."
"Joint EU/USA investigating teams will operate uncontrolled in the ?U, in violation of national constitutions and domestic law."
"This is an agreement at the expense of the citizens of the Member States of the ?U. It does not result in any differentiation in the domestic law of the USA, such as the repeal of the death penalty or the discriminatory provisions in the 'patriotic law' which deny non-US citizens legal aid, changes to the legislation of states in the USA which are incompatible with European law, or an end to the inhumane detention of prisoners of war, including citizens of Member States of the EU in Guantánamo."
"We call on our peoples to organise mass demonstrations against a dangerous agreement which, on the pretext of combating terrorism, will escalate prosecutions against the grass-roots, anti-imperialist movement by extraditing the fighters at its vanguard to the USA, together with anyone in general whom the USA considers suspicious; to prevent the legalisation of uncontrolled activities by the US prosecuting authorities in the ?U and to stop their governments from ratifying any such agreement."
". (NL) In the past, countries did not extradite their own nationals."
"These days, the EU functions as a single state, with a number of guarantees in place to prevent people from being punished for something that is allowed in their own countries."
"Extraditions from the EU to other countries outside it go even further than that and are downright dangerous."
"This is certainly true for countries using a different penal system, such as the United States of America, where prisoners of war are locked up without any rights in camps that do not fall within the scope of American law and where the International Criminal Court is not recognised."
"It is a matter of some importance to us Europeans that capital punishment exists over there and that innocent suspects first need to admit their guilt before they can negotiate a reduction of their sentences."
"People living in Europe need to be protected from being subjected to that American system."
"Anyone who does not travel to that country of their own free will and on their own initiative must have the guarantee that nobody forces them to go there."
"This is why I reject the draft agreement on extradition and judicial cooperation, discussed in the Justice and Internal Affairs Council on 8 May."
"I support the rapporteur's attempts to at least take a stand against military courts of justice, against what is going on at Guantánamo, and against discrimination against European citizens, and I fully share his view that any future change to this agreement should not be made outside the normal, parliamentary procedure."
". (FR) While this agreement could have been a real step forward in the fight against serious crime and international terrorism, this Parliament believes its support should be made subject to extravagant conditions and to considerations that are humiliating for the United States."
"The reservations concerning the lack of democratic control or the requirement for a reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights seem almost fanciful in view of the serious accusations levelled against the United States."
"Is it some kind of joke when the report says that the judicial system of some US States does not offer the same level of guarantees that the European Court of Human Rights and EU measures seek to provide for EU Member States?"
"And what are we to make of the remarks about the untimely nature of an agreement with the United States when several European Union citizens are still being held at the US military base at Guantánamo Bay, quite unlawfully and without the slightest guarantee that they will receive a fair trial?"
"When otherworldliness reaches such proportions and produces such absurdities - how can terrorists be equated with ordinary prisoners under common law? - it is bordering on stupidity."
". (PT) I have voted against the report because I believe that the rapporteur has exceeded the competences conferred on the European Parliament by the Treaties, and is seeking, through interpretive methods with which I do not agree, to increase the number and the volume of dossiers that will be subject to consultation."
"In fact, my interpretation of Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union diverges from the one put forward in this report, and I believe that the words '... main aspects and... basic choices' of common foreign and security policy must not be understood to be 'practical agreements' and 'specific countries', however wide-ranging the agreements or however important our counterpart might be."
"The assumption that the silence of the law lays down a specific obligation for the Council and that this supposed specific obligation results in a general rule laying down the obligation to consult Parliament is an interpretation with which I clearly cannot agree."
"I believe that the attempt to impose the State model at Community level does not reflect the current State of the Union."
"There is no basis for attempting to give the European Parliament competences similar to those of a national Parliament."
"Most particularly, I regret the fact that the original proposal for a recommendation should have been replaced by quite aggressive initiatives, which do nothing to encourage the signing of the EU-US agreements that are the basis for this recommendation."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.30 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A5-0197/2003, by Mr Cunha, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and support schemes for producers of certain crops (COM(2003) 23 C5-0040/2003 2003/0006(CNS));"
"A5-0182/2003, by Mr Olsson, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000 (COM(2003) 23 C5-0041/2003 2003/0007(CNS));"

"A5-0175/2003, by Mr Souchet, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in dried fodder for the marketing years 2004/05 to 2007/08 (COM(2003) 23 C5-0044/2003 2003/0010(CNS));"
"A5-0183/2003, by Mr Bautista Ojeda, on behalf of the Committee on and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in rice (COM(2003) 23 C5-0043/2003 2003/0009(CNS));"
"A5-0177/2003, by Mrs Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a levy in the milk and milk-products sector (COM(2003) 23 C5-0046/2003 2003/0012(CNS));"
"A5-0181/2003, by Mrs Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (COM(2003) 23 C5-0045/2003 2003/0011(CNS));"
"A5-0189/2003, by Mrs Rodríguez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on multifunctional agriculture and the reform of the CAP (2003/2048(INI))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, my voice is not making it easy, but I shall try to speak clearly."
"In January, the Commission presented its legislative proposals for a new reform of the CAP."
"In addition to the significant adjustments proposed for some sectors, the proposal's main innovations can be seen in what is known as the decoupling and modulation of direct aid paid to producers."
"The aim of decoupling is to convert the current form of aid into a single payment per holding, which would be decoupled from the volumes produced."
"Farmers would then always receive this amount, regardless of what they might grow in future and they could even grow nothing, provided that they maintain the land in good farming conditions."
"Through modulation, the Commission is attempting to apply an aid reduction rate that would amount to 19% by 2012; around two-thirds of the appropriations thereby freed up would fund future reforms and around one-third would be reserved for strengthening the CAP's second pillar - rural development."
"Only farmers receiving less than EUR 5 000 per year would be exempt from this aid reduction."
"The proposal that is now being presented here in plenary was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the basis of a compromise proposal tabled by the rapporteur and negotiated with all the political groups."
"The essence of this compromise, which I hope will become the position of the European Parliament, is the following:"
"Firstly, to support only partial and gradual decoupling of direct aid, limited to the arable crop and male bovine sectors."
"Consequently, all remaining premiums would continue to be awarded on the basis of the current model; secondly, to support a much more limited form of modulation, of only 6% in the less-favoured regions and of 8% in other regions, since revenue generated in this way will go mainly towards strengthening the second pillar."
"Exemptions would also apply to farmers receiving less than EUR 7 500."
"By adopting this position, the European Parliament intends to send certain political messages."
"The first is that it unequivocally supports a reform of the CAP that makes it more rational from the economic point of view, that will make it easier to implement in an enlarged European Union and which helps to unblock negotiations in the World Trade Organisation."
"The second message is that changes of this nature must be undertaken prudently and realistically."
"In fact, our position is that aid totally decoupled from production as proposed by the Commission is an interesting model in theory, but poses risks in its practical application and ignores the reality of European farming, the great instability of the markets, which still need border management and protection instruments, and the extremely heterogeneous nature of European farming, in which there are huge differences in income levels and degrees of competitiveness and, consequently, greatly differing effects on the implementation of a decoupled payment scheme."
"The third political message is that the risks of production being abandoned following the introduction of a decoupled aid scheme are particularly serious in the outermost less-favoured regions, which have the lowest levels of productivity and which are therefore the least competitive."
"This is why Parliament has proposed a lower rate of modulation for these regions, why no decoupled scheme would apply to the outermost regions and why the particular situation of all of these weaker regions would be taken into account, in order to continue to ensure that farmers have alternative means of production."
"Fourthly, Parliament also wishes to state that there is no justification, at this stage, for deciding on such a high rate for reducing aid in order to fund future CAP reforms, since we do not yet know either the costs or the timetable of these reforms."
"Fifthly, I also wish to emphasise Parliament's commitment to playing a role in strengthening the second pillar of the CAP, particularly by funding new actions to guarantee food safety and quality."
"Lastly, it is also worth recalling the proposal that, from 2007, the future decoupled aid scheme will no longer be based on historical reference criteria and will from then be based on two main criteria: the surface area and employment situation of each holding."
"To conclude, the European Parliament is thereby making its contribution to adapting the CAP to the new needs and realities that are emerging, but is doing so in a way that avoids or at least minimises the risks of production being abandoned, of increased unemployment and of creating further serious imbalances in some farm schemes, particularly in the less-favoured and outermost regions."
"I therefore hope that the Council of Agriculture Ministers, the body responsible for taking the final decision, shares these concerns of Parliament's and forces the Commission to amend its proposal in the negotiations that are now underway."
". (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, there are few things that will be as important in the world of the future as sustainable and environmentally friendly agriculture."
"From the start, I have supported Mr Fischler's far-sighted ideas about coming up with proposals as to how we are to reform European agricultural policy."
"Unfortunately, these ideas have deteriorated and are still in the process of deteriorating."
"I believe it was a deterioration when President Chirac and Chancellor Schröder agreed upon a ceiling which was to have been applied, rather, as a floor for the costs of agricultural policy."
"I have to acknowledge, unfortunately, that, in my view, what we have arrived at here in Parliament does not improve the proposal but, instead, exacerbates it."
"I am concerned that, when they meet, the ministers too will make it still worse."
"Not even European farmers seem to understand what is in their own best interests."
"Opposition to the Commission's proposal for agricultural reform among farmers, among ourselves in the European Parliament and among agricultural ministers must have to do with their not wishing to see the broader context."
"I do not intend to talk about the details of any report, but I intend to concentrate precisely on the bigger picture in my speech."
"We must remember that most of the world's food is produced at costs that are not covered by today's low prices on the world market."
"Most farmers in industrialised countries therefore require aid if they are to be able to produce food, and farmers in the developing countries need to be paid more."
"Aid for agricultural production in the industrialised countries increases production, and the surpluses are exported with the help of subsidies."
"That reduces prices on the world market."
"We must change the systems in order to create a healthy world market."
"It should be possible for prices on the world market to rise to a level that enables most farmers to produce food, and it is therefore quite obvious that all forms of aid that distort trade must be done away with."
"The EU cannot change this situation by itself but, together with the United States, we should be able to do a lot in this area."
"The negotiations within the WTO and the Commission's proposal for agricultural reform are steps in the right direction in this connection."
"We must remember, however, that the world is not quite as simple as that."
"Even with fair prices on the world market, large areas of small-scale European agriculture would still not be competitive."
"We have tough requirements in terms of the environment and animal welfare."
"We insist upon food safety and quality."
"We demand worker protection."
"We wish to conserve the cultivated landscape and natural and cultural environments, and we want to improve social conditions in the countryside."
"The market could in theory pay for account to be taken of values such as quality."
"Our requirements could be financed through direct aid from society and, more specifically, from the EU when it came, especially, to matters of collective benefit."
"The route from high subsidies and collapsed prices on the world market to healthy trade and pricing must, however, be achieved via a change to the way in which aid is at present provided, that is to say through a decoupling of aid from production."
"That is where my report on rural development comes in."
"Unfortunately, there was too little money when the Commission drafted its proposal."
"Thanks to helpful and kind-hearted fellow MEPs in Parliament, I have obtained a little money from Mr Cunha and a certain amount of money from Mrs Jeggle and have thus been able to add a little more for rural development."
"That is because the proposed decoupling puts less favoured areas at most risk, and we must deal with the risks as quickly as possible."
"I believe that Parliament has come up with an improvement where that matter is concerned."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if, in the EU, we do not in good time modernise our arsenal of aid to agriculture - that is to say, by moving the aid from the Blue to the Green Box, or however one wants to put it - the WTO negotiations may, if they are to lead to any result that is encouraging in a global perspective, forcibly divest us of the weapons we use to protect European agriculture and the European agricultural model."
"There would then be nothing for us to have recourse to."
"Prevention is better than cure."
"That is something we Europeans should also appreciate."
"When they meet for negotiations next week, the agricultural ministers will hopefully realise that a poor decision, or no decision at all, may in actual fact lead to a disaster for farmers, the countryside and also consumers who want to see good food in Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I am rapporteur on two counts, I will begin, if I may, by presenting the report on reform of the common organisation of the market in cereals, which our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted by a very large majority, and I will then go on to present my second report, on reform of the common organisation of the market in dried fodder, which was also adopted by a very large majority."
"Let us begin, then, with the common organisation of the market in cereals."
"In its proposed reform, the Commission departs completely from the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, advocating the dismantling of all the vital components of the COM."
"What are the Commission's proposals, in fact?"
"First, a reduction, a further reduction I should say, in the intervention price, taking it to a price below the cost of production, an approach that is both uneconomic and unsustainable."
"Then, the abolition of monthly increments. Then, the abolition of intervention for rye, the abolition of the minimum price for starch potatoes and the abolition of production refunds for starch."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development considered this dismantling of the oldest and most emblematic of the COMs to be neither timely nor justified."
"On the intervention price, as rapporteur I had proposed that account be taken of inflation, which is 25.5% since the 1992 reform, bringing the effective decline in internal prices for cereals in real terms to 56%."
"I do not need to remind you that the intervention price for cereals is the earnings index for hundreds of thousands of farmers."
"Our committee did not want a further reduction, for which there is no justification, not even the trend in world prices, which the Commission itself believes must rise in the years ahead."
"The zero price reduction our committee recommends requires no compensation and there is therefore no need for degression."
"So far as the monthly increments are concerned, our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was anxious to point out that these are intended to cover a real economic and financial cost, namely the cost of storage, including the modernisation of silos and bringing them up to standard, especially in the matter of security, and that their abolition would be equivalent to a further reduction in the intervention price, without compensation."
"Consistency therefore required that the Commission's two proposals, concerning the intervention price and the monthly increments, be treated in the same way."
"For rye, where there is a real problem of surpluses, we propose cutting the amounts allocated for intervention so that cultivation of this cereal can in future be concentrated in areas where it is the last resort before leaving the land fallow and where there is no profitable alternative."
"As to starch and potato starch, Commissioner, we find the Commission's determination to abolish the schemes that enable European industry to compete against imports on equal terms hard to understand."
"It is a gift to third-country starch producers, with the European Union receiving nothing in return."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's proposals therefore differ from the negative measures placed on the table by the Commission, which do not seem to us to give the cereals sector any real prospects of development."
"I will turn now, if I may, to the common organisation of the market in dried fodder."
"For my part, I had never before seen an explanatory memorandum to a Commission proposal based on so weak an argument."
"Relying in fact on an outdated comment in a Court of Auditors report, the executive - the Commission - intended purely and simply to abolish this common organisation of the market from the 2008-2009 marketing year on the grounds that, and I quote the Court of Auditors report, 'production relies on the use of fossil fuel for dehydrating and, in some Member States, on the use of irrigation'."
"How casual and offhand can you be, Commissioner, to threaten the future of an entire industry on such a slender basis?"
"And not just any industry, but one which provides 15% of the fodder protein produced in the Community, an industry of 150 000 producers and 500 000 hectares, an industry whose dehydrating sector consists of 350 fodder processing and packaging units, most of which are farmer-owned cooperatives providing no less than 15 000 jobs."
"Have you calculated, Commissioner, the amount of public rural development budgets that would have to be mobilised to preserve the rural activity and jobs that would be destroyed by this industry's euthanasia?"
"Our Committee on Agriculture therefore had no difficulty in realising that, given the Union's fodder protein deficit, it would be perfectly irresponsible to abolish aid for dried fodder."
"If our Parliament adopts the report that its Committee on Agriculture is laying before it, it will be clearly reaffirming the position it previously adopted in the Stevenson report, which called on the Commission to quickly find and put in place the necessary means for reducing this very serious handicap, this strategic dependence, this monstrous vegetable protein deficit, which amounts to more than 75% of our needs."
"I recall that the Americans, for their part, had no compunction or hesitation, after the Blair House Agreements, about introducing direct aid for soya, and the WTO did not object."
"So why shouldn't we do the same?"
"Our Committee on Agriculture also considered that the environmental balance in dried fodder could in no way be limited to a vague and unimaginative consideration of fossil fuel consumption."
"If all economic activities that consume fossil fuels were banned, you would have come to Brussels on foot, Commissioner."
"Alfalfa, on the other hand, which accounts for over 80% of the Union's dried fodder production, has exceptional qualities in two vital fields - soil renewal and savings on phytosanitary products."
"Moreover, there are no genetically-modified varieties of alfalfa in Europe."
"This crop, which ensures that fodder derived from it is fully traceable, can therefore replace imports that raise a host of GMO issues."
"As to dehydration, the amount of fossil energy used has already been greatly reduced over the past few years. There is still room for improvement, it is true."
"We therefore propose, in agreement with the sector, that 'contracts for progress' be concluded, whereby dehydration units will be able to commit to improving their efficiency, their yield, their energy balance."
"It seems to us to be more constructive to put schemes in place for this sector with environmental conditions attached than to abolish aid to them completely."
"Finally, our Committee felt that the sector was capable of making further agronomic and environmental progress."
"That is why we are proposing the creation of a research fund financed from a small levy on aids granted to the sector."
"These seem to us, Mr President, Commissioner, the positive directions that the executive - the Commission - ought to take in order to offer a particularly sensitive and strategic sector quite a different prospect than the destruction, without more ado, of a common organisation of the market, which up until now has managed to preserve one of the Union's few sources of vegetable protein."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when, at the beginning of this year, the Commission's legislative proposals on the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 and the timetable for them were put before us, we were under considerable pressure of time."
"Parliament was meant to produce its positions by this week."
"The task before us seemed almost beyond our capacities."
"Few of us dared to believe that we would manage it."
"As the rapporteur responsible for the reports on the dairy sector levy and on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products, I can say, with a great deal of satisfaction, that we have done it, and done it together."
"Cooperation at an early stage across group boundaries, which was our experience particularly with the milk sector, has finally paid off."
"From the very outset, I was able, in the drafts of my reports, to take into account the concerns of my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, as well as those of the other groups, which meant that there was a manageable number of amendments in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and that the result that you have before you is coherent and consistent."
"Finally, the small number of amendments tabled in the plenary is evidence of general agreement, which was also reflected in the outstanding voting results in the Agriculture Committee."
"This is a splendid piece of work, for which I would like to thank most warmly all those Members of this House who have worked with me with this end in mind, showing goodwill, expertise and a willingness to compromise."
"I also wish to thank the Committee's secretariat, which was a valued and ever-reliable support to me in my task as it did its coordinating work behind the scenes."
"The Commission has presented a package of legislation on the dairy sector, and it is one that we very much welcome, including as it does such measures as the retention of the milk quota up to 2015."
"In order, though, to achieve its goal of bringing the dairy sector into line with WTO requirements, the Commission is offering instruments which - taken as a whole - are highly problematic: further price reductions, quotas raised still further, and the decoupling of milk production from milk premiums."
"What would be the consequences of such a course of action?"
"If the massive price reductions were implemented as planned hand in hand with extended quotas, the milk quota system would in fact be nullified."
"In particular, small and medium-sized rural dairies in disadvantaged areas would find it practically impossible to cope with the competition, at which point the decoupling of the sector would do the rest, so that milk production would move very rapidly from grassland and disadvantaged areas to what is termed prime land."
"The adverse structural, social and environmental consequences in the areas affected could not then be ignored."
"In order to make dairy farming in the EU more competitive and more efficient, the Commission is frustrating, by means of its proposals, its own structural and rural development policies."
"It makes no sense, though, to destroy today businesses and jobs, especially in disadvantaged, structurally weak areas, whether this be done out of anticipatory obedience to the WTO or, conceivably, for ideological reasons, since we will, tomorrow, have to replace or create anew these jobs, with a great deal of effort and expense to public funds, using rural development programmes to do it?"
"The need for a gradual transition if such conflicting objectives are to be avoided in this area is therefore plain to see."
"With the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, then, I have taken another approach."
"We aim to maintain sustainable and extensive production of milk, especially on grassland."
"What is clear is that, if dairy farming dies out on grassland and in disadvantaged areas, a great deal of public effort will be needed to maintain the landscape in the state that we all know today, as a valued place in which to relax and go on holiday."
"This makes the retention of the milk quota system until 2015 right and vital, and - as we want to make reliable policies - let there be no bringing forward of what was decided under Agenda 2000."
"The price reductions decided on in Agenda 2000, some of which have already been implemented, have already given us more room to manoeuvre in the WTO."
"This room to manoeuvre was originally to have been made use of in the negotiations."
"If the outcome of those negotiations is that further price reductions really are necessary, my reports will give an indication of what further price reductions might be like."
"In order to keep the dairy and cereals sectors on a par - at least to some extent - we are calling for a higher level of compensation for price reductions."
"The 50 cents proposed are definitely inadequate."
"The WTO's argument is irrelevant to the extension of quotas unless the Commission were to have as its declared objective the use of these measures to exert renewed pressure on prices."
"No representative of the Commission, though, has put it to me in these terms, so we urge that we meet the quota-hungry Member States halfway on this by introducing a flexible system."
"This means a 'yes' to increased quotas, but it must be dependent on the market situation."
"We propose that a gradual approach be taken to decoupling."
"At this point in time, there should be none. The Agriculture Committee proposes that this be reconsidered in 2008, when experience will have been gained of decoupling, re-coupling, or simplification in other sectors."
"We will then be able to have some idea of the likely effects and consequences and fashion the instrument accordingly."
"It is important, as regards both the milk reports, that a similarly good voting result should be achieved in the plenary as in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Let us join together in sending a clear signal to the Council and the Commission. Sustainable land use can take the place of much environmental, social and regional policy."
"The European Union is committed to extensive and sustainable agriculture, at the heart of which, in many of Europe's regions, is the dairy industry."
"Mr President, Commissioner, last June you presented us with a document on reform of the CAP which established the objectives which this reform should pursue: food quality and safety, the strengthening of rural development and more extensive production methods which are compatible with the environment."
"Nobody could oppose these objectives, but today we have to tell you that the instruments you wish to use are not only mistaken, because they are not valid in terms of achieving the proposed objectives, but that, most seriously, they move in the opposite direction."
"One of the key elements of your reform - the decoupling of subsidies - may have adverse effects if we do not manage to modify it."
"The decoupling proposed to us for certain sectors as an instrument capable of creating a new model for agricultural policy is not viable if you maintain the criterion of historical references in order to set the decoupled aid by farm."
"The direct aid, as laid out, corresponds to the logic of the market and is directly linked to quantities produced and the yields allocated."
"According to the information that you yourself have provided, in 2001 5% of European farmers received 50% of the direct subsidies."
"You cannot ask us to accept the validity of this great imbalance in the distribution of aid in order to support the implementation of a new CAP."
"In the herbaceous sector, a model in which you propose total decoupling, 3% of farms receive 40% of the support."
"If we work on that basis, if we allow that situation to continue, Commissioner, we would be changing everything so that everything can stay the same."
"Please allow me once again to ask you to change the criteria for allocating decoupled aid; use multifunctional criteria in order to establish genuine multifunctional aid by farm."
"Agricultural multifunctionality means that agriculture contributes to the maintenance of the rural population, creating jobs."
"It also helps to preserve the environment, preventing depopulation and desertification of our territory."
"You should therefore introduce the criterion of territory, the criterion of agricultural surface area, the criterion of employment generated and of the environmental benefits contributed by the farm and then we will be in a position to talk about genuine multifunctional aid."
"Of a genuine decoupling of aid to production, but of a genuine coupling of aid to producers and their farms."
"You yourself recognise that this proposed decoupling will create serious problems for many small and medium-sized farms, in less favoured and less productive areas."
"If that is the case, change it, Commissioner, because otherwise we will be banishing many of the European Union's small and medium-sized farms from the agricultural system."
"Another key element of this reform is modulation."
"In June I applauded and supported it."
"Let us reinforce rural development by means of significant modulation, transferring funds from the first pillar to the second pillar."
"What is now proposed to us following the budgetary Council in Brussels on 24 and 25 October - where the Community budget was cut - is that just 6% of the modulation should go to rural development, leaving the rest to fund sectoral reforms in the first pillar."
"It is true, as you say, that this is a Council agreement and that the Council therefore has political responsibility for it, as do those people who, like my government, applauded it and who lied to the farmers, telling them that they would guarantee sufficient budget until 2013."
"That is not true."
"In 2008 there will be problems, as you have acknowledged."
"I would ask you to be a little more rebellious, to make a little more effort, if you really believe that rural development has to be strengthened in order to create a more sustainable and fairer CAP."
"I say no to a linear modulation, which would mean that the cut in direct aid would affect all farmers equally in order to fund the budgetary gaps in the Brussels agreement."
"And I say no to a modulation which is the same regardless of differences between favoured and less favoured areas, and which does not take account of the farmers' incomes."
"And I say no to dealing with the person who receives EUR 5 000 in the same way as the person who receives EUR 50 000 or more."
"That is not fair, Commissioner."
"For all these reasons, I would ask you, please, to show flexibility, not to expel the small and medium-sized farms from the market."
"Those smaller farms guarantee the viability of a rural framework which take up more than 80% of European rural territory."
"This reform, essentially, does not provide cohesion, it does not contribute more social justice to an agricultural policy which is in great need of it."
"I would ask you to reflect and to modify this proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Greek Government took over the Council Presidency on 1 January 2003, the reform of the common agricultural policy was one of its focal points."
"Thus, negotiations to close this dossier were one of the main objectives of the Greek Presidency, in cooperation of course with the European Commission and the European Parliament."
"Our Council discussed the Commission's proposals at its meetings in February, March and April on the basis of the Presidency's questionnaires, which focused on reform issues of particular importance."
"The Presidency drew positive conclusions from this procedure and decided to give impetus to the negotiations by creating a High Level Group."
"The role of this group was mainly to prepare the crucial summit of Council ministers in June."
"The push towards reaching an agreement was reinforced at the Council on 26 and 27 May, when Commissioner Fischler and I met each minister in order to identify basic problems and possible solutions and reach an honest compromise."
"Both the Commissioner and I found to our satisfaction that we have the support of the majority of ministers for our timetable."
"This majority is convinced that, provided that we achieve the right mixture in the content of the dossier, we shall be able to take decisions before the end of the Greek Presidency, in other words at the June Council."
"I should like to point out to Parliament that the Ministers for Agriculture of the 10 new states participated in the tripartite consultations."
"The European Parliament is a particularly important factor in the procedure to formulate the future common agricultural policy."
"Your resolution in November 2002 on the Commission communication gave the Commission important pointers for the orientation of its legislative proposals."
"The opinion of the European Parliament on the Commission's legislative proposals for the reform of the CAP is exceptionally important and is awaited by all with keen interest."
"I should like at this point to thank all the rapporteurs, the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and, of course, all the members of the Committee on Agriculture, who managed in such a short space of time to complete their efforts and vote on the truly interesting reports on the Commission's package of proposals."
"This consistency on the part of the European Parliament, and especially the Agriculture Committee, will allow the House to give its opinion on the European Commission's proposals in good time, thereby enabling our Council to pursue an honest and sincere compromise."
"This compromise will not ignore the European agricultural model based on family holdings or the multifunctionality of agriculture or, of course, the needs of less favoured areas, as confirmed by the European Council in Brussels in October 2002."
"Allow me now to refer to the most important issues in our overall endeavour."
"The first is decoupling."
"This is without doubt the core of reform. This is what is causing the greatest difficulty in finding a commonly accepted solution."
"The approaches to this vary between the Member States, with the consequence that, so far, material reservations have been expressed on a series of individual elements."
"One initial issue is the entry into force of the system."
"The view expressed by certain members of our Council with so-called partial decoupling is also particularly important."
"Although this sort of approach could, in principle, constitute one element of a compromise, we must bear in mind that various interpretations of differing content are given to the term partial decoupling."
"There are also Member States who have expressed themselves in favour of the derogation from decoupling for certain products while, on the other hand, other Member States have come out in favour of the integration of more products, in order to avoid competitive phenomena between the productive sectors."
"The opinion of the European Parliament on this crucial issue will, I hope, help us find a satisfactory solution."
"Second issue: modulation."
"Most Member States have expressed reservations as to the franchise level of EUR 5 000 for the derogation from the obligation to gradually reduce support, whereas others wish for an intermediate scale to be provided for, which will allow for the more progressive application of gradual reductions on the larger and more competitive holdings."
"Other issues on which the views of the Member States diverge are the need to safeguard small and medium-sized producers, the application of principles of social justice and the wish for more straightforward administration on farm holdings."
"We must not forget that the arrangements also aim to save resources, which will be used to fund future reforms of the common organisation of the markets."
"In other words, because agricultural resources are specific, any increase in the franchise or any other similar arrangement must not jeopardise either the funding of future reforms in dairy products, sugar or Mediterranean products or the financial ceiling."
"The third issue is cross-compliance."
"Almost all the Member States take a positive position on this measure in principle."
"The problem lies in the fact that this endeavour is considered to involve an excessive administrative and financial cost, which is disproportionately high in relation to the objective pursued."
"Consequently, our efforts must tend towards finding ways which will allow demands to be restricted to the absolutely necessary, and making provision for greater flexibility in the Member States, with the possible gradual application of the proposed system."
"Ladies and gentlemen, various measures have been proposed within the framework of the Community policy on rural development, in the aim of responding better to the concerns of society as regards environmental protection, compliance with Community standards in the agricultural sector, improving the conditions in which animals are kept and higher food specification standards."
"These ideas on the part of the Commission have attracted a great deal of support."
"It became clear during the various stages of discussion of the new measures that the reform of the common agricultural policy must be the starting point for simplifying the Community farming development policy."
"At sectoral level, the European Commission's proposals need improving so that the Council can adopt them within the framework of an overall package."
"Finally, the reform of the common agricultural policy must include specific measures for young farmers, who represent the future of European farming, and specific arrangements for disadvantaged, isolated and problem areas of the European Union currently threatened with abandonment."
"I should like now to refer to the financial aspects of the proposals for the reform of the common agricultural policy. Discussions in the Council have focused on the anticipated financial impact of the proposed market measures and the financial aspects of the main elements of the reform proposals from linked payments, gradual reduction and modulation."
"The Commission's expenditure forecasts show that the modulation and gradual reduction measures are required in order to safeguard compliance with the financial ceilings set by the summit in Brussels in October 2002."
"As the presidency, we shall endeavour to ensure that the solutions adopted are within the framework of the financial frameworks decided for the European Union budget."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, our Council has accepted that the present economic climate is such that we need to go one step further in adjusting the common agricultural policy."
"We all need to recognise that the common agricultural policy was never static and that it has always responded to changing circumstances by adjusting existing and creating new means."
"These decisions have always been founded on the Community method, which means cooperation between the institutions and compromise between the Member States within the framework of the Council."
"Today we are at a crucial stage in the overall process."
"With pragmatism and good will, which have always been demonstrated both by the institutions and the Member States, I am optimistic that we shall be able to reach political agreement over coming weeks."
"I should like to assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that the Council, like the citizens of Europe, awaits the views of the European Parliament with the keenest interest."
". (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, the reports by Mr Bautista Ojeda, Mr Cunha, Mrs Jeggle, Mr Olsson, Mrs Rodríguez Ramos, and Mr Souchet, as well as the proposals by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are, in my view, truly impressive evidence of the commitment with which Parliament intends to tackle the pressing challenges facing European agriculture and the future of the common agricultural policy."
"For that, I wish to extend to you all my warmest thanks."
"I do think that there is a large degree of unanimity among Parliament, the Commission and the Member States when it comes to analysing the problem and defining our general objectives."
"There is no doubt that this consensus is founded on the common denominator of the model of multifunctional and sustainable agriculture, the maintenance of which is of prime concern to all of us."
"This model is our programme."
"If the common agricultural policy is to claim to be sustainable, it must be consistently guided by economic, social and environmental objectives."
"If we measure these objectives against the reality, the extent of what still remains to be done becomes apparent."
"The social function of agriculture, the general economic framework, the stability of international trade relations, the maintenance of the environment, the preservation of cultural landscapes and, above all, the production of high-quality, safe food - all these things, taken together, are the challenges that we must overcome in the interests of farmers and in the interests of all Europe's other citizens."
"It is these factors that underlie the Commission's proposals for reform, which are being debated here today."
"We want to adapt market management mechanisms to future conditions of supply and demand, in order to avert crises before they develop."
"We want to make direct payments that are compatible with the market and with our international trading obligations."
"We have to offer farmers the legitimate expectation of adequate payments and determine the amounts paid in individual cases by reference to historic levels of support."
"The expectations of present-day society cannot be ignored; we have to tie the direct payments to criteria measuring the protection of the environment and of animals, the safety of food and safety at work."
"We want to facilitate uniformly productive farming and see cultural landscapes preserved by means of agricultural activity rather than through any other kind."
"To the instruments of rural development policy, we want to add elements guaranteeing quality and protecting animals."
"We are obliged to introduce degression in order to secure finance for new reforms, and modulation can help to develop rural development policy."
"Last but not least, we do not want our reforms to lose sight of the need for cohesion."
"In listing these elements, I am treading upon the ground that is, to a substantial extent, common to all of us."
"I do not want to deny, though, that there are differences - some of them major ones - as regards the assessment of the situation and the choice of the appropriate instruments."
"I am of course aware that we still have some way to go before we reach agreement."
"As the President of the Agriculture Council said, however, this is for us the way forward, both in Parliament and in the Council of Agriculture Ministers."
"Looking at the specific elements in the Cunha report, I have to acknowledge that it contains much food for thought, and I also thank Mr Cunha for his clear affirmation of the need for reform."
"I, too, am sympathetic to preferential treatment for disadvantaged areas, but I wish neither to repudiate nor to endorse the idea that applying different modulation rates is the most appropriate means of doing so."
"There are also reasonable arguments to be adduced in favour of not granting farm income payments for certain vulnerable production sectors such as the keeping of suckler cows, sheep or goats, not least the maintenance of agricultural production in problem areas."
"We do, though, have to consider the drawbacks of such a course of action, which includes such things as the market-distorting effect of coupled aid, or the constraints that prevent farmers from doing the most economically sensible thing for their businesses."
"There is sound reasoning, too, behind the idea of excluding fruit and vegetables from the land eligible for support, yet we also have to ensure that we do not, overall, go so far as to risk losing the advantages of decoupled aid."
"In the Olsson report and the Committee on Agriculture's amendments to it, I admire Members' ambitious visions of the further development of rural areas."
"I agree entirely with Mr Olsson that we should all make the effort to avoid the proposals being watered down."
"This makes me sceptical about the large number of proposed amendments, and also about their scope."
"In my view, programme packages put together on the basis of Regulation 1257 should not be wholly dismantled halfway through the programming period."
"I might add that the existing Budget framework does not permit fundamental changes to the amounts and rates of aid."
"Ultimately, the Commission also has to take care that the whole package should retain its coherence."
"The same can be said of the rules for state aid and the regulations of the Structural Funds."
"We should not forget that the great debate on the future of structural policy still lies before us."
"When the Commission presents the third cohesion report at the end of this year, it will also be putting forward proposals for the new, post-2006 structural policy."
"This brings me to the reports on the market regulations, and I would like to start with the Souchet report on cereals and starch."
"We have learned from the experience of recent years that, in Agenda 2000, we took too little account of market development."
"Our analysis of long-term prospects gives very clear indications that, without further changes to market support, the EU's cereals producers will be unable to find adequate markets for their produce."
"That, at the end of the day, is what counts."
"This dilemma is made even more acute by changes in the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar."
"It is for that reason that we must regrettably cut intervention prices by 5% as scheduled, and stop increasing them on a monthly basis."
"As is well known, this still involves a number of specific problems - with rye, for example, intervention stocks of which have increased to 5.3 million tonnes, equivalent to more than the harvest for a normal year."
"This state of affairs, already unsustainable, may well get even worse after enlargement in 2004."
"Responsibility for these structural surpluses lies primarily with the intervention mechanism, and so we should do away with the problem for good, rather than - as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is proposing - fixing our sights on a partial solution in the form of the introduction of national indicative maximum quantities."
"As I see it, there is no alternative to abolishing intervention for rye."
"From the point of view of economic principle, the retention of production refunds in the starch sector is no longer necessary, as market prices will correspond to those on the global market."
"Any minimum price for starch potatoes are made questionable by measures in the cereals sector, with which it competes."
"Moreover, the retention of a 50% coupled premium will provide sufficient economic incentive to grow starch potatoes."
"Turning to dried fodder, I would like, in order that the Commission's position be better understood, to remind you of the trenchant criticism levelled at these rules by independent studies and the Court of Auditors' report, on the grounds of adverse effects on the environment."
"There is no doubt that the amendments aimed at using aid rules to promote technical progress, in order, in particular, to minimise energy consumption, are of interest, but I ask myself whether it really does make sense to do something of this sort within the framework of market support measures."
"Would the rural development programmes not be a better framework for such a scheme?"
"In view of the social, economic and environmental significance of the rice sector, I have no wish to question the need for a market regulation on rice, but there is no getting away from the need for radical reform, without which, we would end up with enormous intervention stocks, which - quite apart from the resultant cost to the Community budget - we would be unable to sell."
"I am glad that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development shares this view in principle and supports the essence of the Commission's proposals for dealing with this."
"A number of your amendments, such as the increase of import volumes and the obligatory price refund, have my complete support."
"As for your other proposals, I support their general tendency, but not the form of words you have chosen."
"I am convinced, though, that the guidance you have given me will help with the final negotiations in the Council."
"As regards import rules, any change to the bound customs duties on rice would have to be negotiated under Article 28 of GATT."
"For that to happen, the Council would, ultimately, have to give the Commission a mandate to conduct negotiations on the subject."
"In addition, as I understand it, import duties for rough rice should be checked separately."
"If, however, a permanent intervention mechanism for rice were to be retained - albeit only at the level of EUR 150 per tonne - that would prove very expensive."
"I do, though, have an open mind as regards testing a standard mechanism at a price level that is compatible with the conditions expected on the markets and that prevents a renewed increase in stocks."
"This brings me to the last two reports - Mrs Jeggle's - on market regulation."
"I note that the members of the Committee recommend the extension of the rules on milk quotas until 2015, whilst taking a critical view of the bringing forward of price cuts under Agenda 2000 from 2005 to 2004, as well as of other cuts in intervention prices and the limit on the intervention volume for butter."
"I am convinced, however, that these steps are needed in order to make the EU's milk sector more competitive."
"Being the world's largest exporter of dairy products, we also have to allow developments on global markets, and discussions in the WTO, to influence our decisions."
"It is evident that the 1% increase in the milk quota in both 2007 and 2008 is another sensitive issue."
"Independent studies have shown that increased consumption means that the markets are able to cope with these additional quantities."
"I am therefore convinced that this proposal makes sense."
"If, however, you want first to wait for the changes to happen, the Commission will not stand in the way of a discussion on the subject."
"I am sceptical, though, about the proposals for granting higher support payments, increasing them in disadvantaged areas, differentiating on the basis of quality standards or fixing prices in line with the costs of labour and production."
"I do, however, have an open mind when it comes to the amendments on the position of those who market their goods directly and the consideration of the question of to what extent the Member States might add part of the transferred quotas to their national reserves."
"I share the general view of the Committee's members that the milk sector must remain profitable and that producers' incomes must be safeguarded."
"I can also assure you that I will give careful consideration to all the proposals you have made."
"Finally, let me turn to Mrs Rodríguez Ramos' own-initiative report on multifunctional agriculture and reform of the CAP."
"You have said, Mrs Rodríguez Ramos, that you cannot bring yourself to oppose the objectives of reform, and that is quite something."
"We all want to build up the rural environment, especially in disadvantaged areas, and this is what the budget funds allocated, the use of sustainability as a guiding principle, and the payment of farmers for the performance of social services, are all about."
"It goes without saying that we have to apply funds in the most effective way, in the way most suited to the end in mind, but we also have to account to the taxpayer for this."
"Our concept of rural development and the use of modulation to strengthen it are tangible steps towards the achievement of the objectives you have set out."
"This is a more than adequate reward for agriculture's multifunctional nature."
"What you are demanding is a massive redistribution of aid funds, and I cannot agree to it."
"I am not convinced that the system would thereby, and automatically, be made more just, but I do understand that we, as a matter of necessity, have to give special consideration to cohesion; that is why we have included an element of cohesion in the choice of the allocation key of the additional rural development resources that will be available in future, and that must be retained."
"All in all, I would like to thank you most warmly for all that you have done, and will add that I look forward with eager anticipation to the forthcoming contributions."
"I will be happy to reply to your questions at the end of the debate."
"Mr President, the Commission's goals are laudable and certainly comprehensible in a macroeconomic framework, but it is hard to support them."
"The Commission advocates greater price competitiveness, but also respect for the demands of society, in other words, sustainability and quality."
"We need to ask ourselves how European farmers are going to manage to meet the demands of society, which is calling for extremely rigid rules on production methods, guarantees, food security and so forth, at a time when they are being forced to reduce prices and keep costs down if they are to continue to be competitive on world markets."
"The Commission advocates simplification."
"In my opinion, an analysis of the proposals reveals that these are complex measures which will increase rather than reduce bureaucracy."
"Just one element of the proposals - the system of rights in respect of decoupling - suffices to make it clear by exactly how much bureaucracy will increase costs for our farms."
"I hold a pessimistic view - and I sincerely hope I am wrong - which can be broken down into three very simple points."
"Firstly, the proposal to reduce prices, together with decoupling, will lead to large-scale abandoning of production in many regions and many sectors, which will speed up structural changes and cause an exodus from rural areas."
"In addition to the impact on farms, decoupling will result in the dismantling of the agrifood chain, threatening jobs and having a severe impact on farming cooperatives."
"Secondly, the European market will be strongly influenced by the main world exporters, which, in our view, will certainly not be the developing countries."
"Thirdly, the only new measures that will be adopted to help farmers implement more stringent rules and safeguard quality will have to be financed by the farmers themselves through cuts in support."
"In view of this, I do not know how it is possible to endorse reform."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the amendments voted on in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - something like eight hundred of them - have made plain how controversial the Commission's proposals on the future of the common agricultural policy for Europe are."
"The spectrum extends from outright rejection to qualified approval."
"Despite that, we have managed to draw up a compromise that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was able to adopt; this entailed a feat of strength the like of which has never before been seen, although it must be conceded that this was done under great pressure of time. This compromise represents, as a German weekly periodical puts it, a respectable staging-post on the road to an agricultural policy that will take us up to 2013."
"The imminent WTO negotiations, the soon-to-be-accomplished enlargement of the EU, and a mandate to review Agenda 2000 - these were the constraints upon the Commission when, in January 2003 and at the Council's behest, it presented Parliament with its proposals for its consideration."
"If it is the case that, in the reports now being put to the vote in this House, much has been toned down, much added, and a certain amount rejected as currently impracticable, then that has, in the final analysis, happened under pressure from those who work in agriculture, whom it is our function to represent."
"Many critics worked on the assumption that, just as opposing views on the proposals were to be found in the Council, it would not be possible, at the present time, for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to come up with a workable solution."
"It may be that the Council had been covertly hoping that Parliament - because it was unable to do so or, above all, because of pressure of time - would not come to any decision, so that it would be this House, rather than the Council, that would be able to put the brakes on an agricultural reform that is much needed."
"I can tell the Ministers of Agriculture that they are way off the mark."
"Whatever the result of Thursday's vote may be, it will not be binding, as agriculture is still not yet subject to codecision, a situation which, it is to be hoped, will soon change."
"The result of this vote will, however, send a signal and impose on you, the Council, who are supposed to take final decisions, the duty of finding your own compromises before this Presidency's time is up."
"We in Parliament have done our homework, and, speaking on behalf of my group, I can only recommend to the Council that it act in accordance with this House's balanced proposals."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we have gone from an Agenda 2000 mid-term review of the CAP to a reform that will be valid until 2013, in other words for ten years."
"It is therefore important that we make no mistakes in our fundamental choices."
"With this in mind, Commissioner, you have proposed two major objectives, multifunctionality and competitiveness in agriculture, both in the light of the desire to increase the European Union's room for manoeuvre in WTO negotiations."
"On behalf of my group, I would therefore like to support this promotion of a multifunctional agriculture to meet the expectations of our society and underline the adequacy of resources, the conditionality of aids and the strengthening of actions in the second pillar."
"I would like to stress, however, that the rapporteur, Mr Cunha, has had the pertinent idea of increasing the modulation of aid rather than adopting your combination of degression and modulation, which is complex, administratively cumbersome and would leave few resources for the rural pillar."
"Turning now to the objective of competitiveness which, you say, entails reductions in prices for cereals and milk, I would like to point out that the application of multifunctionality will result in an overall increase in production costs, while at the same time direct aid to holdings will fall in the 15 Member States."
"In this context, to follow your recommendations would be unwise, to say the least, especially since it seems to me that the idea of Europe as an agricultural exporter needs to be looked at again to take account of the new market of 450 million consumers that we will shortly be."
"You seem, Commissioner, to see the decoupling of aid as a miracle solution, but it would be better if this were done partially and gradually, to put the Union in a better negotiating position at the WTO, but also so that we can make a first-stage appraisal before possibly going further."
"My group, the PSE, is proposing an amendment to this effect to increase decoupling to 50% for arable crops and male cattle from the time it is first implemented."
"It is a solution that combines boldness with caution and I ask all my fellow Members to support it."
"Finally, as it is legitimate to make a better distribution between farmers, crops and regions of the aids intended for holdings, my group fully supports the Cunha report's Amendment No 61."
"This amendment in fact recommends that multifunctional credits be allocated according to the criteria of area and employment from 2007."
"Over all, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in the absence of co-decision I think we have contributed enlightened and well thought-out opinions."
"I therefore want to conclude by congratulating Mr Cunha on his excellent report, which is the basis of the debate, and those by the other rapporteurs, who build on it consistently."
"Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I am on this occasion to express an opinion on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"In my previous speech, I spoke mainly on my own behalf as rapporteur."
"The difference is, in itself, marginal."
"I am all in favour of decentralisation and like to see things done on a small scale, but I want to say to my esteemed fellow MEPs that globalisation is on the way for agriculture too."
"It does not help to bury one's head, ostrich-like, in the sand and say that we have not noticed anything and that we do not wish to change anything."
"When I listen to my fellow MEPs, I find that many of them are in actual fact behaving like the proverbial ostrich."
"What is odd is that, in this Assembly, people appear to be more conservative the further to the left they are."
"I should like to make a comment on the Commissioner's view regarding multifunctionality and sustainability."
"As those of us in the ELDR Group have said, it is important and a matter of urgency that we should in the long term deregulate agricultural policy, but now it is very important, in the near future, to guarantee aid to a form of agriculture that is multifunctional and sustainable."
"That is something with which we agree. We are trying to change the systems so that we have something to fall back on, the world being as it is."
"Mr President, I wish of course to thank everyone for all the work that has been done."
"It is fantastic that we coped successfully with all these amendments in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"As representative of my group, I also want to say that we support the compromise in Mr Cunha's report."
"We support it because it is in favour of the principle of decoupling."
"That is important, and even if we do not go the whole hog, we shall nonetheless make a little progress."
"To the President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to say that, if now we have taken a decision, I regret that we do not also have the right of co-decision."
"I nonetheless think that the Council and the President-in-Office of the Council must make use of the opportunity that does in actual fact exist, not completely to fall in with Parliament but to go a step further."
"If you do that, you will in any case serve my, and perhaps also the Commission's, interests rather better."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the mid-term review has nevertheless been quite an adventure and it is no bad thing that we, the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, have arrived at a possible compromise, which might, it seems to me, satisfy farmers."
"We wanted the policy directions to be clear to all and that is why we have given the Cunha report a clear introduction."
"For us Greens, the positive aspect of this compromise is that it strengthens rural development."
"The thorough grooming proposed today allows European farmers to keep the positive aspects of multifunctionality by strengthening rural development, the system of modulation allowing them to pass from the first to the second pillar."
"I am thinking in particular of Amendment No 44 to Article 12."
"This proposed modulation uses a territorial criterion for the application of different percentage points, taking account of less-favoured areas."
"Indeed, as the rapporteur says in his justification, the objective must be to consolidate the structure of producer organisations."
"Moreover, this amendment obliges States to commit themselves to rural development, since they will only get 100% of the EAGGF Guarantee amounts if they commit themselves to obligatory national co-financing."
"I am sure that will encourage States to correctly finance all the social, food quality and environmental aspects of rural development."
"The territorial farming contracts model introduced by France was an excellent precursor from this point of view."
"It should be noted, since it is essential for the future, that Member States may use this modulation to fund their national contribution for the so very necessary establishment of young farmers."
"Similarly, States may - and in our opinion must - chose to finance the compensatory payments to less-favoured areas and to areas subject to environmental constraints or agro-environmental measures - all this without affecting the overall amount allocated by the State to the second pillar."
"This strengthening of rural development is therefore a step in the right direction for two very good reasons: the first is to consolidate good farming practices, more extensive practices, protecting the health of the consumer, respecting the environment and biodiversity and producing a good social added value; the second is to protect the rural world from the vicissitudes of the aggressive commercial liberalism advocated by the WTO."
"Thus, the multifunctional specifics of European agriculture or the exploitation of products specific to a particular region will still be able to be paid for under the second pillar, which affords the best protection for small producers in less-favoured areas."
"In addition, there is the difference between the degression of direct payments to fragile areas (6%) and other areas (8%)."
"If it is to remain meaningful, this strengthening of the second pillar must preserve the milk quotas which have proved their effectiveness in safeguarding mountain stock farming."
"We must also protect and consolidate natural pasture land, but more than that we must continue to support the fodder and, more generally, the protein crops necessary for healthy, high-quality stock farming - the alfalfa mentioned by Mr Souchet - and maintain the necessary schemes."
"It ought to be possible to grow protein crops on all frozen land since Europe is in deficit in them and growing vegetable protein is also beneficial for the quality of the soil and the environment and for the quality of animal feed."
"On the sensitive issue of decoupling, we had to decide between those who supported total decoupling and those who wanted none."
"We feel that the compromise of going a step at a time opens up a perspective that everyone can accept."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission's legislative proposal contains elements of reform of the common agricultural policy which we feel give some cause for concern."
"Total decoupling, proposed by the Commission, will lead to widespread abandonment of production, particularly in disadvantaged areas or areas classed as marginal, and cannot on its own, in any case, provide an exhaustive response to the need for substantial CAP reform."
"Indeed, although it gives us more room for manoeuvre in WTO negotiations, total decoupling of production aid could, in the long term, lead to the dismantling of all market management mechanisms."
"We consider reform to be necessary, but it must be carried out with due regard for the goals laid down in the Treaties and for the principles of quality, environmental protection and, above all, employment."
"With a view to increasing employment, Member States must be given the tangible possibility of making employment a criterion in allocating a quota of the direct aid provided under the first pillar."
"In any case, we feel that preserving our farming system and fostering a future of security and dignity for our farmers must continue to be priorities, and we hope that it will be precisely these priorities which will influence any WTO negotiations, not vice versa."
"For all these reasons, we believe that gradual, vertical decoupling of aid is possible, with a view to gradually limiting the application of the measure to a few sectors."
"It is far too early to extend decoupling to the animal-rearing sector, rice and durum wheat, considering, not least, the definitive nature of the measure."
"Then we cannot endorse the proposed differences in aid and we believe that money saved through modulation must be channelled principally into preserving rural development measures which include, not least, support for quality, with no distinction made between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged areas."
"These are the main reasons why we have tabled a number of amendments on behalf of our group, amendments which I hope will be accepted by the House."
"We have also, on behalf of the UEN Group, tabled a number of amendments seeking to introduce a more balanced system of aid to the nut sector, a system which, taking into account the different production situations in the Union, establishes a fairer distribution of support between the different Member States and more aid per hectare than was originally proposed by the Commission."
"We welcome the introduction of a distinct animal-rearing sector, with the goal of preserving traditional rearing methods and the use thereof in the territory."
"We will firmly support all the genuinely important amendments which, like those tabled by our group, seek to establish a system of special benefits for young farmers with a view to facilitating access for new generations to production activities."
"Lastly, as regards the dairy sector, we believe that it is desirable to move on from the quota system and that, 20 years on from the adoption of the temporary quota regime, it is now time to bring about an appropriate transition to normal market dynamics through a conclusive process with a reasonably short timeframe."
"In any case, we believe that the agreement in principle achieved on the key principles of the reform could serve as a sound basis for the future Council agreement."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have only two minutes to speak so I will get right to the point, and you will no doubt understand, Mr Fischler, that two minutes to tell you everything I think about your proposal, which is, in fact, a complete overhaul of the CAP, is a very short time indeed."
"What can we say about the decoupling you are imposing on us?"
"Even the United States has abandoned the idea."
"That should give us some food for thought."
"Whether it is total or partial, fixed or degressive, it will result firstly in a divide between farmers and citizens, secondly, in additional administrative burdens, not to mention the audits you have added, and, thirdly, in speculation in land."
"What is happening as regards the transfer of rights?"
"I have now asked you that question three times and you have still not responded."
"Perhaps I will be in luck today."
"What can we say about the absence of any future prospects not only for our young people but also for our current farmers?"
"What can we say about your silence regarding Community preference and border protection?"
"What can we say about the lack of information on the impact of your proposals?"
"The studies were launched very late in the day."
"What can we say about the sprinkling of information you have granted us regarding intermediary areas and less-favoured areas?"
"What can we say about ecoconditionality and these 38 directives, some of which are the responsibility of the states?"
"What can we say about the 1 200 amendments that have been tabled?"
"They are proof that your proposal has not satisfied anyone in spite of the good will of the rapporteurs, which I commend today."
"Commissioner, your proposal fills farmers with despair."
"You have been utterly deaf to their requests."
"They do not need a social worker; they are men and women who simply want to make a decent living from their work and their production."
"Mr President, thank you very much for your understanding of my request, and thank you to all the Members of the European Parliament."
"As you know, air traffic controllers are currently on strike and the aeroplane on which I have to return to Athens will not be able to take off after 5.30."
"I shall try to say a few things in reply to the very accurate comments by all the Members and the rapporteurs and spokesmen."
"I can assure you that I have noted all your proposals with particular interest and shall take them into account in the compromise proposal which we shall submit to the Council of Ministers for Agriculture to be held in Luxembourg on 11 and 12 June."
"I have noted with particular interest your accurate proposals on the repercussions of full decoupling, especially on small and medium-sized holdings, together of course with the repercussions which full decoupling may have on holdings in remote and disadvantaged areas, which is why I think that the Council will show particular interest in these proposals."
"Now as far as modulation is concerned, I should like to assure you that I am taking serious account of the limit proposed by Mr Cunha, which is slightly higher than that proposed by the Commission, but of course this is a matter that will also be discussed at the Council of Ministers for Agriculture."
"I shall close on the issue of cross compliance."
"I think that all the ministers are calling for greater transparency in the payment of subsidies."
"They are calling for the money paid by European taxpayers to be put to good use, as regards the development of farm holdings, the production of quality products, healthy products for European citizens and of course for our customers, and that is why we want payment procedures to be as simple as possible."
"With these words, Mr President, I would like to thank you once again for your very courteous treatment. I assure you that the Presidency will take all the measures at its disposal so that an honest and sincere compromise on a new dynamic and efficient European agriculture is reached at the Council of Ministers for Agriculture on 11 and 12 June."
"Thank you, President-in-Office of the Council."
"I am sure that your colleagues will make sure that you receive brief accounts of the opinions expressed while you were absent from the debate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I can assure Mr Martinez that I am very proud of Austrian agricultural policy and of what has been achieved in Austrian agriculture and by the farmers and others who live in rural areas."
"Let me start by thanking most warmly all the rapporteurs for the work they have done."
"I would also like to extend the warmest thanks to all the staff of this House and also to those of the Commission."
"Without them, it would not have been possible, in this short time, to agree on these compromises, which have met with overwhelming approval in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"We all know what close ties bind agriculture to rural areas and to the people who live and work in them, that rural areas are a place of relaxation for our industrialised society, and that they contribute to cultural and biological diversity."
"Rural development, then, must be about more than ensuring that food is produced, for the European model of agricultural policy, which is committed to extensive and multifunctional agriculture, makes great demands of us."
"The first pillar, which governs the organisation of markets and delivers production incentives, is closely connected with the second, which contains the policies on agricultural structures and rural development."
"It is therefore of fundamental importance that these two instruments should be kept in constant balance and harmony with each other, rather than being applied counter-productively."
"Objectives and means for rural areas can be worked out centrally, but they must take effect on a regional basis."
"Europe's rural areas are very diverse and have different characteristics, advantages and also problems."
"This means that, in many areas, the rural development programme very much needs, as an instrument, to bear the stamp of the regions to which it applies."
"There is, in addition, a need for the regions to be fundamentally motivated and involved."
"Although the Commission proposal and the report represent two important steps in the right direction, I do believe that it would be desirable for the second pillar to be strengthened to an even more marked degree and for rural areas thus to be developed in a sustainable way."
"I can see no comprehensible explanation of why the redefinition of objective criteria that the report calls for is necessary; I think the definition is perfectly adequate already."
"Integrated rural development must not be restricted solely to agricultural structures, for the maintenance and the functioning of rural areas are dependent on a functioning infrastructure being in place."
"The utmost care must also be taken with the distribution of funds, as, when supporting the infrastructures of other, new, businesses, care must be taken to ensure that funds from the EAGGF are allocated only to farmers."
"Let me conclude by saying that extensive and sustainable agriculture is the guarantee that production will go on in every region."
"For example, an Austrian farmer safeguards three jobs both up- and downstream, and we know too that, as enlargement progresses, agriculture will not exhaust the EU's budget resources; on the contrary, regional policy has need of many more of them."
"(Restrained applause)"
"Mr President, I would like to speak principally on the report by Mr Cunha."
"As regards the other reports, I want to mention only the question of intervention in rye, which the Commission proposes should be done away with and not replaced."
"I therefore support the proposal on intervention in the form in which we modified it in the Souchet report in the Committee."
"There must continue in future to be the possibility of compensation for certain specified sites, the natural characteristics of which allow only a limited number of economic alternatives."
"Let me turn, though, to the Cunha report, which I wholeheartedly endorse."
"It incorporates elements that we social democrats have repeatedly called for, such as the requirement for both modulation and cross-compliance, as well as aspects related to the protection of animals."
"The preamble inserted before Article 1 reflects this House's priorities: a secure income for farmers along with support for environmental protection and employment in rural areas."
"What I see as important in this is that Parliament is strongly advocating that a start be made on decoupling aid from production; in the text voted on by the Committee, though, this affirmation is still very muted and vague."
"This, in my view, is where we have to choose a form of words that clarifies what we are calling for."
"It is for this reason that the Group of the Party of European Socialists has tabled amendments providing for decoupling to start, in 2005, at 50% and, following the presentation of a report from the Commission in 2007, for it to rise progressively and be extended to other sectors."
"This is especially important, as, in the compromise motions, we have agreed on the partial decoupling of only two sectors."
"Much as we should, certainly, welcome this introduction of decoupling, we should not lose sight of the longer-term perspective."
"So I hope that the Group of the Party of European Socialists' Amendments Nos 126 and 127 will be endorsed, as these amendments will enable Parliament to send the Council a more emphatic message."
"Let me conclude by addressing yet another important aspect, that of renewable raw materials."
"These offer farmers in many regions great potential for viable alternative crops while, at the same time, having a positive effect on the environment."
"The possibility that our amendment - in contrast to the Commission proposal - will continue to enable set aside areas to be used for cultivating renewable raw materials is one that I very much welcome."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have in our hands a huge programme of reform, one that right now is unavoidable."
"Our committee has, in a spirit of positive cooperation, drafted a large number of amendments to the Commission proposal."
"These amendments will serve to hone the reform to make one that is good for the farmer."
"As the lower limit for modulation is being raised to EUR 7 500 and less-favoured areas are being treated with special care, agriculture in the Union will also be able to continue in the poorest regions: in the north, in the south and in mountain areas."
"Unfavourable conditions must be taken into consideration when distributing funds earmarked for rural development, and for that reason my group has tabled an amendment proposing that the number of LFA areas be added to the criteria for distribution."
"We should not race ahead in the matter of milk production if the market situation does not demand it."
"We must remember that milk production is of particular importance in the less-favoured areas, and in those areas reduced prices can be a serious threat to motivation with respect to production."
"Commissioner, in Finland rye is very special."
"Very high quality rye is used there in the production of functional foods."
"The Commission should also take such special circumstances as these into consideration."
"For us rye is not just a mediocre crop used as fodder, but an appetising daily breakfast food and a staple in our traditional food culture."
"Mr President, the rapporteurs and members of the Committee on Agricultural and Rural Development have had a hard job positively revising the Commission proposals for reform of the Agricultural Policy, which are ill thought-out and unreasonable."
"I refer specifically to complex cereals, dried fodder, milk, and also to reductions in defence of the gradual decrease and the full decoupling of direct payments."
"Particularly in respect of enlargement, it is a positive thing that the majority of the committee are behind my proposal to allow, with regard to rye, a time-limited intervention for locations where there is no alternative to its cultivation."
"All in all, however, I am dissatisfied, in particular as the pressure of time was so great that the assembly-line voting did not produce a conclusive result."
"Furthermore, I consider it wrong in principle that the majority show such unwavering solidarity with the Commission on the road to decoupling and total liberalisation."
"I want to state clearly that, for me, the issue is not about a primitive autarky, but an agricultural policy whose priority is orientation towards the internal market offering ever greater opportunities for regularisation."
"Exports should be limited to finished agricultural products and imports subject to special external protection which does not hinder developing countries, and at the same time does not prevent access to the market for cheap goods from large non-multifunctional agricultural export countries, such as the USA and the Cairns Group."
"Without these conditions there can be no sustained universal multifunctional agriculture in the European Union."
"We should all be clear about this."
"In conclusion I would like to mention two further important reasons for rejecting the Cunha report."
"Firstly I am opposed to modulation funds being a sort of second Cohesion Fund."
"These funds should be used in the interests of rural development in each Member State."
"Secondly I consider it wrong that decoupling is being prematurely implemented."
"It is therefore obvious that a regionalised land premium is far more progressive."
"The proposal from Mr Cunha, however, will be almost impossible to carry through."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament has demonstrated that it is willing to shoulder its responsibilities."
"I hope that the Convention now adopts both the form and content of what has been jointly decided, and that not too many exemptions will be placed before the Council."
"I could understand it if exemptions for all decisions were to find their way to the Commission, but Parliament must be involved in all decisions."
"The work before us has not always been easy."
"The analysis has been good, new perspectives have been gained, which are reflected in our preamble, but implementation has been somewhat difficult."
"With regard to the audit process, for example, we demand that business consultancy is introduced; this has been taken to mean that we want to tie the hands of businesses."
"Let us consider qualified external protection, which should guarantee multifunctionality; the Commission gave this too little publicity."
"A crucial error has also been made with regard to differentiated modulation and re-designation in the second pillar, in that, firstly, too little money is being moved and, secondly, clearly it is not meant to be decoupled in the second pillar, which thus acts as a balancing mechanism for difficult or at-risk types of farming."
"Proposals for decoupling - to which I will return later - should have been made immediately."
"The issue is not, for example, support for the rye sector as a whole, but for certain specific types of crops in certain regions, and this is exactly what can happen in the second pillar."
"Furthermore, no proposals were submitted for abandoning intervention and export subsidisation."
"Whereas with milk you have gone down the same old road, you have proved, with regard to rye, just how brutal reform can be."
"Both were ill-conceived and an integrated abandonment to a set timescale with quantitative limitations but no more price reductions should be considered."
"Decoupling is also a complicated area."
"Many have not understood it; many have understood it and made use of it for their own purposes."
"You have once again completely undermined the possibility of greater freedom in price setting in respect of subsidies by immediately backing down when the starch potato industry says, 'but then we'll get no more raw materials'."
"The reason why these raw materials will no longer be available should have been discussed more thoroughly and questioned more aggressively."
"Why does the milk industry fear that decoupling the milk premium will mean certain areas falling by the wayside?"
"If everyone is now saying that milk production in these deprived areas ought to be safeguarded - and has it now been? - the funds remain the same."
"If this had been better publicised, the associations working in the interests of these industries would have had less opportunity to cause trouble."
"Finally, the second pillar must become the core component of agricultural reform."
"Even here the Commission is very restrained and cautious."
"Possibly you thought there are not enough funds available and the instruments have not been assembled, but this too is an omission on the part of the Commission."
"I hope that, this autumn, there will be a debate between Parliament and the Commission so we can really flesh out the contents of the second pillar and then make it clear that it can and must be a core component of decoupling."
"Mr President, Commission proposals for a mid-term reform of the common agricultural policy have led to a very difficult debate."
"The tabling of 1 200 amendments represents a serious divergence of views within Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Attempts by the Commission to introduce premature - and in the case of milk - unnecessary reform, have contributed to insecurity and unease among farmers."
"Our immediate objective must be to restore farmer confidence in the political process and to safeguard the integrity of the common agricultural policy, outside of which EU agriculture will not survive."
"In the time available it is not possible to evaluate the proposals other than to say that the status quo is not an option, the bottom line must be a sustainable profit margin for farmers, and we need assurances that, whatever the outcome, they are fully protected in the context of the WTO talks."
"While there appears to be some consensus emerging on decoupling, I have reservations about the long-term implications for a commercially focused EU agriculture."
"I pose the question, and not for the first time, what happens following decoupling if the projected price increase in the market place does not materialise?"
"Mr President, EU agricultural aid discriminates against the developing countries, the acceding EU Member States, the environment and ecological interests."
"The large intensive farms receive the most aid, leading to environmental damage and reduced animal welfare."
"In the set-aside scheme, which promotes the cultivation of marginal land, farmers are paid for doing nothing."
"The consumer pays twice: he or she pays via tax for the aid and then pays the artificially high prices for everyday goods."
"Reform of EU agricultural aid is therefore more necessary than ever."
"The June Movement believes that the only real way forward is to abolish discrimination by creating equal conditions through cutting back on agricultural aid with a view to phasing it out entirely."
"The cutbacks must be organised in such a way as to create equal conditions for both conventional and organic farms."
"This can be achieved by stipulating that no more than 70% of the aid is to go to the actual acreage, a target that can be reached by removing the higher amount of aid for protein crops and by promoting extensification by setting an upper limit of 0.5 units of livestock per hectare."
"This means that the set-aside aid and the additional measures can in this way also be done away with."
"The cutbacks must restrict the artificial structural development whereby the large intensive farms receive the largest amount of aid."
"This can be done by having the aid relate to upper limits of 150 hectares and 75 units of livestock."
"The cutbacks must also create better conditions for livestock."
"This can be done by phasing out the aid for skimmed-milk powder from factory calves, as well as by phasing out the aid for the horrendous export of live animals to third countries. Better conditions for the developing counties can be created by phasing out sugar aid and direct aid for exports."
"Finally, the EU countries must be placed on an equal footing."
"Instead of increasing aid by 100% for the new countries in 2013, the old countries should receive 25% less aid in 2013."
"Commissioner, you are right when you say that we are discussing reforming the CAP at last, but your reform is not the kind of reform we need, still less so if we call for its impact to be reduced, as Parliament seems to be doing."
"Your reform does not get to the heart of the CAP issue, which is the scandalous fact that the European Union is continuing and intends to continue in the future to tie up half its budget in subsidies and agricultural protection in order to protect a sector which represents 2% of the European Union's GDP."
"We constantly talk about the Lisbon objectives, about making the European Union the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010."
"How do we think that this objective can be in any way achievable when half of our budget is being used to protect and subsidise agricultural production?"
"CAP reform cannot be based on the interests of farmers; the focus must be on the interests of the European Union, on the interests of all the citizens and all the consumers who are paying 70% more for milk than they would on an open market free of subsidies; who are paying 220% more for meat while their Argentine cousins are starving to death or, if not dying, are suffering the effects of an economic recession because we are preventing them from exporting their meat to Europe; who are paying 90% more for sugar while Mozambique is unable to achieve economic recovery because of European protectionism."
"The example of New Zealand is significant, although it is a small country."
"After the total elimination of subsidies and agricultural protection, the contribution of farming to GDP rose, employment rose, particularly among young farmers, and quality improved."
"Even if we talk about protecting the environment and marginal and mountainous areas, if we continue to call for half of the Community budget to be channelled into protecting and subsidising the production and export of European farm products regardless then that is something else altogether."
"We are denying ourselves the chance of reaching an agreement on the major WTO trade agreements and, most importantly, we are continuing to harm the European citizens, consumers and taxpayers."
"This is the truth, and reform seeking to dismantle the CAP must be placed on the agenda as soon as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first make a small, general observation."
"At this point, I would like to express our particular thanks to the ladies and gentlemen of the Committee secretariat, to our staff and the staff in the Parliamentary groups."
"All have been under enormous pressure of time."
"In particular I must thank the rapporteur with dual responsibility for cereals and dried fodder, our French colleague, Mr Dominique Souchet, for his two sound and, from a practical point of view, balanced reports, and above all, for the truly remarkable and transparent cooperation and close coordination across group boundaries, right from the start."
"This is not always the case in this House."
"We in this House - and we really should see this - consider ourselves the chosen representatives of the public and understand the individual working situation more precisely and also much more clearly than others - even including the Commission."
"Now, briefly, let me turn to the report by Mr Souchet on the subject of cereals."
"We consider the proposed reduction in the intervention price unnecessary."
"Ten years of continuous intervention price reductions have left it almost at the level of the world market price."
"Even the additional monthly charges - Commissioner, I know I said 'yes, but' - ultimately help towards better distribution over the year."
"Of course there have been many suggestions here today - for which we are grateful - regarding the proposed situation in the rye sector."
"Amendment No 28 - I mention this amendment in particular - also contains a measure to limit surplus."
"It provides opportunities for increased consumption at various levels on the one hand, and the restriction of rye cultivation to limited farm locations - as Mrs Fiebiger has already pointed out, this is by and large where the heart of the matter lies."
"Regarding potato starch, which is of course regulated by the cereal market organisation, we envisage the fundamental retention of production refunds."
"Nevertheless we will get a decoupling or a step-by-step partial decoupling of cereals."
"With regard to the report on dried fodder, Commissioner, I find the total abolition of the dried fodder regulation incomprehensible."
"For many of our grassland farms the cooperative drying plants maintained by farmers are a valuable means of support, which make an important contribution to the supply of mineral-rich fodder."
"As Mr Goepel has already pointed out, we have all seen the danger that discussion of this reform is happening too close to WTO issues, and also to the discussion on the future structure of the enlarged EU."
"In actual fact the current discussion and this conclusion are vital."
"We have shown that we have carried out our responsibilities regarding co-determination."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too am taking as a starting point the fact that there was absolutely no guarantee that we would reach the vote in plenary."
"We are here because of a sensible decision made by the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which has displayed great commitment and has adopted a method capable of dealing with over 1000 amendments and achieving a reasonable balance in its proposals overall."
"Precisely because of this ability, which I hope will be confirmed tomorrow in the House, I am sure that the Commissioner and the Council will pay greater attention to Parliament's work."
"I consider the reports to be well-balanced, particularly Mr Cunha's report."
"We have emphasised the need for reform, and to those who oppose reform with various arguments I would simply say that blocking reform will not protect the CAP - it will ultimately divest it of social legitimacy."
"We have therefore concentrated on introducing useful amendments to avoid the risk of decoupled aid, which would become support measures or lead to the abandonment of production."
"We consider partial decoupling to be the right way forward."
"Lastly, I would like, if I may, to draw the attention of the Presidency and the Commissioner to the decision we have made to maintain support for durum wheat unchanged, and I hope that there will be particular focus on the expiring COMs as well as on this package - oil, tobacco, fruit and vegetables - so that we avoid using the savings made through the decisions we are about to take for some sectors and not others, in other words solely for milk and sugar, thus avoiding exacerbating imbalances between producer countries."
"Mr President, I too should like to thank all the rapporteurs."
"With regard to decoupling, I also support the Commission proposals to a large extent, but there are exceptions to every rule, of which I should like to mention two."
"It should not be the case that agricultural products such as vegetables, fruit, flowers, and so on, which were not subsidised in the past, should now be subsidised indirectly."
"In my view, an exception should therefore be provided for in the regulation."
"The second exception should apply to potato starch."
"To my mind, the 50% decoupling, as proposed by the Commission, is not sufficient and should remain at 75% in order to avoid as unacceptable social consequences."
"I too am in favour of making the payment of premiums dependent on the observance of environmental requirements, but what are these?"
"They are very vague."
"If every Member State were to observe the nitrate directive, agricultural policy would become very simple, but, as thirteen of the fifteen Member States do not observe the environmental requirements, we should prescribe clearer parameters."
"I would like to make a third remark with regard to the budget in general."
"I do not know what the costs are of the reports on which we are about to vote, but the current proposals mean that the budget is already extremely tight as it is."
"What will the Commission do when reform proposals are tabled for sugar, for vegetables and fruit, for olive oil and for tobacco?"
"Can we then look forward to other reductions, other degression standards?"
"This is the question I should like to put to the Commission."
"Mr President, the Commission's recent proposals on the reform of the CAP do not simply recommend a mid-term, corrective review, but give the coup de grace to small and medium-sized farming, reducing the quality and competitiveness of agricultural produce and destroying the environment."
"With harsh, forcible measures, which none of the reports we are debating revokes; rather they gild their destructive logic with anodyne amendments on individual issues, Community farming is being brought into line with conditions on the so-called globalised market and farmers are being turned on Mr Fischler's 'because I say so' from producers into businessmen, as he is wont to say; in other words they are prey to the laws of the market, importers and multinationals in the foodstuffs industry."
"Decoupling subsidies from production and paying direct income support, modulation with the gradual reduction and degression of support over and above EUR 5 000 per holding and making aid conditional on strict compliance with environmental standards, so-called cross compliance, are turning the already disastrous CAP into a mechanism for wiping out farmers, with radical changes to the productive map of the countryside."
"Mr Cunha's analgesic proposals such as, for example, the partial decoupling method, in other words making decoupling gradual rather than universal, with fewer products in the first year instead of all products, revoke none of the above and, on a medium-term basis, they will have the same catastrophic results on the rural economy."
"The objective of the reform of the CAP is to save resources from agriculture for other policies - EMU, CFSP and others - and to orientate farming to the market on terms of unadulterated competition, with no social, development or environmental criteria, as required by the mechanisms of the WHO and pressure from the USA."
"The reference to environmental protection, which is repeated throughout, is being used as an alibi to reduce agricultural production."
"A typical example of this hypocrisy is in the giving way to pressure from the USA for the release and use of genetically-modified organisms, with unforeseeable adverse repercussions on the environment and public health."
"The famous multifunctionality of agriculture, with resources being reallocated to the second pillar for supposed rural development, is nothing more than a very poor pretext to conceal the pursued objective of marginalising the rural world and changing its social and environmental role."
"The implementation of these proposals leaves no margin to develop the rural economy, leads to the forcible readjustment of holdings, the disappearance of small-scale cultivation, and an increase in tenant farmers both in the new Member States and in the existing Member States, increases the profits of the multinationals and reinforces and consolidates the plundering of developing countries and their peoples."
"Not only do Parliament's reports fail to get their act together and move away from the Commission's disastrous policy; on the contrary, they add fuel to its fire."
"As the farmers are fighting not to embellish but to overturn anti-farming reforms, we shall vote against these proposals."
"We take the farmers' side and support them in their proactive fight, which is the only way to secure their survival and protect the quality of products, the consumer and the environment."
"Mr President, in this Parliament we have discussed the CAP often, and at length."
"I hope this time we shall achieve some conclusive results."
"I am sure I speak on behalf of the whole farming community in that regard."
"I come from a country, Wales, where the per annum income of some of our farmers, especially in the less-favoured areas, 80% of our nation, is as low now as EUR 6 000."
"This is at a time when the large supermarkets receiving their products are recording their best profits ever."
"Such a situation is totally unsustainable."
"The plethora of amendments to the reports highlight the conflicting viewpoints on this very emotive issue."
"We must avoid a situation where a small number of the large Member States dictates the future shape of European agriculture at the expense of a more representative and democratic decision."
"The lesser regions and nations in the European Union, with endemic problems of the exodus of young people from rural communities, small family farms and less-favoured areas, should also be involved in the important decisions taking place."
"The general swing now towards partial decoupling weakens what could have been a bold move on the Commission's part."
"It could at least have provided the mechanism for Member States, and importantly the nations and regions within them, to target support at their own priorities through national envelopes."
"To this end, as has been mentioned by other Members, democratic representation of regions in the Council of Ministers is vital, as well as codecision for the Committee on Agriculture."
"My problem with a mixture of the current livestock support schemes and the new decoupling scheme is that it would result in an uneven playing field for many sectors and bring increased bureaucracy and more barriers for producers aiming to focus on the market."
"If this means people having to leave small family farms in less productive areas to find work, it risks undermining the very foundations on which these rural communities are built."
"I know this is a scenario that the Commissioner will be keen to avoid."
"Having discussed this topic extensively with Welsh farmers, I find that what they undoubtedly want is simpler, more market-focused policies to help farms return to profitability."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if an instrument overshoots its goal, you need to adjust it, but the goal needs to be the right one."
"Commissioner Fischler proposes decoupling aid and production."
"He has given up the fight for the European agricultural model within the WTO before it has even started."
"That way, he is overshooting the goal."
"Complete decoupling may well serve the cause of trade liberalisation, but it does not serve the European agricultural policy."
"On other continents, decoupling as an instrument has failed."
"Should we repeat this mistake?"
"Mr Cunha is right to draw our attention to the great difference between economic theory, which is probably very rational, and practical application, which brings with it many risks."
"European farmers should not again fall victim to economic experiments devised at drawing boards in Brussels."
"Decoupling does not work in places where there are no stable internal markets."
"The Commission's plans lack any measures to promote stability."
"I would, for example, mention protection at the borders against great fluctuations in the world market price and regulation of production on the internal market."
"To be sure, I too would welcome an end to the intervention regime and export subsidies; not, however, via a structural reduction in prices but by restricting production."
"Rural policy stresses the multifunctionality of agriculture in the European Union."
"This is why a substantial proportion of the proposed modulation should reinforce this second pillar."
"As is evident from my amendment, it is only fair that the Member State that makes the saving should be able to use these monies for rural development within its borders."
"Mr President, by agreeing, although with a number of reservations, to back the decoupling line proposed by the European Commission, the Cunha report is asking us to take a step in the wrong direction."
"Why?"
"It is a step in the wrong direction because decoupling, by introducing a radical divide between farmers' wages and production, would transform direct payments into income linked to the land, of a set amount, comprising a sort of negative tax that is hard to justify in the eyes of the public and taxpayers, increasing the price of land in an inappropriate and uneconomical manner, and thus making it more difficult for young people to become farmers and establish themselves."
"Decoupling would also have negative consequences for the regional localisation of crops and would therefore encourage relocation rather than land-use planning."
"The declared aim of decoupling is to promote our negotiating position in the WTO, but it is hard to see how the announcement of a reform before the negotiations could give us any more weight."
"Finally, by doing away with all links between production and State aid, we are forgoing any market guidance and control measures, which are the basis for all of our COMs."
"We must therefore abandon this crazy, pointless idea of decoupling."
"Total decoupling would be a total mistake and partial decoupling would be a partial mistake."
"Partial decoupling would be an incomprehensible compromise, a bureaucratic monster and an unsustainable system."
"It would make the CAP, which must be simplified as soon as possible, even more complex."
"It would create a new cursor, that of the decoupling rate, and many hands would ensure that this moved towards total decoupling, to the detriment of our agriculture, our independence and our food security."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, if I may, to start by thanking the rapporteurs for their excellent work."
"I would stress that, overall, we can only support the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy, given the financial constraints which we have imposed on ourselves until 2013 and considering, not least, the new challenges posed by enlargement."
"However, we do have a number of concerns."
"Firstly, we do not know the proposals for all the sectors and so we do not have an overall picture."
"Secondly, once the principle of decoupling has been endorsed, the Commission is free to apply it as it wishes."
"We must therefore endeavour, first and foremost, to reassure our farmers. I therefore call upon the Council to regulate this mechanism as rigorously as possible, safeguarding the different areas of production and, above all, farmers' incomes."
"Another part of the Commission's proposal which causes me great concern is the employment incentive."
"The July proposal referred to the criterion of working units: this criterion disappeared subsequently and we have attempted to reincorporate it through amendments, for we consider it to be necessary."
"The danger that the transferral of aid from production to income will not encourage working of the fields may be partially averted by this decision."
"We must therefore put all possible effort into these areas of reform, and also into quality, for in promoting quality we will be equipping our agriculture to compete on the markets."
"Mr President, the Commission's proposals are not in the interests of farming and could have serious consequences for family-based farming and for small and medium-sized farmers, unless some of their basic assumptions are revised."
"Instead of correcting the present imbalances in the distribution of aid amongst countries, areas of production and producers and instead of paying particular attention to the specific characteristics of countries such as Portugal, the intention is basically to ensure that the Community budget under the enlargement process is frozen and to take a step further towards liberalising the farm sector at world level, with a view to the forthcoming negotiations at the World Trade Organisation."
"One of the policy's fundamental principles is to establish aid on the basis of historical reference criteria from recent years and to ensure its decoupling from production, which primarily benefits the large producers and the countries with the most advanced forms of farming and condemns the producers that lag behind, the small-scale and family farmers, to their current situation."
"Consequently, in addition to speeding up the process of concentrating production and land, this will set in stone the current inequalities in aid distribution in which Portugal suffers greatly, and encourage absentee land ownership and speculation on the market in farmland. It will promote unfair competition between the forms of productions entitled to aid and those that are not and create further hurdles to entering the sector, particularly for young farmers."
"We cannot accept this being converted from a policy of support for production to a policy of social handouts."
"The CAP reform that we want to see is quite different and we regret the fact that the opportunity provided by this mid-term review to establish such a reform has not been taken."
"Some of the amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are to be welcomed but most of them are not."
"One of the most worrying is the report by Arlindo Cunha, which is dangerously similar to Commissioner Franz Fischler's proposal."
"In fact, it not only fails to put forward a genuine proposal for modulation, it also accepts decoupling aid from production for some payments for arable crops and bovines."
"What is required is for instruments to regulate the market to be promoted, guaranteeing the maintenance of a price that is fair and that compensates for farm production, for the principle of Community preference to be guaranteed in order to protect the internal market, and for consumer safety and food sovereignty to be promoted, taking account of Portugal's conditions and specific characteristics."
"We shall continue to fight to achieve these aims."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to use my speaking time to call for a reform of the CAP that does not again overlook those regions of the Union that have climatic and environmental conditions and farming traditions that are particularly appropriate to multifunctional rural development. These are regions whose farming consists of small and medium-sized family holdings, based on land and pastures, regions that have considerable milk-producing capacity and which, because they did not have the necessary milk quota when they joined the Community, have undergone a Malthusian modernisation, which has led to the disappearance of tens of thousands of holdings."
"Today, these regions receive practically no production subsidies, which means that they would not receive decoupled aid either."
"They form part of States where there is an enormous deficit between milk consumption and production."
"I am talking about Galicia, but I am not only referring to my own country; I am talking about countries that need their milk quota to be increased, countries that could provide for their internal markets without calling European balances into question."
"I hope that these are not ignored once again in this reform of the CAP."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, you are called upon to give your opinion on the various draft reports on the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy."
"I will not talk about the substance but, as Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I cannot ignore the comments, not to say the criticisms, some of you will be tempted to make as regards the procedure chosen for the adoption of these various reports."
"Unfortunately, we were pressed for time and I am the first to regret this."
"The goal of the Council presidency was to have Parliament's opinion by the end of June."
"The time we were allotted was very short."
"However, we have chosen to respond to this request so that it cannot be said that the principle of consulting the European Parliament merely causes delays in the discussions underway."
"In fact, at a time when the debate on the development of the European institutions is considering precisely the competence of our House, any delay in the consultation procedure could have been interpreted as a sign that Members were incapable of dealing with an issue head-on and giving their opinion within the allotted timeframes."
"That is why, in the Committee on Agriculture, we adopted a procedure that made it possible to respect both the timetable set for us by the Council presidency, which is keen to move this issue forward, and the right of expression and of amendment of the members of the Committee on Agriculture."
"We achieved this as a result of the remarkable work of the committee staff, and also the coordinators."
"I felt it was necessary, Mr President, to explain why we adopted a working method dictated by the urgency of the situation and increased the pace of the work, whilst respecting our fellow Members' right of expression."
"As far as I am concerned, it is the result of a compromise achieved through the desire of the members of the Committee on Agriculture to preserve the key provisions on the management of agricultural markets laid down by the common agricultural policy, whilst allowing us to move towards a form of agriculture that gives greater consideration to the general interest."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you must now take the right decisions to guarantee a decent income and a future for our farming families."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I shall begin by expressing my deep disappointment with this reform of the common agricultural policy and I wish to challenge your conscience, Commissioner, with the injustices and the discrimination that your policy is perpetrating against farmers and also with regard to the way in which you are protecting desertification and damaging the credibility of the Union itself."
"Let us look at the injustices: you are responsible, Commissioner, for around seven million farmers in the Community."
"Only three-and-a-half million are entitled to direct aid - only three-and-a-half million."
"Of these three-and-a-half million farmers, 52% receive only 4.5% of the aid."
"Is this or is this not a profound injustice?"
"In my own country, one hundred farmers - the one hundred largest - receive more than 60% of farmers in my country do."
"I challenge your conscience with this injustice."
"Next, Commissioner, your policy is discriminatory!"
"Two areas of production, cereals and bovines, which between them account for 21% of Community production, receive 60% of aid; I repeat, 21% of production receives 60% of all aid."
"I call that discriminatory, Commissioner!"
"It is all the more discriminatory because these two areas of production are those most responsible for desertification."
"By not opposing this policy, Commissioner, you have contributed to the enormous increase in unemployment throughout the Union, because the only winner is something that causes unemployment and not the areas of production that actually employ people."
"The third issue concerns the damage done to our credibility, because the institutions have a duty to protect the weakest."
"Commissioner, I have probably been involved in politics as long as you have, and the basic duty of the institutions is certainly to protect the weakest members of society and yet you have put yourself in the position of protecting only the strongest."
"Why have you abandoned the ceiling, Commissioner?"
"Even the United States, which has companies that are two hundred times larger, has a ceiling of EUR 350 000, and you, who initially had a ceiling in place, abandoned it, concluding that it was excessive because it should not exceed EUR 100 000."
"You and this Parliament will go down in history as being profoundly unfair and discriminatory and for having damaged the credibility of the political process."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the past year, it was important that confidence in Agenda 2000 should be maintained."
"Today we deal with the further development of the common agricultural policy post-2006, taking into consideration world trade law, with the applicant countries participating as appropriate."
"I emphasise that it is right at this time to make a serious and sustainable decision on the future of the common agricultural policy."
"However, Commissioner, the parallelism of agricultural decision-making on the one hand, and the continuance of world trade discussions on the other also have a part to play here."
"They can only be properly combined if the Commission adheres strictly to the whole package of WTO negotiations and allows no watering down in this case."
"With this in mind I would like to say that Mrs Kinnock's comments with regard to the evaluation of the agricultural policy are an evaluation of the Agricultural Policy from 20 years ago."
"If we do achieve a balance in development policy and commit all industrial nations to this, we have no reason to hide behind others."
"Commissioner, you have always quite rightly said that only economically healthy businesses can be sustained in the long term."
"The concept of sustainability does not have to be continually updated."
"It is adequately and internationally defined and set out in Agenda 21."
"The issue before us today therefore is in a sense to rework the Commission's proposals so that they are, if possible, more practical and more manageable, and at the same time to make the necessary adjustments without these adjustments asking too much of businesses or people."
"Regarding the simplification of the agricultural policy, with regard to the thirty-eight directives named and the possibility of Member States implementing these administratively, I would ask that still more be done to avoid hardship cases so that the simplification of European agricultural policy also fully and completely respects the basic principle of non-discrimination."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, can the European Union continue to ignore the expectations of society, which has been deeply affected by the food crises we have experienced in recent years?"
"Is it right for 80% of agricultural aid to be distributed among only 20% of farmers?"
"Can Europe seriously be exonerated from the need to carry out an in-depth analysis of a policy that accounts for almost half of its budget, at a time when it is preparing to welcome 10 new countries?"
"You were right, Commissioner, to prefer movement to the status quo, anticipation to a waiting game."
"Your reform is courageous, for it advocates, through decoupling, a break with the approach of providing incentives for production."
"It is ambitious in that it seeks to strengthen the multifunctional nature of European agriculture."
"It is relevant in terms of the future WTO appointments and the impending enlargement of Europe."
"However, I am afraid that it may also be unfair in that it is based exclusively on the situation in mainland Europe and does not give sufficient consideration to the diversity of regional situations, particularly as regards production in the outermost regions."
"These regions have not yet achieved the initial objective of the CAP, namely a degree of agricultural self-sufficiency."
"Their markets are far from being saturated."
"They need incentives to help develop their farms."
"If the proposed measures were automatically applied to the outermost regions, they would be an undeniable hindrance to the dynamism we have witnessed in recent years."
"It is not a question of putting the outermost regions in a bubble; we simply need to take account of their specific situations."
"The legal basis already exists, in Article 299(2); what we need now is the political will."
"The Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has shouldered its responsibilities by adopting on 21 May an amendment, which I tabled with the aim of ensuring that the outermost regions are not subjected to automatic, systematic application of the reform."
"The Commission and the Council must now shoulder theirs."
"There is no doubt that we must learn from the lessons of the past and adapt our agricultural policy to the challenges of the twenty-first century, but it would be unacceptable to allow this reform, in the name of general principles, to sound the death knell for the Union's most vulnerable farmers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a proposal for reform, however comprehensive, will never be able to satisfy the many different farming systems in Europe."
"It was therefore inevitable that the debate would become heated and even change in tone according to the different viewpoints of the Members."
"To get straight to the point which interests me, I would like to say that I come from the mountains, and in this debate I want to express the opinion of those who live and work in mountain regions."
"We endorse the transition from market, in other words from production, to farm, and we also endorse the proposal to transfer the savings made through modulation to rural development."
"Despite the many instances of reluctance to address mountain concerns, despite the fact that the mountains are not mentioned anywhere in this reform, we can say that there is hope on the horizon."
"At last, for the first time, multifunctionality, which is indispensable for some disadvantaged peripheral areas, is treated quite seriously."
"Multifunctionality has always been practised in mountain areas where, together with their primary activity, farmers are required to control forestry development, channel watercourses, concern themselves with animal welfare and look after the environment for the benefit of farm and other tourism."
"This also means taking the greatest possible care to ensure the quality of typical products and niche products, which have for some time been highly successful and not unprofitable on the market."
"This too could help to convince a young farmer or two not to abandon the mountains."
"It is not enough, however: multifunctional farming brings added value to the community and it is therefore right that there should be appropriate remuneration."
"The ridiculous premiums for meadow mowing are not enough: a decent, fixed, supplementary income should be provided for those who work in the mountains and perform these services for the benefit of all."
"Otherwise, the exodus already taking place will continue and depopulation of the mountains will be the inevitable result."
"Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the resolutions adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development even though I do not doubt that, in many areas, they do not go far enough."
"Having had the same experience with the foot-and-mouth disease report, I would also like to congratulate the members of the Committee on their tremendous hard work."
"It is hard work but an agreement must be reached."
"Much that has been negotiated, however, has still not been implemented."
"In addition, many of Commissioner Fischler's proposals, which I believe go in the right direction and in which there is very much that I can support, have unfortunately still not been fully implemented in all areas, something of which he is well aware."
"We should however stop breaking everything down and unravelling it all again because in the end, we can only negotiate the whole as a package."
"There is, of course, the World Trade Organisation, which requires that we observe certain rules."
"If one considers the governments that took part in the negotiations from 1986 to 1994 in the Marrakech Round and the Uruguay Round and which ones then signed the treaties at the end of 1993 or 1994, there were abstentions in many areas."
"Even though I come from Upper Bavaria, I do of course think that an increase in the milk quota is wrong."
"Many other price interventions have to be readjusted as well - rye is one of them - because everything cannot be ploughed up in one go or from one day to the next."
"That will not work."
"I would also like to make it clear that I support cohesion in the European Union and the shifting of funds into those regions and countries that have less, to help them to improve."
"I do not understand, though, why money that, for example, will be cut back from many operations that are in a higher grouping, should go back to the Commission for redistribution elsewhere."
"The bulk of the money should be used within the two pillars, according to the principle of subsidiarity, in the regions from where it originates."
"Otherwise, to put it bluntly, many will in reality be paying twice."
"Commissioner Fischler's reforms are necessary and they would be necessary even without the entry of the ten accession states and without the World Trade Organisation because no one in this Chamber will seriously claim that the system is fair in terms of the way it has been managed up until now."
"It is not fair."
"Decoupling in the most widely varying of areas - and, as you and I know, this will one day be complete; it is a matter of time - will lead to greater fairness."
"It will not help however if everyone takes their region out and says that nothing should be done here and nothing should be done there."
"That does not begin to solve the problem."
"A few words on the developing countries: I am really glad that these have been discovered in the meantime."
"The 'Everything But Arms' initiative will not kill anyone or cost anything."
"We must however look at which countries are attempting to sell from the little that they produce because they need other vitally important goods."
"We must look into that."
"In the European Union, for decades, we have dumped our surpluses at a world market level and have forced them onto the developing countries and deprived many of their farmers of the capacity to make a living."
"We should also give some thought to that."
"Mr President, as far as we are concerned, Commissioner Fischler will go down in history as the Commissioner of decoupling."
"If, in order to guarantee a successful WTO agreement, we have to choose between two options, then we would pick decoupling rather than price reduction."
"If the Council and Commission have listened carefully, this is, in any case, the direction that Parliament has indicated."
"The CDA (Christian Democrat) delegation in the European Parliament has been happy to help reach a compromise on the Cunha report which contains a number of points that were of interest to us and which we have highlighted by means of amendments."
"First of all, there is set-aside."
"In our opinion, it should be possible to rotate, and it should be up to the farmer to decide, rather than it being fixed for ten years."
"Secondly, land that has been decoupled and where other products may possibly grow should definitely not be used for growing free products, including consumption potatoes and vegetables."
"The CDA has tabled an amendment to that effect, which has been adopted by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Our third point, which is a little more controversial, is that we welcome the increase in franchise per farm on which decoupling is practised, from EUR 5 000 to 7 500, but that is too little in our opinion."
"The European Christian Democrats should protect the family concern and in our view, this ceiling should be raised to EUR 10 000 or 15 000."
"In fact, we in the CDA have, together with our British colleagues, tabled an amendment for EUR 10 000, and a Spanish amendment has been tabled for EUR 15 000, both of which we will support."
"With regard to the dairy sector and reform, we back the Jeggle report and, partly based on a CDA amendment, we have decided in favour of far less far-reaching decoupling and also for change."
"In our opinion, we should first reach 5%, wait for a WTO agreement and possibly implement the Berlin Agreement in its entirety."
"Anyone who thinks that the dairy sector should be reformed - and I am particularly addressing Mrs Kinnock - should realise that, since 1983, the European Union has surrendered 5% of the global market and that production has not benefited the developing countries but other rich ones."
"To state that we must further pull down European dairy policy without considering the effects is evidence of armchair socialism."
"It is a cheap form of armchair socialism."
"I am in favour of any discussion on development cooperation, provided this is done on the basis of the agreements which Europe has reached with the 48 poorest countries and after we have considered the implications for the European farmers and farmers in developing countries."
"If we fail to do this, the European farmers will be sitting targets in the whole discussion on development cooperation."
"As a member of this Parliament, I refuse to have any part in this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like also to be able to say Minister, President-in-Office of the Council, but, unfortunately, he is absent."
"I wish to start by congratulating all the rapporteurs who have worked on the very important matter we are debating today, but mainly I wish to congratulate Mr Cunha on his magnum opus, which I do not envy him at all."
"I would not want to be in his shoes, but I congratulate him on what he has managed to produce."
"Allow me to convey to you the anxiety and uncertainty of Greek farmers, because Mediterranean products are not included in the reform of the CAP, and their anxiety as to what will emerge from part two, from the second round of negotiations, when we discuss Mediterranean products after the Cancun round of the World Trade Organisation."
"We are worried. We are very worried and I hope that it will turn out that we have no reason to worry but, until it does, we shall worry."
"We consider that the EUR 5 000 limit is very low."
"It needs to be increased drastically if we really want improvements to production and monitoring of all the preconditions needed for us to have improved prospects in the agricultural sector."
"I also wish to express the conviction that disadvantaged island areas, which in my country especially are particularly exposed, and mountain areas throughout the European Union should receive special treatment."
"We must take care to keep these people in their villages, in their agricultural areas, instead of making them unemployed town dwellers."
"I welcome the prospect of making agricultural production a business."
"However, I want to see how farmers are to become businessmen."
"Finally, we obviously all welcome the enlargement of the European Union with the 10 new Member States, but what I should like is for not only the farmers of the European Union to be called upon to pay the bill for enlargement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there have been many speeches this afternoon about the financing of EU agricultural policy."
"In my opinion, the overall situation over recent years has been much more favourable for consumers than for farmers."
"I never tire of saying that the proportion of outgoings spent on food by the citizens of the European Union has fallen continuously over recent decades."
"There are hard figures indicating that those who, decades ago, spent 40% of income on food, now spend approximately 14%, so foodstuffs are not surplus junk and, with EU support, the farmers produce them and look after the countryside perhaps even far more cheaply than municipal farms could do it."
"My idea of the European agriculture model has remained unchanged for years."
"I would like farmers in the European Union to continue to perform the dual task of producing high quality products and caring for and maintaining the cultural landscape."
"In my opinion, therefore, we should really now be using the debate on common agricultural policy to ensure that this task can be performed in the long term in difficult locations not only in Germany but in all European regions."
"There has been much discussion today about your proposals, Commissioner, but, if I have understood you correctly, there are one or two places where you have allowed for a certain readiness to compromise, and this affects decoupling."
"The agriculturalists in my parliamentary party are demanding clear differentiation between arable and animal production."
"I therefore regard as eminently important the consistent continued development of common agricultural policy and also quantity-oriented market policy for milk."
"Commissioner, I am convinced that we should now decide - as you have always said."
"The parliamentary reports are available and I am very keen to know what the Council will make of them."
"We should really use this negotiation capital."
"Finally, I would therefore like to encourage you to follow our suggestions."
"If we all fight together it will produce the best results for agriculture and I am someone who would really like to defend you out there."
"I cannot imagine what interest you could have in initiating something unsuitable."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I congratulate the Commission on its radical proposals for decoupling."
"I fear that the propositions that Parliament is putting forward are far too timid and believe that we should go down the road of decoupling."
"If we are going to do it partially, then let us at least do it sector by sector, not by horizontal decoupling across all sectors."
"Mr Cunha, you know I believe that part of the proposal is mad."
"Farmers need a clear direction as to where they are going."
"We need a decision from the Council of Ministers so that farmers can plan for the future."
"What we do not want is a complete mixing of decoupling."
"If we need to look after less-favoured areas there are ways to do that."
"We do not have to do that through production subsidies."
"The decoupling system that you have put forward, Commissioner, will help us with the WTO round."
"It will also help us face up to enlargement."
"Let us face it, many of the accession countries would find it very difficult to put into place the production-based subsidies we have."
"What point is there in asking them to put those systems in place if, a year or two later, we change the whole system again?"
"We have to face up to the reality that we will have a different agricultural policy for 25 Member States than we have for the existing 15."
"That is where we have to be careful in what we do."
"We also have to be sure that when Europe goes to the WTO round we can fight our corner and face up not only to the United States, but Third World countries."
"We need to support our farmers, but not at the expense of Third World trade."
"The proposals you put forward will help us to support European agriculture, European farmers and give good value to European taxpayers who are sometimes forgotten."
". (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank you all for your contributions, which, even though in parts very critical, were constructive and always relevant."
"I would also like to assure all of those who have pointed out the importance of giving the European Parliament the power of codecision in the field of agricultural policy, that you have the full support of the Commission and also my full personal support in this matter."
"Anyone who is involved in European politics knows that compromises are necessary in the interest of a common cause and in the interest of reaching a joint decision."
"Compromises must, however, be judged by criteria, and these criteria are the substance of reform, which must be preserved."
"The Commission cannot depart from this principle and does not want to do so."
"On many topics however, there has for some time been discussion on the adaptation of Commission proposals."
"These include, for example, the concentration of the cross-compliance requirements on the most important provisions with the aim of improving administrative manageability, a moderate increase in the portion of cross-compliance moneys remaining in the Member States, a longer preparation time for the installation of the management advisory system with initial voluntary participation which shall only later be made obligatory, greater flexibility for the Member States with regard to the payment of advances relating to direct payments, flexible treatment of cases of hardship and problems in calculating and allocating the uniform management premium as well as the option for the Member States to exclude certain types of fruit from the areas subject to premiums, the retention of the rotating set-aside land with the possibility of secondary growth of commodities in these areas, delaying the decoupling of milk premiums in the interest of simplifying administration or a more flexible cofinancing rate for agricultural environmental measures and an occasional increase in the promotion sums in areas with specific environmental restrictions."
"There are however other topics where even greater efforts are required in the discussion to enable us to achieve solutions."
"The Presidency will certainly undertake these efforts jointly with the Commission, especially next week in Council."
"These topics include, amongst others, the various aspects of the decoupling of direct payments."
"Here as well there is definitely scope but again, it is important to achieve the basic objectives of decoupling."
"These are the simplification of our promotion policy, the avoidance of absurd production incentives, the strengthening of a market-oriented entrepreneurial trade and finally, the avoidance of trade distortions."
"In particular, we should not forget that decoupling means that of the promotion granted, twice as much money will remain in the farmers' pockets as under the old system."
"This has been demonstrated again recently by the OECD."
"The important topics still requiring an open discussion include the treatment of the outermost marginal areas or overseas areas."
"Here as well, it is crucial to protect the basic principles."
"This of course includes the need to take into consideration both the special features of these areas and the objectives of the POSEI Regulations."
"I would also like to mention the wish voiced in many quarters for an even more targeted strengthening of the two columns of common agricultural policy."
"You will not be surprised that I am open to ideas here as regards strengthening these two pillars even more than was envisaged."
"Once again let us briefly return to the question of decoupling because very many here have mentioned partial decoupling: I think there are problems with the idea of introducing decoupling gradually over a long period or only decoupling a certain percentage of each individual support measure."
"These mixtures of a partial decoupling mean in the end that the disadvantages of the existing system are linked to withholding the advantages of the new system."
"We should therefore be very careful here."
"The particular disadvantages of the existing system are the farmers' lack of freedom to make decisions about their farms."
"Other disadvantages are that the farmers have to pay out more for increased and more complex bureaucracy and in particular, they are denied entrepreneurial freedom."
"A final word on the question of intervention prices, in regard to which some of you have been very critical, asking why we actually want or need a measure to guarantee market balance for the coming years, 10 years in total."
"The main reason is that if we compare the market forecasts that we used as a basis for the Agenda 2000 with the market forecasts that the same institutes, for example, Fabri, are now publishing, these institutes have had to drastically lower their very positive expectations of that time."
"For example, a reduction of 14% for wheat, 10% for barley, 16% for maize, 37% for butter and more than 30% for skimmed milk powder."
"How can we then come up with a 5% drop in the intervention price?"
"Only because we were considerably more cautious then when these forecasts were suggested to us and we can therefore now take a more moderate approach."
"Not taking steps however, would again result in a market imbalance and that means none other than downward pressure on price."
"Last of all, the question on Mediterranean products: I would like to say to you quite clearly that next week, when it is time to decide in Council, we will be pressing for the Agriculture Council, jointly with the Commission, to make a declaration guaranteeing that Mediterranean products are assessed on an equal footing and in the same way if new steps are taken."
"Thank you very much, Mr Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0097/2003)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"I regret that this Question Time, as a result of where it falls on our agenda, always, or almost always, begins late."
"Today we are beginning 30 minutes late, which means that we must deal with it is quickly as possible."
"I am banking on the cooperation of all the Members."
"Part I"
"Question No 22 by Stavros Xarchakos, which has been taken over by Mr Folias (H-0317/03):"
"Subject: Measures to combat the deadly SARS virus"
"The deadly SARS virus has justifiably caused alarm throughout the world."
"What immediately implementable measures to protect against this virus, if any, has the Commission proposed to the Member States?"
"On behalf of Mr Xarchakos, who cannot be here for reasons beyond his control, I would like to thank the Commissioner."
"Question No 23 by Lennart Sacrédeus (H-0314/03):"
"Subject: Violation of human rights in Cuba"
"In March this year, 78 opposition figures were imprisoned in Cuba."
"Summary trials with no chance of a proper defence or the presence of independent individuals were held in April, followed by sentences of 15 and 28 years."
"The prisoners are now serving their sentences under inhuman conditions, in solitary confinement or together with hardened criminals, most often so far from home as to make visits by relatives impossible."
"These conditions are clearly a violation of human rights."
"Given that the Commission has recently opened an office in Havana and that the Cotonou agreement makes certain stipulations regarding human rights, what does the Commission intend to do to secure the release of political prisoners in Cuba?"
"What is the Commission doing to ensure that the treatment of the Cuban prisoners improves and that they are moved nearer to home?"
"What steps will the Commission take to support the prisoners and their relatives?"
"Part 2"
"Question addressed to Mr Monti"
"Mr President, I wish to thank Commissioner Byrne for his answer."
"Approximately 60 of the 75 people sentenced and imprisoned in Cuba following summary trials have received prison sentences of more than 20 years."
"They feel, quite simply, that their lives are threatened."
"Sentences as tough as these have not been handed down in Cuba for several decades."
"My follow-up question to the Commissioner is about how we might follow up the protests in terms of practical politics."
"Can we act within the world community - within the UN - by trying to persuade the Red Cross to take action?"
"Can we act through churches or in some other way?"
"By means of various types of sanctions, can we put pressure on the Cuban regime?"
"We are concerned here with people who have had to pay a very high price for the sake of democracy."
". As I have already indicated, the view of the Commission is that the International Red Cross should be invited to examine and report on the situation."
"In addition, a new EU démarche is being prepared for the beginning of June, but there is no agreement yet on the text."
"To sum up, the situation is that the Commission is keeping this issue under review and maintaining such pressure as it is capable of bringing to bear on the situation."
"Commissioner, the people whom the European Union calls human rights activists are nothing more than agents of the United States of America, as proven in the Cuban courts."
"In addition, the Americans themselves have admitted that they are offering them several tens of millions of dollars to set up internal opposition in Cuba."
"Indeed, which country would not protect itself from outside plotting?"
"In all events, I should like your comments, Commissioner, on the action by Mr Cason in Cuba and by his office."
"I should also like your comments on Mr Bush's message on 20 May, promising freedom to Cuba, and your comment on the fact that the United States have not punished the hijackers who forced aeroplanes to go to Cuba."
"And, finally, what do you think about the detention by the United States of five Cuban patriots who have barely seen 80% of the bill of indictment, because it is supposed to be confidential?"
"As the author is not present, Question No 24 lapses."
"Question No 25 by Ward Beysen (H-0315/03):"
"Subject: Parallel trade"
"Is the Commission aware of the continual threats to legal parallel trade in medicines inside the EU, a process which saves Member State governments and European patients millions of euros each year?"
"Has it considered using Article 82 as a legal basis for ensuring pharmaceutical manufacturers play by the single market rules?"
". (IT) The honourable Member's question is not just undeniably of interest but is also extremely topical."
"The question is interesting in any case because the barriers to parallel trade in pharmaceutical products have for some time been a source of concern to the Commission, which has already prepared many cases for trial in this field in the past and continues do so now."
"In particular, a large number of cases are currently under investigation in the competition sector, at the request of both pharmaceutical laboratories and complainants."
"The matter is also, as I said, highly topical."
"As you are aware, the Commission has two legal instruments under which it can take action: Articles 81 and 82."
"With regard to Article 81, just a few days ago, Mr Tizzano, the Advocate General of the Court of Justice, presented his conclusions on the Bayer case, relating to parallel trade in one of the company's products."
"I do not want to go into the details of this case or the conclusions of the Advocate General, which concern a matter of highly specific legal practice."
"The conclusions do not, however, endorse the lines taken by the Commission on the case."
"The Court's judgment will be issued in a few month's time but will not, in any case, compromise the Commission's other decisions on issues different from the matters addressed in the Bayer case, such as, for instance, the decision adopted by the Commission on 8 May 2001 on the dual pricing system employed by the company, Glaxo."
"As far as Article 82 is concerned, the Commission is currently working along precisely these lines."
"That raises a number of new questions, especially with regard to the definition of markets and abusive practices."
"Moreover, last February, the Court of Justice received a preliminary question from the Greek Competition Committee, which is the Greek authority responsible for competition."
"This preliminary question seeks to establish to what extent the refusal by a pharmaceutical company in a dominant position to supply a wholesaler with a view to stopping parallel trade can be deemed to be abuse prohibited by Article 82 of the EC Treaty."
"The Commission will, as usual, be called upon to express its opinion to the Court in the coming weeks, but the Court is not due to issue its judgment for many months yet."
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his extensive response to what is indeed a very topical problem, which, as the Commissioner was right to emphasise, causes great concern."
"In my view, Article 82 is indeed the only legal basis on which we can carry on, and I hope that more light will be shed on the situation within the foreseeable future, because major mergers within the medicines sector almost always lead to huge cuts in employment."
"Moreover, current practice is very detrimental to the consumer."
"I would therefore expect, as soon as possible, a more detailed answer to the question that was put before you."
". I subscribe to the importance that you attach to the subject, as well as to its urgency."
"I shall give you just a brief indication on where we are going."
"As I said, our priority for the moment is to finalise our contribution to the Court of Justice in the Greek preliminary ruling request - this should be done by mid-June - concerning the treatment of approximately 30 cases pending before the Commission."
"I am sure you will understand that I cannot give precise dates."
"The assessment under Article 82 is ongoing."
"One way or the other you can expect the Commission to adopt its position - positive or negative - on the supply quota systems by the end of this year."
". The whole problem posed by the increasing role of Internet trade exists for aspects related to the internal market and competition."
"It is a positive challenge for the authorities to take on, given the benefits that consumers can draw from the increasing use of the Internet, and also given the continuing need to ensure that whatever the technology adopted for the conduct of transactions, the key principles that support the Community's legal order should not be circumvented."
"Thank you very much for your cooperation with Parliament this afternoon, Mr Monti."
"We will now move on to the 20 minutes of questions to Commissioner Reding."
"Questions to Mrs Reding"
"Question No 26 by Bernd Posselt (H-0301/03):"
"Subject: Minority languages"
"How is the Commission preparing for EU enlargement in terms of the promotion of minority languages, and what part do linguistic minorities whose languages are majority languages in other Member States play in the discussions?"
"In reply to Mr Posselt, I would like to say that the definition of minority and regional languages used by the European Commission is that established by the Council of Europe in its European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages."
"What we mean by a regional or minority language is, and I quote, a language 'traditionally used within a given territory of a state by nationals of that state who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the state's population, and different from the official language(s) of that state'."
"This definition therefore encompasses many languages that are minority languages in one country but majority languages in another."
"As regards the promotion of minority and regional languages within the Union, the Commission finances the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages as well as the Mercator research centres."
"Their 2003-2004 work programme includes measures to provide information on European policy in the areas in question to the future members of the Union."
"Meetings are held on this issue, such as the Bolzano Conference of 26 and 27 May on the topic 'Best practice in promoting linguistic diversity in an enlarged Europe'."
"The European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages has also begun to work on the establishment in the new Member States of national committees representing linguistic minorities, along the lines of similar committees existing in the current 15 Member States of the Union."
"It must be said that the future members already have the same opportunities as the Fifteen as regards minority and regional languages, namely the funding of initiatives through the existing programmes."
"Some of the programmes involved - Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci - are also open to all of the candidate countries."
"Finally, the Euromosaic study on the production and reproduction of the minority language groups in the European Union will be extended to the new Member States."
"The new Member States have also been invited to participate in public consultations that have been launched by the Commission as part of the preparations for an action plan for language diversity and learning, which will be presented to the Council and Parliament in July, in the context of the analysis of the new generation of Leonardo, Socrates and Youth programmes."
"All linguistic minorities, including those whose language is a majority language in other Member States of the enlarged Union, have been able to take part in these consultations."
". (DE) Mr President, in this regard I can reassure Mr Posselt that the Union will not intervene in projects that, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, fall within the competence of Member States."
"I am therefore at a complete loss to explain the origin of this discussion because if a Member State wants to help out another Member State or a third country in some way and wants to carry out cultural projects in this Member State, then this is a matter for the Member State and the Union should not interfere."
"On the contrary, I am happy for Member States to organise numerous cultural projects in their neighbouring countries."
"I was very interested in the Commissioner's response and her definition of languages, which is well known in this House."
"I fully support the notion of providing financial assistance to minority and lesser-spoken languages, and like many colleagues I am familiar with the educational programmes and the work of the Bureau."
"As the Commissioner knows, respect for someone else's language, respect for that person and his or her culture and customs, helps support the integration of those communities."
"In that vein, can I ask the Commissioner to at least consider, perhaps by means of a study or a survey, giving support for re-defining the definition and including other languages perhaps non-European in origin, but still spoken and understood by many people, languages understood across many EU states - Urdu, Hindi, Bengali and Tamil, to name but a few."
"I realise that this is a significant suggestion, but my fear is that if we do not at least consider this, we will be sending a very divisive message to many ethnic minority communities at a key time of integration."
"In effect we will be saying that languages spoken by a few hundred people in some cases, and I agree with the support of those languages, are more important to the EU than others spoken by hundreds of thousands."
"I wonder whether the Commissioner would be prepared to consider that?"
". In answer to the honourable Member, all Community action concerning languages is inclusive, not exclusive action."
"We have not clearly defined what the languages are because in the action programme which I am going to present in July this year we would like to outline all the languages spoken in the enlarged European Union."
"We will see if it is possible to include migration languages such as those you mentioned, Mr Evans."
"At any rate, they are not excluded by any of our texts."
"Mr President, as regards the issue of language learning beyond the official languages, that is to say, the regional languages, minority languages and also the issue of migration languages which has just been raised, I believe that these areas should indeed be kept separate, with the official languages, regional and minority languages on the one side, and the migration languages on the other."
"I would ask the Commissioner to share her opinion with us on this point, also with regard to the programme which was launched in connection with the European Year of Languages and which was very clearly defined."
"In my view, also given that the funding available is limited - the Commissioner needs far more resources for this area of activity than she is currently being provided with - some sort of prioritisation is essential."
"."
"(DE) Mr President, the honourable Member is quite right, of course: we will never have enough money to do everything."
"However, during the European Year of Languages, we not only gave the official languages their say; we also facilitated the provision of funding for languages which are actually spoken in the territory, if that was what associations or citizens wanted."
"We must be vigilant in monitoring what is happening through our schools and in society in general."
"In our schools, it is inevitable that the mother tongue is the official language, the first language."
"I have always demanded that we should endeavour to teach two foreign languages in addition to the base language, and this is something that our heads of state and government have accepted."
"That is one point."
"The other point is respect for multiculturalism, for cultural diversity in our society, and I do believe that in some regions, languages spoken by migrants are also part of this cultural environment."
"That is the reality, and it must be taken into account when analyses are carried out and language diversity is subjected to academic study."
"Nonetheless, the priority, in my view, will continue to be supporting traditional languages and promoting multilingualism in our schools."
"Question No 27 by Joan Vallvé (H-0306/03):"
"Subject: Violence at football grounds"
"The subject of violence at football grounds is addressed in the Council Decision of 25 April 2002 concerning security in connection with football matches with an international dimension (2002/348/JHA"
"In response to the question by Mr Vallvé, the Commission must point out that it does not give an opinion on issues that are outside its remit."
"At present, the European Union does not have any direct competence as regards the organisation of sports events, or, at least, I should say that it does not yet have any such competences, as the Convention is currently looking at this issue."
"In this respect, the European Court of Justice has on several occasions recalled that sporting bodies have a broad degree of autonomy as regards the way in which they organise their competitions."
"As Mr Vallvé mentioned in his question, the European Union's official position on security at football matches has an international dimension and is set out in the Council Decision of 25 April 2002."
"This document does not contain any references to the subject raised in the question."
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for her response and her analysis of the future of sport in the European Union."
"As you know, the Union is made up of nation states but also of multinational states."
"In some of the latter, certain nations may have national teams, as is the case with Scotland and Wales."
"However, it is not the case with Catalonia."
"In future, we would like to see our national team participating in official competitions."
"We therefore thank you for your response, Commissioner, and we believe that in future the European Union, in its bid to recognise the cultural identities that exist throughout Europe, will have to allow these cultures to express themselves through sport."
"Mr President, Mr Vallvé is well aware of my love of the cultural diversity in the Union and the great wealth this diversity offers all Europeans."
"Naturally, Catalonia, with its language, its history and its wonderful culture, is part of this tradition of cultural diversity."
"As far as sport is concerned, I am afraid I cannot say any more than I have just said because it is up to the sporting bodies, whose autonomy is recognised by the Union through the Court of Justice, to resolve the issues raised by Mr Vallvé."
"While I do not have a photographer present like Mr Vallvé, I have a serious point to make about violence at football matches."
"Could the Commissioner tell me the latest position on the question of organised racist violence at football matches?"
"My own country, England, will shortly be playing a football match against a candidate country and risks being thrown out of the competition in question as a result of racism from its fans."
"While I know that this is the preserve of UEFA and not a matter directly for the Commission, I want to ask about the increase in racist violence at national and regional football matches, the fact that it is organised - often from the far right but not exclusively so - and whether the Commission would at least make a statement about this increase because, as the previous speaker said, sport is an expression of the culture and way of life of countries within the European Union."
"I am particularly worried about that expression from candidate countries where racism in football matches will be on the rise."
". The honourable Member is right."
"It is shocking to see how something which should be the expression of joy is distorted into the expression of rejecting other human beings."
"It is for this reason that, with the help of the European Parliament, the Commission has decided to make 2004 the European Year of Education through Sport."
"We would like to discuss this phenomenon in schools, clubs and society at large, and to speak about the true values of sports, which are about fair play, about recognising the other, about people reaching out their hand, not clenching their fist."
"I would like all Europeans - including Members of the European Parliament - to commit themselves during that year to getting that message across to young people in our Member States and in the enlarged Europe."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her response to Mr Vallvé."
"I would also like to voice my support for his request regarding national teams, although I did understand your message, Commissioner."
"As regards cultural diversity, Parliament has adopted several resolutions, one of which I hold particularly dear: that of 1989, which recognises that the Catalan language has a somewhat special role among the minority languages and which called on the Commission to publish a number of fundamental texts in our language, Catalan."
"My predecessor in this role, Mr Gorka Knörr, who is currently the Vice-President of the Basque Parliament - whom I am replacing for that reason - had raised the question of Basque."
"Why does Catalan enjoy minor status as a recognised language and why can Basque not have the same status?"
"Therefore, at the very moment when the Spanish authorities have shut down the only Basque newspaper, Egunkaria, I would like to ask you the reason for this difference in the status of Basque and Catalan."
"Commissioner, this question is not supplementary to the question on violence at football grounds; it bears no relation to it."
"Question No 28 by Theresa Zabell (H-0328/03):"
"Subject: Article on sport in the future Treaty"
"Can the Commission say what steps it has taken to ensure the inclusion of an article on sport in the future EU Treaty?"
"Reports concerning anti-doping measures in sport are more and more worrying and sportsmen are increasingly vulnerable."
"Can the Commission say what it knows about the new World Anti-Doping Code and what its opinion of it is?"
"There is sometimes good news even in politics, and I think that this is one example from the point of view at least of the work being carried out in the Convention."
"In fact, the inclusion of a Community competence in the field of sport is currently being considered by the Commission for its draft constitutional Treaty."
"Following the proposal by the Praesidium of the Convention to introduce such a competence under the areas of supporting actions, the Commission, through its representatives, Mr Barnier and Mr Vitorino, took the initiative of submitting a draft article to the Convention, to which my services and myself made a significant contribution."
"The draft constitutional Treaty, as it currently stands, incorporates the principles of the Commission's draft and includes competence for sport in Part III, Chapter V of the Treaty, areas where the Union may take coordinating, supplementary or supporting action: education, vocational training, youth and sport."
"Sport is therefore added."
"In this article, paragraphs 1 and 2 are specifically dedicated to sport, and I am very happy with this proposal, as with this article, the Union encourages the educational and social functions of sport without harmonising the laws and regulations of the Member States."
"Therefore, this new article, if included at last in the final Treaty, would also provide the response to the previous questions."
"The second part of the question relates to the new World Anti-Doping Code."
"As you know, the Commission welcomes all efforts to combat doping."
"However, there is no unique or miraculous solution that would enable us to resolve this problem."
"The World Anti-Doping Code will help to combat this scourge, but other measures are needed too."
"The Code is a preventive instrument, targeted at high-level sport."
"Nonetheless, it is important to be aware that the fight against doping should also cover the amateur sector and encompass issues of prevention, education and research."
"The Commission wants to emphasise that the issues covered by the Code are not directly within its remit, but it is following these developments very closely and will continue to keep a close eye on them."
"The Member States support the Code, and the Commission, which does not have an official position as this is an intergovernmental matter, is, instead, stepping up its efforts in the areas of education, prevention and legislation on sports foods."
"We have therefore established a form of complementarity: we help the Member States to reach agreement."
"Moreover - before the major meeting in Copenhagen on doping - a meeting of Sports Ministers was organised by the Commission in Brussels with a view to enabling Europe to speak with one voice."
"In these cases, however, it is the ministers who speak and not the Commission."
"Thank you for your reply, Commissioner."
"I would like to congratulate you on the good work you have done, because I believe that introducing sport into the future European Union Treaty is very important."
"It seemed very difficult, but all indications are that it will be achieved."
"I am reassured by the information you have given me, because I had seen certain proposals from international sporting organisations which really did not reassure me very much in terms of the inclusion of sport in the future Treaty, amongst other things, because, being rather difficult, we ran the risk of achieving nothing in the end."
"With regard to combating doping, my feeling is that, since the World Anti-Doping Agency was created, there is almost less control in this area then there was before."
"I would like to hear the Commissioner's opinion on this and on whether she believes it is necessary to rather reinvigorate the fight against doping at European level and, if possible, at world level."
"The honourable Member welcomes, as I do, the wisdom of the Convention members, who have actually included sport in the draft treaty, taking into consideration what the Union and Parliament have been saying on this subject for years."
"We have been talking about the social dimension and educational dimensions of sport for years."
"It is these dimensions which have been included in the draft treaty, not, I am glad to say, the excessive demands of certain sporting bodies."
"The wisdom of the Convention members has therefore prevailed over the demands of certain sporting organisations."
"At this point I should like to thank all the sportsmen and sportswomen and all the sporting organisations, including the President of the International Olympic Committee, who have been helping us for years in our aim of getting this article included in the treaty."
"I should also like to thank the Convention members, the Members of the European Parliament and all the national politicians who have contributed to this effort."
"As for the World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, it poses a few small problems, since among other things it is not based on international law and, therefore, neither are its proposals."
"The Agency is a body under private law, which does not make things any easier."
"As for controls, I do not know whether there are fewer now than before."
"Just about everybody tells me that there are too many, and that everyone is carrying out overlapping and contradictory controls, and that it would be better to concentrate them and to act logically and in accordance with Member States' laws."
"Many problems still have to be sorted out before a final solution is achieved."
"A World Anti-Doping Agency code is not enough."
"We need a change in, or an adaptation of, Member States' laws."
"Imagine a situation in which a sportsman is given a two-year suspension and appeals before a national court, and it turns out that the law of that State is not in accordance with the World Anti-Doping Agency code."
"The sportsman would be acquitted and we would find ourselves in complete chaos, and with even more uncertainty than before."
"I believe that we must decide, at last, to endeavour to strike a balance, to reform Member States' laws on doping and to obtain from the Union an assurance that it is committed to complementary action in the form of educational and preventive measures."
"Mr President, I am pleased to hear that the Commissioner is taking action in this area and I offer her my congratulations."
"On the issue of doping, I have a very specific question: time and again, when doping cases occur, it is pointed out that the athletes were not clear about the content of the products."
"A fairly simple measure which could be adopted - although it is admittedly not absolutely watertight in its effect - is to identify doping products on the label, perhaps by including a red dot or a red line on the packaging, in order to draw specific attention to the content and the risks associated with doping."
"Could the Commissioner take steps in this direction?"
". (DE) Mr President, Mr Ebner is right."
"We are responsible for the labelling of medicinal products."
"I have already spoken to my fellow-Commissioner Mr Byrne about ways in which we can label medicines in order to prevent such substances entering the body by chance - although as we know, something like that does not happen entirely by chance."
"However, we also know that it is not just medicinal products that are causing the problems, but also food additives, so this whole issue is fairly complex."
"However, if we want to control doping in Europe, we need a comprehensive list of the medicines and additives concerned, and this list must then be distributed - in collaboration with the sports associations - to the sportsmen and sportswomen themselves."
"Therefore I believe that providing information both to sports doctors and to athletes is extremely important."
"I also want, however, to point out that we do not just have a problem with professional athletes."
"For example, we carried out a study on fitness centres which revealed that even teenagers - primarily young men between 15 and 17 years of age - are taking banned substances because they have seen the older ones doing so and because these substances are freely available in some of these fitness centres."
"We are clearly dealing with a public health issue here, and in this respect, I believe that more political action is needed than we have seen to date."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I found out today that France has banned rugby."
"That is fine by me."
"However, my question is this: do you think that boxing is really a sport which should be encouraged, and do you think that boxing is especially conducive to the morals and ethical values of young people?"
". (DE) Mr President, I do have my own favourite sports, and I must say that boxing is not one of them."
"Has France banned rugby?"
"That is news to me."
"I need to check that and see why it has done so and what the underlying thinking was."
"As far as the rest is concerned - and this is the message to be sent out during the European Year of Education through Sport - I believe that sport is enjoyable; it brings people together, both as individuals and as nations, and it must seek solutions to social problems."
"It should not be a social problem itself."
"Thank you very much for your cooperation, Commissioner."
"Questions to Mrs Diamantopoulou"
"Question No 29 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0293/03):"
"Subject: Implementation of Council Directive 1999/70/EC by Greece"
"Presidential Decree 81/2003 transposes Directive 1999/70/EC"
"Mr President, Greece has indeed transposed the directive and very recently notified the Commission of the implementing legislation."
"The Commission is currently in the process of evaluating the transposition and will take a decision following a careful examination of the dossier."
"However, it is perfectly clear that, under clause 5 of the directive, the Member States must establish a framework to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term contracts."
"The directive gives the Member States a number of options as regards the application of this clause."
"They must introduce at least one of the following measures: objective reasons justifying the renewal of fixed-term contracts, maximum total duration of the contracts and number of renewals."
"A first reading of the presidential decree shows that article 5 makes provision for the above and that it expressly stipulates that the renewal of fixed-term contracts of employment is allowed if justified by an objective reason and examples of objective reasons are given."
"Of course, the Member States themselves determine what is meant by the term 'objective reasons'. However, the measures introduced must be adequate measures to prevent abuse."
"For example, the argument that work in the public sector per se is an objective reason for unlimited successive fixed-term contracts is unacceptable."
"There must be objective grounds based on the nature of the object."
"The Commission, as I said, intends to arrive at an evaluation of the transposition of the implementing legislation and to proceed to take any subsequent action required."
"Mr President, I appreciate the Commissioner's reply and I understand her position, given that she herself is from Greece."
"As she understood, the question does not concern the objective reasons and the implementation criteria, it concerns the scope."
"I have noted what she said about the public sector, but I should like to ask her: when does the Commission believe that it will have finished its evaluation of the scope of the directive and of what I consider to be the unacceptable exemptions being made for the public sector and certain industries?"
"There is legal chaos in Greece."
"We already have judgments from the courts of first instance in Patras and Larissa and from the court of appeal in Crete, which apply the directive and do not apply the presidential decree."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner if she could estimate when we shall have this opinion from the Commission."
"What we are trying to do is to present it as quickly as possible."
"All I need say to you is that we received it about 10 days ago."
"There are legal procedures, but there are also internal committee procedures."
"I believe that we shall be able to present our evaluation before the summer."
"Question No 30 by Paul Rübig (H-0302/03):"
"Subject: EU senior citizens' card"
"Today's senior citizens are active, dynamic and enjoy travelling - not only within their own country, but all over Europe."
"This makes the introduction of a European senior citizens' card useful and worthwhile. Such a card would allow the holder to pay the reduced rate for senior citizens for public amenities, museums and events etc. throughout the whole of Europe."
"This would not only support and encourage mobility, but would also increase general acceptance of the EU, and improve contact and understanding between individual Member States."
"Does the Commission feel it is possible or necessary to introduce an EU-wide senior citizens' card?"
"Mr President, several years ago, in 1989, the Commission issued a recommendation which it addressed to the Member States concerning the introduction of the European over-60s senior citizens' card."
"The Commission's recommendation at the time concerned the possibility of access for senior citizens to all resources provided by decision of the Member States to their own senior citizens, from museums and cultural activities to free subsidised transport."
"Of course, the technical obstacles to the introduction of this card proved to be quite considerable."
"To date three cost/benefit studies have been carried out, describing the systems which exist and the limitations to which they are subject, together with the obstacles which exist in numerous Member States."
"The final report from the last study was submitted to a contact group of representatives from the Member States for policies for senior citizens and to the association group of senior citizens' organisations."
"No Member State and none of the pan-European senior citizens' organisations in this group, to which the final study was submitted, supported the idea of the card or the proposals contained in the report."
"Consequently, the Commission does not consider the introduction of a senior citizens' card in the European Union to be feasible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Flemming, ladies and gentlemen, the senior citizens' card really should also be a symbol of the tremendous purchasing power enjoyed by senior citizens in Europe."
"We are all aware of the current strikes about the pensions reform."
"I think that the best practice model would be appropriate here too."
"We should demonstrate which kind of best-practice reforms have achieved the target most effectively."
"I would therefore like to ask you this: does the Commission have any thoughts on how to promote pensioners' power as consumers in future through best practice and benchmarks?"
"Mr President, it is not easy to give an answer at this precise moment to the question of whether there are global policies to strengthen the intervention of the purchasing power of senior citizens."
"They are consumers. We know that there is a very large section of the European population who are pensioners and well-off pensioners."
"These people really do have mobility at European level and participate in consumption, but the question was very specific and concerned the need for a card."
"It is a nice idea. I agree with you that this sort of card would facilitate the mobility of pensioners even more, but an idea also has to be adopted by those who will be called on to apply it and by those who will be called on to enjoy its advantages."
"At this precise moment, we see that there is no inclination either on the part of the Member States or on the part of senior citizens' organisations."
"Obviously, if there is any movement, we too shall act accordingly for our part, but I do not think that the Commission has any possibility of acting at present."
"Commissioner, age is the future for Europe and - I hope for you all - it is your own future too."
"I have already reached it: I am already seventy years of age."
"I am also very proud that the European Union, in Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, has the only constitution in the world to include a ban on discrimination on grounds of age."
"Yet this is no longer provided for in the Convention's draft."
"My question to you is this: do you see any possibility of bringing influence to bear, even at this stage, so that this unique ban on discrimination which currently exists in Europe can be included in the new constitution as well?"
"Both the text presented this precise moment to the Convention and the Charter of Fundamental Rights retain the wording concerning the issue of discrimination based on age intact."
"It is precisely the same wording which we had in article 13. It has not changed."
"It is an element of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and it refers to age, race, religion and sex."
"There has been no change to the sectors to which the area of discrimination refers."
"Question No 31 by Michl Ebner (H-0304/03):"
"Subject: Youth unemployment"
"Youth unemployment is a phenomenon deserving of serious attention and is indeed dealt with accordingly in the European Union; even greater significance will, however, need to be attached to it as a result of the accession of ten new countries as part of enlargement to the East."
"The Member States will in future be confronted with an influx of young people seeking work from the new Member States which will boost their own rates of unemployment."
"Is the EU equipped to cope with this imminent surge of arrivals?"
"Have specific projects already been drawn up?"
"What kind of assistance is the Commission providing and what objectives is it pursuing?"
"Naturally the European Commission has analysed the prospects and specific problems concerning youth unemployment in enlarged Europe."
"The first point concerns the fear of waves of immigrants."
"Usually, it is the youngest workers who move."
"Studies which we have carried out show that mobility from the 10 future Member States to the present European Union of the 15 will be relatively limited."
"It is estimated that there will be an outbreak in the first years, which will reach 250 000 people per annum, half of whom will be manpower, but that this mobility of manpower will start to decline towards the end of the decade to fewer than 100 000 people."
"Of course, these studies always have a significant number of forecasts. However, they are fairly convincing if you think that they have taken account of all the prevailing conditions in each of the Member States."
"Similarly, previous experience of enlargement in Europe and studies into the phenomenon of immigration suggest that young migrant workers from the new Member States will tend to migrate towards the wealthier areas of their own countries, to large towns where unemployment rates are relatively lower and there are relatively good prospects of finding work."
"Young people in these countries tend to opt first for their own towns and their own areas which are better developed, rather than choosing to go to another country."
"So much for the study of the phenomenon of immigration flows."
"The second point concerns transitional arrangements for the free movement of workers decided at European level."
"As you know, there is an agreement on the free movement of workers during the first two years."
"Following accession, each Member State can decide on free movement, but it can also postpone it for five years."
"This is the 5 + 2 rule."
"The third point concerns the strategy on employment, the application of policies in which the European Union has an added value."
"Here we must say that there has been cooperation here for three years between the European Commission and each of the candidate Member States, where essentially we are trying to support the creation of individualised action plans to combat unemployment."
"Considerable efforts are being made to include reducing the drop-out rate from school, which is a serious problem in many of these countries, and to prepare them so that, with the new generation of Structural Funds, there will be optimum investment in human resources."
"Thus, I repeat that my reply includes three basic categories of issues."
"Immigration flows and the study of the phenomenon with possible forecasts."
"The second is the institutional framework as configured at European level and the third is the application of policies on employment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like the latter part of your informative comments to be given added depth, especially with regard to the use of the Structural Funds in the field of education."
"You specifically raised the issue of school drop-outs."
"I think it would be very important for the European Union to focus especially on education and training, so that young people in the accession countries have a chance to benefit from suitable job opportunities in their own countries."
"It would also be important in psychological terms, in terms of the basic attitude in these countries, for young people to see that they have a chance in Europe and that Europe guarantees them this chance."
"For this reason, I am wondering whether it is possible, in terms of funding, to launch special measures via the Structural Funds."
"Mr Ebner, at this stage, a first round of discussions is being held for the next generation of the Structural Funds."
"The discussion also relates to which areas funding from European resources should be directed at and to the priorities of the sectors which have to be financed."
"There is broad agreement that high priority needs to be given to human resources."
"Without significant investment in human resources, there will be a problem with the take-up of funds, even for the projects, even for business support."
"Thus, the discussion is being directed to a large extent towards the fact that the candidate countries, as they are already doing, will have to prepare those structures with which they will be able to fund the employment strategy, to fund the infrastructures of their education systems and the reforms needed, all of which are very important to their development."
"It is not my feeling that, with the agreement that already exists, significant resources will be safeguarded for the new countries."
"As the Commissioner knows, she has made me a very happy man today, but hopefully she has made a lot of other people very happy too!"
"I am talking about the work in the Luxembourg Council today and the Atypical Workers Directive, which has not passed further."
"That is genuinely very important for youth employment opportunities."
"Many young people and young students rely upon temporary work for employment in between term times and they will therefore be as happy as I am at the lack of progress today."
"My question to the Commissioner is really will she consider - and I am only asking her to consider, not to commit herself - saying a final goodbye, rather than au revoir, to this directive?"
"If so, she will not only make me happier, but a lot of young people happier too."
". Mr Bushill-Matthews, would you accept the title of 'charming provocateur'?"
"It is true that today we were not greatly successful."
"However, as you know, the directive for temporary agency workers is a very difficult and complicated one."
"The central concept of this directive is to strike a balance between flexibility and security."
"I am not at all ready to say adieu."
"As I said in my press conference today it is an au revoir, not a 'goodbye'."
"Therefore you can expect a new phase with negotiations on this directive."
"Mr President, I should like to enter this very interesting debate and state that I agree with the answers the Commissioner has given."
"Nevertheless, I believe that the problem of unemployment amongst young people in Europe is almost a red herring since, if we are able to increase Europe's economic growth, we will be providing employment and we will need many young people. Consequently, the young people from the countries now joining the Union, who will be able to compete on the labour market of the current fifteen, are an asset and not a problem."
"There could certainly be a problem in the countries they leave behind."
"To put it briefly: economic growth plays a crucial role in a country's capacity to absorb young people and this growth and economic development must be of concern to everyone."
"Young immigrants are always an asset."
"Mr Bushill-Matthews is well aware that the contribution made by young Portuguese people and Portuguese immigrants has been crucial to the great prosperity that his country, Luxembourg, now enjoys."
"I totally agree with you, I only need give you a few figures."
"In order to achieve the objective of full employment in 2010, we need to create 22 million jobs for the 25 new countries, so that we arrive at unemployment throughout Europe in the order of 3.5% - 4%."
"Is this feasible?"
"As you quite rightly said, provided growth rates are achieved and the agreed reforms are applied, we have statistics from the past to show that we created 5 million jobs in the 15 countries alone over a four-year period."
"Thus a combination of growth and reform can indeed give the desired result."
"My second comment is that obviously the problem is in the countries from which immigrants come."
"We have the brain drain phenomenon, the fact that these countries are losing human resources at their most dynamic age, the cleverest, most spirited people, and it is very important for these countries to keep their human resources, which is also why our approach, especially with the Structural Funds, is to invest in human resources, especially at these ages."
"Question No 32 by Roy Perry (H-0316/03):"
"Subject: Misapplication of the Acquired Rights Directive with respect to British lecturers"
"The United Kingdom has stated by way of a letter to the Commission that it is removed from the field of application of Article 3(2) of the Acquired Rights Directive 77/187/EEC"
". I can assure you that the Commission is fully aware of the importance and seriousness of the issues at stake in relation to the complaint concerning the presumed wrong application of Directive 77/187/EEC following the transfer of colleges of further education in England and Wales to the private sector in the 1990s."
"Indeed, this has led to continuous correspondence with the Commission services since 1996."
"The honourable Member is probably aware of the fact that the Commission's legal analysis differs from that of the complainants."
"According to our information, the United Kingdom has now correctly transposed Directive 77/187/EEC into national legislation."
"Accordingly, disputes concerning incorrect application are, in principle, a matter for the national courts."
"Therefore the Commission services have stressed on several occasions over the years that the national courts constitute the appropriate legal framework for dealing with the issues raised in the case concerned."
"It should be recalled in this respect that the complainants have indeed addressed the national courts but without success."
"As far as the legally binding nature of collective agreements in the United Kingdom is concerned, I would like to point out that this is also a matter of interpretation of English law, often requiring a factual appreciation."
"The directive and, in particular Article 3(2), does not oblige a Member State to change the legal nature of collective agreements."
"Furthermore, even if, generally speaking, collective agreements are not legally binding in the United Kingdom, nothing prevents them from being legally binding if they are incorporated into an employment contract, thereby becoming part of the contractual terms."
"Whether or not this is the case is often a complex issue requiring a factual appreciation."
"Contrary to the conclusion reached by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the complainants' case, a recent judgment concerned such a binding collective agreement applicable in the National Health Service."
"In its judgment, the European Court of Justice explicitly acknowledged that it is for the national courts to determine, if necessary, whether benefits arising from a collective agreement bind the transfer and thus also bind the transferee under Article 3(2)."
"Accordingly, a non-enforceable collective agreement before the transfer will continue to remain non-enforceable after the transfer."
"."
"As you very well know, there are two different issues: first, the transposition of the directive and how we evaluate this transposition and, second, implementation."
"There have been thousands of pages of correspondence on this matter over many years."
"As far as the transposition is concerned, there is now a legal decision according to which this transposition is acceptable, and there is no problem with the government of the United Kingdom."
"On the second problem, implementation, it is for the national courts to decide whether it is implemented correctly or not, and there is a decision of the national courts, so the Commission cannot go further."
"I am grateful for what the Commissioner says in terms of compliance by the British Government."
"I have myself been approached on similar cases, particularly in relation to the exclusion of pension rights from being fully protected under the Acquired Rights Directive, as in the case of a company in Boreham Wood in my constituency."
"I wonder if the Commissioner, looking forward, might learn some lessons from the case raised by my colleague and myself in terms of future reviews of the directive even if further action under the current rules appears not to be possible."
". No, there is nothing in the pipeline concerning the changes in this Directive."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou."
"As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 33 to 55 will be replied to in writing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with your permission, I should like, first of all, to thank the President, Mr Pat Cox, for his kind invitation, for the quality of the welcome that has been given to my delegation and to me personally, and for the words which he has kindly spoken about me and about the Algerian people, which demonstrate the strong links which unite us with the people of Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking to you at a time when the people of Algeria are still seeking to eradicate the consequences of the disastrous earthquake which has plunged them into mourning, to heal the wounds and the traumas caused by this catastrophe and to rebuild the ruins and to restore life to the towns and villages which were destroyed."
"I am most anxious to express our profound gratitude for the gestures of solidarity and sympathy which the European Parliament made to us, and for the assistance of all kinds which was immediately sent to the disaster area by the countries of Europe."
"This spontaneous show of solidarity has been a great comfort to the people of Algeria, and I should like, on their behalf, on behalf of the families that have been so sorely tried, to express once again our feelings of intense gratitude to all those who have been at our side throughout this cruel affliction."
"Mr President, on 22 April 2002 at Valencia, in Spain, Algeria and the European Union, by solemnly signing their Association Agreement, set the seal on a new and sustainable relationship for a future of solidarity and cooperation."
"This agreement represents a genuine economic anchor binding Algeria to the European Community, and it is an illustration of our consistent desire - a desire which is shared by our European partners - to base our relationship on the essential values of mutual respect, shared prosperity and friendship."
"The undertaking that we gave together on that occasion opens up broad prospects for intensifying the political dialogue between Algeria and the European Union, in the interests of a global partnership which we are hoping will be in line with our expectations."
"Was it not an omen that the Treaty of Rome was signed by a France which had full and entire sovereignty over an Algeria which was already into its third year of the war of national liberation and which was nevertheless still divided into three French départements?"
"Was there, at that time, a single signatory State to the Treaty of Rome which had the good taste and presence of mind to express reservations in favour of our country which was occupied and struggling to gain national liberty?"
"This undertaking is in line with my country's consistent attitude in favour of privileged cooperation with Europe, as is demonstrated by the gamble taken by Algeria in making Europe, right from the beginning of the seventies, its major energy market."
"Algeria committed itself very early on in that respect, via the construction of gas pipelines through Italy and Spain, to the path of long-term cooperation with Europe, thereby giving an expression to a fundamental act of faith in European integration and in future prospects for cooperation with the European continent."
"All this goes to show the importance that my country has always attached to the promotion of political dialogue and an economic partnership with the European Union, and I can only say how much I welcome the fact that the signing of our Association Agreement has strengthened our conviction."
"Traditionally, we have held regular political consultations with the European Union, a lively and constructive dialogue involving the exchange of many delegations of political parties and members of parliament, who have helped to introduce a climate of understanding into our relationship as a result of a mutual desire to know one another better in order to be better able to cooperate."
"Mr President, in this troubled time for international relations, the Euro-Mediterranean region is facing major challenges of different kinds, which are in danger of aggravating the instability factors and the fracture lines between the two shores of the Mediterranean Sea."
"Europe's southern Mediterranean coast is the soft underbelly of Europe, as an eminent leader of the twentieth century once said."
"It was precisely in order to address this situation and to arm ourselves in advance against these dangers that, together, seven years ago now, we launched the pioneering Barcelona process, with which all the countries surrounding the Mediterranean were to associate themselves."
"For Algeria, such a process remains a key reference framework, as well as an essential forum for political dialogue and cooperation, and also an instrument which is relevant to the promotion of stability and security throughout the whole of the Mediterranean basin."
"By its objectives, and by the actions which it envisaged, it gave rise to great hopes among the peoples on the southern shore of the Mediterranean basin."
"Today those hopes assume even greater significance at a time when the enlargement of the European Union towards Eastern Europe is in danger of diverting the attention of European countries away from the south towards the east, thereby displacing the real centre of interest of the Barcelona process."
"For my part, I remain convinced that the enlargement of Europe ought to be a source of precious political inspiration, enabling us to imagine innovative concepts of cooperation between Europe and the countries south of the Mediterranean, and calming legitimate fears of the risk of Europe's distancing itself from its neighbours to the south."
"It is all a question of balance, and I am sure that the European Union will be able to reconcile its various demands which, let us not forget, also influence the stability and the security of the continent of Europe."
"Is it not true to say that, twice in its history, my country has found itself, all too unwillingly, involved in two world wars which had Europe as their principal theatre of action, and that, ever since Sedan, Algeria has taken part in all France's wars?"
"The Euro-Mediterranean project into which we have launched ourselves without hesitation implies, on the part of everyone, a total commitment to the implementation of the objectives set out in the Barcelona Declaration."
"In this context, our action must take into account the interests of all the partners involved, and must respond to our many and varied concerns."
"Consequently, it must be global, balanced and multi-dimensional."
"Mr President, the emergence of the new context of globalisation had allowed us to hope that growth and development would occur at the same rate."
"The countries of the South agreed to many sacrifices, often under duress, in order to be a part of this development of the world economy, and adapting to this new situation has often involved painful adjustments and given rise to burdensome social repercussions."
"It has to be admitted now that the promised prospects have, so far, become a reality only in the wealthy countries."
"The split between rich and poor countries is becoming increasingly wide."
"It is currently a source of deprivation, a source of violence and a source of intolerance, accompanied by other social scourges such as rural exodus and population migration."
"As part of the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area, we are obliged to implement, within relatively short time limits, far-reaching changes to our economic and social system."
"That represents an enormous challenge and involves huge upheavals in our social and economic structures."
"We cannot hope to succeed in making these changes unless the Association Agreement allows the Algerian economy, which is already stretched as a result of the reforms that have been carried out over the past decade, to acquire the means to become integrated, gradually and harmoniously, into the world economy, and to acquire the added value which will give it full credibility, particularly from the point of view of increasing the flow of European investment."
"Despite the difficulties which I have just mentioned, Algeria has launched a huge programme to boost the economy, and has provided funding in the form of USD 7 billion over a period of four years."
"This is barely enough, in view of the size of the reforms underway."
"The support of the European Union is absolutely essential at this particular stage, especially in the form of a sustained commitment to keep investments flowing."
"I am afraid that the financial support measures allotted to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership as part of the MEDA programme fall well short of expressed expectations."
"An example is the budgetary appropriations allocated to Algeria for the first and, in particular, the second tranches of the MEDA bilateral programme."
"Mr President, the last 12 years have been an appalling nightmare for the Algerian people, who, while suffering the violence of a particularly cruel form of terrorism, have also had to cope with natural disasters, with droughts lasting several years, with floods, and with several earthquakes, the latest of which has just devastated the area around Algiers."
"Although international solidarity was spontaneously and generously shown on the occasion of the last two natural disasters, the people of Algeria have, by contrast, had to live with the feeling that they had been abandoned to their fate during the whole of the time that they were subjected to the extortion, destruction and massacres perpetrated by terrorists who - most cruelly of all - claimed to be motivated by religion."
"The developed world has taken a long time to understand the threat posed by this phenomenon, which has usurped the mantle of ideological respectability and used democracy as a means of persuading European opinion that it has the right to destroy Algerian society."
"These terrorist organisations have even found asylum and freedom to act in certain capital cities of Europe, where the massacres in Algeria were still giving rise to questions and doubts which showed a total ignorance of the internal situation of the country and of the threat that it represented to the rest of the world."
"It was only after the events of 11 September 2001 in the United States that the world's perception changed and it became possible to envisage terrorism as an international scourge against which it would be necessary to engage in a merciless battle on a worldwide scale."
"I think I can say that, at that moment, the situation in Algeria became better understood and the sacrifices borne by the Algerian people were at last fully appreciated."
"Terrorism is a threat to the very foundations of civilised human society."
"As a matter of urgency we must put an end, finally, to this nihilistic culture of terrorism."
"However, it is even more important to mount a thorough campaign not only against the manifestations of terrorism, but above all against its causes, its roots, and everything that gives it sustenance."
"This world will never build anything solid or lasting unless it bears this objective firmly in mind as a major priority."
"However, deprivation engenders violence, and unless you wage war on poverty, poverty will wage war on you."
"In that case we shall never fully enjoy the happiness of a peaceful and secure world."
"After 12 years of struggle, the security situation in our country has improved considerably, but it still requires the measures of vigilance and protection made necessary by the isolated acts of violence which occur from time to time."
"The policy of civil concord and national reconciliation which I introduced as soon as I took office has made a very significant contribution towards calming social tensions, and has reduced terrorist violence to its lowest ever level."
"Today, that violence no longer constitutes an obstacle to the resumption of economic activity and growth, or to national or foreign investment."
"In the same way, political life has come into its own again, and last year saw several important steps regarding the organisation of legislative elections and the holding of local elections - both of which showed crystal-clear and total transparency - and the constitutional amendment which enabled Amazigh to be elevated to the status of a national language."
"Our willingness to create a state subject to the Rule of Law, which respects the rules of democracy and which respects political pluralism, has once again been reinforced by these democratic advances."
"The Algerian Government remains convinced that the deepening of the democratic process and the acceleration of economic and social reforms will allow the emergence and the strengthening of a civil society which is capable of making its contribution to the progress of Algerian society, while respecting the rights and the duties of each individual."
"In this context, the overall approach of the Government tends to give automatic preference to dialogue and consultation and to make them not only the instrument of political and social regulation but also a powerful factor in promoting vital political and social consensus."
"In this dialogue-centred approach, economic and social problems, and the numerous social claims which form the corollary to those problems, assume a special place because of the enormous constraints burdening a national economy which finds itself in the process of changing and of opening up to the demands of the market economy."
"It is by no means easy to evolve from a planned economy into a liberal economy, any more than it is easy to evolve from political dirigisme to democratic openness."
"What is more, the market economy, like democracy, originates from a culture which cannot be imposed."
"At another level, the consolidation of a State subject to the rule of law also comes about through a commitment to reform education, the structures of the State, and the justice system."
"In this context, the revision of the penal code and of the penal-procedure code which Algeria has started work on is intended to provide more guarantees regarding the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the press, to which we remain fundamentally committed, seeking in this way to reinforce the ethics of the associated professions."
"In our countries, too much 'state' is an aberration."
"The decline of the state, however, leads to catastrophe and anarchy."
"The issue of human rights is one of our main concerns."
"It is included in the steps that we are taking to consolidate a State subject to the rule of law."
"We are aware of our imperfections in this area, but we all know that in any society respect for human rights requires a long apprenticeship which leads to a true human-rights culture."
"We are seriously committed to that, and we are persevering in our commitment."
"The creation of the National Consultative Committee for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights is a response to this major concern, and demonstrates our willingness to move forward in this area."
"The Association Agreement which now links us to the European Community will enable us to multiply our contacts and exchanges with European countries, and I am convinced that this will lead us towards a strengthening of the democratic tendencies in our own country, and towards a greater openness towards the human-rights culture."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is this the place, is this the time?"
"I believe that it is, and I do so in good faith."
"It is therefore with painful emotion that I again refer to the memory of the victims of the crisis that our country has experienced, assuring their families, as I stand before you here, of the compassion that all Algerian people feel towards them in their pain."
"The international community has also shown its sympathy and compassion towards them."
"Immediately after the dreadful earthquake which shook several provinces, or wilayas, of the country, I asked the Algerian authorities to mobilise all civil and military resources without delay to cope with this national disaster."
"The very next day, the Council of Ministers passed the necessary emergency decisions, which the Government immediately implemented."
"Thus the People's National Army, the Security Corps, the civil defence authorities, the medical and paramedical services, Sonelgaz, the Algerian water authority and the other major public services, with an acute sense of duty, mobilised all their available human and material resources and united their efforts in order to cope with the crisis and with the tragic situation with which the country was suddenly faced."
"As I speak to you here today I should like to express my gratitude, in particular, for the tremendous upsurge of national solidarity which emerged spontaneously throughout the country on the part of all our citizens, and in particular our young people, who were so keen to bring to their brothers in distress the support of the whole nation."
"I also wish to emphasise how great has been the international solidarity, which shows the esteem in which Algeria is held today and the respect which is felt for the Algerian people."
"All the countries, large and small, rich and less rich, to whom I now express my gratitude, in addition to the telephone calls and the messages of condolence and sympathy sent to me, have expressed their willingness to provide any material aid which our country needs, and have been anxious to show their sincere and brotherly solidarity in the form of practical gestures, which the entire Algerian population particularly appreciates."
"In this respect I should like to pay particular homage to all those specialist rescue teams, from countries which are our brothers and our friends, who, alongside the People's National Army, the civil defence authorities and the Algerian medical teams, have done a splendid and remarkable job of work and have provided us with assistance which is greatly appreciated in these difficult times."
"This extraordinary chain of national and international solidarity has been remarkably well supported by the great majority of the media who have done everything possible to provide, in this case, a real public service, making their communication and broadcasting resources available to the families of the victims."
"In these sad circumstances I must emphasise that the state has done its duty, the government has assumed its responsibilities, the public institutions and services have played their part and the civilian and military agents of the state, the local authorities and the public establishments and enterprises have done what was required of them."
"I have personally been at pains to supervise personally the smooth running of operations to assist the victims and the implementation of measures of all kinds adopted in this field, and to verify that all the institutions in the country are remaining mobilised for this purpose."
"Finally, I should like to turn my thoughts to the people who have suffered, and who have met this terrible ordeal with exemplary courage and dignity, and I should like to say to them, speaking from this House with you as witnesses, that we shall take it upon ourselves to reconstruct the areas affected by the earthquake."
"The Algerian people have demonstrated, yet again, that solidarity to them is not an empty word, and that they will find in themselves the strength and the capacity to overcome this new ordeal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, facing Europe, the African continent is seeking a way of escaping from its under-developed position and, like the European continent, it is trying to achieve unity through better coordination of its efforts and better use of its resources."
"This ambitious undertaking is intended to be based on a vast economic programme which is currently known by the name of NEPAD, and which the leaders of Africa have once again presented to the Heads of State of the G8 countries at their meeting in Évian."
"I raise this question because I know the interest that Europeans show in everything that relates to Africa and the sympathy that they have always shown towards the efforts of Africans to participate in world development."
"In Africa, development, which has been called the 'new name of peace', has for a long time now been more familiar with the inhibiting burdens of selfishness than with the generous outbursts of a dynamic concept of interdependence between nations."
"The so-called 'lost decades' for developing countries have been followed by more of the same, and the spectres of poverty, famine and pandemic diseases constantly reappear in Africa."
"The countries of Africa have learned much from their failures and their mistakes, in their economic and social choices and in the implementation of particularly restrictive structural adaptation programmes."
"It is thus having come to the end of a path rich in lessons that we find ourselves contemplating the possibility of effective African integration, conceived as a long-term, complex and multi-dimensional undertaking and supported by the cooperation of the world outside."
"It is a possibility because Africa has courageously brought about a revolution in attitudes in order to ensure a future of democracy, peace and prosperity."
"The decision taken at the Algiers Summit of the Organisation of African Unity, establishing an African doctrine for the disqualification and rejection of anti-constitutional changes in political regimes, was a historic decision, marking an important stage in Africa's development."
"In the same spirit, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (now known as NEPAD) defines new methods of operation, based on specifically African efforts characterised by responsibility and solidarity, such as Peer Review, which is a system whereby each African Head of State voluntarily submits his internal actions to the calm and rigorous assessment of his peers."
"For its part, the institutional architecture of the African Union includes provisions intended to ensure that the nature and democratic operation of national governments are equipped to deal with any attacks and attempts to pervert them, so that joint African action is in line with rules which no one is allowed to infringe."
"In this context, it is of the utmost importance that we should really turn globalisation into an opportunity for the development of the countries of the South, by the encouragement of new forms of partnership, capable of unleashing the dynamics of sustainable growth and development."
"From this point of view, it must be possible for globalisation, which takes the form of a remarkable contraction in space and time, to become more human and more democratic, because unless the equal participation of all the actors in the great movements of contemporary history is encouraged, globalisation will intrinsically involve the risk of giving free rein to violent forces hostile to the cohesion of national societies and of international society."
"The tragic events of 11 September 2001, which brought the horror to its climax, demonstrate the truth that, in the world of today and tomorrow, there can be no sanctuary of security and prosperity in an environment of vulnerability, disorder and destitution."
"When international debate covers up legitimate concerns in order to sanction the status quo, when the logic of power relationships carries more weight than mutual understanding, when the voice of reason is stifled or ignored on the international scene, extremists will find an inexhaustible source of nourishment in the injustices, disappointments and frustrations that people experience in their daily lives."
"Fundamentally, the response to the phenomena of violence lies in the proper management of international relationships and the promotion of human rights, in their indivisibility and universality at worldwide level."
"This presupposes that the international community will abandon its former practices and open itself up to new horizons, in the search for a better-quality destiny for the human race."
"It also presupposes that Africa will receive its fair share of the benefits of the growth of the world economy, and will become a centre of attraction for the flows of capital and technologies in which it is so cruelly lacking, so that it can assume primary responsibility for its own development and contribute to the greater equilibrium of the emerging international community."
"We should like to believe that the meeting in Évian has amplified this message and that the G8 countries have confirmed their faith in the recovery of Africa and renewed their determination to give it all their support in the best-understood interests of everyone."
"Algeria is one of the African countries which founded NEPAD, and its activities on the African political scene reflect the major role that it plays in accepting responsibility for and solving the problems which arise in our continent."
"A new dynamic is emerging in Africa, whether it is concerned with settling conflicts, deepening the democratic process, improving governance, strengthening institutional capacities or being more ready to accept responsibility for the human dimension of development."
"On a smaller scale, we are working with our other partners in North Africa to give substance to the Arab Maghreb Union, of which Algeria currently holds the presidency."
"I personally have faith in the future of the AMU."
"I have taken on the task of remodelling it on sound and secure foundations."
"I have not given up hope of being able, soon, to convene an AMU summit, which will enable us to re-launch sub-regional cooperation."
"Algeria remains attached to this objective, which cannot be made conditional upon the settlement of the Western Sahara question, which is an issue that requires, in the last analysis, the application of international legality and the implementation of the United Nations settlement plan, to which we are continuing to lend our support."
"The role of the UN remains central here, as does the holding of the absolutely essential referendum on self-determination."
"Recent developments in the Middle East, a region which is so sensitive and which has suffered so much, constitute a forceful challenge to all of us, because of the serious threat that they represent to stability and security in the region and to peace in the world."
"Deprived of their most basic rights, the people of Palestine continue to suffer the horrors of a brutal occupation which has lasted too long, and they are paying a heavy toll faced with Israel's intransigence and its systematic stubbornness in opposing any peace initiative, the latest of which, the 'roadmap', has given rise to no less than fourteen major reservations from Israel, which completely destroy the - albeit very modest - substance of the plan."
"It is high time that the international community and, in particular, the United Nations Security Council, pulled itself together and acceded to the legitimate claim of the Palestinian people finally to have their own independent State, ..."
"(Applause) ... in the context of respect for the rights of all the peoples of the region to live in peace and security."
"We hope that the unacceptable intransigence and repeated demands of Israel will not result in the failure of this latest attempt at a settlement represented by the 'roadmap' of the Quartet, despite the somewhat diffident nature of its content."
"It is also time that those Syrian and Lebanese territories that are still under Israeli occupation were evacuated and returned to their legitimate rulers."
"The situation in Iraq is also a source of great concern in the Arab world."
"On this issue, Algeria remains in favour of the strict observance of law and of international legality."
"It now believes that the political stabilisation of Iraq will be achieved by re-establishing the sovereignty of the country, ... (Applause) ... and that the international community, represented by the United Nations, must be effectively involved in any process of political rehabilitation and reconstruction in Iraq."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have tried to paint you a picture of the situation in Algeria and of certain other issues, both internal and international, which are a source of concern to us."
"I have tried to promote a better understanding of the situation in Algeria, a situation which Members of the European Parliament can always appreciate for themselves by coming to visit our country, where they are always welcome and where we shall be happy to receive them and very happy to listen to their comments and above all to their advice."
"These exchanges, which are based on mutual confidence as well as an already established friendship, are more essential than ever now that we are linked by an Association Agreement which strengthens our solidarity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me once again to thank you for the welcome that you have given to my delegation and to me, and for having been willing to give your attention to what I have to say."
"From this platform I say, with your permission, that my country too is made either to succeed or to learn from its misfortunes."
"One day soon, in a national upsurge of reconciliation between Algerians, the fields of hope will be green again, and the orchards will once more be covered in blossom."
"The winds of adversity and of national discord will be conquered, without a doubt, by the grace of God and thanks to the tenacity of the Algerian people, tempered like steel by suffering, and, in an increasingly interdependent and mutually supportive world, thanks to the help and the support of the international community."
"(Loud applause)"
"President Bouteflika, I should like to thank you for your official visit to the European Parliament, a visit, as I have already emphasised, without equal and therefore a first."
"I should like to thank you for your fascinating speech which has touched us all and to which we have listened with a great deal of interest."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the formal sitting is closed."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0154/2003), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on transboundary movements of genetically-modified organisms [15546/1/2002 C5-0081/2003 2002/0046(COD)] [Rapporteur: Mr Sjöstedt]."
". (SV) Thank you, Mr President."
"When the Cartagena Protocol was successfully negotiated in 2000, this was a significant success for the European Union."
"It was also a success for all those of us who want free trade to be conducted in the context of environmental concern and respect for consumers."
"The protocol clarifies the conditions for global trade involving genetically-modified products."
"To date, 49 countries have ratified the protocol."
"It is only necessary for one country to ratify the protocol for it to come into force."
"The draft law we are now to debate lays down EU rules for the export of genetically-modified organisms."
"In adopting these rules, the European Union fulfils the requirements laid down in the Cartagena Protocol."
"These new rules are coming at precisely the right time, and they may perhaps also serve as a model and inspiration for states that are working on their regulations right now."
"Compared with the proposal tabled by the Commission, the rules we are to adopt tomorrow are a little stricter and clearer."
"They are more in line with what is laid down in the protocol and, in certain areas, go still further."
"In Parliament, we have focused on tightening up the proposal in certain key areas."
"We have made sure that rules and definitions shall not be looser than what is laid down by the protocol and that express approval by the country of import shall always be required before the export takes place."
"The draft law now makes this crystal-clear, explaining that the absence of a response from the country of import may never be viewed as 'silent consent'."
"The legislation of the country of import must always be respected."
"The proposal makes it clear that we must not export anything from the EU that is not permitted within the EU and that there must be considerable transparency, with the public being given information about the export taking place."
"The proposal also makes it plain that responsibilities must be clearly distributed so that it is the actual exporter who gives notice of the export."
"Overall, the text we are now to adopt means that the European Parliament has obtained a hearing for approximately 80% of what we wanted to get through at first reading."
"We have also discussed this proposal with the Council of Ministers."
"COREPER has already adopted the text we are to adopt tomorrow."
"In this way, we can avoid conciliation, and the legislation will be ready when the protocol comes into force globally."
"That has been possible thanks to a significant consensus between the Council of Ministers and Parliament."
"There has also been a clear willingness to compromise and a shared desire on the part of the political groups to work quickly."
"This has happened following constructive cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, whom I would thank, one and all."
"We have also had very close cooperation firstly with the Danish and then with the Greek Presidencies."
"They too deserve thanks, and the same applies to those with responsibility at the Commission's Environment Directorate-General, who have been of very great help."
"By adopting these rules, we show that environmental considerations and respect for developing countries' legislation are key concepts for the EU's view of the global trade in genetically-modified products."
"There is a need to do this at the very time when the United States is pushing for issues of this kind to be resolved within the World Trade Organisation."
"We have recently seen examples of how this country has dumped genetically-modified food in countries that do not permit such food in their own national legislation."
"This shows very clearly how important it is for the EU to adopt rules right now that indicate a more responsible, credible and long-term approach to these complex and very controversial issues."
"."
"(SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Sjöstedt, in Swedish, for his excellent work on this very complex issue."
"It is an issue of great importance not only for us Europeans but also for the rest of the world, especially the developing countries."
". Mr President, the proposal on the table today is linked to the recent ratification by the European Community of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety."
"The overall purpose, as we have heard already, of this United Nations agreement is to establish common rules to be followed in transboundary movements of GMOs in order to protect biodiversity and human health at world level."
"The European Union has to fulfil its international obligations, which means transposing into our own legislation the provisions of the Biosafety Protocol."
"This is the objective of the proposal we are discussing today."
"The Commission has already expressed its reservations on some political points of this procedure, particularly since the common position agreed in the first reading goes well beyond the provisions of the Biosafety Protocol on a substantial number of issues."
"Despite its reservations, the Commission is willing to cooperate on the basis of the package of compromise amendments we have on the table today, in order to increase the chances of reaching agreement at the second reading."
"Therefore, in a spirit of compromise, the Commission will not oppose the package."
"However, the Commission still believes that it might have been better to adhere more closely to the provisions of the protocol in order not to impose an excessive burden on Community exporters."
"Nevertheless, the Commission considers that it is important to progress swiftly in order to have the implementing legislation adopted before the protocol enters into force."
"This will be soon, as Mr Sjöstedt said, since 49 countries have already ratified it and the deposit of 50 instruments of ratification is required for its entry into force."
"I would like to stress that the European Union has been a key player in these international negotiations from the very beginning."
"I remember this vividly since that is what I had to start with as a new Commissioner."
"We need to send a clear signal that we intend to honour our commitments and be in a position to fully implement the protocol as soon as it enters into force, which should now be a matter of months."
"The Commission is in a position to support the package of amendments submitted for the approval of the Parliament as part of a compromise."
"The package consists of Amendment Nos 19-26."
"Let me just comment briefly on some of the amendments from the package to illustrate the Commission's position."
"Amendment No 19 does recognise the need to respect the party or non-party of imports that can be regulated by your safety framework, consistent with the protocol."
"This is in line with the position taken on numerous occasions by the Commission in international forums, which is to respect the right of countries to a free informed choice with regard to GMOs."
"So the Commission can accept Amendment No 19."
"It can accept Amendments Nos 24-26 on improved public access to information regarding transboundary movements of GMOs, which is in line with the general framework of public access to environmental information and with Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment."
"Amendments Nos 21 and 22 impose an obligation to wait for prior written consent before proceeding with the export of GMOs."
"The Commission believes that this goes beyond the Biosafety Protocol and is also the only amendment in the package about which the Commission had some serious reservations."
"However, as part of the overall compromise, the Commission can agree to both amendments."
"By way of conclusion, I would like to say that Parliament has worked in a swift and transparent manner in close cooperation with the Commission and the Council."
"Once again, therefore, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sjöstedt, for his efforts."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to start by thanking our rapporteur Mr Sjöstedt very warmly for his cooperation, which was positive and fair."
"However, my thanks are due equally to the Commission, the Danish and of course particularly the current Greek Presidency, which worked with great commitment to achieve a compromise between the Parliament and the Council."
"We are all keen to avoid a conciliation procedure for this report, for it deals, after all, with the transposition of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and the protection of biological diversity, which is a subject close to everyone's heart."
"The European Union was indeed a key player in the negotiations on the Cartagena Protocol."
"This makes it all the more important to transpose the Protocol swiftly into Community law now, thus sending out a clear political signal of our continued commitment."
"The main priority of the draft before us is to find a solution, which has eluded us until now, to the issue of EU exports of living GMOs to third countries."
"Here, practicability must be the key imperative."
"We must achieve realistic legislation that can be applied in practice."
"This is why I am pleased that the Council has not incorporated, in this regulation, a number of amendments proposed at first reading, for example on the inclusion of aids."
"These amendments aimed to intervene in pending legislative processes through this report on the transposition of the Cartagena Protocol."
"By 'pending legislative processes', I mean the legislation on genetically-modified food and feed, their labelling and traceability."
"We debated and voted on this matter at second reading in committee just two weeks ago."
"The outcome was very close; opinions diverge widely and it still remains to be seen how the plenary will finally vote in July."
"It would therefore be quite wrong to try to anticipate the outcome."
"A vote on the environmental liability regulation has only just taken place at first reading as well."
"A final decision on this issue is certainly not yet in sight."
"For this reason, any statement on the liability issue in connection with traceability of GMOs and aids in the current report on transboundary movement had to be emphatically rejected."
"These issues have nothing to do with the transposition of the Cartagena Protocol into Community law."
"However, relevant amendments from the first reading did not make it to this second reading either."
"I am pleased that the Council has decided in principle to adopt my amendments on exemptions to the system of notification and information for GMOs in transit and in closed systems."
"We really do need these exemptions to ensure that there are no impediments to research."
"The Council has also made it clear that the so-called Advanced Informed Agreement procedure set out in the Cartagena Protocol should only apply to first movements."
"Conversely, this provides an exemption to the information procedure for GMO exports to a third country, if this third country has already given approval to another country for the import of the same GMO."
"These exemption provisions are necessary since the AIA procedure, as the information procedure in this case, does not promise any enhanced safety and would simply obstruct transboundary movement unnecessarily."
"I believe that the report before us, with all the compromises that we have drafted, is good and viable, and would ask all of you to vote for all the compromise amendments."
"This will set us on the right course and avoid a lengthy conciliation procedure."
"Mr President, I should also like to say a big thank-you to Mr Sjöstedt for his outstanding work on putting into effect the Catagena Protocol on Biosafety in Europe."
"Mr Sjöstedt has shown considerable openness and a very great desire to achieve results, but I also think that the Commission and the Council - during both the Danish and Greek Presidencies - have made very positive contributions so that we can now avoid protracted discussion in the Conciliation Committee."
"I think that the developing countries, in particular, are well protected. They are in the position of being able to exercise genuine choice in connection with the import of GMO products, even though they may of course be thought to be exposed to quite aggressive marketing from parts of industry."
"By far the majority of Parliament's amendments have been accepted, and this means we can have the Catagena Protocol put into effect without its wording being weakened for political reasons - on the contrary, with the wording of the protocol being tightened up in certain respects."
"This means, for example - and I see this as the most important thing of all - that there can be no export of GMOs without the express consent of the country of import."
"It is not enough that there should be no reaction, and this cannot be interpreted as tacit consent."
"Express consent is also required, something that I think has been quite crucial in these negotiations."
"In my opinion, the result makes an important contribution to the overall complex of laws that we shall now soon have on the subject of GMOs and that are designed to protect our health but, above all, to protect biodiversity, even though the ability genetically to manipulate the products of nature has opened the way for doing so."
"This is, however, a constructive contribution to the overall picture."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am very pleased that it has been possible to achieve a common position between the Council, the Commission and Parliament here."
"It would have been very sad if no consensus had been reached on such an important issue."
"As Mr Lund has already mentioned, the Council initially agreed unanimously that the exporters must have the approval of the importing country before they undertake the first transboundary movement."
"However, in order to meet the Commission halfway, the Council and the Parliament then voted in favour of the requirement for this approval to be provided in writing prior to the first transboundary export of a GMO."
"It was also possible to reach a consensus between the Parliament, the Council and the Committee with regard to the exporters' notification documents."
"The exporter is required, for a period of a minimum of five years, to keep a record of the notification and the acknowledgement of receipt from the competent authority of the importing country."
"He is also obliged to forward these documents to the authority of the Member State from which the GMO is exported and to the Commission."
"The Commission then makes these documents available to the public in compliance with the European regulations on access to environmental information."
"This new-found consensus between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission will, I believe, give the public the opportunity to be informed at all times about everything that happens."
"I am certainly convinced that these provisions will be effective."
"I hope very much that this new European regulation will overcome much of the public's mistrust of GMOs."
"Mr President, I too would like to pay very warm tribute to the rapporteur."
"This regulation is a great success."
"It means that the eight remaining Member States yet to ratify the Protocol can now begin the process."
"The Protocol will therefore come into force very soon, marking the start of a new era in international environmental law, an era of international genetic technology law."
"The Biosafety Protocol is the first international treaty to regulate genetic technology, and it does so explicitly and exclusively."
"It is to be hoped that the voices still raised to dispute that there is any difference between genetically-modified and conventionally bred organisms will at last fall silent."
"This House has greatly improved the regulation before us on numerous points, often in exemplary cooperation with the Council."
"On many key points, the regulation goes far beyond what is required by the Biosafety Protocol itself."
"The fact that all groups support the compromise reached is therefore encouraging and a hopeful sign for the implementation of future environmental agreements."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am now faced with the very difficult, if not impossible, task of finding something new to say."
"Everything has already been said, but not yet by everyone."
"I shall therefore follow everyone else's lead and express my warm thanks to the rapporteur for the good work and positive cooperation."
"I would also like to congratulate him on his excellent substantive work, as well as on his great sensitivity during the negotiations, which enabled us to achieve a compromise among the parliamentary groups and among the European institutions."
"I think that is absolutely crucial."
"It has already been said repeatedly here today that the speedy entry into force of the Cartagena Protocol is naturally an issue that is close to everyone's hearts."
"However, I do not want to pass up the opportunity to express my great regret that the largest exporter of genetically-modified organisms, namely the United States, again remains outside the frame on such a key issue, where global multilateral regulations are essential."
"We face a major political challenge, that of convincing our counterparts in the United States of the need for such regulation."
"The common position is also a great success."
"In substantive terms, the Council endorsed almost 70 per cent of the position adopted by Parliament at first reading."
"I note with satisfaction, especially as rapporteur for genetically-modified food and feed, that there is clearly something of a tradition here, with the Council generally following Parliament's position."
"I hope that the vote tomorrow will be a major step towards the ratification of the Cartagena Protocol."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0151/2003) by Mr De Roo, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 1999/32/EC as regards the sulphur content of marine fuels [COM(2002) 595 C5-0558/2002 2002/0259(COD)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in our discussions in the Committee on Industry, we focussed especially on the various technical options to reduce the sulphur content of marine fuels."
"Here too, we started by considering the real impact of such a reduction."
"We can visualise this in very practical terms."
"If you visit any port in the European Union - let's take Hamburg as an example - and sit down on the quayside, you have buses on one side which comply with the Euro 4 limit and now produce virtually no particulate emissions, and on the other side you have ships - service barges, perhaps - where you can actually see the particulate matter being released."
"There is clearly something wrong here, technically speaking."
"It is therefore appropriate to step up the measures adopted in respect of shipping."
"In Hamburg, for example, 80% of sulphur dioxide emissions and around 20% of particulate emissions now come from shipping, even though there are of course far fewer ships on the sea than private vehicles and lorries on the roads."
"If we consider that ships are replaced relatively infrequently and engines are long-life products, it is difficult to achieve very much with exhaust gas technology for diesel engines in the short term."
"We are therefore focussing on the technology to reduce the sulphur content of marine fuels."
"That has a direct impact, and Mr de Roo has already given us the figures: such fuels typically contain 2.7% of sulphur, compared to 0.0001% for automotive fuels."
"There is clearly a great deal of potential here."
"We need to agree on the level of reduction we must achieve."
"The aim is to introduce a 0.5% sulphur limit on marine fuels in order to attain a real reduction in sulphur dioxide and particulate emissions."
"We spent a long time discussing how we can sensibly achieve this target, and finally opted for this two-step approach, which offers scope for development."
"I too would ask you, Commissioner, to go along with this two-step approach so that we can finally achieve the 0.5% limit."
"It is supported - as you see - by a large majority in this House."
"Of course it would be better if we could proceed on the basis of an international consensus here, because naturally, the ships are not only refuelled in the European Union."
"However, MARPOL is itself a cumbersome vessel, as the Commissioner knows, which offers little room for manoeuvre."
"In my view - and the negotiations on the other issues of relevance to the environment and safety bear this out - if the European Union is the driving force here, MARPOL will start to move as well."
"In other words, if we take this step towards a 0.5% limit, I believe that this will offer us the prospect of achieving more robust agreements on this limit at international level."
"From our perspective, the task is not just to decide on a specific technology."
"If it is possible to reduce sulphur dioxide and particulate emissions in another way than by reducing the sulphur content, that is naturally to be welcomed."
"The aim is to reduce emissions."
"It is not our job to decide how this should be done."
"To that extent, I am also in favour of examining alternative technologies and, if this review produces the right outcomes, to implement them as well."
"We have therefore opened the way for alternative technologies here as well."
"The cost issue was naturally a major consideration in the Committee on Industry."
"Low-sulphur fuel is of course more expensive."
"However, as experience in the Baltic bears out, low-sulphur fuel oil has the advantage of resulting in less maintenance work and better fuel efficiency, so the additional cost of using low-sulphur fuel oil is to some extent compensated by cost savings."
"I therefore believe that in the interests of the environment, but also in the interests of the economy, the 0.5% limit should be the target."
"I believe this is the right route, so let us follow it together."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I do not usually thank my fellow rapporteurs, but this time I want to thank Mr de Roo, together with all my colleagues, for their constructive cooperation."
"We have worked openly and constructively."
"I have proceeded on the basis that we in actual fact want to improve the environmental situation in the coastal states."
"When, today, we look at the Commission's proposal and at the MARPOL Convention's Annex VI, we see that, according to information I have received, it should quite soon come into force because 47.57% of world tonnage is affiliated to it."
"I must, however, say what a shame it is that a great many EU countries, including the country I know best, have not ratified it."
"I think, however, that the example involving MARPOL shows that the Commission's proposal was not perhaps as ambitious as we had wished and that we must make further progress."
"When we get together to take a measure within the maritime sphere, we can now, as Mr Lange also said, achieve a very great deal internationally."
"Together, the EU countries and the candidate countries have such a large fleet that we often have our rules put into effect in the IMO."
"I therefore also view the directive and the improvements we are making in the light of this."
"That is how we must work together."
"We have been talking a very great deal about the new reduction methods, an area Mr Goodwill said I had been anxious about."
"In actual fact, I want the Commission to take an honest and broadly based look at the subsequent environmental effects."
"It may well be that the methods are better for one area of the environment but worse for another."
"We need broadly based follow-up systems in different eco-systems in different types of water."
"The overall effects need to be looked at."
"Finally, I want to say that our group will request a separate vote on Amendments Nos 20 and 21 in order to clarify anything that may be obscure."
"Our group will also vote against them because we do not think it is possible to implement them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr de Roo on his excellent report and on the fact that he was able to reach a compromise with the shadow rapporteurs."
"I shall say, first of all, that, according to data from the European Environment Agency, in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions we must focus on maritime transport."
"This focus on maritime transport in order to resolve the problem of climate change must not be developed, however, at the cost of acidification by sulphur dioxide emissions."
"I therefore consider it unacceptable that the efforts made on land to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions have not been matched at sea and I consequently welcome the Commission's excellent initiative, although I feel it should be more ambitious."
"First of all, the upper limits for sulphur content should be lower, and so I fully support the figure of 0.5%; secondly, zones should be extended with the aim of reducing sulphur dioxide emissions into other zones to below the levels laid down in the MARPOL Convention - it is therefore crucial that the Commission fights within the MARPOL Convention to extend these emissions reductions to the Mediterranean, the Northeast Atlantic and the Black Sea; thirdly, I believe it is important that our action in the field of climate change to reduce the economic costs of complying with the Kyoto Protocol can also be applied to the problem of acidification."
"If we are going to achieve a EUR 1.3 billion reduction in the cost of complying with the Kyoto Protocol in Europe, we should also apply an identical system for sulphur dioxide emissions trading so that we can lower even further the cost of achieving these aims."
". Mr President, the Commission has carefully considered the proposed amendments."
"We are able to accept three-quarters of them fully, in part, or in principle."
"Most offer helpful clarification and improve the quality of the proposal, as has been expressed by speakers here tonight."
"Those amendments that we cannot accept or accept only in part relate to three main issues."
"The first and biggest issue is the proposal for tighter marine fuel sulphur limits extended to a wider sea area."
"The report proposes a phased approach, starting with the 1.5% set out in the Commission proposal, with a tighter 0.5% limit in a second phase."
"Later phases also extend the area where ships have to comply with these limits in all exclusive economic zones and territorial seas throughout the European Union."
"Amendment No 20 contradicts this and goes further still, proposing that the 0.2% sulphur limit for ships at berth should be extended throughout the 12-mile territorial seas of all EU Member States."
"We believe that these new and extended limits are premature."
"I do not doubt that there may be environmental benefits."
"These have not been quantified; nor have the costs, which could be significant."
"Contrary to the normal rules of economics, the more low-sulphur fuel is required, the more expensive it gets."
"That is because refineries have to invest more and more in de-sulphurisation technology to increase capacity."
"The proposed new phases also go beyond the internationally agreed 1.5% sulphur emission control area in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel, but it is open to Member States to propose the designation of new sulphur emission control areas at the International Maritime Organisation and to negotiate tighter fuel limits for these areas."
"Shipping is a global industry."
"Given that this international policy mechanism exists, we believe that it should be used as a first resort."
"However, if tighter limits prove necessary and an international solution cannot be reached, the review clause in the proposal gives the Commission the right to take action at EU level at a later date."
"The second issue concerns emissions offsetting, or trading."
"The concept of emissions trading for conventional air pollutants is not currently well developed at EU level, even for land-based stationary emission sources."
"For sea-going mobile emission sources - ships - we also believe that the idea is somewhat premature."
"Trading is not permitted under MARPOL Annex VI."
"Another concern is that ship emissions of air pollutants have regional or local impacts that trading schemes might not be sensitive enough to address."
"It is quite difficult to see how and by whom any scheme would be administered and enforced."
"That said, we are actively considering emissions trading and other economic instruments as possible complements to regulation in future."
"For this reason we can accept Amendment No 44 in principle, which requires the Commission to consider a range of economic instruments and report back to Parliament and the Council."
"The last issue relates to requirements on the Commission."
"Amendment Nos 32 and 44 propose to bring forward the date of the Commission's 2010 report on the implementation of the directive."
"They also require the Commission to present new proposals, with a report, to revise fuel sulphur limits or to introduce economic instruments."
"The Commission believes that it would be too early to report on the implementation of the directive in 2007 or 2008, given that some of the proposed fuel sulphur limits would not enter into force until 2008."
"We also believe that it is premature to prescribe the content of the report and require it to be accompanied by legislative proposals."
"While we can accept Amendment Nos 30 and 34 in principle, we believe these are also too prescriptive about the Commission's activities."
"You know how sensitive we are to these things."
"In each case we would propose an alternative wording."
"Finally, just a few words about the possibilities offered by exhaust-gas cleaning."
"The tighter fuel sulphur limits proposed in today's report are linked to the possible use of exhaust-gas cleaning technology or scrubbing, as an alternative means of compliance."
"This is allowed under MARPOL and, provided it does not emit harmful effluent into enclosed waters, the Commission proposal already includes a review clause to allow scrubbing in future."
"The technology appears to offer potential benefits, reducing sulphur dioxide emissions, nitrogen oxides and particles."
"It may also cost less than switching fuels for ships which frequently travel on EU seas."
"On the other hand it is very important to prove that the technology has no adverse impact on the marine environment, so that we do not simply replace one environmental problem with another, as you have also pointed out."
"Subject to successful sea trials we believe that scrubbing can indeed be considered as an alternative to low-sulphur fuels and not just for the proposed second-phase limit of 0.5%."
"So, we welcome Parliament's proposals for a new text on scrubbing."
"I would like to hand in a list in writing summarising the Commission's position on all the amendments tabled"
"Thank you Mrs Wallström."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries:"
"(A5-0168/2003) by Mr Hudghton, on the proposal for a Council regulation for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms [COM(2002) 672 C5-0026/2003 2002/0275(CNS)];"
"(A5-0165/2003) by Mr Stevenson, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the management of the fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing areas and resources and modifying Regulation (EEC) 2847/93 [COM(2002) 739 C5-0030/2003 2002/0295(CNS)];"
"(A5-0162/2003) by Mr Fava, on the Commission communication to the European Parliament and the Council on the Action plan to counter the social, economic and regional consequences of the restructuring of the EU fishing industry [COM(2002) 600 C5-0073/2003 2003/2039(INI)]."
"Mr President, we are well aware in this House that many thousands of fishermen, processors and ancillary workers have suffered severe hardship as a result of the cod recovery proposals agreed by the Council last December."
"The whitefish fleet in Ireland and the UK in particular have been hardest hit, being forced to tie up their boats for half of every month and having their quotas cut by more than 50% on the days that they can fish."
"These interim measures have been in place since 1 February this year and yet not a single penny in compensation has been paid to any of those affected by the cuts."
"It was salutary to note that Commissioner Fischler himself saw the need to call upon the Member States to live up to their responsibilities and apply for aid from the fisheries budget."
"He said that of the EUR 3.7 billion in the budget to 2006, only 3% had been earmarked for socio-economic aid, despite the obvious hardship suffered by many fishermen."
"In fact, in the UK the figure is 0%, which is a shameful indictment of the UK Government."
"Its failure to apply for this aid or indeed, to submit proposals for emergency aid from the EUR 150 million voted by a huge majority in this House in March, amounts to a naked betrayal of our fishing sector in their time of need."
"No wonder more than 230 UK fishermen have applied to scrap their vessels."
"But decommissioning on such a scale, on top of the 20% who scrapped their vessels last year, could take the UK whitefish fleet below the critical mass needed to support the harbour workers, ancillary staff and processors on whom the remaining fishermen rely."
"If they go, the whole industry will collapse."
"And it is against this background that I must express my surprise at the Commission's position on the Irish Box."
"It seems to me to be an utter paradox that the Commission can, on the one hand, support such a draconian regime to enable cod and other whitefish stocks to recover, while at the same time calling for the effective dismantling of the Irish Box."
"The Irish Box is one of the most important nursery and spawning grounds in European waters."
"It is of vital importance as a conservation resource, as numerous scientific studies have demonstrated, and yet the Commission appears ready to accept the argument that restricted access in this zone somehow amounts to discrimination."
"Let us be quite clear about this."
"Of course there is restricted access within the Irish Box."
"That is why it is a conservation zone."
"But the Irish, British, French and Spanish fleets have been fishing in the Irish Box for years."
"Now I am well aware that our Spanish friends are dissatisfied with the current arrangements which restrict access to only 40 of their trawlers."
"However, it is worth noting that the 40 Spanish trawlers fishing in this zone at any given time are all massive 25-metre plus vessels, often twice the size of local Irish boats."
"The problem is, there are a further 120 massive Spanish trawlers waiting just south of the Irish Box, keen to gain access, but I do not see hundreds of Greek or Italian trawlers demanding access to the Irish Box!"
"It is also worth noting that the same proposal for a Council regulation in Western Waters would burst open the 200 mile economic exclusion zone around the Azores."
"Again this is an area of high sensitivity which has supported generations of local Portuguese fishermen, often braving the wild Atlantic gales in tiny, open wooden boats."
"Simply to throw these waters open to giant trawlers from Spain or anywhere else would be catastrophic both for conservation of fish stocks and for the preservation of jobs in the fragile Azorean fleet."
"We cannot allow this to happen."
"I support my Spanish colleagues in many ways."
"I have worked hard to find compensation for the damage caused by the oil tanker Prestige."
"I have supported the international third-country agreements which are of such benefit and importance to the Andalucian and Galician fleets."
"But I cannot stand idly by and watch the destruction of key conservation zones around the Azores and in the Irish Box, simply because our Spanish friends and only our Spanish friends wish to catch more fish in these waters."
"To accept this argument would be to fly in the face of conservation policy."
"Our job as parliamentarians, and my job as Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, is to ensure that fish stocks are allowed to recover."
"I therefore urge the House to accept the amendments tabled by the UEN Group and others to the Stevenson Report and in particular to support Amendment No 20, which calls upon the Irish Box to be maintained for a period of 10 years, with a review by ICES and STECF at the end of that period, to establish whether the policy of restricted access has assisted in meeting the objectives of the cod recovery plan in rebuilding endangered whitefish stocks."
"Commissioner, like many of the Members, I believe that fisheries play a social and cultural role as well as an economic role, particularly small-scale fisheries, given their ability to contribute to social and economic cohesion processes, especially in the most remote, outermost regions."
"We therefore welcomed the Commission's Action Plan seeking to avert the negative social effects of the fisheries reform and we endorse the idea of addressing these negative effects through a compensation programme."
"That said, a number of points in the Commission's proposal give cause for concern in that, for example, the reference data put forward is obsolete, dating back to 2000."
"Three years have passed since then, and the Commission itself acknowledges that the assessment is largely theoretical."
"There is a need for a serious and detailed debate on the model to be adopted: whether to opt for industrial fisheries, involving a small number of large, modern economical vessels, or small-scale fisheries, involving a large number of small and medium-sized vessels, which may be less profitable but certainly employ more labour."
"Lastly, there is a need for an updated version of the Commission's Action Plan, parts of which ought to have been updated in line with the conclusions of the Fisheries Council in December 2002."
"Moreover, Commissioner, some parts of the proposal are unconvincing."
"For example, the Mediterranean is completely disregarded."
"The Commission does not take into consideration its specific nature but only a number of areas of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea."
"This amounts to cultural penalisation caused by historic long-sightedness in the process of European integration itself: our Europe continues to be purely north-facing."
"This was the case during the many years when the common agricultural policy was being developed and it is the case now as well with regard to the common fisheries policy."
"However, it is dangerous, first and foremost, because we are on the eve of the inauguration of the Mediterranean area of free trade in 2010, which will make the Mediterranean sea a major area of social, economic, human and political exchange for which we must be prepared."
"Another key aspect is job losses."
"The Commission appears to envisage the loss of 12 000 jobs, which are to be recouped over the space of four years."
"We feel this prediction is optimistic, in that it underestimates the impact of the reform, failing to take into account the consequences for related sectors, dockyards and the processing industries."
"It is estimated that the European processing industry alone employs at least 100 000 people."
"Above all, the Commission's estimate fails to take into account the fact that it is unlikely that it will be possible to retrain workers, such as those in the fisheries sector, who, especially in some areas of Europe, have a low level of education and work in areas suffering from an extremely high unemployment rate."
"If we think we can recoup them and retrain them to do other jobs we are deluding ourselves, particularly where Spain, Greece, Italy and Portugal are concerned."
"Then, in many countries, there are no welfare support provisions and fishermen would be in danger of becoming reject workers, superfluous citizens; another implicit risk is the social, cultural and economic desertification of many parts of the Union."
"We need to focus aid on small-scale fisheries, seeing as they currently employ half the fishermen working in the sector and account for 75% of vessels."
"It is true that the level of catches is very low, but in terms of employment small-scale fisheries play a vital role."
"The Commission acknowledges that financial incentives to small-scale fisheries have not served much purpose, it acknowledges that further measures are needed, although they will be some time coming, and talks only of long-term perspectives."
"These considerations call forth the question of what resources to invest to mitigate the socio-economic consequences of this reform."
"We are opposed to reprogramming of the Structural Funds, considering, rather, that these funds should be reserved for other priorities."
"The fact that 80% of the regions concerned are Objective 1 and 2 regions means that the Structural Funds are currently necessary and crucial for addressing priorities which cannot be confused with the project contained in this resolution."
"In our opinion, we need to set up an ad hoc fund, a measure which could even be temporary for implementing recovery plans."
"One last point, on the subject of women."
"The fact that 22% of the labour force is made up of women is not reflected at all in the Commission's Action Plan."
"Overall, we support the long-term conclusions, but we feel that it would be appropriate to reformulate some parts of the Action Plan and to analyse the socio-economic impact of the reform more carefully."
". (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking you, Mr Hudghton, Mr Stevenson and Mr Fava, for your reports on our proposals."
"I will turn to Mr Hudghton's report first."
"As you know, the Commission's proposal covers a substantial amount of the regulation on technical measures."
"You said there is little interest because the proposal is so technical."
"Yes, but there is no other option: a proposal on technical measures has to be very technical."
"Furthermore, as a result of the problems with the cod and hake stocks, a number of Commission and Council regulations have been adopted which supplement or amend the regulation on technical measures."
"One of the main objectives of our proposal is therefore to draw together all these provisions, which are contained in many separate regulations, into a single regulation and thus make them far more manageable."
"We also used this proposal, however, to introduce a number of new elements."
"There are three issues which arise here: firstly, we want to harmonise the provisions on the individual species of fish which are caught using trawl nets of various mesh sizes in all the Community waters in the north-east Atlantic."
"We want to avoid a situation in future in which a fishing vessel, which has been fishing in the Bay of Biscay, for example, and wants to continue fishing south of Ireland, is subject to different catch conditions."
"The harmonisation will also extend to the waters of the Skagerrak and the Kattegat, where separate provisions currently apply."
"Secondly, the rules should also apply to ships of less than 12 metres in order to provide better protection for young hake."
"Thirdly, we want to amend the provisions on grading the catches in order to reduce discards."
"We also propose setting out the detailed rules in Commission regulations, such as the percentage composition of the catches if fishing vessels carry trawl nets with two different mesh sizes on board, or the physical dimensions and immersion times for static nets."
"On your question regarding the regional advisory councils, Mr Hudghton: as you know, we have re-established these advisory councils as part of the reform and they are also included in the basic regulation."
"This basic regulation states that the advisory councils can be consulted."
"We cannot change this option envisaged in the basic regulation and make it a general obligation in a secondary regulation; there are legal obstacles to this."
"However, I can tell you that we ourselves have a massive interest in ensuring that these advisory councils are consulted as far as possible."
"Now, technical measures are certainly no longer enough on their own - as we all know - to achieve sustainability in fisheries."
"For more than a decade, scientists have therefore been demanding the management of the fishing effort as well to enable a sustainable conservation policy to be pursued."
"That is precisely what we are aiming for with our proposal on the western waters which is dealt with in the Stevenson report."
"As you know, the special provisions on access by Spanish and Portuguese ships to the Irish Box and on access to the Portuguese coastal waters lost their legal basis from 1 January 2003."
"However, as the relevant regulations from 1995 did not establish any time limit for the western waters, we must remove the legal uncertainty which exists here."
"We are therefore proposing a new regulation to replace the existing regulations, containing the following provisions: we want to restrict the fishing effort in the ICES sub-areas of the western waters for all Member States in a non-discriminatory way."
"We propose defining the fishing effort so that the reduction in fishing opportunities since 1995 and the actual fishing effort deployed between 1998 and 2002 are taken into account."
"We want to limit the fishing effort for pelagic species as well and we want further restrictions on access to waters in the outermost regions."
"I do not think anyone should create a threat scenario here and be alarmed about the prospect of a Spanish armada."
"As we have seen in recent months, that is really not the case."
"We must not forget that the aim is to restrict the fishing effort in general and the issue of relative stability comes into play here."
"It is therefore inappropriate to act as if the Spanish fishing boats were fishing the waters dry."
"Let me make one other thing clear: the proposal before us is based exclusively on scientific evidence, which was not the case with the old Irish Box."
"Let me turn briefly to Mr Fava's report, which deals with the Action Plan to counter the social, economic and regional consequences of the restructuring of the EU fishing industry."
"We have attempted, in consultation with the Member States, to assess the potential job losses and the need for financial resources to alleviate the socio-economic impacts."
"We have held meetings in the Member States - one last September, and one this April - and we also consulted the fishing sector, the stakeholders, in January."
"Your report, Mr Fava, contains fifteen recommendations which I can broadly endorse because they comply with the general guidelines of the common fisheries policy and support the long-term goals of our Action Plan."
"That is an initial presentation and I will of course be pleased to answer your questions at the end."
"."
"(ES) Mr President, I am speaking as spokesperson for the Committee on Budgets on fisheries issues and it falls to me firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Fava, whose report I am essentially going to comment on, on its excellence."
"Allow me to point out that the Common Fisheries Policy is funded almost entirely by means of the Union's budget."
"But it does not even represent 1% of the whole budget, and is funded by the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), the regional fund and the social fund."
"The action plan is intended to alleviate the short-term consequences for fishermen and the fishing industry resulting from the conservation and protection measures, by means of the reprogramming of the FIFG for social measures and a review of all the existing aid, but it also provides for the possible release of additional sums."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Fisheries which has incorporated the following points of the Committee on Budgets into the Resolution:"
"The first stresses that it is not probable that the Council's amendments to the Commission's package on the reform of the CFP, adopted at its meeting of 16 to 22 December 2002, will facilitate the application of this reform nor the scheduled reprogramming of 611 million from the FIFG."
"The second points out that the financial resources available in heading 2 of the financial perspectives intended for the fisheries sector and the areas dependent on fishing can be calculated at EUR 28 000 million for the period 2000-2006."
"Finally, it is stressed that additional European Union funding can only be allocated to fishing measures intended to compensate for losses if this is compatible with the maximum limit in heading 2 of the financial perspectives, or by employing the flexibility instrument laid down in Article 24 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteurs for the three reports we are dealing with tonight, Mr Fava, Mr Stevenson and Mr Hudghton, and I would also like to say to the latter, Mr Hudghton, that I agree with many of the comments he made in his speech."
"I would also like to condemn the conceit of the Commission, which takes decisions behind the backs of the sector, the lack of communication between scientists and fishermen and I agree with him that none of this helps in promoting a credible image of Europe amongst our citizens."
"The time available for this debate is limited, and the issues dealt with by these three reports are very important."
"I will restrict myself to a brief comment on each of them."
"I believe that these three reports, particularly when debated together in this way, demonstrate the contradictory way in which the Commission presents its proposals on reform of the CFP."
"The report by Mr Fava on the action plan to counteract the social, economic and regional consequences of the restructuring of this industry in the European Union raises the need for the Community to deal with the losses with sufficient financial resources and without so much uncertainty, particularly in terms of employment, which this reform of the CFP will cause in the regions dependent on fishing."
"The Committee on Fisheries is requesting additional funding to alleviate the effects of this reform."
"The Commission must ensure that the socio-economic structure of these areas is maintained."
"It will be cheaper to support the maintenance of the existing socio-economic fabric than to stand back and watch it disappear and then try to create other replacement economic activities, with which these regions - and I agree with Mr Stevenson - would have great difficulties, since they are located in peripheral areas and suffer from a lack of professional training, new technologies, infrastructures and access to the markets."
"The Commissioner is well aware that each job on a ship generates from 4 to 5 jobs on land, and therefore the disappearance of fishing would cause serious disruption to the socio-economic fabric of these regions."
"With regard to the report on the management of fishing in relation to certain areas and resources, I believe that, when drawing up resolutions, we Members of Parliament must take account of reality."
"And the reality is that the transitional period following the accession of Spain and Portugal has come to an end."
"The CFP has quite enough exceptions already without restoring and perpetuating those which at one time were mere transitional mechanisms."
"Mr Stevenson, this exception, which has come to an end, is not one favour which is being exchanged for another."
"If anybody has led you to believe this, I am very sorry, because it has come to an end."
"It is a problem of legal basis and it has come to an end, and it is not being exchanged for anything."
"You helped us in Morocco; we will help you as much as we can, but the exception has ended."
"Finally, my group supports the Commission's proposal on the protection of juveniles."
"Correct and effective technical measures should be the basis for achieving the balance between fleet and resources."
"The excessive scrapping which some people want to see is anti-economic and antisocial, and could lead us to a situation in a few years when we have created sufficient quantities of fish but do not have either the ships or the fishermen to catch them."
"With regard specifically to the Irish Box, I believe that to use 1998-2002 to measure fishing is far too little, it is shameful."
"With regard to the consultative committees, I support this measure, but quite frankly I would like the Commission to clarify whether all the Member States are currently in an equal position to implement this new element."
"I would like to know whether we are all in an equal position, because, if we are not, we would be generating a new source of disparity, of unequal treatment and injustice, and I am told by the sector in my country that we are not all in an equal position."
"Mr President, rapporteurs, thank you for your contributions and efforts, although I can imagine that Mr Stevenson is not altogether happy that his name has been associated with this report."
"There is a reason for this."
"With regard to the Hudghton report, I should like to say that it is crucial in future to really involve regional consultative committees in order to keep, and use, the mix of science and hands-on knowledge as closely to fishing as possible, thus giving us information and allowing the topic to be approached from a more European point of view."
"I should like to make a few comments with regard to the Fava report."
"These are tough times, of course."
"There must be severe cut-backs, as the Fisheries Council decided in December 2002."
"There is a plan to cushion the negative social and economic impact of restructuring, which is necessary and unavoidable."
"It is particularly unfortunate and regrettable for people who are hit by it."
"I set great store by implementing the plan as effectively as possible, and this should be backed up by the necessary resources."
"It is important, in my view, for the sector itself to be involved in the plans that are required to offer these people new opportunities."
"Money on its own cannot offer a structural, long-term solution."
"In recent years, subsidies have been granted continuously to the small-scale sector that was facing difficult times, but this money has not led to a smoothly-running small-scale fishing industry."
"Therefore, if resources are deployed, it should be with the intention that the sector can ultimately help itself and take its future into its own hands."
"I have already tabled amendments to this effect in the past."
"Structural change, offering alternatives, is what is crucial."
"The Member States also have an important role to play, not only by handing out subsidies but also by changing policy, setting up new tasks and creating new opportunities for the sector in society."
"I think that we should indeed learn from this experience, and I hope that we can maintain a balanced policy."
"Mr President, this proposal for a regulation on managing the Atlantic waters suffered a major setback at the last Fisheries Council, with the presentation of a proposal for a compromise by the current Presidency of the Union. In the name of non-discrimination between Member States and on the pretext that the transitional period for fully integrating Portugal and Spain into the common fisheries policy has ended, this proposal seeks to eliminate the division between their fishing zones, making it difficult to adopt measures to control the fishing effort and calling into question the guarantee of the sustainability of resources in Portuguese waters."
"This proposal would mean opening up access for Spanish vessels to the zone between 12 and 200 miles from the exclusive economic zone, thereby creating an enormous border-free fishing zone. Given the size of the Spanish fleet, this would not only have devastating effects on fisheries resources, with serious consequences for Portuguese fishermen, but it would also nullify the measures for resource conservation that Portugal has implemented."
"Hence the importance of maintaining the division of the ICES statistical fishing sub-areas IX and X and the FCECA areas. This cannot be called discrimination between states."
"Discrimination exists when situations that are different and specific are considered to be equal, as is the case with Portuguese fishing."
"We must therefore take account of the specific arrangements for access by Portuguese and Spanish vessels to the waters of Portugal and Spain respectively, without setting an end date."
"Lastly, I would also like to mention the specific situation of the outermost regions and the need to preserve existing derogations for access to their exclusive economic zone, as laid down in this report."
"Mr President, the Irish fishermen both from the North and from the South whose home waters are those of the Irish sea are now staring in dismay at what is happening to their industry."
"There is no doubt that this matter of the Irish Box is all-important."
"All the sacrifices they made were argued about before, but now all those sacrifices were in vain, because the Commission now takes a different line and says the box has got to go."
"The time has come when this House must face up to the fact that the fishermen from the North and the South of Ireland, for the first time in history, have come together to face this particular problem."
"It is a serious problem, it is a problem that is causing people who were pro-European Parliament to turn against this Parliament."
"This is a serious matter, and I trust that tonight the Commissioner will take this to heart and to his very soul."
"The fishermen are looking for a fundamental review of the current quota system, they are looking for a review of the tie-up policies, they are looking for a review of the direction of the Common Fisheries Policy, they are looking for a review of the best way to achieve proper cod recovery and to achieve the recovery of other fish stocks."
"These are matters that must be faced, they cannot be swept away."
"I appeal to the Commissioner to come to Ireland, both North and South, hear the fisherman at first hand and act for them and the future of this industry."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am disappointed by this debate as it seems like a hotchpotch of national interests and I am hearing very little about Europe, but rather a defence of the conservation of resources which responds entirely to each of the parties' own interests."
"I believe that the Commission must play a significant role in defending European interests."
"Everyone is looking after number one, and that is not what we want to see."
"I would like to congratulate the three rapporteurs, or rather the four, I would like to congratulate Mr Ó Neachtain, because he produced the report - Mr Stevenson's name now only appears as chairman, despite the fact that the amendments presented to the plenary come from the UEN Group, although they have also been signed by Members with national interests."
"I will say nothing about the report by Mr Fava since we are all going to accept it and I believe there is little controversy about it."
"With regard to the reports by Mr Hudghton and Mr Stevenson, I would like to say that I support what has emerged from the Committee on Fisheries, which is our specialised and competent committee."
"What subsequently emerges from the politics in the plenary is another issue."
"We support Mr Hudghton's report."
"I would simply like to say that on the issue of the regional consultative committees, I agree with him, that they are consultative."
"We must listen to the regions, we must listen to the sectors."
"We have said this in Parliament and it has been said in the Council, but of course Parliament and the Council will then have the final word, because consultations are obligatory, but there is a common policy and common European bodies which must take these decisions after listening to the sectors in all regions."
"With regard to the Stevenson report, there are two fundamental principles: firstly, the conservation of resources; secondly, equality of Member States."
"They are two principles which the Commission must accept."
"We have scrupulous respect for the conservation measures."
"We want a genuine sustainable fisheries policy, responsible fishing, with all the necessary measures, including fishing bans."
"If there are areas in which there are reproductions, of juvenile and restocking fish, there must not be any fishing, nobody fishes."
"And that is the way to create healthy biological bans."
"This must be made absolutely clear."
"These sensitive areas must therefore be sensitive."
"But this must be balanced with a second principle, which is the need for the Community principle of not discriminating against any State for reasons of nationality and therefore all these conservation measures must be taken in a manner that affects everyone, not benefiting some and harming others; that would be an anti-Community measure and would end up in the courts, the Court of Justice in this case."
"I hope that this is not necessary so that the Member States, which have actually come to the end of their transitional period of 17 years - the longest transitional period in the history of the European Union - whose rights have been restricted for these 17 years, can now accede under equal conditions."
"The conservation measures must therefore affect everybody."
"There are measures, as the Commissioner knows, which consist of limiting the ACRs, fishing days, the capacity of fleets, all of which are selective technical measures."
"There are many measures, but they must clearly be applied equally to everybody."
"It is discriminatory, Commissioner, because the period intended to be used as a reference is 1998-2002, years during which there were two countries - Spain and Portugal - whose rights were restricted or limited."
"They are therefore not operating under equal conditions if we take that period as a reference."
"We are naturally against the amendments which will be presented tomorrow by the UEN Group and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, because we believe there are other ways to conserve resources without discriminating against certain States."
"Finally, Commissioner, I would like you to clarify whether we are discussing the first proposal you made or the proposal which is already in the Council and on which there is an agreement, as certain Members have said."
"If that is the case, I would ask that this Parliament be consulted again and if it is not, we will use all the rights this House enjoys to see that it is."
"In any event, the political decisions adopted in this House will have to be respected, but I would insist that what has been debated here today has been a hotchpotch of national interests, unfortunately for fishing, and that is not something which I, as an MEP, wanted to see."
"And the Commission is not playing the leading role it should playing in terms of a conservation of resources in the sensitive areas of Europe which affects every one of the Member States in an equal manner."
"Mr President, I should also like to add my support to what has already been said on the concept of regional advisory councils."
"They are essential to provide a dialogue with all interested sectors."
"However, I would like to concentrate on what is now called the 'Stevenson report'."
"I would like to thank Mr Ó Neachtain for all his work on what was originally his report."
"I regret that he had to move his name from the report but I also understand that he was left with no option."
"The proposal from the Council seeks to put in place a new regime for fishing effort in Atlantic waters and a system of fishing effort management, concerning certain Community fishing areas and resources."
"However, on the one hand it would appear that the proposal looks for a management instrument to ensure no increase in fishing efforts, but on the other hand the issue of access of Spanish vessels into what is known as the 'Irish Box' becomes a matter of real concern."
"The whole issue rests on the question of access to the Irish Box - water within 50 miles of the Irish coast."
"This area is an important spawning ground, rich in juvenile fish."
"This sensitive biological area deserves protection."
"Thus it is vital that the EU restricts the fishing effort in the Irish Box in order that future generations can enjoy a sustainable fisheries."
"The Irish Box was specially recognised as an area of biological sensitivity."
"However, this report as it stands, instead of applying the policy of sustainable development, would open up this area of sensitivity to over-exploitation."
"As reports in the Irish Examiner note, fishermen are primarily concerned that fish stocks will be decimated if the Spanish fleet gains unlimited access to the Irish Box."
"Even the Irish Marine Minister expressed his frustration that he could not get the European Commission to give its opinion on the legal status of the Irish Box."
"I understand that there has now been some communication in this matter and that there is tentative compromise on the table, although the Irish and Spanish ministers are diametrically opposed."
"I too share my Irish colleagues' concerns that, as Mr Ó Neachtain stated in the Irish Examiner, we could find these waters completely fished-out in no time at all."
"I would therefore like to ask colleagues to recognise the importance of boxes in scientifically sensitive areas."
"I understand that this is not just a north versus south issue."
"My colleagues from Portugal also value the sensitivity of boxes, especially concerning the Azores."
"If we are truly serious about a common fisheries policy, I believe that boxes are an important management tool, in recognition of biologically sensitive areas."
"This is not about discrimination."
"Far from it."
"This is about ensuring a sustainable fishery for future generations."
"I hope that colleagues will support the amendments tabled, especially Amendment No 20, and make sure that the vision Mr Ó Neachtain had is seen through in this report."
"Mr President, a commitment to sustainability leads us too to support fully Amendment Nos 20 to 30 to the Stevenson report."
"We must ensure proper protection for sensitive nursery and spawning grounds such as the Irish Box."
"Sustainability also requires the use of technical measures as dealt with in the Hudghton report, but these are most effective when they have the full support of those engaged in fishing."
"Indeed, fishers may become pioneers in the area as happened in Scotland with the square mesh panel."
"Therefore we thoroughly endorse the involvement of regional advisory councils in decisions on technical measures and we hope for the speedy establishment of such councils."
"Finally, as regards the Fava report and the sustainability of the fisheries industry, decommissioning may be good for marine resources, but if fleets are reduced too far then the industry simply cannot survive."
"Even with a moderate level of reduction, effects on communities are severe."
"Help is urgently needed."
"Only today we have heard that the Commission has declared that what seems to be an eminently sensible arrangement in Scotland concerning quotas, is not compatible with common market rules."
"How many more blows are our fishing communities supposed to take before faith in the European project is finally lost?"
"When we see what is happening to them, even the most committed amongst us may begin to have our doubts."
"Please let us act with the sustainability of resources and of industry and with communities in mind."
"If we do not, it may be too late on all counts."
"Mr President, this is quite a difficult debate, which we must approach in a spirit of democracy, whilst also showing sensitivity to all parties involved."
"We all agree that the principle of sustainability based on scientific criteria must, of course, be observed when exploiting the sea's resources, but the principle of non-discrimination must also apply, although this must be duly combined and complemented with the principle of relative stability, which is also important."
"I wish to thank those colleagues who, together with Mrs Figueiredo, voted for my amendment on access to waters in the Azores region."
"In fact, as has already been stated, this is an extremely sensitive situation, with a very complex ecological balance, and enormous care must be taken in granting access to these waters, since fish are concentrated in a tiny part of these waters, in the furthest reaches of the sea."
"Secondly, I also wish to support the Commission's intention, expressed in this proposal for a report, to continue the specific arrangements with regard to access to the waters lying between Portugal and Spain. This was, in fact, decided in 1995, by common agreement between the two countries, and has had the support of the Commission and the Council."
"We hope that these arrangements can continue, because they are the best way of pursuing responsible fishing and a climate of peace between the fishing communities of the two countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries and dear friend, Mr Stevenson, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking to you at a particularly difficult time for the autonomous region of the Azores, as has already been said."
"Things are also difficult, however, for all those who believe in sustainable development and in the need to reverse the trend of over-exploiting fishery resources and of exterminating species, which is leading our oceans and, with them, our fishing communities, to disaster."
"The Commission's original proposal for the Western Waters and the Stevenson report both seek to uphold and strengthen existing legislation protecting the resources of Portugal's Western Waters."
"Nevertheless, to our great surprise - as Mrs Figueiredo has already said - we have just discovered that the Council is preparing to dismantle all existing protection."
"The Council's current position is an invitation to plunder and devastate the Western Waters, flying in the face of the scientific reports that conclude that there is an urgent need to restrict, rather than extend, access to the waters, it ignores the positions and interests of fishing communities and will, if adopted, inevitably lead to an unprecedented disaster."
"Commissioner, I should like to remind you of the answer you gave to my parliamentary question on the validity of the current regulations."
"You said at the time, Commissioner, in Question No 26: '? the Commission has a clear understanding of the validity of Regulations Nos 685 and 2027."
"Unless amended or repealed by the Community legislator, the rules established by the regulations will continue to apply.'"
"This is the opposite of what you have just said here!"
"I fail to understand how your opinion can change completely in only three months!"
"I should also like to clarify the following point: the rules for the accession of Portugal and Spain to the European Communities expired in 1995."
"We are not in a transitional period!"
"A new set of regulations was adopted in 1995 to apply thereafter, with the agreement of everyone!"
"This is what you now want to blow out of the water, to call into question in order to ruin Portuguese waters."
"This is completely unacceptable."
"I wish to conclude, furthermore, by saying that equality between those in completely different situations is nothing but humbug and not equality at all."
"We want to see equality between situations that are equal, not a pretence of equality that serves only to cover up a policy of destroying our resources."
"For this very reason, I wish to support the rapporteur and to call on all Members to vote for Amendment No 20 of this report tomorrow."
"Mr President, I would like to focus on the Fava report and then make a brief point on this absolutely fascinating debate on the Irish Box."
"Commissioner, I would like to ask you to clarify a few points regarding Mr Fava's report, if possible, since you have said that you essentially endorse the proposals it contains."
"Mr Fava's report - which we will support tomorrow - states that the data on which your proposals are based is not up to date and is therefore not particularly reliable: the forecast of 12 000 jobs losses is underestimated and the retraining of the workforce envisaged is virtually impossible given the level of education of the people concerned."
"Mr Fava has pointed all this out today too, and yet you say that you are essentially in agreement."
"I fail to understand how you can support the report considering the proposals made."
"Then the Committee on Budgets points out that there is not enough money and that the constraints are such as to exclude additional funding."
"Well then, if you, with your imagination, could manage to dream something up, we would be truly delighted."
"I would propose, and I am anxious to hear your opinion, in view of these budgetary difficulties, giving some of the responsibility back to the Member States - we are going to call for this in another report - allowing them, for example, to apply the de minimis rule to fisheries too, a rule with which you are quite familiar since it is employed in agriculture as well."
"As far as the other issue under consideration is concerned, I confess I am a little disappointed by the debate."
"The excessively nationalistic overtones make me genuinely of the opinion that there is no longer any point in having a common fisheries policy."
"Whether we are talking about Portuguese, Irish or Spanish waters, clearly the scope for debate is reduced by such attitudes."
"During these periods of genuine difficulty - I am thinking of the serious issues affecting fishermen and their families - the only certain point of reference is the law."
"By respecting the law, we will be able to reconcile environmental sustainability with rights, the Treaties and the agreements. It is our only safeguard against shifting towards national policies and the only guarantee of our being able to pursue a common policy in this sector."
"Mr President, I am going to talk almost exclusively about the maintenance of the Irish Box, since it illustrates the poles of opinion dividing clearly defined parties; despite this, Parliament's Committee on Fisheries had managed to adopt a report which I believe clearly combines the interests of the different parties since, on the one hand, it responds to the concern of a majority to protect sensitive areas from irresponsible fishing, and on the other, maintains that it is necessary to eliminate any discrimination suffered by Community fleets of any Member State."
"The maintenance of the Irish Box is not justified from either a scientific point of view or a legal point of view; it consists of a political concession granted to a country 18 years ago, to make it possible to reach an agreement on the accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Union."
"The restriction of access to a fishing area cannot be extended indefinitely, particularly if it affects a specific fleet."
"Several judgments clearly indicate that the rules relating to equal treatment laid down in Community legislation not only prohibit explicit discrimination on grounds of nationality, but also prohibit any disguised form of discrimination by means of the application of differentiation criteria which have the same effect in practice."
"The transitional period for Spain's accession to the European Union ended in December 2002, and from January this year all restrictions should have disappeared."
"From a scientific point of view, any measure for the conservation of resources is justified, provided that is not discriminatory."
"In the case of the Irish Box, the measures advocated by some people go even further than the initiatives recently taken to protect cod stocks, a species whose situation cannot be compared with the situation of angler fish, hake or john dory in the Irish Box."
"The Act of Accession to the European Union by Spain and Portugal contains the explicit decision to remove all restrictions of access to Community waters in December 2002; legally, for reasons of legislative hierarchy which everybody, from the legal expert to the uninitiated in law, understand, the Regulations of 94 and 95 cannot replace the Act of Accession."
"All fishing areas considered sensitive, without exception, must be protected and dealt with in the same way by means of technical measures, including by means of bans, but without discrimination."
"Those of us who vote against Amendment No 20 tomorrow, Mr President, want sustainable fishing resources, but also equality for all countries, discrimination against nobody and we are opting for Europe."
". (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, many thanks for all your contributions to the debate."
"I have followed your arguments carefully and would now like to comment on the individual amendments that have been proposed."
"I will start with the Hudghton report."
"In Amendments Nos 1 and 3, you draw attention to errors in the references in our proposal."
"Thank you for pointing this out."
"We will of course correct these mistakes."
"As regards Amendment No 2, we prefer to set out the provisions on the use of combinations of towed nets of more than one range of mesh size in a single Commission regulation, as this opens up more options for discussion and technical consultation with the experts from the Member States."
"Amendment No 4 concerns industrial fishing, where by-catches of undersized fish and other species undeniably occur, that is true."
"However, I should remind you in this context that in this fisheries sector, a maximum of 5% by-catch is permitted, and controls carried out primarily by ICES have revealed that in practice, the by-catch falls well below this 5% limit."
"Amendments Nos 5, 8 and 10 on the regional advisory councils, as I have already pointed out, are redundant here, in my view."
"The new framework regulation already states that we will consult these regional bodies where there is a regional aspect to a proposal."
"Amendments Nos 6 and 7 are redundant because their content is already included in the new framework regulation on the common fisheries policy."
"I can accept Amendment No 9 to the extent that I can take up the reference to the new framework regulation."
"Finally, I would just like to clarify one point, because Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna asked whether I was referring to the first or the second Commission proposal."
"There is only one Commission proposal."
"There is also the report on the proposal, and my statement."
"What you mean, perhaps, is a non-paper which the Greek Presidency presented for discussion, but it is not a Commission proposal."
"Let me turn now to the Stevenson report."
"The proposals relate to the western waters."
"I am happy to accept Amendments Nos 2 to 5 as they are entirely in line with the objectives contained in our proposal."
"However, I cannot accept Amendment No 6 as it would delete the recital which sets out the basic concept underlying our proposed regulation, namely to ensure that there is no increase in the overall levels of the fishing effort in the western waters and that the fishing effort is calculated on the basis of the fishing effort actually deployed to date in these fisheries."
"I can endorse Amendment No 10 in principle, although the right place for this text is in the recitals, not in the enacting terms of the regulation."
"I do not think that Amendment No 17 is necessary, as we are safeguarding the monitoring of the fishing effort through the proposal's other provisions."
"The inclusion of a clause on changes to the system is acceptable, however, so I endorse Amendment No 19."
"Unfortunately, I must reject Amendments Nos 20 to 29."
"I would like to make it clear at this point that the Irish Box is a thing of the past."
"There is no going back."
"Free access to the waters beyond the 12-mile zone is a fundamental principle of the common fisheries policy."
"It can be restricted if stock conservation measures warrant such a measure."
"However, such restrictions must then apply equally and without discrimination to all Member States."
"Amendment No 30 concerns relative stability."
"This principle is already contained in the new framework regulation for the common fisheries policy and therefore does not need to be rolled out again here."
"As regards the outermost regions, I can accept Amendments Nos 8 and 13 to the extent that we should also restrict access to stocks other than tuna and related species, in order to protect the interests of local fisherman more effectively."
"However, this need not apply to the whole 200-mile zone."
"This should be looked at in more detail."
"With regard to the pelagic stocks, I must unfortunately reject Amendments Nos 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 18."
"If practical problems arise due to the migration of stocks between the various ICES areas or sub-areas, the areas for the maximum permissible fishing effort can be extended without any difficulty to several sub-areas or to the whole western waters, instead of applying per sub-area."
"However, we cannot resolve potential problems of this kind by removing the pelagic species from the regulation altogether."
"However, I am happy to accept your Amendment No 1 regarding the adaptation of the text reference to the new framework regulation on the common fisheries policy."
"The same applies to Amendment No 7, which relates to scientific and biological surveys and Amendment No 9 on satellite monitoring systems."
"This brings me to the Fava report on our Action Plan to alleviate the social impacts."
"As regards paragraph 11 of the resolution on the inclusion of employment and health and safety conditions at work, I should point out that these objectives are already taken into account in the common fisheries policy."
"I am happy to comply with paragraph 5 of your resolution to the extent that we can always update the Action Plan when the Member States supply us with information on the socio-economic impacts for any future stock recovery plan or multiannual management plan."
"We have already fulfilled the demands set out in paragraph 13 on consultation with Member States and the fisheries sector."
"With regard to paragraphs 7, 8 and 9, let me say that I reminded the Member States, at the Fisheries Council on 26 May, that they should supply the Commission by 15 June this year with precise details of the additional funds needed to deal with the socio-economic impacts of the stock recovery plan for cod."
"To date, only the United Kingdom has provided more precise data, but it has indicated that it is seeking to cover the additional financial requirements from national funds."
"However, no other Member State has provided any data as yet."
"I also asked for information to be provided to us on whether and how the Member States wish to revise their original programme planning in order to boost support for socio-economic measures."
"Without this information from the Member States, we will all - the Commission and the Parliament alike - have difficulties in complying with this year's European Parliament resolution."
"We will also be unable to convince the budgetary authorities of the need to make as much as EUR 150 million in additional funding available via the flexibility instrument to alleviate the crisis in the white fish sector if no such demands are forthcoming from the Member States."
"Mr President, I should like to ask for clarification of the Commissioner's remarks in relation to regional advisory councils."
"In his earlier statement he said that RACs had been established in the basic regulation, that they can be consulted, but there was not a general obligation and indeed there are legal obstacles to that."
"Now he has said that regional advisory councils will be consulted where there is a regional aspect to a proposal."
"In general, whose prerogative is it to decide when and on what RACs will be consulted."
"In particular, does he accept that technical measures, if they are to be meaningful, must be tailored to regions, and that therefore there is a regional aspect."
"Therefore will or will not regional advisory councils be consulted on this technical measures report?"
"I am very grateful, Mr President, but I believe the Commissioner should tell us what the truth is: is it what he stated in his answer to Question No 26 - which is that the regulations are in force - or what he has just stated, which is that the regulations are no longer in force?"
"The Commissioner must clarify the situation and say which is true: his previous statement or the one he has just made."
". (DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to reply to Mr Hudghton's question on the regional advisory councils."
"The question whether it is meaningful and necessary, or regarded as necessary, to consult such a body must arise from the given situation."
"What I drew attention to is this: the basic regulation provides for the option of consulting the advisory councils, and it is therefore not possible to transform this into obligatory consultation in a secondary provision."
"However, I can solemnly pledge, on the Commission's behalf, that we will always consult the relevant advisory council, if one exists, as a matter of course where there is a regional aspect to a proposal on a region of the sea."
"After all, we ourselves have an interest in obtaining the greatest possible range of clear and detailed information on the meaningful deployment of technical measures."
"As regards Mr Casaca's comments: yes, of course, what was said in the answer to the question continues to apply."
"However, you do need to consider one thing: you said that the provision of the Accession Treaty automatically continues in force."
"Perhaps this was not translated quite correctly."
"This certainly cannot apply, as this provision of the Accession Treaty, as is well known, has already expired."
"Currently, the situation is this, to be precise: according to the Commission's Legal Service, the legal basis has expired, but legislation is required to repeal the relevant provision of the regulation as well."
"It does not become invalid of its own accord."
"However, there is a view in the Council's Legal Service that due to the expiry of the legal basis, this provision of the regulation also forfeits its legal force."
"There are therefore two conflicting legal opinions here."
"As would seem logical, I informed you about the Commission's legal opinion in my reply."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon."
". We support the rapporteur's proposal to reject the initiative."
"However, we do this for very different reasons."
"We believe that expulsions and deportations from Member States are wrong."
"They do not take account of the underlying reasons forcing people to flee from their countries and often involve sending people to countries where murder, torture and inhuman treatment are not just a threat but bitter reality."
"It is also no secret that, again and again, people being deported die because of the actions of security staff."
"Expulsions and deportations from Member States are often cruel, inhumane and unjust."
"Apart from this, asylum procedures in the EU are often grossly unjust and arbitrary, leading to dramatically varying recognition rates between Member States."
"In such a situation, and as long as the global misery of capitalist exploitation, war and violent conflict and disrespect for human rights continue, nobody should be deported from Europe, and there should be no mutual recognition of deportation orders."
"In view of all this, we demand a total halt to deportations, the immediate release of all people being detained pending deportation and a permanent right of residence for all undocumented immigrants."
"Welcome"
"We are joined today by a distinguished visitor in our official gallery, the Speaker of the Parliament of Finland, Mr Paavo Lipponen."
"I should like to welcome you, Mr Lipponen, to our House."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Thessaloniki Council will bring a particularly difficult six months to a close and pave the way for the procedure of European integration to continue."
"The Council plans to focus on five important entities."
"First, how to advance the matter of the institutional changes which the European Union needs and which the Convention on the Future of Europe has been processing since March 2002."
"Secondly, foreign policy and defence issues, with particular emphasis on the points of transatlantic relations, the formulation of a strategic perception on Union security issues and the issue of weapons of mass destruction."
"Thirdly, immigration, asylum and external border issues, which you know the Greek Presidency has an interest in, and their increasing importance to the Union over the last five years."
"Fourthly, issues relating to the strategy on employment and the Lisbon strategy in general, which the Council needs to address, and a fifth entity for the day after the Council, in other words Saturday 21 June, which concerns the Union's policy on the western Balkans."
"Of course, over and above these five entities, the Council will not omit to discuss and take appropriate decisions on a series of other issues."
"However, I shall confine myself mainly to the thematic entities I have mentioned."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the first thematic entity concerns the institutional changes which are being processed by the Convention and the steps which need to follow."
"As a result of enlargement, the Treaty for which was signed in Athens on 16 April, there is the urgent problem of the changes which have to move forward so that the European Union does not fall into the ugly trap of having inflexible institutions which are unable to operate efficiently and creatively."
"That is why the issues of the Convention on the Future of Europe are major issues for the Council and the Union in general."
"As agreed at the informal Council in April, the Convention, through its chairman, is expected to present the results of its work, which has lasted about 15 months."
"The Greek Presidency has managed, following special, multiple agreements, to ensure that the timetable given to the Convention by the Copenhagen Council is kept to."
"Ideas and proposals have been submitted."
"The dialogue can continue, but at some point we must conclude."
"This conclusion will obviously not happen under the Greek Presidency, but we expect the leaders to exchange views and decide on the order for the Intergovernmental Conference, and for the bridge to the final stage to be completed under the Greek Presidency."
"The final product of the Convention will therefore be submitted to the Thessaloniki Council."
"It is not the Council's role to take material decisions; its role is to decide how the order will be given to the Intergovernmental Conference to start up work, so that we have a result which is accepted by everyone, which will be a common denominator and will constitute the institutional framework which will determine the course of the Union for several years to come."
"We need to make sure, when the time comes, that this common denominator is not a lowest common denominator, is not a change of limited importance, but is a denominator that will guarantee a dynamic course for an enlarged Europe."
"The Greek Presidency plans to hold a discussion on the material aspects of this item so that there is an exchange of views, so that a picture of national positions is formed before the Intergovernmental Conference and, of course, so that decisions are taken on procedural issues relating to the subsequent stages of the procedure."
"The timetable of work for the Intergovernmental Conference is an important issue."
"In order to determine the timetable, account must also be taken of the obligation of certain Member States to hold an internal dialogue on the outcome of the Convention."
"We estimate that, around autumn, this procedure should have been completed, the Intergovernmental Conference should proceed and its work should be completed on time so that the period between the date of enlargement, in May 2004, and the entry into force of the new institutional framework is as short as possible."
"In all events, progress with the work of the Convention allows me to express certain views on a series of points."
"The debate on the institutional architecture of enlarged Europe started by identifying the need for greater efficiency."
"Everyone is convinced that we need to adapt the institutional structure and operations to the needs of a bigger Union, while maintaining all the principles on which the European unification endeavour is based."
"The drafting of a Constitutional Treaty is a quantum qualitative leap which is due in large part to the efforts made in the Convention."
"However, we must say that it also expresses the will of the European citizens."
"Its strength depends on two basic elements: on its more democratic functioning and on more efficient decision-making."
"I should particularly like to welcome the fact that, during the work of the Convention, a significant degree of agreement has been noted on a series of basic issues, such as, for example, the strengthening of the role of the European Parliament, the introduction of a single international legal personality for the Union, the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Constitutional Treaty and the further communitisation of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"The view that we can achieve better democratic credentials for the Union without creating new institutions or bodies was also broadly accepted."
"An enlarged Europe should result in a stronger international presence."
"This means finding solutions, such as a more coordinated way of using foreign policy resources and the creation of a person who will unite the responsibilities of the High Representative with those of the Commissioner responsible for foreign policy."
"As you know, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is under way."
"Over and above the various approaches expressed in plenary at the Convention, it is, I think, important for us to maintain a balance between the Union's institutions, to safeguard the equality of the Member States, to make further use of the advantages of the Community method and to strengthen the democratic character of a Union of states and peoples."
"In all events, I think that the Convention has been a success, taking decisions on a series of difficult issues outstanding from previous Intergovernmental Conferences."
"It goes without saying that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will have to take account of the decisions on which there was agreement and it is important in the final stage of work for there to be a spirit of compromise, for the authority of the Convention to be preserved and for the strong result which the Union so badly needs to be guaranteed."
"As I mentioned earlier, a second important area of work for the June Council has to do with developments over this entire period on the particularly crucial issue of foreign policy, which includes the question of relations between states."
"The EU/USA summit will be held in Washington a few days after the Council."
"It will be an opportunity to discuss issues which are important to both sides, to cooperate and address serious issues concerning international and/or bilateral developments and to overturn the climate which has often prevailed over all these recent months."
"Relations between the European Union and the United States depend on traditional ties, the weighty role of the two sides on the international stage and their dynamism, despite the fact that over recent months they have been put to the test by a divergence of opinion on a series of issues."
"All we Member States, however, consider that what unites us is more than what divides us and that it is in everyone's mutual interest that we work together."
"At the last meeting in Gymnich, we had a very useful discussion."
"We believe that the image of our relations with the United States should improve and should better reflect the real state of our relations."
"That is why we are working hard to ensure that the next summit, the agenda for which will be discussed at the Thessaloniki Summit, will be an important step in the further development of our strategic relations, so that we can meet the challenges of our times together."
"The issues of Iraq, transatlantic relations and international developments in general recently created new challenges in the field of the European security and defence policy."
"In this sector, we will need to be in a position to develop a common perception of the new security environment and be able to deal efficiently with new challenges and threats."
"The Ministers for Foreign Affairs, at their informal meeting at the beginning of May, instructed the Union's High Representative to prepare a general report on the new security environment, the challenges and threats arising from it and the ways in which the Union can deal with them, to be submitted for initial discussion at the European Council in Thessaloniki."
"Similarly, the European Council expects to adopt the Presidency's progress report on the European security and defence policy, together with the annual report concerning the implementation of the Union's programme on the prevention of violent conflicts, which forms the cornerstone of the Union's security mechanism."
"The issue of weapons of mass destruction, which is linked with the foregoing, is also one of the important items on the agenda and, of course, I think that it will stay there, given that the proliferation of these weapons is a major challenge for the international question."
"Following on from the conclusions of the European Council in Seville, the Presidency also intends to bring a series of issues concerning immigration, asylum and external borders which, as you know, were basic priorities of our Presidency, to the attention of the heads of state during the June Council."
"Considerable progress has been made."
"The Council managed to bring about political agreement on the directive on family reunification and we believe that we shall manage to achieve political agreement on the directive on long-term residents and the related directive defining refugees."
"As you know, we sought a global review of the question of immigration in the sense of both legal and illegal immigration."
"In an effort to formulate a single European policy on the issues of legal immigration and asylum, the Presidency also attached particular importance to the issue of the integration of third country nationals."
"We intend, together with the Commission, to formulate conclusions for Thessaloniki on the basis of the Commission communication on the development of a common policy on illegal immigration, people trafficking, the issue of external borders and the return of illegal immigrants, again in conjunction with the question of dividing the burden."
"The Presidency also intends to seek political agreement on including immigration as a necessary parameter in the evaluation of third country cooperation with the Union."
"Following the spring European Council, which was held under difficult economic and political developments, measures also need to be taken to implement decisions reached within the framework of the Lisbon strategy in March 2000, especially now that we are one third of the way through the process and a great deal still remains to be done."
"At the March Council, we decided to promote the application of a series of policies on employment, innovation, entrepreneurship and other policies."
"That is why one central issue in Thessaloniki will be the approval of certain guidelines, such as the revised European strategy on employment, recording progress made on various targets concerning, for example, public takeover bids, energy issues and environmental liability and the adoption of the package on the reform of the common agricultural policy, despite the fact that it is difficult today to forecast the final outcome of this issue."
"That brings me to the western Balkans."
"As far as the western Balkans and their relations with the Union are concerned, our programme targets a set of priorities, especially the strengthening of their progress towards European structures and European conditions."
"The fact that the western Balkans have remained high on the Union's list of priorities despite the adverse climate over recent months is an achievement on the part of the Union and also illustrates the major political importance we attach to the region."
"This interest has been manifested in real terms through the stability and association process, as well as in the political sector and in the security sector, with the two operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the FYROM."
"Reconstruction of the western Balkans has been based on regional cooperation and the role of the stability pact is important in this direction."
"I shall refer in particular to the Presidency's initiative, within the framework of the south-eastern Europe cooperation process and the stability pact, to create a crisis and conflict prevention and early warning mechanism which will mainly emphasise the importance of economic and social development as a deterrent."
"The stability and association process remains the basic element in the Union's policy in the countries of the Balkans and, in our efforts to support this policy, stock was recently taken in Croatia of what has been achieved under the stability pact, the main objective being to coordinate actions under the pact in order to complement the stability and association process."
"Democratisation, reconciliation and regional cooperation, on the one hand, and the rapprochement of each of these countries with the Union, on the other hand, constitute a single entity."
"Our objectives for the western Balkans have been agreed by the Commission and the Member States and the five countries in the region."
"The Council and the Commission are working to implement these objectives with specific operational conclusions."
"The relevant decisions are due to be adopted at the General Affairs Council on 16 June."
"The European Parliament will approve these decisions and, in this way, we look forward to marking a crucial point in our relations with the western Balkans, with a text of conclusions not only expressing the political will to support the European prospects of the countries in the region, but also containing an operational outline for this purpose."
"At the same time, the European Council will confirm that the European future of these countries lies mainly in their own hands and in their commitment to implementing the necessary reforms."
"The stability and association process, an integral part of which is the principle of conditionality, continues to give us the necessary institutional framework."
"Enriching this process with elements of the recent enlargement experience will reinforce the evaluation, reform and control mechanisms on the basis of the 1997 conditionality and the Copenhagen criteria."
"In this spirit of further development, the Commission has proposed a specific means, the European integration partnerships."
"Inspired by the pre-accession procedure and adapted to the requirements of each country, they will indicate priorities and obligations which need to be honoured on a regular basis and will act as a guide for financial support via CARDS."
"The decision to adopt this mechanism is again expected to be taken at the General Affairs Council and the European Council."
"Of the operational actions that will be discussed at the summit, particular importance is also being attached to the questions of justice and internal affairs, especially combating organised crime."
"We are seeking an evaluation of the achievements of the countries in the region in order to draw up lists of their specific obligations on these issues for the future. Specific actions will also be proposed on other horizontal issues, such as the return of refugees, the fight against unemployment, the liberalisation of trade and the protection of religious and cultural monuments."
"An important precondition if we are to achieve efficient stabilisation in the region consists of strengthening European funding and placing greater emphasis on development measures."
"The decisions taken by the Thessaloniki Council will also be reflected in the Thessaloniki declaration which is expected to be signed by the interested parties on 21 June."
"Within this political forum, which follows on from the Zagreb summit in 2000, we intend to renew a political dialogue which will complete the existing framework and will also emphasise the responsibility of the countries of the western Balkans in the overall process."
"Over and above these basic parameters which the European Council will address, I might refer very briefly to certain other issues which are of particular importance."
"Following the historic ceremony of the signing of the enlargement treaty on 16 April, new impetus was given to this process and a basic stage in its overall course was completed."
"The ratification procedure for the 10 countries is proceeding smoothly, as is reinforced monitoring of the application of the acquis."
"At the same time, accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania are making satisfactory progress."
"With Turkey, we are in the process of completing the accession strategy in accordance with the Copenhagen decisions."
"It is therefore expected that the European Council will take note of the progress which has been made and will adopt the necessary guidelines."
"I shall not refer to other matters which will obviously occupy the Council on a running basis."
"I should just like to point out that, in an effort to bring European citizens closer to European developments, the Greek Presidency is dealing with the proposal for European political parties as a matter of high priority and is making every effort so that negotiations in the Council will be completed before the Thessaloniki European Council."
"I am particularly pleased that an overall consensus on organising an agreement on better legislation was reached yesterday and, consequently, we shall also have the presentation of this agreement to the Thessaloniki Council."
"I should like to close by noting that the Presidency has tried and will make a final effort to see if perhaps a solution can also be found to the question of the MEP statute."
"We shall see how this develops."
"I cannot prejudge anything."
". (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Yiannitsis said, the draft Constitutional Treaty, drawn up by the European Convention, will be the focus of the forthcoming European Council in Thessaloniki."
"As the event is so important, my intervention today will be entirely devoted to this subject, and I am certain that the ensuing debate will provide much encouragement and many suggestions for the final, extremely delicate, stages of the Convention's work."
"Firstly, with just a few days to go before the Convention closes, I would like to thank all those who have represented this assembly at the Convention."
"Your commitment has been, and will be decisive for the future of this delicate process."
"I would also like to thank President Simitis and Mr Yiannitsis, as well as their team, for their patient mediation work which will culminate at Thessaloniki and I hope the results will be positive."
"It was not so long ago that the Commission and Parliament strongly propounded a Convention on the future of Europe."
"Today we have the opportunity to establish our first true Constitution from a democratic debate taking place in the full light of day."
"Together, ladies and gentlemen, we sought the Convention and together we must strive for its success."
"The Convention must put forward a balanced text with no alternatives, a text that lays the foundations for Europe for many years to come, guaranteeing our presence and independence on the international stage."
"If we did not achieve this, the risks would be enormous."
"If we leave the decisions on a number of crucial issues to the intergovernmental conference, we risk a rerun of the sorry experience of Nice."
"That would be an ironic turn of fate because we wanted the Convention precisely because we were not satisfied with Nice."
"Let me remind you of the original ideas behind this great reform of our policies and our Institutions."
"In December 2001, the Laeken Declaration established the Convention and gave it the task of preparing the ground for the Intergovernmental Conference as broadly and openly as possible."
"The Laeken Declaration sets three main objectives: firstly, a better division and definition of European Union competences; secondly, simplification of our legal instruments and action; thirdly, making the Union more democratic, transparent and efficient."
"The basic aim is to assert the values pursued by the Union, define citizens' fundamental rights and duties and clarify the relationship between Member States within the Union."
"The Convention, therefore, came into being with a Herculean task, an extremely difficult task ahead of it."
"Nevertheless, we must also admit that in almost half a century we have built up an astonishing wealth of institutional and lawmaking experience and we have developed a style of politics that is unique on the world scene and of which we should be proud."
"So the Convention's brief is clear: it must define more clearly who does what in the European Union."
"This means striking a new balance between the Institutions so that Europe can play its part in a globalised world, but a balance that is easy to grasp for our citizens."
"Parliament and the Council must have joint legislative power, requiring the general extension of codecision; the Court of Justice must hold judicial power, and in this respect I am in favour of extending its jurisdiction to foreign policy and to the area of justice and home affairs; lastly, in addition to clarification of its legislative power, the Union needs a single executive: the Commission."
"Under the control of the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission should apply legislation, implement policies and represent the Union externally, except in matters relating to the Common Security and Defence Policy."
"Duplicating the executive would not provide European citizens with the necessary transparency and accountability, and the executive would escape your control, Parliament's control."
"There is one point, however, that I must stress as being of prime importance: the general application of majority voting as a decisive and determining element of the political will to act with democracy and efficiency."
"Without this we will lack democracy and efficiency."
"The latest version of the draft Constitutional Treaty, published by the Convention, contains some, perhaps many, good proposals: the Charter of Fundamental Rights is firmly enshrined as Part Two of our Constitution; the scope of the codecision process has been extended, although not far enough; lastly, it is now clear that we will have a Foreign Minister to represent the Union at international level."
"We must continue to push ahead on other issues, however: firstly, the requirement for unanimity has not been repealed."
"I must stress this point too: this is the basic issue on which the whole future effectiveness of the Institutions depends, because the right of veto can only bring deadlock in the Union."
"The best solution - there may also be second best solutions - is double simple-majority voting - that is, half the Member States and half of the population: easily comprehensible, straightforward and clear."
"This is the system we prefer because it reflects the dual legitimacy of the Union which - I would remind you - is based on agreement between the States and the shared will of the peoples."
"I repeat, the fundamental point is to eliminate the right to veto, for which we are paying an unacceptable political price, both in internal and international policies."
"Secondly, the issue of a stable Presidency of the European Council is still unresolved."
"The solution put forward in the latest draft of the Constitution has three drawbacks: first of all, there is the fundamental problem of legitimacy, of accountability, as it is unclear to whom such a President would report, which is fundamental for democracy; in addition, it weakens your role, the European Parliament's role, because this assembly rightly has power of control over the Commission, but not over the Council or its President."
"So this philosophy is asymmetrical; it is a weak kind of democracy that we are considering, that this draft is considering."
"We cannot accept this!"
"Last, but certainly not least, it would create another executive within the Council which would end up generating confusion between Community competences."
"So no simplification of instruments here, and even less clarity about who does what within the Union."
"Keeping that picture and these three basic objections in mind, we are open to various solutions, ranging from maintaining the rotating Presidency to creating a post of Chairman, purely and simply 'Chairman', to make the Council more efficient technically."
"More generally, what counts is laying the basis for effectively combining what cannot go beyond intergovernmental cooperation today and our firmly established Community mechanisms, something which does not, however, come out of the draft."
"This cannot be achieved by dividing and fragmenting these two dimensions, but rather by interlinking them, and providing for possible future development towards more unitary formulae, such as that of a future President of the Union."
"We need to be creative, imaginative and have a sense of time and the future."
"Today we already have the Union's Foreign Minister as a practical example to work with."
"The person holding this post will represent the Union for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, while we want the Commission, as I just said, to continue to represent it in all other areas."
"This explains the proposal for a dual nature of the Foreign Minister and why he must be a Commissioner if the idea is to work, albeit a Commissioner with special status as regards the CFSP."
"The Foreign Minister will therefore need to work closely with the College and, in particular, with the President of the Commission and must have the backing of a genuine European service."
"This structure must be linked administratively with the Commission so that it can work together with the other Commission departments in order to make optimum use of knowledge, resources and action in all sectors linked to foreign policy in the strict sense."
"The Union's external representation will thus be truly unitary and able to utilise Community and intergovernmental instruments effectively, and this will give us the international influence and role we should have."
"This, ladies and gentlemen, is a practical example of how the intergovernmental and Community dimensions should be combined."
"The events of the last few months have taught us one thing: until we put an end to our divisions, we will continue to be an economic giant and a political dwarf on the world stage; indeed, when you are a political dwarf for too long, you cease to be an economic giant."
"Before closing, I want to raise one last point: we need the right institutional instruments to strengthen our economic policies, precisely to prevent us being sidelined on the economy too."
"In this context, one can legitimately wonder whether one option for a workable combination of today's intergovernmental and Community mechanisms would not be for the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs to chair the Eurogroup and represent the euro area externally in international institutions."
"This calls for a strong person, someone who will continuously represent the Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that sums up what I wanted to say today."
"There are many things I could add, but I have sought to confine myself to the essential points so that there is more time for debate."
"I would just like to say a few, final words to thank the Greek Presidency. They have shown determination, effectiveness, understanding and sensitivity to the various points of view - a model of how we should work together."
"This leads me to make a further remark - which may seem ill-disposed but which on the contrary is sincere, indeed absolutely sincere - that is, that institutional engineering formulae may provide a rational explanation why the rotation system cannot function."
"I repeat: perhaps they can explain it, but no formula can replace the enthusiasm and intelligence of policy-makers who put their national cultural heritage at the service of Europe's common interest."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the President of the Commission received such warm applause, because he has really earned it."
"He deserved that warm applause for his comments, which were based on the Community method, and I too would like to focus my contribution on the Convention."
"I would first like to thank all our representatives to the Convention and its Chairman, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, very sincerely for all the work they have done up to now, although we have not reached our goal yet."
"If such clear progress had not been made over the past week, we might have found ourselves concerned about the risk of failure today."
"But I no longer have any such fears."
"Nevertheless, we need to make still further progress."
"My group firmly believes that there should be an agreed and definitive draft for the constitution, without any options."
"We do not want a proposal to emerge from the Convention that could be reopened by the Intergovernmental Conference. No, we want a final draft, a definitive programme, which we hope will then meet with the agreement of the governments."
"And there is one thing that we want above all: the preamble refers to our Greek and Roman heritage and to the Enlightenment, but we must insist that our Christian heritage is also referred to in the preamble of the European constitution, forming as it does part of our identity today."
"We as the European Parliament demand equal rights in framing all European legislation, and we also demand that we should share budget rights with the Council, including medium-term financial planning."
"As regards the Commission, we want a strong Commission, and we welcome the suggestion that the President should be proposed by the Heads of State and Government on the basis of the election results, and that Parliament should then choose the President of the Commission."
"We want a strong Commission, because it, together with Parliament, and of course with the European Court of Justice, forms the heart of the European Community."
"We are also calling for the Convention to find a solution as regards the size of the Commission, a solution that ensures that the Commission is able to act, but one that also ensures that all the Member States of the European Union are represented in the Commission. I say that because all Member States, large and small, want a place at the Commission table."
"It is quite possible to think of mechanisms, including both rotation and junior Commissioners, that allow not only the large Member States but also the small ones to have a place at the Commission table."
"This is of great psychological importance for our common European project."
"We are also calling for the European Foreign Minister, who is at the same time to be the Vice-President of the Commission, to be subject - together with the entire Commission - to a vote of approval by Parliament."
"A situation in which the Foreign Minister has no link with Parliament is not acceptable."
"He too needs to have Parliament's approval and confidence, and that is why we want him to be linked into the Commission as a whole, which will then have to be approved by us."
"As far as the Council is concerned, I can very largely agree with what the President of the Commission and of course with what the President-in-Office of the Council has said, not in every detail, but in their broad thrust."
"In instances where the Council is acting as the legislature, we need genuine transparency, and, as a legislature, the Council must as a matter of principle take decisions by majority vote."
"That brings us to the issue of the presidency of the European Council. The Convention Praesidium's proposal contains a formula according to which the President of the European Council should not belong to another institution."
"This is just a personal opinion, but I believe it would be a good thing if this sentence were to be deleted."
"We need to keep open the option that one day, if we can reach that point, the President of the European Commission can also be the President of the European Council."
"That is why I hope that this sentence, which still figures in the proposal, will finally be deleted."
"(Applause)"
"I am happy to give my full support to the proposals for the European Court of Justice, for which I would specifically like to thank you, Mr Prodi."
"All or virtually all actions of the European Union must be subject to European law, because only if they are subject to court rulings will European actions be based on law rather than political opportunism."
"That is why it is so important that most areas of common European action, with very few exceptions, should be based on law and subject to control by the European Court of Justice."
"Only in that way will we become a genuine community of law."
"The same should apply to home affairs."
"I would like to thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for saying that the Greek Presidency will endeavour to achieve a result as regards the Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"Mr President-in-Office, if we cannot achieve a result in the Council, then I fear that there will never be a Statute for Members."
"I think that we have now been wrestling with the issue of the Statute for Members for 15 years, and by finally reaching a decision yesterday, by reaching a decision today, we will have fulfilled our parliamentary obligations."
"I hope that you will manage to fulfil your own obligations."
"If you should fail, the Council will bear a great burden of responsibility."
"I therefore wish you every success in adopting the Statute for Members."
"I hope that you will also manage to adopt the European party statute, because it is very important indeed for all Europe's party political families, large and small, that we should have a party statute that ensures transparency and an ability to act, and I would very much encourage you to take this to heart."
"In conclusion I would like to make a comment about foreign policy, which will have a major role to play."
"Yesterday we had the President of Algeria, Mr Bouteflika, here with us."
"These days we naturally tend to look towards Eastern Europe."
"This weekend, this Saturday and Sunday, we are encouraging our Polish partners to vote 'Yes' to Europe in their referendum, to say 'Yes' to membership of the European Union."
"I had a wonderful experience last Sunday in Warsaw during a pro-accession demonstration, when we were shouting out: Tak dla Polski!"
"'Yes' for Polish membership of the European Union!"
"It is now time, however, not only to look towards the east, but also towards the south, towards the Mediterranean area."
"We should really be injecting some substance into the Mediterranean dialogue, because up to now it has largely consisted of rhetoric."
"We should not lose sight of the Mediterranean area, because if we are concerned about border security - and we need to be, both in relation to countries in the east as well as countries in the south - we do not want to erect a new wall."
"No, we need to help the countries of the Mediterranean area, in North Africa, so that people there, and particularly young people, have opportunities in life."
"That is why we need to redouble our efforts."
"I wish you every success at the Thessaloniki Summit."
"If you take this decision, you will have my group's support."
"I wish you, the Greek Presidency and all of us in the European Union good luck!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me first of all to congratulate the Greek Presidency on its courage and determination."
"Like Ulysses, you have navigated through turbulent waters, and there were perhaps times when you should have tied certain members of the crew to the mast when the transatlantic Sirens began to sing, but we do have time to improve the situation."
"The central issue in this debate is the future of Europe, and it is within this framework that the Convention is working."
"I would also like to welcome the speech by the President of the Commission and to reaffirm, on behalf of my group, that we, who are working for the Convention, and who are participating actively, believe that it should produce a draft Constitution, and not just a list of options."
"This is an absolutely fundamental point."
"We also believe that to affirm the secular nature of the Europe we are building is a positive element, because it demonstrates our respect for all religions and for the complexity of our history."
"Consider, for example, that in Thessaloniki, until the Second World War, there lived the largest group of Sephardic Jews expelled from my country, which has a Greek, Roman, Christian, Muslim and Jewish history."
"It is a good thing that we are affirming Europe's secular role in this way."
"With regard to external personality, it is also important, as the President of the Commission has said, that we genuinely affirm the fundamental principles and the criterion of majority as a working system."
"The Greek Presidency has indicated that the stabilisation and integration of the Balkans is an absolutely essential issue."
"And we must remember that, when we launched the CSFP, our first failure came when we were unable to reach agreement amongst ourselves."
"And that is what exacerbated the Yugoslavian tragedy."
"When we began to work together in Kosovo and Macedonia we were able to improve."
"With regard to the final work of the Convention, I would like to point out firstly that the important thing is that no possibilities are ruled out, in other words, that the constitutional text allows us to evolve, because the text itself will not be able to change reality, but rather we must be able to continue with the Community method."
"And this involves certain fundamental issues."
"Firstly, the question of the Commission."
"If we say that the President of the Commission must be elected on the basis of the result of elections, this means, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you must make the Statute on European political parties an essential issue on the agenda at Thessaloniki, because without protagonists we will not be able to create a genuine democracy, in which the President of the Commission has democratic legitimacy, and I must say that it does not appear that the Council attaches great importance to this point at the moment."
"Secondly, with regard to the composition of the Commission, I would say that this is an open debate within all political families but, in any event, what we must do is strengthen the Commission's capacity as a college and the authority of its President."
"With regard to the establishment of a Council Presidency of a dual nature, President Prodi is well aware, as we all are, that such dual systems are not stable."
"There must be one body with executive power."
"We must support improvements in the Council's internal organisation, but an organisation based on two institutions which, to a certain extent, overlap, will not be stable."
"The very important issue for Parliament is the need to enshrine the power of the law, of shared legislative power, which means that the Council must also act in a democratic and open way and, at the same time, we must maintain the institutional balance."
"With regard to the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, I would like to insist on one point, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and I would also like the President of the Commission to give his view on it during this debate."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this issue does not relate to Parliament's internal system."
"It is an entirely constitutional issue and therefore what you have to do at this point is not to resolve the problem, but essentially not to oppose the solution we have offered, which furthermore justifies and supports the need for majority decision-making."
"Remember one thing: in relation to taxation, Nice decided on unanimity, and this is producing entirely negative results."
"Everybody must face their responsibilities, and you have responsibility in relation to an entirely constitutional issue."
"Mr President, please allow me to refer very briefly to two important issues."
"One is the economy."
"There has been a G8 Summit, in which the President of the Commission has participated."
"I would like you to be a little more explicit with regard to the development of the Lisbon strategy and also the euro, which is an issue of concern us, above all because the European economy is not working as a motor."
"Finally, with regard to the transatlantic Summit at the end of this month, it is very important to demonstrate the will of both sides to once again take up our responsibilities within a multilateral context, particularly at a time when there are signs of hope in the Middle East peace process and an opportunity to work for the future of the United Nations."
"Mr President, we must say to our American allies - and I am thinking of the extradition treaty - that they must treat us with equality, respecting our own legislative capacity and, above all, they must give us explanations - this is an important point - with regard to the entirely unacceptable situation of certain European citizens, in that law-free zone known as the Guantánamo base."
"This is also of importance in terms of our future relations."
"In any event, it is very important that you take a significant step, respecting and supporting the results of a Convention which leads us to a European Constitution."
"Mr President, European Liberal Democrats in this House hope that President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing will present to the Heads of State and Government a draft Constitutional Treaty which commands a broad consensus."
"It must dampen the fires of the increasingly bitter disputes we have witnessed in recent weeks."
"However, it is for the Convention, not its President, to confirm the existence or not of a consensus, and if the Convention needs a little more time to complete its work, so be it."
"Mr Giscard d'Estaing likes to say that his Constitution will last unchanged for 50 years, but unless a durable consensus is reflected in the final text and Member States are given the time to debate it we are likely to have to revisit the matter in the very near future."
"The latest proposals provide hope that the Praesidium is now in listening mode, but there is clearly still much listening to do."
"Even with the restrictions on his role in foreign policy, European Liberal Democrats remain unconvinced of the case for a full-time chairman of the European Council."
"We are suspicious that the larger Member States seek to unpick the seams of the Community fabric."
"A double-hatted approach for Europe's new Foreign Minister commands widespread support, so why not take the same approach and integrate the roles of European Commission and European Council Presidents?"
"Must we risk years of conflict, of turf wars, of duplication of effort before we recognise the sense of this approach?"
"At the very least we must leave open the door to an integrated presidency in a few years time."
"President Prodi spoke - and I have sympathy with much that he said - of the national veto."
"In the name of preserving national sovereignty, the veto all too often promotes international anarchy."
"Unless we are capable of thinking in new ways about the concept of sovereignty, we will continue to fail our citizens on the major challenges we face."
"While I welcome the proposed extension of Parliament's powers of democratic control over the budget and European legislation, I am concerned that an imbalance remains between the powers of Parliament and Council in other areas, such as concluding agreements with third countries on crucial security matters."
"Mr President-in-Office, another item on your agenda in Thessaloniki will be the debate on High Representative Solana's recommendations for an overall strategy in foreign and security policy."
"It is vital for the European Union to develop a doctrine which enshrines the central role of international law and of institutions such as the UN, the WTO and NATO."
"Europe also urgently needs a framework for deciding under which conditions we should commit troops to military action, including conflict prevention, peace enforcement and humanitarian crises."
"Congo is a welcome step forward but our current embarrassment over Bosnia-Herzegovina is a setback."
"And to prevent the European Union fracturing again as it did over Iraq, we need to start debating and planning now our approach to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"I hope that the summit will discuss Europe's approach to North Korea and Iran and not leave it until a crisis erupts."
"In the area of Justice and Home Affairs, I commend the President-in-Office for the progress made thus far under Greece's stewardship."
"I hope that you will continue to seek to balance repressive measures against illegal immigration with a generous approach to refugees and an emphasis on human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"I would also appeal to the President-in-Office to make every effort to conclude three important proposals concerning third-country nationals who are long-term residents, minimum standards for qualifying for refugee status and minimum standards for the granting of such status."
"Mr President-in-Office, you touched on the subject of a Members' Statute."
"I fear that the proposal we adopted yesterday will not make your work any easier, but I hope you will be guided in this, as in other matters on your agenda, by the advice of your philosopher, Socrates: remember that there is nothing stable in human affairs, therefore avoid undue elation in prosperity, or undue depression in adversity."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the Greek Presidency has been characterised by particularly seminal deadlines for the future of the Union, such as the signature of the accession treaty by ten new countries and the probable conclusion of the Convention's work."
"I would like to focus, however, on a third major event, which is more important than any other: the sudden appearance of the Union's identity crisis."
"What do we want to do together?"
"This existential question remains, more than ever, unanswered, certainly with regard to our internal ambitions for the Union."
"Do we genuinely want to set ourselves the objective that the praesidium of the Convention proposes should be included in the future Constitution of the Union, namely balanced economic growth and social justice, full employment, high living standards, social protection and equal opportunity for all?"
"In that case, why refuse to open the debate on a change in the priorities of the European Central Bank?"
"Its priority should no longer be price stability, at a time when there is a risk of recession, but instead protection of jobs, training and pensions for all women and men, the funding of useful infrastructures, such as large-scale piggybacking, and, more generally, genuine, fair, sustainable development."
"Why confine public services to the precarious status of a derogation to the rule of free competition, instead of making the promotion of high-quality services of general interest a priority of the Union, one consequently included in the Constitution?"
"Why continue to block any possibility of taxing the movement of capital and financial income?"
"This kind of blatant contradiction between the statement of objectives corresponding to expectations and the rejection of means that would enable us to achieve them is at the heart of the lack of trust felt by our fellow citizens with regard to the European institutions."
"What do we really want?"
"We must respond frankly and take responsibility for our choices so that Europeans can participate in the debate in an informed manner."
"As Albert Camus wrote: 'Mal nommer les choses, c'est ajouter au malheur du monde' ('To name things wrongly is to add to the misfortune of the world')."
"This identity crisis is equally obvious with regard to the role of the Union in the world."
"This has become only too clear since the war against Iraq."
"Before the conflict, contradictory, but frank, voices at least enabled public opinion to be clear on the matter and become involved in this confrontation of choices."
"They did so in such a spectacular manner and so uniformly from Western to Eastern Europe that this sudden crisis, in our opinion, represents a real hiatus in the history of the Union and the only hope of future change."
"On the other hand, since the show of force by the world superpower, against the law and will of the international community, it seems as if the European Union is rebuilding its unity on the basis of resigned or enthusiastic subordination to the fittest."
"Paul Wolfowitz admits that the crusade to eliminate weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was merely 'a bureaucratic pretext to gain acceptance for the war'."
"This tremendous deception has called forth no indignation among the Fifteen, let alone among the Twenty-five."
"This was confirmed this morning, and I regret it."
"George Bush decides to monopolise the management of the road-map for the Middle East, with all the risks entailed by his complicity with Sharon and the latter's reservations on the very substance of the commitments to be made; the European Union, despite having jointly initiated this fragile hope of peace, allows itself to be ousted from the scene with no resistance."
"The United States rejects the International Criminal Court, maintains special military courts, detains - as Mr Barón Crespo pointed out - European citizens in a law-free zone in Guantanamo Bay; the Council nevertheless prepares an extradition and mutual legal cooperation agreement with Washington, turning a blind eye to all these broken rules."
"Our US partners relaunch their attack for the moratorium on GMOs to be lifted in order to protect US agriculture;"
"Europe instantly starts to waver, holding back from applying the trade retaliation measures that are authorised by the WTO itself against the thoughtless tax advantages granted to exporters in the US."
"For all these reasons, Mr President, my group considers that the Greek Presidency would serve Europe well by raising this entire problem clearly at the Thessaloniki European Council: what do we want to do together and what means are we providing ourselves with in order to achieve our objectives?"
"In any case, in our societies, the question has now been raised and that is a very good thing."
"Earlier, I quoted a French author."
"For good measure, I shall end my speech by quoting the great German, Hölderlin: 'Where there is danger there is also salvation'."
"It is clear where the danger lies for Europe."
"Let us be among those who seek to save it."
"Mr President, I too would like to acknowledge the Greek Presidency's work over the last few months and say how pleased I am with yesterday evening's work to conclude the agreement on better regulation."
"In particular, I am grateful to the President of the Commission for having reminded us of the origins of the Convention and what our objectives were, given that at times we forget them, when we see that some members of the Praesidium and especially its Chairman want to pose more as members of the Intergovernmental Conference than Europe's founding fathers."
"The Convention, Mr President, must retain control of the process of reforming the European Union."
"If it does not manage to conclude its work by 20 June, we must allow it to continue working to reach an agreement, which is perfectly feasible provided that the Convention plays its full part as a constituent or para-constituent assembly, does not give in to blackmail by the small numbers of eurosceptics who have no interest in seeing it succeed - this needs to be said and reiterated - and asserts the value of an open, parliamentary working method which is very different from the intergovernmental method that is based exclusively on power politics."
"It is true that the President and the Praesidium have clearly miscalculated, intentionally prolonging the concluding period of debates without ever setting out in black and white which points had achieved a broad consensus, thereby deluding themselves that they can control the Convention at will and giving the wrong impression that the Convention is divided on everything; but today the governments which are anxious to see this constitutional reform succeed - and they exist, I am sure, and I am also sure that your government, Mr President, is among these - cannot simply pull the plug on the Convention if it does not conclude its proceedings to the satisfaction of the majority of its members."
"We consider that, if the Convention offered options at Thessaloniki, this would prove that its job is unfinished."
"In my opinion, there are at least three issues where we need to send out a signal of progress, democracy and clarity, which can be seen directly by all the citizens: direct access to justice for citizens in the event of breaches of the Charter of Rights; the simultaneous extension of codecision and Council majority voting, in particular with regard to taxation and foreign affairs."
"We will not be able to act as a global player, committed to the values of multilateralism and democracy, if we are blocked at every turn by vetoes and counter-vetoes and if all of this sector remains, as it is today, totally free of any form of parliamentary control."
"The third and final point is that the reform process cannot maintain unanimity and cannot allow once again - and this really is an astonishing situation for 2003 - the European Parliament to be excluded from the ratification process."
"Turning to the Seville programme which you, Mr President, referred to: we have often condemned the great imbalance in the strategy agreed in Tampere, between the repressive aspects of the fight against illegal immigration and the forced repatriation policy and the positive aspects, such as the creation of legal, controlled immigration channels, the softening of the visa policy and integration measures for third countries based on the non-discrimination principle."
"We hope, Mr President, that the Council will heed the loud and clear message that Parliament sent out yesterday: no signing of the extradition treaty between the European Union and the United States without clarification of the situation of the European Union citizens in Guantanamo."
"We are referring to Union citizens not because the others do not concern or interest us, but because we consider that, by taking this approach, we can legitimately intervene on the entire issue of the existence of a part of the world where no laws exist."
"Mr President, the Laaken Summit asked the Convention to bring the EU closer to the people."
"With the Praesidium's draft constitution, Chairman Giscard d'Estaing will instead put a greater distance between the EU and the people."
"A French sun king is leading the Convention in contravention of all the democratic ground rules."
"We are unable to have proposals translated and debated."
"The EU rules on transparency do not apply to Chairman Giscard d'Estaing. He is not content with leading the meetings; he also tells us what to think and is apt to draw conclusions that are clearly opposed to the views of the majority."
"He does not permit any votes that might upset his so-called consensus method, the same consensus method that he now wants to introduce, in place of unanimity, as the European Council's form of decision-making."
"The draft constitution is not progress but a large step backwards in history to the time before the introduction of democracy when the king asked for advice but took the decisions himself."
"Chairman Giscard d'Estaing's draft constitution may be likened to a large removal firm."
"It would transfer power from the electorate and elected representatives in all the countries to officials, ministers and lobbyists and from the legislature to the executive and judiciary, with the EU Court of Justice becoming the supreme interpreter of the constitution."
"Power would also be transferred from smaller countries to larger ones and from medium-sized countries to the largest ones. It would be transferred from ordinary party members to transnational party bureaucracies and from living democracies to a stronger Commission, a stronger European Parliament and the strongest power federation of all: the prime ministers of the largest Member States who would be at the very centre of power in the form of a directorate revolving around a French-German axis."
"They would be given power because of their countries' size, not because we had elected them."
"None of them were elected for saying what their plans were for the EU."
"The prime ministers would, then, meet after each election to the European Parliament and divide the posts among themselves."
"When Mr Blair could no longer be elected in Great Britain, he could become President of the EU, and Mr Fischer could become the EU Foreign Minister when his prospects in Germany dwindled."
"Mr Aznar could be made President of the Commission, or Vice-President with responsibility for justice and home affairs. Someone else could become the EU minister of finance and economic affairs, and a third person could become supreme commander of the armed forces."
"The constitution would create good jobs for outgoing prime ministers when they could no longer be elected."
"It would not be the electorate that would be given power over the institutions and their top people, as in federal states such as the US and Germany."
"In our case, 13 prime ministers could vote down 12 in the European Council, and the prime ministers of the three largest countries could vote down the 22 others in one go on the basis of what is termed their double majority, in which countries with 40% of the inhabitants are given the right of veto."
"The electorate in countries large and small would lose all power over the laws."
"Our democracy would be reduced to something very local."
"We should no longer be able to reward or punish our elected representatives at the next election, for most laws would be adopted behind closed doors by a working party under the aegis of the Council of Ministers or by the Commission, which would be given increased independent legislative power."
"Our national governments and parliaments would be like large, powerless local authorities in an EU writ large."
"Voters would be able to go to the polls in elections to the European Parliament, but it would not be possible in this way, either, to change the laws of the EU or replace the people running it."
"The European Parliament would obtain the right of codecision in quite a few areas, but it would not gain all the power lost by the national parliaments."
"The Commission would be given the sole and exclusive right to table many more proposals and to prevent others from being tabled."
"That power would be taken away from voters and elected representatives in all the countries."
"Officials and Council ministers would assume most of the power, for without their consent it would not be possible for any laws to be made."
"The power that, in all democratic countries, resides with the electorate would, in the case of the EU, be apportioned through an inscrutable power game involving prime ministers, meetings of the Council and of the Commission and a European Parliament potentially dominated by powerful supranational party bureaucrats."
"As for the electorate, it has an extremely remote role to play in the draft constitution to be debated at the Thessaloniki Summit."
"Greece was the cradle of democracy, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. The Thessaloniki Summit ought not to become a burial chamber."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I personally feel that Mr Bonde's wonderful speech - although a friend asked me whether he was announcing the end of the world - is like a carefree drawing produced by an unhealthy imagination like that which created Goya's monsters."
"If we follow the Convention experts, the mixture of Community and intergovernmental, the distribution of legislative, executive and so on, we will find ourselves in a period of total decadence, where we do nothing but destroy any remnants of the classical which brought us to this point."
"I hold up to you the Europe of Altiero Spinelli and Ernesto Rossi."
"Why?"
"Because these Europeans conceived the European federation inside Fascist prisons."
"This is just one name: the prisons were Fascist, Communist, Nazi, Clerical, Counter-reformist, of all kinds."
"Their dream was to eliminate the monsters of nationalist degeneration, of minority groups which wanted to establish themselves on a legal basis to the detriment of others."
"Mr President, I would just like to make one, very brief point: this debate is an affront to the parliament which has chosen to hold it."
"We should have discussed this on 18 June during the mini part-session."
"The President-in-Office of the Council could have given us hard facts then, and we would have known what they would actually have discussed at Thessaloniki."
"Today, they are simply telling us what is in the papers."
"Parliament is demeaning itself."
"We should have refused to hold a debate when it is not known what the proposed decisions will be, and I am very disappointed that none of the other Members have made this point."
"We would have met on 18 and 19 June, and the Council would have taken place in Thessaloniki on 20 and 21 June."
"Things sometimes happen better by chance than by Europe's political logic."
"This time I greatly appreciated Mr Wurtz's speech, for the first time in 20 years, I think."
"When he said that 'we are facing an identity crisis', he was right."
"But what defining parameter does the identity crisis refer to?"
"How do we define our identity?"
"Either we place ourselves in the history of continental Europe, which over the past 100 years has unceasingly produced all kinds of monsters, including our institutional monstrosities, which bear no relation to the transparency of the rule of law and its functioning, or if not, you are already creating a new anti-liberal, anti-democratic, anti-humanist monster out of this Europe of counter-reform and of a thousand violent and murderous tendencies."
"It was not by accident that we, or rather you, found yourselves on Saddam's side in actual fact, as regards Iraq."
"Let us admit that Mr Solana still sees Mr Arafat, despite the fact that there is another possibility, that of Mr Abu Mazen, created by Mr Sharon and Mr Bush."
"As in the forties, you are the heirs of a Europe that the England of the past and America freed."
"We need to free ourselves of you, and we shall!"
"Mr President, I too want to focus solely on the contribution that the Thessaloniki Council can make to a positive outcome of the Convention and hence to useful preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"At the moment, it is not easy to foresee at what stage the Convention will have reached on the eve of Thessaloniki, what text the Chairman, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, will submit to the Council or what level of consensus will have been reached in the Convention."
"I do not think that everything will be clarified and settled before Thessaloniki and, in any case, it is down to the Council to provide further stimulus towards fully attaining the objectives set by the Laeken Declaration of December 2001, the main points of which have already been listed by President Prodi."
"For my part, I would like to recall the content and tone of that declaration, especially in relation to the duties that the European Union must perform and the challenges that it must meet."
"It would be worrying if the conclusions, firstly of the Convention and then of the Intergovernmental Conference, did not live up to those expectations."
"I feel that I need to sound the alarm here: were the questions raised by the Laeken Declaration on the European Union's global role or on greater coordination of economic policies and so on, merely rhetorical questions?"
"Beware!"
"If we failed to meet the expectations that these questions raised among European citizens and world opinion, we would bear a heavy responsibility."
"The risk exists now, and it can be inferred from the text adopted thus far by the Praesidium of the Convention, yielding to the growing pressure from certain heads of government of the larger countries, particularly with regard to the Chapter on the Institutions, the Council's decision-making procedures and also the future procedures for reviewing the Treaty."
"In various regards, it would perhaps be instructive to reread the Treaty for which Altiero Spinelli was rapporteur, which was adopted by Parliament in February 1984."
"President Prodi has already said a great deal in very clear terms regarding the serious contradictions and the shortcomings of the text adopted so far by the Praesidium on institutional matters."
"I would just like to reassert the positions expressed by Parliament, which as an institution has not kept quiet, has not relied solely on its 16 representatives at the Convention - unfortunately only 16 out of 105 - but, through the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, it has made many contributions and sparked major debates during which - I want to stress this above all - a clear position was taken against the idea of a full time President of the European Council."
"In order to strengthen the authority of the European Council as a college, we have put forward other proposals, without excessively customising them and not just concentrating on having a President-in-Office for two and a half or five years."
"Mr Poettering pointed out that we must delete the idea of incompatibility envisaged between holding the mandate of President of the European Council and holding other European mandates."
"It is essential to remove the idea of incompatibility with holding a national mandate too, because if we establish a full time President of the European Council - albeit calling the post 'chairman' or trying to draw up a restrictive job description - all the elements of duplication, or dualism in the leadership of the Union, which have been condemned for being extremely confusing with regard to executive functions, will inevitably come about."
"Lastly, as Mrs Frassoni and Mr Bonde have already said, it must be stressed that Laeken did indeed appoint a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman, but it granted a collective mandate to the Convention as a whole."
"I believe that the Thessaloniki Council must issue a warning in this respect, so that we do not take a path where the personal opinions of the Chairman of the Convention or the compromise opinions of the Praesidium override majority opinions, supported by a broader consensus in the Convention plenary."
"Mr President, I wished to begin my speech by congratulating the Greek Presidency on the work it has done in very complicated and difficult circumstances."
"I am glad that during this Presidency the Parliamentary Conference on the Stability and Association Pact in relation to the countries of South-Eastern Europe has been able to take place since it has allowed us to improve our neighbourly relations with the Balkan countries."
"Winston Churchill said that the Balkans had a very great and very full history which hardly fitted within its territory."
"I believe that the European Union must manage and improve this relationship, and promote cross-border cooperation between the Balkan countries, as a method for preparing them for their future integration into the European Union."
"This cross-border cooperation is based on knowledge, understanding and trust in one's neighbours and eventually on cooperation with them."
"To be able to work on the creation of a free trade area between states, firstly by means of unilateral agreements, progressing towards the disappearance of visas between states and eventually also the disappearance of visas with the European Union."
"These countries must be integrated into the common foreign and security policy and they must be able to participate in programmes such as Socrates or Leonardo, in order to bring their integration into the European Union closer."
"The Balkans is a complex region."
"At the Thessaloniki Summit the European Convention will also be presented."
"I believe the Convention has not dealt with the complexity of certain European Union Member States, which are not nation states but rather multinational states."
"We must establish mechanisms to allow these nations without a state, as in the case of Catalonia or the Basque country, to be represented in the bodies of the European Union."
"In this regard, I believe that Mr Napoletano's report has been very positive, but certain points, such as the right to bring cases before the High Court of Justice, do not appear in the draft Convention."
"I believe this is necessary so that the citizens in question can feel directly represented within this European Union, which must be a Europe of the citizens, but also a Europe of the peoples it contains."
"Mr President, if I could make a wish in this debate it would be for Mr Simitis to stay in the Presidency for another six months, to stay for the second half of 2003 as well."
"I would make the same wish if Mr Karamanlis, the leader of the opposition, happened to be president-in-office, in the face of the concern which I truly feel at the advent, not of the Italian Presidency in general - I have a great deal of respect for the Italian people - but of Mr Berlusconi."
"I think that this is not the time to transfer American kitsch to the European Union and for us to become even more farcical than we were on the issue of Iraq."
"I want to say that the Greek Presidency, in my opinion, has been methodical and has made serious preparations."
"I wish to congratulate Mr Yiannitsis on the way in which the Presidency has behaved in cooperating with the European Parliament;"
"I think, however, that, despite this, there are serious political problems, especially on the major issue which has arisen, the issue of relations with the United States and the war in Iraq."
"The Greek Presidency followed a 'foot in two camps' policy and I think that the Presidency is closing with Europe in confusion."
"Which precise stance are we following?"
"The stance expressed by Mr Blair, the stance expressed by Mr Schroeder, the stance expressed by Mr Aznar or the stance expressed by Mr Chirac?"
"It is a huge problem and I think that it is a new given which will not allow us to start building on sand, because I hear everything being said about what we are going to build as regards our foreign policy, Ministers for Foreign Affairs etc. and I wonder on what ground, on what policy, we are going to build them."
"Before I finish, I shall just say that I believe that the Greek Presidency, because there was the Iraqi dossier, the most important and difficult dossier dealt with, should demand explanations, just as explanations are being demanded in the United States and in the United Kingdom about the weapons of mass destruction, which was the basis for the invasion of Iraq and was supported by eminent members of the European Council, such as Mr Blair, Mr Aznar and others."
"Mr President, Presidents of the Commission and of the Council, I wish, first of all, to offer my congratulations to the Greek Presidency for the intelligent and useful work it has undertaken."
"We have once again seen proof that the presidencies of the European Union's small- and medium-sized States are better and more pro-European than those of the larger countries."
"I wish to congratulate the Greek Presidency in particular on the way it acted during the crisis triggered by the war in Iraq, launched by the United States and the United Kingdom and supported by the government of the Spanish State."
"The presidency did its best to achieve peace and to combat the idea that transatlantic relations must involve the subordination, and even the humiliation, of Europe by the United States, a prospect that is all the more dismal because that country is currently governed by the militaristic far right."
"Accordingly, we hope that the Convention presents the European Council with a draft Constitution that continues constructing a Union that is respected on the world stage as a body working for peace and solidarity, unlike the militarism that currently prevails."
"I hope that the Constitution will give this Parliament all the democratic powers that it needs, including codecision and a role in electing the president of the Commission."
"We are, therefore, in agreement with President Prodi's ideas on the Council presidency."
"In any event, we must be able to have confidence in the future of the Union."
"Only recently, following the failure that was Nice, just one small group in this Parliament was calling for the Union to have a Constitution."
"As a European and as a political representative of a nation-state such as Galicia, of course I want the Constitution to respect the national and cultural diversity that constitutes the fabric of Europe."
"This is what we are calling for because Jacobin tendencies clearly still exist on our Continent."
"We must ask ourselves why Slovakia, Luxembourg, Estonia and Malta are recognised as European nations, but Galicia, Scotland and Catalonia are not."
"I shall make one final observation: I hope that the Union's institutions are courageous enough to end the criminal chaos that dominates international maritime traffic and which leads to disasters such as that involving the Prestige."
"We must prevent the appalling deaths, such as those that occurred the day before yesterday just off the Spanish coast, of illegal immigrants seeking work in Europe."
"We must ensure that joint policies such as the CAP and the CFP or cohesion policy are fair and non-discriminatory."
"We hope that this will happen, so that everyone can benefit."
"Thank you, President-in-Office of the Council, for attending today and for the information you have given us."
"The forthcoming Thessaloniki Summit is of considerable importance for the future of the Union, both in the medium and the long term."
"It is important to lay the foundations so that Europe, or rather the Union, soon to complete an enlargement process which is unprecedented in its history and in the history of the world, can increasingly combine economic power with political dignity."
"It is to do justice to the latter that I would like to talk about the policies neglected by that same Union, something which is even more serious as it grows in importance."
"Health, for example, is one such policy."
"With reference to Article 152 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, I acknowledge national autonomy for health issues, but a Europe which is heading for enlargement to include 25 countries cannot underestimate the impact which the social and healthcare problems of these countries will have on the political and social economy of the Europe of the future."
"This is why the UEN Group recently met in Turin and discussed precisely these enlargement-related social and healthcare issues, producing a document that has already been submitted to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi."
"The results of this work were not reassuring, so much so that our hope is that, during the six-month Italian Presidency, public health will be included among the Union's priorities as soon as possible."
"The globalisation process could see ill people and diseases knocking loudly on Europe's doors, finding us lacking, as has already happened with regard to SARS infection: a situation which tested our health coordination and cooperation abilities, a matter which the forthcoming Italian Presidency must address if it truly wishes to prevent emergencies and tackle the health service divide that the individual nations are experiencing and which will induce people to travel en masse to countries with health service facilities and centres of excellence, which, in turn, might be in danger of paralysis."
"I hope that the Union will decide to give consideration to this and that the next Presidency of the Union will put forward proposals in this respect."
"Mr Yiannitsis, you have been the recipient of many compliments this morning and I should like to agree in one specific regard: I compliment you on the way in which, in the midst of all the right and proper attention to the Convention for example and transatlantic relations, the Greek Presidency has succeeded in preventing the Western Balkans from sinking into oblivion."
"That would be quite wrong and extremely foolish."
"Your starting point is, I think, correct."
"The question is not if the countries of the Western Balkans will ever join the European Union, but when."
"Before they can join however there is much that needs to be put right."
"This conclusion is in itself nothing new."
"In 1999, after the Kosovo war, the European Union set up the so-called stabilisation and association process, based on an analysis of the problems in the 1990s: ethnic violence, extreme nationalism and the need to develop democratic structures."
"This approach has - as we have said here many times - been a success."
"Think of European Union action in Macedonia."
"But we have reached a point where the European Union's policy cannot simply be based on an analysis of the 1990s; it must also be based on an analysis of the current and the future problems of the countries in the Western Balkans."
"These problems are increasingly resembling a problem the present Member States are also having to face, namely socio-economic stagnation."
"In my opinion this means that we must retain the good points in our current policy in respect of the Balkans."
"Other elements must be added to them however. As I see it, these are elements from the pre-accession strategy as the Union has known it to date, such as the strengthening of the unilateral trade benefits for the countries of the Western Balkans, the opening of a number of European programmes which has often been mentioned such as the education programmes Leonardo and Socrates and the introduction not only of the logic, but also of the methodology of the cohesion funds as we currently know them."
"This too is possible in the Western Balkans, as is the step-by-step introduction of the change in visa policy, which Baroness Ludford has previously mentioned."
"The Greek Presidency has rightly begun with an exchange of students, which is a good start, but it is not enough."
"What we need is not a repeat of the way in which we have so far drawn the countries of Central and Eastern Europe into the European Union."
"We now need a tailor-made strategy with elements of our old policy and elements of the new policy that must be added to it."
"This - and I say this direct to the Council - this needs money."
"My appeal to the Greek Presidency therefore is to ensure that the new policy, which I warmly support, is feasible in financial terms as well."
"The trick will be in not creating any new illusions, but bringing the Balkans closer to the European Union."
"If we fail to do so, we shall regret it dearly later on."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I welcome the Greek Presidency's statements about the Balkans, and unlike Mr Alavanos I am also pleased that in the second half of this year the Italians will have an opportunity to pursue this excellent policy further."
"There are in fact two neighbouring countries that have a vital interest in seeing stability in the Western Balkans, that is to say in south-eastern Europe."
"It is a fact that these countries - Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Albania - are at very different stages in their development."
"They will ultimately have an opportunity, as already promised in Zagreb and as will once again be confirmed in Thessaloniki, to become members of the European Union depending on their own individual progress."
"The road they have to travel will be a difficult one, as the 10 accession countries have discovered."
"It will place great demands on their citizens."
"We recognise the different rates of progress that exist, which are chiefly due to the fact that these countries have all had different opportunities to develop."
"Until just two years ago, Serbia and Montenegro still had Milosevic."
"We therefore need to take into consideration those opportunities of which they were unable to take advantage."
"Many of these problems are, however, common to all these countries, such as the fight against corruption and organised crime, and above all the fight against traffic in human beings."
"In many of these countries the judicial system is still very poor and deficient."
"Another cause for regret is that cooperation at regional level is not as good as it is always made out to be."
"If an appeal is being made to us to grant these countries visa freedom, then, in my opinion, they should first come to an agreement between themselves to allow their own citizens to travel freely."
"It is not that simple to get from Serbia to Croatia."
"That is why I believe that these countries should first put their own house in order before they start making further demands on us."
"I also believe that bilateral free trade areas are a good thing."
"However, they can only be truly effective if they are extended to create a multilateral free trade area."
"I would like to mention three points contained in our motion for a resolution."
"It is reasonable for the Stability Pact to be closely linked with the stabilisation and association process."
"It is important that the CARDS programme, for which ever less funding is available, should be given more money."
"The money is available; we do not need to create new funding."
"The pre-accession aid has not been fully used, and I regret that the Commissioner mentioned a figure of EUR 200 million."
"You probably do not want to exceed that figure, but I believe that we need more, because economic development is a prerequisite for our co-existence, for the development of this Community and for the ultimate solution of the problems of refugees."
"I would like to touch upon one final issue, and that is the question of young people in these countries."
"Without their youth, these countries will have no chance of developing favourably."
"If they are not given a signal now that Europe will not become a reality just for their grandchildren, but now, for them, there will be problems."
"They are all trying to leave these countries and to emigrate to other countries, such as New Zealand, the United States and Canada."
"We must open up our Socrates and Leonardo programmes to them."
"As the rapporteur for the Socrates programme, I know what a difficult business that is."
"I appeal to the Greek Presidency to play an active role here in ensuring that we really give the young people of these countries a signal that they can take part in our educational programmes."
"If I rightly understood the communiqué issued by the presidents of these countries on Monday, it contains many good things - many promises and many valuable insights."
"I only hope that something will be done in Thessaloniki to give these countries a real incentive to translate those promises into action."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am the third or fourth Member queuing up to speak about the Balkans."
"It is true to say that the Balkans are at present not in the public eye, that they are not hitting the headlines."
"Thank goodness, you might say, because it is usually only bad news there that makes the front pages."
"Nevertheless, there are far-reaching problems."
"Growth in the Balkans is too weak for them to catch up."
"They have high unemployment, low inward investment, and there are still open wounds from the armed conflicts that marked the end of the former Yugoslavia."
"The process of refugee return remains to be completed and the process of nation building is still incomplete and uncertain - we only have to think of Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia or Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Added to that, the area is characterised by international crime that is also spilling over into Western Europe."
"It is therefore the job of the Presidency and of the Thessaloniki Summit, the 'Zagreb II Summit', to make a clear offer to these countries, but also to spell out the conditions very clearly."
"We already have the Copenhagen Criteria, and there is no reason to bend the rules they stipulate."
"But we also need to help these countries carry out their economic reforms."
"It has already been mentioned that the CARDS programme alone is not enough."
"We need to move towards pre-accession instruments and pre-accession aid, just as we did with the other enlargement countries, and secondly -as has also already been mentioned by others in the 'Balkans brigade' - we need to build up the rule of law."
"There can be no avoiding that."
"This means that the refugee problem must be solved, and that respect for minorities must be clear in people's hearts and minds and not just laid down in the law."
"There needs to be consistent prosecution of all crimes, and in particular, it should go without saying, of crimes against humanity."
"And there must be cooperation with The Hague."
"Like my fellow Members, I regret the fact that the United States is giving ambiguous signals: on the one hand strong pressure for cooperation with The Hague and on the other hand equally strong pressure to sign Article 98 agreements in connection with the International Criminal Court."
"That is untenable for us, and I believe and hope that the European Union - both the Council and the Commission - will make it clear to these countries that such agreements run counter not only to the spirit of the Common Foreign and Security Policy but also to the acquis communautaire that we have created in that area."
"That is why I am hoping for three things from the Thessaloniki Summit. The first is to give these countries clear membership prospects, which is essential; the second is to extend the support instruments not only quantitatively but also qualitatively, as part of preparations for an accession strategy; and the third point is strict monitoring."
"I agree with those fellow Members who have said that this is not about being particularly benevolent."
"We need to be able to tell those countries exactly where there are still problems, but we also need to be able to tell them where progress has been made."
"I hope - and this, Mr Prodi, is a job for the Commission - that Europe will react swiftly to the application by Croatia, the first of these countries to apply for membership."
"In principle, we should be giving a positive reply, at least I hope that things are moving in that direction."
"But there are also still certain things that Croatia needs to address, of course."
"I therefore believe not only that the Thessaloniki Summit should be described as 'Zagreb II', it should also be a kind of pre-Copenhagen, that is to say a Copenhagen I, in that it gives clear signals."
"Something can also be done as regards visa policy; it can simply be made more flexible, without having to lift visa requirements at this stage."
"Mr President-in-Office, I hope you will take on board that although we in this House are watching these countries with an extremely strict and critical eye, we also share the belief that we should give them reasonable European prospects."
"If you do that in Thessaloniki, then you will be able to chalk up a great success."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, one very important point for the European Council in Thessaloniki: bring Europe out of the closed back rooms of governments and give it back to its citizens."
"Mr Giscard d'Estaing will soon be presenting the European Convention proposal for a European Constitution."
"The Convention has achieved much over the past 15 months: agreement has been reached on a single European Constitution and ambitious proposals have been tabled in the area of simplification and the guaranteeing of fundamental rights."
"With the finishing line in sight, however, intense discussions have now broken out about the details of the institutional framework."
"Yes or no to a permanent President of the Council, yes or no to a European Commissioner for each Member State, yes or no to a Congress of Peoples."
"These institutional questions are all very important, but in my view must really only come into play when we have reached agreement on the content of European policy areas."
"Europe must become important for its citizens."
"It must also ask these citizens for an effective policy in the area of foreign affairs, a policy in respect of social issues such as pensions, employment an economic policy, a security policy, a policy in the important area of asylum and migration and, let us not forget, an environmentally friendly and fair agriculture policy."
"In all these areas we must move away from paralysing vetoes and towards truly effective decision-making."
"Europe, that means making a policy for European citizens so that we can create an area of security, solidarity and prosperity for all."
"Europe is about content and not about window dressing."
"Institutional questions are very important, but first we must give Europe back to its citizens."
"Only when we are sure that where European policy is needed it can also be effectively structured can we start the debate about the architecture."
"It has to be simpler, more understandable, more effective and closer to the citizen - more democratic in other words."
"That means a President of the Commission elected by the European Parliament and a troika presidency of the European Council that guarantees both continuity and the involvement of individual countries."
"I call on both the European Convention and those government leaders who will shortly be attending the IGC to persevere and to opt for an effective and democratic, that is communal, Europe."
"It is precisely in areas such as migration and asylum policy that we have seen the lack of results when policy is made by way of intergovernmental back rooms."
"So, Mr President, make the policy communal, excluding the right of initiative for the European Commission and with decisions taken by both the Council, by qualified majority, and by Parliament."
"Start by ensuring in particular that the content is in order and then provide for an adequate democratic structure through a debate about the institutions."
"Only in this way can a credible Europe be created for its citizens."
"Give Europe back to its citizens by allowing them to express an opinion on the European constitution through a referendum."
"That will force the political parties and the public at large into an active and political debate about Europe."
"I call on my Dutch colleagues in the CDA and the VVD to support this idea and to distance themselves from Dutch back room politics."
"The European citizen deserves better, Mr President."
"Mr President, if I have understood President Prodi correctly, Europe, by remaining a political dwarf, will eventually lose its status as an economic giant."
"I personally do not dream of Europe as a great power in world affairs, becoming policeman and teacher to the rest of the world."
"I dream of a world governed by international law, based on cooperation between all States, large and small."
"Europe is currently experiencing a few problems."
"Nonetheless, thanks to Community cooperation, our Europe is certainly the fairest, most egalitarian society in the world."
"Our ambition should be to eliminate the last inequalities in Europe, enabling every individual to work and live decently."
"To do so, we need to share: share within the Union, share with the new Member States, share with developing countries."
"Politically, our Union must be able to speak with one voice."
"This means that the most original institution of the Union, the Commission, must represent all the Member States."
"The Commission must remain the driving force, with which each citizen must be able to identify. This politically more united Europe, however, is not a goal in itself."
"The aim of political action is to satisfy the economic, social, environmental and cultural needs of our citizens."
"The Convention has devoted far too much attention to the institutional architecture, which will serve no purpose if we do not provide ourselves with the political means to achieve sustainable development and economic growth in order to ensure full employment."
"Currently, the European Central Bank's interpretation of Article 105(1) of the Treaty is too restrictive, limited to the sole objective of combating inflation."
"Although stability is necessary, the fight against deflation and for growth is equally essential."
"Hence the need to specify the ECB's mission as follows: 'the main objective of the European System of Central Banks is to maintain price stability."
"While combating inflation and deflation, the ESCB should support the other economic and social policies of the Union'."
"This clarification of the mission of monetary policy is vital if Europe does not want to suffocate in formal stability, which, ultimately, is unproductive."
"I shall end, Mr President, by thanking Greece for an exceptional presidency."
"This shows, once again, that the smaller countries generally accomplish a better presidency than the larger, more conceited countries, which, out of personal vanity, want to abolish rotating presidencies."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to join in warmly congratulating the Greek Presidency."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Thessaloniki offers you the opportunity to strengthen the Union's immigration policies and to improve the measures for offering security to European citizens."
"These are two essential, but different, objectives."
"You must confront the new threats resulting from organised crime, whose tentacles stretch throughout and beyond the European Union, and you have instruments for doing so, such as the European arrest warrant and Europol."
"Strengthen them and use them to combat large-scale international crime and also small-scale crime, the crime which fills our streets with beggars, children and prostitutes, victims of human trafficking, but please do so using the instruments necessary for each issue."
"A member of Al Qaeda is not an illegal immigrant who indulges in terrorism, but an international criminal."
"And you must manage immigration, which is a different thing, a complex social phenomenon which should be dealt with from different angles."
"Do that, please."
"Return to the global and integrated vision laid down at Tampere."
"Return to the map drawn up by the Commission, adopt the legislative framework envisaged, apply the measures proposed by the Commission with regard to third countries, integration, employment, with regard to all the issues relating to this field."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the majority of illegal immigrants enter the Union legally."
"The majority of illegal immigrants are domestic employees working in our homes."
"A danger to the European Union?"
"To whom?"
"And above all, please, please call things by their real name."
"If the leaders of the European Union are going to persist in mixing international organised crime with immigration we are going to have a problem."
"If we tell the citizens that immigration, even if the adjective illegal is added, is one of the new dangers to be confronted by the Union, we should not be surprised if it leads to excessive reactions, we should not be surprised if it creates a problem with the citizens of the Union and their perception of immigration."
"Mr President, there is a fundamental requirement that should always be made of a constitution, irrespective of whether it is a national constitution or the constitution of the European Union."
"That requirement is clarity: clarity when it comes both to the distribution of power and to well-defined competences."
"As a Swede, I have an unhappy experience of the devising of constitutions."
"When the Swedish constitution - our fundamental law - was adopted, far too many questions were left unanswered."
"The Swedish Parliament - the Riksdag - was given more or less unlimited power to take decisions on just about every issue on the basis of a simple majority."
"Thanks to a unique Swedish tradition, freedom of expression and freedom of the press retained their strong position, but the political authorities were given the go-ahead to put their fingers into every pie."
"This mistake of Sweden's must not be repeated in a constitution for the European Union."
"The most important thing must be to devise a clear catalogue of competences explaining which tasks are to be carried out by the EU and which are to be carried out at national, or some other, level."
"There are proposals to make social issues with shared competence matters for the EU."
"As I see it, that would be an historic mistake."
"Such issues are best dealt with by each individual Member State."
"Moreover, I see no other way of proceeding in an enlarged EU with a huge range of economic conditions from one country to the next."
"In the same way, all essential aspects of economic policy must remain the responsibility of the Member States."
"The euro is the Member States' common responsibility, implying budgetary discipline."
"Taxes and decisions on expenditure must, however, remain the responsibility of the individual nations."
"There are large differences between one country and another, and flexibility is required."
"Low taxes will be the new Member States' only chance of gradually catching up economically with the current Member States."
"On the issue of the distribution of power, it is important for us not to provide the EU with several presidents or institutional chairmen."
"That would scarcely contribute to a more effective EU."
"The rotating Presidency of the Council is also important if the Member States are to be able to feel they belong together."
"It is also a unique opportunity for small Member States too to influence the work of the EU."
"I therefore want to urge the Convention and the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to be very careful in establishing the shape of the future EU and the way in which it is to operate."
"Mr President, the Convention has made progress in many issues of political content."
"Of particular importance is the fact that the fundamental rights of EU citizens are to be determined as a binding component of the work of the Union."
"There are still shortcomings, however, in the organisation of the division of duties and responsibilities among the institutions."
"It was the task of the Convention to put forward proposals to make decision-making more effective, clearer, more democratic and more transparent than before."
"This mandate cannot include the setting up of new institutions."
"The work of the Council does indeed need reforming, decisions must be taken openly and its work must have continuity."
"This cannot happen, however, with a permanent president who is beyond democratic control, or by reducing the Commission's power of initiative and its executive power."
"Public support is absolutely essential for the future of the EU."
"One very conspicuous institution in all Member States is the Commission."
"In the name of equality, therefore, there must also be a Commissioner from all the Member States in the future."
"The work of the Convention has gone in the right direction with regard to the development of EU legislation."
"I support the appeal made today by President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, that the right of veto should be relinquished when the EU is making a decision."
"Using the right of veto does not achieve anything worthwhile as it only hampers and prolongs the decision-making process."
"One EU priority this term has been food safety."
"We have not succeeded in deciding where to locate the Food Agency, however, because the right of veto has been used."
"At Thessaloniki it will be necessary to sort this out and decide that the permanent home for the Food Safety Agency should be Helsinki."
"Helsinki is already totally equipped for the Agency to be able to start its work immediately after the decision has been taken."
"Finally, I wish to say a special thank you to Greece, the country to hold the presidency, for the way it has helped the progress of matters to do with safety at sea."
". (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been a very heated, highly interesting debate;"
"I have noted all the issues raised, vital issues for our future: from the Balkans question to equality of the Union's citizens, to safeguarding the Institutions."
"During this brief reply, I will restrict myself simply to making an appeal, which I consider absolutely necessary and indispensable today when, at Thessaloniki, we will have to take fundamental decisions for our whole future."
"I would like to appeal to the Convention to give us the response that many of you - starting with Mr Wurtz - have said that the Convention has not yet provided."
"There is a very simple reason for this."
"We decided to form the Convention during our institutions' deepest crisis; we decided on it all together after the night of debate at Nice, when we saw that the intergovernmental method of negotiations between States - precisely, during the intergovernmental nights of talks - did not provide satisfactory results; we decided to take that path in order to restore to our people and our parliaments the sovereignty which befits them."
"Now the Convention has got down to business: it was to be a finite process; the Convention was to give the Intergovernmental Conference a finished product."
"Instead, a parallel process has emerged: a kind of Intergovernmental Conference parallel to the Convention has come about, which has divided into various fragments and which is in danger, at this time, of further fragmentation."
"I repeat what Mrs Frassoni said: currently a false impression is being given, a false message that the Convention is split on everything."
"Therefore, my appeal is very simple: we want the Convention to carry out the Convention's work fully, autonomously; we want it to produce, as you have all requested, a clear, systematic draft, because the Convention Assembly represents all the citizens, all the countries, all the institutions of Europe."
"We need its voice, we need it to carry out its role in full."
"Over recent months, we have been divided over basic policy points and we have also suffered humiliation in our foreign policy."
"Do we wish to deny ourselves the instruments we need to restore our dignity?"
"Do we wish to deny ourselves the courage to advance proposals which are becoming instruments necessary for our survival?"
"I can summarise with great satisfaction the contribution of all the leaders of the main political groups - whom I have the pleasure of seeing here before me - who, as one, have put forward coherent, courageous proposals on the coalition rules, on Parliament's role, on the future dynamics of the Institutions."
"They have put forward courageous proposals for both today and tomorrow, such as combining the President of the Commission and the President of the Council."
"They have given us, all working together, a single framework of what they want for the Europe of the future."
"And so, just as I am calling on the Convention to express a single, strong opinion and to present it to the Intergovernmental Conference,"
"I am calling on you, chairmen of the largest European parliamentary groups, to tell our friends and fellow Members in plenary to speak out loud and clear, to make clear the conditions under which they will agree to sign the new agreement upon which Europe must be built."
"This is my appeal to you, because, at this time, we all need the Convention's voice for the new Europe."
"(Loud applause)"
"Thank you, Mr President of the Commission."
"I have received six motions for resolutions on this issue in accordance with Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, all morning we have been distressed by the news reaching us of a terrible rail accident which has taken place in my country, in my region of Castilla-La Mancha, in the town of Chinchilla."
"Many people have been killed, but what is even more serious is that apparently 21 people have disappeared, burnt to death inside the train's carriages."
"In view of the anguish we are feeling in my country, and more specifically in my region, I would like to inform my fellow Members of this tragedy and ask the President to send a message of condolence and solidarity to the families and the regional government of Castilla-La Mancha, who are so seriously affected by this tragedy."
"I would like to inform the House that written declaration No 4/2003 submitted by Mr Tannock, Mrs Villiers, Mr Helmer, Mrs McKenna and Mr de Roo on the live transport of animals from Member States and EU candidate countries had, by 3 June 2003, been signed by the majority of Parliament's component Members."
"Consequently it will be forwarded to the addressees and published together with the names of the signatories."
"Mr President, I just wish to thank all those Members of the House, across all nationalities, delegations and groups, who signed my written declaration."
"It is a mark of a civilised society how it treats its animals."
"This is a wake-up call to the Commission and in particular Commissioner Byrne, whom I now call upon to come before the House to make a statement on this issue."
"It is dear to our hearts that we uphold high welfare standards in animal transport, in particular in the acceding countries, where there is no tradition of high welfare standards for animals."
"I would also like to make the point that I am delighted that my amendment to the Corbett report, taking written declarations outside of the plenary, has now come of age."
"I have seen a lot of interest today in both the piracy issue and Rugby League."
"Let us hope that the Members of this House will sign declarations in future."
"The next item is the vote."
"Report (A5-0162/2003) by Giovanni Claudio Fava, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission communication to the European Parliament and the Council on the Action plan to counter the social, economic and regional consequences of the restructuring of the EU fishing industry (COM(2002) 600 - 2003/2039(INI))"
"(Parliament adopted the text)"
"Proposal from the Conference of Presidents complementing the decision taken by the European Parliament on 9 April 2003 on the Calendar of the European Parliament, 2004"
"(Following the rejection of Amendment No 1, the President declared the proposal of the Conference of Presidents approved)"
"Report (A5-0193/2003) by Willi Rothley, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the adoption of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament"
"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, I propose that we should reject that suggestion, for the simple reason that in its opinion the Commission clearly spelt out that this is a very serious proposal."
"We have now been discussing this subject for five years, and it would not make any sense at all to re-run all those discussions."
"It is high time we made a decision on this subject, and I can only call on the House to reach a decision now and not to perpetuate this never-ending debate."
"I therefore call on you to reject the proposal for referral back to committee."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the Commission has certainly made a positive contribution here, for which I offer my sincere thanks."
"Its support for the Parliament's position is welcome."
"There has, incidentally, been a misunderstanding about Article 33 that would not have arisen if we had based our discussion on the German text."
"On the subject of misunderstandings, I would like to point out that the amendment tabled by my group to delete Article 5 of the resolution simply means that, as the Bureau has agreed the reform, it no longer makes any sense of course to call on the Bureau to adopt this particular reform."
"That has been settled, and there is nothing more to it than that."
"Perhaps you will permit me, Mr President, to make a further point. We are voting on the Statute today; it is to be adopted today."
"This is a decision under Article 190(5) of the Treaty."
"We are not voting on whether we want the reform or not, as some newspapers have suggested."
"That is not the case at all."
"We all want the reform."
"But I would be grateful to those who are highlighting this aspect in particular if they would finally stop denigrating the majority of this House by suggesting that we wanted to block this reform by linking it with other, legitimate political objectives."
"This is therefore a decision under Article 190(5)."
"Nevertheless, as far as taxes are concerned, we are open to the Council's proposal that an additional national tax should be introduced for a limited number of Member States."
"We are quite open to that suggestion."
"Mr President, your speech yesterday following the vote was a very worthy one."
"It was a fine speech that was a testament to your political wisdom."
"It was also courageous, and I hope that this House will summon up the courage to accept its political responsibility."
"There is a great deal at stake here today."
"I implore you, ladies and gentlemen, in the interests of the peoples of Europe, those whom we serve, to summon up that political courage!"
"(Applause)"
"I would ask, for a quite specific reason, to take the floor under the rules of procedure."
"I shall not, like Mr Rothley, talk in very elevated terms, but explain to him that the reason why the Group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to omit paragraph 5 of the resolution is simply that the Praesidium has already made a decision. At the same time, however, there are some important principles contained in this demand that changes to the reimbursement of travel costs enter into force at the same time as the new Statute, if it ever sees the light of day."
"Instead of calling upon the Praesidium to take a decision, the wording might be in terms of taking note of the Praesidium's decision. At the same time, an important addition should be made: namely, where the words 'enter into force together with the Statute' appear, I wish to propose adding the words 'and with the same validity as the latter'."
"It may perhaps be a little difficult to grasp in translation, but the principle is that decisions taken on the reimbursement of travel costs must have the same legal validity as the Statute."
"That is what I should like to propose."
"Amendment No 7, if adopted, would delete the paragraph, in which case the oral amendment would not stand because the paragraph it refers to would have been deleted."
"In the event that Amendment No 7 is rejected, then I will ask the House if it wishes to accept Mr Krarup's oral amendment."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, with the next three reports this House is voting on the package negotiated with the Council on the decision to create an internal energy market in Europe."
"As acting chairman of the committee responsible, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I am obliged to make a statement here before we continue. The House is voting on 50 amendments in three reports."
"This compromise document is accompanied by two statements."
"One is the statement by the Commission, which the Vice-President of the Commission presented to the House during Monday's debate, and that is recorded in the Minutes."
"It is also accompanied by an interinstitutional statement by Parliament, Council and Commission, and it has been agreed that this statement should be read into the Minutes of Parliament, that both statements should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union with the legislative text and that this arrangement should also be recorded in Parliament's Minutes now."
"I am therefore obliged to read out the interinstitutional statement here."
"I can reassure you that it is not very long."
"It reads as follows: 'The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission underline the need for Member States to ensure that adequate financial resources for decommissioning and waste management activities, which are audited in Member States, are actually available for the purpose for which they have been established and are managed in a transparent way, thus avoiding obstacles to fair competition in the energy market'."
"Mr President, I ask you to sign this statement on behalf of this House and to arrange for its publication in the Official Journal."
"Mr Mombaur, I would be happy to sign that and ensure that it is duly published as a document of record."
"Through you I congratulate your committee and the rapporteurs on what is an extraordinary piece of work and an example of politics at its very best."
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0136/2003) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 96/92/EC (15528/2/2002 - C5-0034/2003 - 2001/0077(COD)) (rapporteur: Claude Turmes)"
"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, Commissioner, within the context of votes on the directive at first reading, the Commission promised Parliament that it would submit two related directives: one on cogeneration, on which the Commission has kept its promise, and another on energy efficiency services, which is highly important in order to provide a framework for the market in this regard."
"This directive was promised us, first of all, after summer 2002, then for the end of 2002."
"It has still not arrived and today there is a faint possibility that this important directive might not be adopted during the current Parliamentary term."
"Can the Commission assure us that this directive will be presented as soon as possible, preferably before the summer?"
"Mr President, I would just make my fellow MEPs aware of the conditions governing this vote."
"There is a political agreement between ourselves in Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission whereby, through adoption, we can avoid conciliation."
"We therefore have to vote in favour of the first block and against blocks 2 and 3."
"I would therefore urge Members to do just that."
"We should in that way obtain most of what Parliament has wanted, at the same time as being able to avoid conciliation."
". (DE) Mr President, this report is about the phasing out as quickly as possible of old oil tankers, which have been responsible, for example, for the Prestige disaster."
"We have reached an agreement with the Council and the Commission that what the committee has agreed is also a common decision, and that we can complete the first reading today."
"I therefore urge all honourable Members to vote in favour of the committee's proposals; otherwise we will put the timetable at risk."
"If we can complete the first reading, this regulation would come into force in the summer, allowing us to achieve a major improvement in maritime safety in our European waters."
"Amendments Nos 33 and 34 have been withdrawn by the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, and I therefore hope that other Members will only wish to vote on the committee's amendments."
"Mr President, it is extremely important not only that we phase out the single-hull oil tankers, but also that we realise there will then be 200 to 300 ships out there somewhere."
"Not only does Parliament have to accept responsibility for promoting the phasing out of these tankers, it must also accept responsibility for waste management, for the correct disposal and scrapping of ships."
"I did try to incorporate this in this resolution, but I think that we will have every opportunity to include our need to accept responsibility for the dismantlement of these ships as well in the Sterckx report."
"I feel that we must follow the fast-track procedure Mr Piecyk is proposing and I shall therefore withdraw my amendments."
"Mr President, I should simply like to point out that there is a slight error in the Portuguese version of Amendment No 20: there is a missing semicolon!"
"A missing semicolon in Portugal is an extremely serious matter and I would draw this to the attention of the services."
"(Laughter)"
"Thank you for that, rapporteur!"
"I should like to point out to the House that the Portuguese version has already been corrected."
"The semicolon, and order, have been restored!"
"Mr President, I wished to speak on a point of order in accordance with Rule 142, observance of the Rules of Procedure, with regard to Rule 140 b) and c), which relate to the admissibility of amendments."
"Rule 140 b) and c) prohibits the presentation of an amendment aimed at replacing or deleting the whole of a text or which proposes amending more than one of the articles or paragraphs of the text it refers to."
"According to the services, if Amendment No 20 is approved, all the amendments presented to Parliament will lapse and so will all those that have been presented in committee, and its approval would also mean that the legislative text of the Commission's proposal in its entirety would lapse as well."
"The Commission told us yesterday, through Commissioner Fischler, during the evening debate, that it was against Amendment No 20, that it was against the other amendments by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, from No 21 to No 29, and said that they were contrary to the Treaty on the accession of Spain and Portugal."
"Mr President, Amendment No 20 intends to extend the Treaty on the accession of Spain and Portugal, which I believe to be legally unacceptable since it contravenes the Community acquis."
"Mr President, I would like the services to tell me what the admissibility of this amendment is based on."
"I would like them please to speak to me directly, or, if not, write to me, because I believe we are violating Community law and taking a step backwards in terms of European integration."
"Mr President, I can understand the frustration of Mr Varela and our other Spanish colleagues about this amendment, but what this amendment seeks to do, and I do not wish to reopen the debate, is to protect a key conservation zone, one of the most significant conservation zones in European waters."
"If we are to be taken seriously as a House, if our Common Fisheries Policy is to be taken seriously, then we must insist that this policy is about preserving fish stocks, allowing fish stocks to recover."
"That is what support for Amendment 20 would mean."
"Trying to use the Rules of Procedure to stop this House having its democratic say on this amendment would be a serious error."
"I would suggest to you, Mr President, if you are inclined to rule that this amendment is inadmissible, that the whole report be referred back to committee."
"But I hope you do not rule that it is inadmissible and that we can go ahead with the vote."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, as a Portuguese Member of this Parliament, I simply wish to say the following: whatever opinion one has of Amendment No 20, it is totally wrong and dishonest to claim that it has anything to do with the Accession Treaty, which has expired."
"This was made perfectly clear in yesterday's debate in speeches by some of my Portuguese colleagues, such as Arlindo Cunha, Ilda Figueiredo and, in particular, some very lively speeches by Paulo Casaca."
"The comment that Mr Varela has just made on this point is, therefore, completely untrue."
"The ruling I wish to make on this matter is that I believe Amendment No 20 to be admissible."
"It seeks to insert text."
"It is true that the effect of the insertion would cause the deletion of other parts of the text, but it is not an amendment that simply calls for deletion."
"We have precedents for this."
"I am not making an arbitrary choice."
"I am following the Rules of Procedure and therefore rule this admissible."
"The wisdom of the House will decide the matter."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"President."
"That concludes the vote."
"The Action Plan proposed by the Commission does not take account of the impact of the decisions taken by the Fisheries Council between 16 and 20 December 2002 and does not provide a response to the problems facing the sector or to the consequences of the restructuring (scrapping) measures and recovery plans which, according to the Commission, would entail the loss of 3 000 jobs per year until the end of 2006, on top of the foreseen loss of 8 000 jobs per year resulting from the crisis in the sector and from fleet renewal."
"The Commission's proposal to fund the action plan by reprogramming Structural Funds under the FIFG and its suggestion that it might use the mid-term review of the Structural Funds to try to obtain further resources from other Structural Funds are unacceptable."
"We agree with the rapporteur on the need for additional funds to compensate for the socio-economic consequences of the reform and the recovery plans, and the Commission must make use of the flexibility instrument or undertake a review of the financial perspective."
"We agree with the rapporteur's observation that attention must be paid to small-scale coastal fishing."
"The Commission admits that 'financial aid measures in favour of small-scale fisheries have not had the desired effect of protecting the sector'."
"Hence our insistence, in the 2003 budget procedure, on creating a specific support programme."
". (EL) The report is correct in its comments on the dangers which will be faced by small-scale fishing (which accounts for 75% of Community fishing vessels) with the application of the new common fisheries policy, which will result in a loss of 28 000 jobs, economic stagnation and the abandonment of coastal areas."
"The report does not, however, dispute the policy which produces the hardships, which it confines itself to describing."
"On the contrary, it takes them as given and is merely interested in moderating the consequences, in slowing down the rate at which they emerge and in 'countering' the losses."
"The rapporteur harbours delusions about the intentions of the Commission which he calls on to ? consider its options."
"We do not harbour any such delusions."
"The applied fisheries policy and the proposed policy, as it stands or with a few amendments, prove that the EU is heading straight in the direction of handing the exploitation of fisheries resources over to big business."
"This is the direction being taken by the funding measures to scrap small and medium-sized fishing vessels in order to wipe out small and medium-sized fishermen and further reinforce the fishing capabilities of large vessels."
"No reversal in the situation can be achieved with wish lists and appeals to the Commission's better nature."
"Only fishermen themselves and their fight can reverse these policies and prevent their extermination."
"The fisheries sector appears to be sailing through calm seas at present."
"As the fishery reform negotiations draw to a close, the professionals are drawing up the balance sheet for the next 18 months."
"With regard to public aid: while the Commission was pushing for an end to public aid from December 2002, the negotiations have led to the current scheme being prolonged until December 2004."
"Although the fishermen have been warned, the difficulties have not abated."
"In Brittany, nearly 75% of the fleet needs replacing."
"The use of safe, new boats, equipped with the latest technology to make sailors' work easier, should be widespread."
"While hostilities in the public aid battle at Community level have been broken off for the moment, however, they will soon be resumed on the world stage."
"The Commission has presented a proposal to the World Trade Organisation asking for a ban on all subsidies in order to prevent overfishing, on the pretext of maintaining the sustainability of the fishing industry."
"With regard to restructuring plans, we have the example of the Scottish cod restructuring plan, whose consequences we know: the collapse of those fisheries which can no longer operate, increased pressure on other fishing grounds and stocks of other fish species, and more considerable pressure on markets."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Article 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The failure frequently ascribed to the previous common fisheries policy (CFP) should make the Union as a whole realise how crucial it is to have a carefully considered assessment, potentially forming the basis of a new approach, and for this approach to be reflected, if possible, in the new CFP."
"For this to happen, the desire to preserve fishery resources must be set against the repercussions that each CFP option has for tens of thousands of people, for their jobs and for their families."
"This report focuses precisely on this issue and the action plan to compensate for the consequences triggered by the negative effects of restructuring in the fisheries sector is the appropriate basis on which this study should be undertaken."
"With this in mind, I support the rapporteur when he:"
"considers the Commission's assessment of the socio-economic impact of the CFP reform to be extremely theoretical and does not provide sufficiently concrete answers to the problems currently facing the sector;"
"argues that the economically weakest fisheries, which might be hardest hit by the reform, warrant the European Union's solidarity and support;"
"insists on the need for a serious and in-depth debate on the fisheries model that the European Union should adopt and reiterates the importance of maintaining a positive approach."
"I have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"The vote of 9 April was nothing less than an attempted coup against Community law."
"By illegally reducing the number of sessions for 2004 from 12 to 10, a coalition of honourable Members, whose antipathy to the notion of Strasbourg as seat of the European Parliament has long been known, has seriously undermined the treaties."
"These honourable Members have also, and no less importantly, undermined this town's status as a symbol of Franco-German reconciliation."
"The time has now come to redress the harm done by what can only be called an anti-Strasbourg plot."
"To this end, my group has supported the proposal before the Conference of Presidents, calling for an extra week to be added to the draft calendar for 2004."
"This is the only course of action in keeping with the letter and spirit of the treaties."
"Furthermore, however, as we approach the crucial moment of enlargement, the European Parliament should bring to bear the full weight of its vote in order to make a political statement of its desire to remain in Strasbourg."
". (EL) I voted in favour of the Rothley report, despite the fact that the amendments proposed by the GUE/NGL, Greens and Liberals were rejected yesterday, for the reasons mentioned by President Cox."
"It is one naturally inadequate, step towards transparency and the settlement of an issue which insults the European Parliament."
"The amendment proposed by the Socialist group to delete paragraph 5 referring to the Bureau's decision on travel expenses etc. throws up questions about the real intentions of the European Parliament and confusion at the very least."
". (NL) One of the reasons why the Dutch Labour Party delegation voted against this report is the absence of a tax compromise."
"The Dutch Labour Party delegation hopes that the Council will soon be prepared to negotiate and to examine the willingness in the EP to incorporate a facility for additional national taxes and to regulate with effect from 2004."
"The Dutch Labour Party delegation hopes that a Statute for Members for which it can vote does nonetheless come about."
". (DA) I consider Parliament's adoption of the proposals in the Rothley report to be unlawful, since they would alter primary law."
"Their adoption is particularly unwise, since it rejects the national taxation of European Parliament salaries and fails to put the travel scheme in order."
"I have not been able to take part in the vote today, since I am to participate in the meeting of the European Convention in Brussels."
"Unlike the rest of my group, I have decided to abstain from voting on this report."
"The main reason for this stems from the decision to raise the honourable Members' salaries by a considerable amount."
"In the current social and political climate, not just in France but throughout Europe, this decision is unacceptable and unjustifiable."
"We are, first and foremost, representatives of the people."
"As such, our priorities are to promote the interests of our citizens and give concrete form to their expectations in Europe, especially in terms of increased democracy."
"I have decided to abstain rather than vote against the report because I believe that adopting a single statute for Members is a positive step towards a more united Europe, towards a truly shared destiny, and towards achieving equality for all."
"I would, however, have preferred to see the goal of equal pay, which this report attempts to impose from the top down, become a priority for European legislators through the adoption of a minimum European wage."
"It would thus affect our fellow citizens first and foremost."
"Taking advantage of the fact that decision-making in the Council on the 'Statute for Members of the EP' has changed from unanimity to qualified majority as a result of the Treaty of Nice, the EP is once again insisting on a proposal that contains aspects with which we disagree."
"One such aspect is that of establishing the same monthly parliamentary allowance for all Members, whichever country they represent."
"Members of the EP are elected in national constituencies. Consequently they are, and must remain bound to these constituencies."
"Establishing a single monthly rate of payment forms part of a federalist view of a Member of the European Parliament's mandate, seeking to transform today's national Members of the EP into future 'European MPs'. This is a vision that we do not share."
"Furthermore, as we have emphasised, the social realities in the countries of the EU differ greatly, making it inevitable that implementing this measure will lead to profound inequalities and differences between the salary level of workers and that of representatives and public office-holders in various countries, such as Portugal."
"This would be quite incomprehensible."
"Accordingly, the salary of a Member of the EP must be based on the salary of Members of the national parliament of the country in which they have been elected."
"Hence our vote against the report."
". (FI) Ulpu Iivari, Reino Paasilinna and Riitta Myller, members of the Finnish Social Democratic Party delegation, voted in favour of the Members' Statute, as we believe it is essential to have one, and voting against it would mean the present system would continue."
"It has been our aim all along to have a system where travel expenses are reimbursed where actual costs are incurred."
"A condition of final acceptance is, however, that the compromise allowing Finland the right to tax the pay of its Members of the European Parliament which arose during the Belgian Presidency be applied to the Statute."
"We also hope that Parliament will be prepared in negotiations with the Council to abandon any designs it might have concerning parliamentary immunity that it is impossible for the Council to accept."
". (NL) The reimbursement of Members' travel expenses must be based on the expenses actually incurred and all Members must receive the same salary."
"Many of the things that Parliament is adopting with the Rothley report on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, such as the late entry into force in 2009 and the subordination of future fellow Members from the accession countries, I do not like."
"I would also have liked to see the majority of this House show a greater readiness to compromise."
"It will now be very difficult to bring the governments and MEPs into line with one another."
"We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, however, are prepared to make compromises, because in the end statutory provision has to be made for these things."
"Moreover, it is the last chance before enlargement to regulate the Statute for Members and with it a better travel expenses scheme."
"All things considered I have therefore voted for the Rothley report because keeping things as they are is not acceptable."
"No, this statute is not perfect."
"Yes, this text is only a compromise."
"No, this project does not provide a complete response to the lengthy battle fought over the best part of the last five years by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party; but yes, I voted in favour: in favour of reform, in favour of the future, and in favour of setting the truly European aspects of this House in stone."
"For that is what is at stake: finding an end to the odyssey on which we embarked in 1979, in search of a common statute, a statute to do away with inequality and injustice."
"How on earth can we continue to justify the fact that German and Italian Members earn four times the wages of their Portuguese and Spanish colleagues?"
"That is why I congratulate myself on the agreement reached on Articles 16 and 18."
"The former establishes the principle of equal pay for all, and the latter confirms Community tax as the benchmark."
"For all that, I regret the fact that this House did not, yesterday, state the rights and responsibilities of its honourable Members loud and clear."
"Neither did it adopt a totally transparent system for the refund of expenses, particularly travel expenses."
"The repeal of the effective compromise negotiated during the Belgian Presidency in October 2001 is also a bad sign."
"That compromise gave Member States the right to impose an additional national tax, should they desire to do so."
"These are all highly controversial questions, which threaten to delay the adoption of the Statute for Members until the twelfth of never."
". (SV) I have today voted against the European Parliament's report on a new Statute for Members now that the Commission has issued its opinion following yesterday's vote in plenary."
"The proposal was nonetheless approved by 323 votes, with 167 against and 39 abstentions."
"The new Statute would not lead to increased openness unless, instead of the current system involving flat-rate payments, there were a system for the reimbursement of travel costs whereby it was the actual costs that were reimbursed."
"Certainly, Parliament's Praesidium decided on 29 May 2003 to investigate how a new system for the reimbursement of travel costs could be designed, but that does not solve the problem."
"A decision to refund actual costs should enter into force automatically at the same time as a new Statute for Members is brought into operation."
"A new Statute for Members must aim at fairness, transparency and efficiency."
"In the future too, I should ideally like to see the salary level of Members of the European Parliament set in relation to the levels applicable in the national parliaments."
"Because MEPs live in, and represent, their Member States, tax should, in the future too, be deducted on a national basis so that account might be taken of different countries' costs of living and social insurance systems."
". (SV) I have not taken part in the vote because I find it absurd that we ourselves must decide on our salaries and other financial conditions."
". (NL) For a century, the generation and distribution of electricity was largely kept out of the hands of commerce."
"It is not a product that you are free to choose whether or not to buy."
"Every household needs electricity and no one can run the risk of its non-availability."
"Distribution takes place along lines under the public highway."
"The public services too, such as hospitals, schools and trams, use a lot of electricity."
"You cannot leave all this to a company whose primary interest is to make a profit; it is best left to local or regional government monopolies, on condition that they are subject to democratic control by a chosen parliamentary body that watches over environmental and consumer interests."
"In the Netherlands we now have wide experience of the transfer of the electricity supply to the private sector."
"Environmentally friendly investments for the small-scale generation of electricity have been neglected or ruled out in favour of the importation of nuclear power."
"Now all that counts is which electricity can be produced or purchased cheapest."
"Payment for green power, which consumers are allowed to buy from a different producer from their traditional regional supplier, usually leads to chaos."
"I support Mr Turmes, our rapporteur, in his attempt to counteract false information about green power or misuse of money for termination of nuclear energy, but that is insufficient."
"Once again, the majority of EP Members are choosing to call for the total liberalisation of the natural gas sector and also accepting the positions put forward by the UNICE in relation to this aim of the so-called 'Lisbon Strategy'."
"One example is the EP's proposal for the role of national regulatory authorities (NRAs) and of a 'European' regulatory authority, which shall have the task of completing the internal market and of ensuring effective competition. This proves that the intention is to transfer to supposedly 'independent' authorities an entire set of competences that should fall to national democratically elected institutions."
"In other words, the EP feels that not even national States would have a regulatory role, with this being given to these so-called regulatory authorities and the European Commission."
"This intention is so outrageous that it has met with the Council's resistance."
"In general terms, this is an attempt to impose competition rules on all sectors that involve public service, providing incentives for privatisation, calling into question the guarantee of security of supply, investment capacity, equal access to the best prices and to a high-quality service and will lead to the deterioration of employees' rights in the sectors in question."
"Hence our group's motion to reject the common position. It is significant that our motion was rejected by the majority of EP Members, including those from the PS, the PSD and the CDS-PP."
"Liberalising the electricity sector is another of the aims set out under what is known as the Lisbon Strategy."
"As for the gas sector, the EP has acted as the spokesperson for the interests of the European employers' confederation, UNICE."
"Energy is a strategic sector that is crucial to the sovereignty of any state."
"Guarantees of its integrity will be called into question as a result of the current liberalisation."
"In a few years, the EU's electricity sector - as the rapporteur states - will be dominated by between five and eight companies, obviously from the countries with the most highly developed economies."
"This is an attempt to impose rules of competition and to encourage privatisations, calling into question the security of supply, investment capacity, equal access to the best prices and to a high-quality service and will lead to the deterioration of employees' rights in the sectors in question."
"This is why our parliamentary group tabled a motion rejecting the common position and various proposals for amendments seeking to mitigate the negative aspects of the recommendation, not least with regard to ensuring respect for public service obligations, for the environment, for the specific characteristics of the outermost regions, and for protection for domestic consumers and small consumers."
"Significantly, the majority of EP Members, including those from the PES, the PSD and the CDS-PP, has rejected the motion to reject the common position."
". (PT) Some amendments that have been tabled suggest that the increase in installed nuclear energy capacity in Europe is crucial to compliance with the Kyoto Protocol."
"This argument is irrational and lacks objectivity."
"All the information available suggests that the opposite is true."
"The European Union already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 4% between 1990 and 1999, and will be able to fulfil the remaining reduction quota by 2012 (4%) through low-cost measures."
"According to data provided by the European Commission, it is possible to comply with the Kyoto Protocol by implementing measures costing less than EUR 20 per tonne of CO2."
"The measures proposed by the European Commission (the European Programme for Climate Change and the Framework Directive on Emissions Trading) contain no reference to promoting nuclear energy."
"Unlike my political group, I have voted in favour of the amendments to block 3."
"I thought it was vital to support Amendment No 1, as it introduces a reference to the precautionary principle."
"Even though I understand the rapporteur's desire to bring this legislative procedure to a close after the second reading (and I would like to draw attention to his hard work and great receptiveness of mind), I am unable to vote against the reference to the precautionary principle."
"I believe this principle to be essential and necessary for a debate as sensitive, and as far from a resolution, as the one on genetically modified organisms."
"The Council has refused to incorporate this reference to the precautionary principle fully into its Common Position, mentioning it in the preamble."
"That is the Council's decision and I respect it."
"I do feel, however, that the European Parliament should not assume the Council's old stance against the reference to the precautionary principle."
"The principle is, in any case, covered by Community legislation."
"To reject it accords GMO a privileged status."
"It sets a precedent which other occupational sectors might exploit in order to challenge future political proposals and guidelines."
"It is a retreat via the negation of a principle, but it masquerades as progress all the same."
"We are aware that this regulation, in conjunction with others, such as the regulation on traceability and labelling, constitute steps towards lifting the moratorium on GMOs."
"The pressure exerted by the US, which has now lodged a complaint against the European Union at the WTO, and by the huge biotechnology multinationals seeking to remove the moratorium and to achieve free trade in GMOs, is becoming increasingly clear."
"The proposals contained in this report, however, as at first reading, make significant improvements to the text."
"An agreement in this field could be important to speeding up the process of ratifying the Cartagena Protocol on biological safety and biodiversity."
"Furthermore, the proposals suggest that GMO imports cannot take place without the prior written consent of the importing country and that the signing of agreements and conventions cannot lead to a level of protection lower than that provided by the current regulation and by the protocol."
"These proposals also require the exporter to comply with national regulatory frameworks and to guarantee the public right to information. These proposals consequently warrant our support."
"As the report suggests, the precautionary principle must be observed, rejecting the subordination of this principle to commercial considerations, given the potential impact of GMOs."
"Because there is no strong and integrated legislation on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that is able to provide guarantees for consumers and industry, the process of granting marketing authorisations at EU level has been suspended for the last three years."
"I welcome the legislation on the traceability and labelling of GMOs, because it makes it possible to register and monitor GMO movements on the market and the movements of food for human and animal consumption produced from them."
"This will help consumers to make their choices and will facilitate the process of withdrawing a product, should this be deemed necessary."
"As everyone knows, the overall aim of the Cartagena Protocol on Biological Safety adopted on 29 January 2000, consists of contributing to ensuring an adequate level of protection in the field of the safe transfer, handling and use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) produced by modern biotechnology, that may have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health, including cross-border movements in particular."
"In line with the position of the Portuguese Government, however, I believe it is important that we now undertake this exercise at European level, in order to ensure the most important factor in this matter, which is a high degree of consumer protection."
"I therefore welcomed the adoption of the Council's common position - and the approximation of positions that avoided the need for us to continue with a conciliation procedure - and, as such, the forthcoming entry into force of a regulation that is clear, technically secure and able to put the EU in a different position to the one that culminated, as a result of the diffuse nature of regulations, in the anti-GMO moratorium that led the USA to lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organisation."
"I voted in favour because, following the shipwreck of the Prestige off the coast of Spain and the huge ecological disaster, immediate protection is required from single hull tankers by imposing an immediate timetable for withdrawing them from circulation."
"The governments of the 15 should support these measures and ignore the pressure from any shipowners who are opposed out of self-interest to a necessary regulation to protect seas and shores."
"We voted squarely in favour of the Piecyk report."
"We also supported the Commission's new proposal to speed up the introduction of double hull oil tankers and withdraw single hull tankers, as well as toughening safety restrictions."
"This report should have been adopted a long time ago, as Philippe de Villiers indeed requested."
"After the wreck of the Erika in 1999, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) drove the Commission to cut corners, however."
"The Council and Parliament were weak enough to follow suit."
"It took another wreck, the Prestige, to wake everyone up."
"Today's text is sounder."
"Its scope should nevertheless be broadened."
"It should apply not only to ships sailing under the flag of a Member State or putting in at one of our ports, but also to any oil tanker sailing in our economic area."
"It will also be necessary to monitor the performance of double hulls closely over time."
"Moreover, as I said last part-session during the debate on environmental liability, we must remedy the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund's inability to provide adequate compensation."
"It is also urgent that we put in place a compulsory insurance scheme operating on the polluter pays principle."
"The safety of ships, crews and the environment cannot be effectively addressed with fragmentary measures, however important they are, such as the mandatory precondition of double hulls for tankers using ports in the Member States."
"A real safety policy needs to combat the unaccountability of shipowners, apply substantive measures against infringements of the law, adjust operating positions to today's enhanced requirements and help improve crews' living and working conditions by safeguarding their rights and giving their trades union the power to intervene decisively."
"Any arrangements must be introduced within the framework of the IMO and the ILO, which should play an essential role in international shipping, without accepting the philosophy of compromise with shipping interests."
"A typical example of how such interests are served at the expense of the environment are the long transitional periods, without any real justification in terms of security of supply, and the exemption from the double hull requirement for ships over 500 - 600 tonnes."
"The ?U is serving the unaccountability of shipowners in the best possible way."
"One example is that the ship repair industry in Greece, a country with one of the biggest fleets in the world, has almost been wiped out."
"Positive results against this policy will only be obtained by decisive fighting on the part of workers, seamen and interested regions, especially coastal regions."
". (PT) There is no shortage of substantial reasons and even imperatives for us to adopt increasingly stringent measures in the field of maritime navigation safety."
"The occurrence, in a very short space of time, of two major disasters, the Erika and the Prestige and having to deal with the variety and gravity of their consequences showed us all how crucial it is for decisions to be taken in this field."
"We have all become aware of the intolerable conditions under which many vessels still sail with dangerous and highly polluting loads."
"For this reason, this new proposal is particularly appropriate given the much-vaunted requirement for double hulls."
"Furthermore, and as the European Commission study was charged with demonstrating, rapidly eliminating single hull tankers, as is proposed, will not lead to a substantial reduction in capacity for oil and, as the rapporteur states, the capacity and international recognition of European shipyards could even benefit by having new vessels to build."
"I also agree with the rapporteur's assertion that we must extend the implementation of the proposals now proposed by the European Commission to the International Maritime Organisation, firmly promoting the necessary negotiations in this field."
"I have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"About time!"
"We have known since December 1999, since the Erika disaster and its tragic economic, social and environmental consequences, that withdrawing single hull oil tankers was an inescapable and urgent priority."
"Shortly before the Erika disaster, I requested the introduction of a timetable for scrapping all single hull oil tankers by 2010."
"At the time, I was told that was impossible."
"All of a sudden, though, it has become possible, in the wake of the Prestige disaster?"
"If it is to be effective, however, this measure should not be confined to the European Union."
"Rather, the International Maritime Organisation should intervene to make it international law."
"The Member States most threatened by oil spills, especially France, should make every effort to achieve this from now on."
"They should not hesitate to exert unilateral pressure either, as France and Spain did so judiciously at Malaga."
"I share the rapporteur's concern to improve the fleet of ships carrying dangerous cargoes."
"According to the Commission's own figures, more than 4 000 ships are classed as hazardous."
"We must oblige shipowners to withdraw these floating dustbins as a matter of urgency, and compel them to adhere to stricter technical and social codes of practice."
"Nevertheless, in the light of the recent Erika and Prestige disasters, I think that the European Union is still shrinking back too much from the unavoidable battle for maritime safety."
"The proposed waiting times are still unsatisfactory: the seaworthy age limit for Prestige-type (category one) oil tankers has been fixed at 23 years from 2005; for category two and three ships (mostly built between 1982 and 1986), the age limit is 28 years from 2010."
"Even with these provisions, the risk of disaster is still with us."
"It would have been better if all dangerous ships had been prevented from putting to sea, and shipyard production shifted by public policy towards the construction and development of safe, modern ships."
"The European Union should have been given new tools in its struggle against the laxity of the system."
"Above all, the Member States should make genuine commitments to implementing existing legislation."
"This is the minimum required to stop all the restrictions from sounding like a wish list."
"The protection of juveniles is a priority for guaranteeing the conservation of fish stocks and their long-term sustainability."
"Improving technical catch measures must therefore be seen as an essential component of the common fisheries policy and must be considered in conjunction with the other instruments for the fisheries sector."
"We therefore agree with the rapporteur's proposals, specifically when he states that, since it is fishermen who are the interested parties in these measures, and since no one knows these matters better than they do, they should be fully involved in the process of defining these measures."
"In fact, we have always called for social dialogue with the sector to be improved, as demonstrated by our proposals in the opinion that we delivered under the 2003 budget procedure."
"We still believe, however, that Regional Advisory Councils might not be the most appropriate instruments for guaranteeing this participation."
"What is really needed is for the common fisheries policy to be properly decentralised."
"We agree with the rapporteur's assertion that technical mistakes in the drafting of this Commission proposal, particularly in a regulation for legislative consolidation involving extremely technical and sensitive matters, call into question the Commission's technical competence in these matters and heighten the lack of confidence fishermen have in the Commission."
"This proposal by the European Commission, consolidating existing regulations and to some extent introducing new measures, specifically with regard to cod and whiting, is important."
"I think that we were on the right track when, in the technical regulation in force, Member States were authorised to adopt measures in certain emergency situations and in relation to their own vessels, with the proviso that they could not be less stringent than the requirements laid down in Community law."
"Like the rapporteur, I regret the fact that this proposal does not retain these provisions. Like the rapporteur, I also hope that this omission will be rapidly rectified by the Commission, as well as the omission of any reference to the Regional Advisory Councils (RACs)."
"The Commission must understand that a sustainable and viable fisheries sector is only possible if it has the trust and cooperation of the fishermen and pays attention to the points of view of the parties concerned."
"In fact, this omission would run counter to what Commissioner Fischler promised fishermen in a speech in London, when he urged them to 'come and participate and make sure that they become full players in the fisheries management process'."
"The report would have been better if more of the amendments tabled in plenary had been adopted, but, for the reasons I have briefly summarised, I too ultimately voted in favour of it."
"Mr President, on the issue of fishing, there is a constant tendency in this Parliament to confuse privileges with conservation."
"I agree that there must be areas in which special conservation measures must be taken, and even that there must be no fishing in them for many years."
"But this conservation has nothing to do with the fact that in certain areas there are States who enjoy the privilege of fishing and others for whom it is banned."
"In this regard, the case of the Irish Box for example, or other areas in European Community waters, that is, continental waters, is not the same as the case of the Azores."
"In the Azores, the problem is that they do not have a continental shelf, and those islands must be granted a privilege so that they can survive by means of fishing."
"In the Irish Box or other areas, we are talking about a privilege granted to several States in violation of Community law."
"In this regard, this confusion has been exploited to achieve a vote whose result I believe to be profoundly wrong."
"A clear sign needed to be sent to the Council Presidency, because the proposal for a compromise, supported by the Commission and promoted by Spain, intended to create a single Atlantic zone to manage the fishing effort without dividing up the current conservation areas, not only fails to contribute to a sustainable policy in the field of fisheries, but would also have harmful effects, not least for Portugal, in terms of the conservation measures already in place and in socio-economic terms, both for the fleet and for regions that are dependent on the sector."
"We therefore helped to ensure that Amendment No 20 to this report was adopted, and we are fully behind it, since it proposes to continue with the current regulations for a period of ten years, after which, the arrangements will be assessed once again."
"I wish to state, despite the fact that all of the other proposals for amendments to the regulation have been rejected, that the Committee on Fisheries adopted our proposal to extend the limit of access to the exclusive economic area of the Azores and Madeira to 200 miles."
"The Council must also take account of this proposal in its negotiations for a compromise."
"The approval by a very large majority of Amendment No 20 was crucial, since it sends a powerful message from the European Parliament about respect for previously established basic principles and valid agreements. It is also crucial because it vigorously rejects murky political manoeuvres, disguised as clever legal tricks and clearly based on a false assumption, in order to serve the interests of one Member State - Spain."
"This would clearly damage the conservation of fisheries resources in particularly sensitive areas of the European coast. Incidentally, it would be completely unacceptable if, through a revision of the Regulation, the great efforts to preserve resources made in these sensitive areas by some Member States, Portugal and Ireland, to be specific, were ignored."
"It is, therefore, hard to understand the restrictions that have for a long time been imposed on the fishermen of these countries, paradoxically paving the way to the further depletion of fisheries resources."
"I also strongly support Amendments Nos 8 and 13, which gave appropriate treatment to specific problems facing the sea around the Azores, which are of interest to Europe in general and to the Azores in particular."
"In the end, however, it was not necessary to vote for them."
"I hope that the Commission and the Council heed - and respect in substance - the extremely clear sign given by Parliament and respect the voice of those who are elected by Europe's citizens."
". (NL) Following the accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Union, a period of seven years was laid down in 1995 in which the fleets of these countries were denied access to, for example, the North Sea and the Irish Box."
"Last December this restrictive measure lapsed."
"In this report the Commission is coming forward with a new regulation to regulate the access of, for example, Spanish fishing vessels to the Irish Box."
"The attempt by the Commission to eliminate discrimination between the Member States in fleet access is laudable, but it is the fish stocks that lose out."
"On the accession of Spain and Portugal it was impossible to foresee what disastrous changes would overtake fish stocks."
"Since 1996 the opportunities to catch fish in the area in question have fallen sharply."
"The Commission is itself - please note - of the opinion that the maximum level of fishing in these areas requires urgent revision or reduction."
"None of this is consistent."
"Equal opportunities for all Member States is a fine starting point, but better still is a full sea in which there is enough to fish."
"That must be our first priority."
"A revision of the allocation formula can therefore only be considered when fish stocks have been restored to sufficient levels of abundance."
"It is not acceptable either legally, morally or politically that an amendment in the European Parliament or a report during a consultation procedure can extend the provisions of a Treaty on accession to the EU such as the one relating to Spain and Portugal, as is the case with Amendment No 20 from the UEN Group or Amendments Nos 21 to 30."
"Furthermore, I believe that Amendment No 20 is inadmissible within the meaning of Rule 140(1)a) and b) of the EP's Rules of Procedure."
"It is unjust, discriminatory and I believe illegal."
"I have therefore had to vote against the report bearing the name of the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Stevenson, but in reality produced by Mr Ó Neachtain."
"If the Council does not remedy it, it will be the Court of Justice of the European Communities that has to declare the report approved today contrary to Community law, and it will thereby be making the final decision, in the event that the opinion issued today by the EP is followed."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The session was suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Mr President, as far as Turkey as a candidate Member State is concerned, the door is open, but the road is hard."
"That is the message of my report."
"For the other candidate Member States that was really self-evident."
"They and their citizens have had a lot of trouble in reaching the finishing line and up to the last committee meetings comments were still being made about them in clear tones urging completion of the work."
"Turkey is no exception."
"There is no reason therefore to give this country special treatment on account of its size or its strategic position."
"Turkey does of course have quite different problems from the other candidates."
"These problems are mainly in the area of the Copenhagen political criteria."
"More than ever perhaps the emphasis in this report is placed on the background to or deeper causes of the political shortcomings which usually manifest themselves in violations of classical freedom rights and of fundamental human rights."
"It is also to do with the fact that the Turkish State is based on a philosophy that was developed in the 1920s, a period in which Europe did not provide many pleasant examples from which to draw your ideas."
"The criticism of Turkey concerns the structures of the State, the dominant political position of the army, the National Security Council, which is dominated by the military, the nationalism that leads to suppression of ethnic, religious and cultural minorities and the priority for collective security and collective interests over individual human rights, which again and again gives cause for complaint."
"The army also has a very strong influence in education, broadcasting and the business community and it is very important that this is also recognised in part in Turkey's latest reform packages."
"In the contact with Turkey it is always a question of who are we talking to? Are we talking to the government and the majority in the parliament or are we in fact talking to the representatives of what people call the 'deep State', the high generals and the high established bureaucracy?"
"Apart from these problems we also mention those on the borders, with both Cyprus and Armenia and possibly with Iraq."
"The lack of a functioning social midfield is also apparent."
"There is little room for the trade union movement."
"Religious communities, even the Islamic, are under strict state control or are having a hard time."
"Other candidates had leeway to make up here too."
"The idea of candidate membership is that the country concerned develops into a Member State like the others."
"It must not for example make any difference in legal position whether you live in Diyarbakir or in Rotterdam."
"If that is the case, then it is impossible to sell membership to our citizens."
"A directly elected parliament may see this more readily and with greater concern than a council of ministers."
"We therefore invite the Council to be just as clear in its policy towards Turkey as this Parliament and not to cling to symbols and symbolic dates."
"Clarity has been the express concern of this report."
"It is not honest out of a need for appreciation to remain silent about a series of objections only to conjure them up again at a later date."
"Turkey has to know where it stands now."
"That means radical changes, as other candidates have also experienced."
"Which is why we warmly applaud the plan to draw up a new Constitution, while expressing the wish that the political values that are supported in other Member States will be taken as a starting point."
"Furthermore, the army must relinquish its present dominant position and be brought back to a form and function that is usual in other Member States."
"This has consequences for the National Security Council and for the state security courts."
"Amendments to the law that have in mind the conversion from a military nation, as people write to me, into a civil nation, must prove that their objectives are being achieved in practice."
"This is a question of mentality and culture."
"The Union must therefore focus its support on actual fulfilment of the political criteria, that is, on retraining and exchange programmes for government officials, especially those in the police, and of lawyers who are involved in courts of justice, and so on. Torture, for example, must now really be over and the return of the expelled and refugees to their villages must not be obstructed by the so-called village guards."
"Freedom of religion must not be a dead letter."
"Numerous frustrating government measures can in fact be abolished in a short time and it is a constant source of amazement that this does not happen."
"Cultural rights must not be recognised in dribs and drabs, but convincingly and generously."
"For a while it seemed that the government would indeed be able to establish its authority and we had also hoped that it would, for example, be able to make good its intention to resolve the Cyprus issue on the basis of the UN plan."
"That unfortunately proved not to be the case."
"A renewed successful attempt will show whether the army is indeed finding its normal role."
"Mr President, I am pleased with the broad support for the report that exists in this Parliament."
"I have also cast a generous eye over the amendments and where possible given them a plus."
"We have agreed with Mr Swoboda that we can accept an amendment from the radical and green corner, concerning the willingness of Turkey to fulfil its tasks under the reforms, as an addition, not as a replacement."
"If it is not wanted as an addition, we shall vote against."
"But if it is presented as an addition, then we can say, 'yes' to it."
"I otherwise hope that the open talk of the debate about religion, culture and politics is not smothered by deletions in paragraph 3, as that is a paragraph that could simply bring this discussion to a tremendously good end."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to take the opportunity of the adoption of the O?stlander report today in order to refer to relations between the European Union and Turkey and developments in the accession strategy for Turkey."
"As you know, Turkey is an important partner of the Union, with which we have maintained contractual relations for a very long time."
"You can go back as far as 1963."
"However, the turning point in this 30-year period was the European Council in Helsinki, when Turkey was acknowledged as a candidate country for accession to the Union on the basis of the same criteria that apply to the other candidate countries."
"In Helsinki, the aim of the accession strategy adopted was to help Turkey on its course towards integration and included reinforced political dialogue, pre-accession aid and a procedure for analytical examination of the application of the acquis."
"The cornerstone of this pre-accession strategy was the partnership of March 2001, with principles, priorities and interim objectives which would allow Turkey to meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"Within this framework, it is necessary to emphasise that important elements are not only the adaptation of legislation in relation to the Copenhagen criteria, but also its material application."
"And the Commission has clearly underlined this point, mainly in the annual progress reports."
"We have recently monitored certain important internal developments in Turkey."
"A new government has taken over power, with strong support from the people."
"The new prime minister, Mr Erdogan, has clearly stated that he intends to continue and strengthen the reform process, so that Turkey meets the Copenhagen criteria."
"Recent surveys have also shown that this objective is shared by an important majority of public opinion in Turkey."
"And I think that this political will is, you might say, reflected in actions and not just words."
"At the Copenhagen Council, the Union itself recognised that the new Turkish Government was resolved to proceed with further reform and it urged it in particular to deal quickly with all the weaknesses which continue to exist in the field of political criteria, in relation both to legislation and to the application of legislation."
"Within this framework, the Union encouraged Turkey to actively continue the reform process."
"If the European Council in December 2004, based on the Commission's report and recommendation, decides that Turkey meets the political criteria of Copenhagen, the Union will renew accession negotiations with Turkey without delay."
"That was, as you all know, a very weighty decision for the future of relations between the European Union and Turkey."
"We hope that this prospect will act as a catalyst and encourage Turkey to adopt and apply the necessary reforms."
"However, I should like at this point for us to see what the situation looks likes six months after Copenhagen."
"Ladies and gentlemen, during the Greek Presidency, we have worked systematically to implement the elements of the accession strategy in accordance with the decisions taken in Copenhagen."
"The revised partnership adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council in April 2003 is of particular importance in helping Turkey to deal with the main issues in its attempt to meet the political criteria."
"A revised national programme for the adoption of the acquis, with clearly defined targets, is expected to constitute Turkey's planned response to the new partnership."
"Similarly, we have held three political dialogue meetings, one of which at ministerial level, when we had an opportunity to see exactly what is expected of Turkey up to the end of 2004."
"The Presidency and the Commission have planned another two meetings in the more specific aim of examining progress in meeting the political criteria."
"The Association Council was convened in April at ministerial level and evaluated the progress both of the pre-accession strategy and the status of the partnership."
"At this point, I should like, guided by the recently adopted revised partnership, to refer with greater clarity to the main issues that we expect Turkey to deal with up to its evaluation in 2004."
"Of course, this is not intended either to discount the Commission evaluation within the framework of this year's, and more importantly, next year's progress report, nor does it have to do with any other criteria over and above the Copenhagen criteria."
"The partnership was the product of valuable experience from two years of helping Turkey to adopt political reforms."
"This means that efficient account was taken of lessons from recent years, following discussion, both by the Commission and by the Council, which adopted it with slight changes."
"What I want to say is that, as we see it, there are two basic issues for promoting Turkey's essential candidature status."
"First, democracy has to operate in this country without the obstacles of the past and, secondly, the institutional changes voted through by parliament need to be translated into real administrative and judicial practice."
"Political control by the parliament and via a democratically controlled government of all the institutions and bodies of state is, therefore, a basic issue which Turkey will need to address effectively."
"This also involves the simple legal adaptation of the rules and raises telling and very material issues in connection with relations between the elected government and the army."
"The Union has also publicly referred to this issue and emphasised that there cannot be practices that result in deviations from the Copenhagen criteria and we have noticed that there have recently also been corresponding examples with reference to internal and/or external policy."
"On the question of human rights and the rule of law, there has undoubtedly been progress, even in sectors which a short time ago were considered prohibited."
"We must not forget that the abolition of the death penalty and the introduction of the right to use and teach minority languages are a big step forward."
"And Turkey itself appears to wish to proceed at a fast pace and to achieve the start of accession negotiations by set deadlines."
"It is important that we know this ambition, for the realisation of which quite a lot still needs to be done."
"At the Association Council last April, the Union clarified the fact that basic outstanding issues in the field of political criteria require Turkey's immediate attention."
"These issues mainly include, by way of example, numerous accusations of torture chambers in the country, references to arbitrary arrests and practices of detaining people without judicial proceedings in south-eastern Turkey, contradictory judgments in relation to the punishment of those guilty of torture, court cases which demonstrate that there is still no uniform interpretation and application of provisions relating to the freedom of expression, and the regime concerning religious foundations and communities, which remains particularly restrictive."
"We have already expressed our concern about the way in which religious foundations are treated and we continue to hope that the Turkish side will keep its promises, so that, with the necessary additional reforms, the problems that have arisen can be dealt with in accordance with international norms."
"Nor has the right been safeguarded for all Turkish citizens, irrespective of their ethnic origin, to enjoy full cultural rights."
"The restrictive nature of the recent regulations in the field of radio and television broadcasting and teaching in languages other than Turkish appears to be hampering the application of the August 2002 reforms."
"There are also additional elements in relation to the human rights situation."
"These are the recent attack by the security forces on the Turkish Human Rights Association, continuing deaths from hunger strikes in high security gaols and the uncertain outcome of the case pending against Leila Zana, which we have also discussed here in Parliament."
"All these issues are elements in an imperfect reform process in which reforms formally adopted have not always resulted in practice in the improvement to the situation which had been hoped for."
"I could also refer to the report by Amnesty International on Turkey, which paints a picture of a human rights situation with numerous problems, but there is no reason now to go into that in detail."
"In addition, however, I wish to mention that there are important priorities which are reflected in the text of the revised partnership and which we expect Turkey to take into serious account."
"They cover important sectors of the economic criteria and I think that they also correspond to the stated intention of the Turkish Government to improve the economic situation in the country."
"They also cover the important chapter of justice and internal affairs, in which we are looking forward to improved cooperation from the Turkish side and are promoting the conclusion of a Community readmission agreement."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out that there are another two basic priorities which also have an important position in the partnership."
"They relate to Cyprus and Greek-Turkish relations."
"Despite the fact that efforts by the United Nations Secretary-General to resolve the Cyprus problem ended in an impasse in the Hague, his plan is still on the table."
"The Secretary-General has pointed out that, if a solution is to be found, there must be genuine political commitment to his proposals and a clear timetable for completing negotiations."
"The spring Council expressed its regret that efforts by the Secretary-General had failed."
"The Union vigorously supports the continuation of the good offices of the Secretary-General and of the negotiations on the basis of his proposals."
"We have called on all the interested parties to spare no effort in finding a fair, operational and viable solution and, more specifically, we have called on the Turkish Cypriot leadership to re-examine its position."
"Within this framework, the priority of the Turkish partnership to support efforts to find an overall solution to the Cyprus question through the good offices of the Secretary-General and negotiations based on his proposals continues to be of decisive importance."
"The President of the European Council also referred to this matter in recent public statements."
"The government of the Republic of Cyprus has demonstrated in practice its will to facilitate such a solution."
"The protocol on Cyprus attached to the Association Agreement also allows a margin for this development."
"But our common will is to achieve something along these lines by 1 May 2004."
"The recent opening of the green line constitutes material proof that the two communities on the island can and will live and progress together."
"However, practical changes imposed from below, by society, are no substitute for institutional solutions."
"These must come about and only thus will Cyprus safeguard the new horizon to which it is entitled after so many years."
"The Union and we, as the Presidency and as a Member State, support the need to find a solution on the basis of the Annan plan."
"As far, then, as the question of a peaceful solution to the differences is concerned, a change in the atmosphere of Greek-Turkish relations has already been noted in various sectors."
"Exploratory contacts between the two ministries of foreign affairs started in March 2002."
"Discussions are continuing between senior officials."
"The improved climate has resulted in increased bilateral exchanges and a series of agreements."
"However, on the other side, the Turkish side, certain practices are being observed, such as by the Turkish air force, which are out of keeping with the aim of deeper relations between Turkey and the Union."
"We are looking forward to further progress in this sector on the basis of the principle of a peaceful solution to the differences in accordance with the Helsinki conclusions and the relative priority of the partnership."
"As decided in Helsinki, the Council will examine the situation in relation to the outstanding differences and, more importantly, their repercussions on the integration process, with a view to promoting their settlement through the International Court in the Hague by the end of 2004 at the latest."
"In closing, allow me to welcome once again Parliament's acute interest in the integration strategy for Turkey."
"We shall continue to cooperate with a view to repeating here the clear success which accompanied the political message of enlargement: extension of the area of peace, stability and prosperity and the abolition of the dividing lines of the past."
"We especially welcome the fact that the policy for the enlargement of the Union is continuing and is a basic incentive for countries, especially candidate countries such as Turkey, prompting them to further reforms in order to safeguard the values and principles I referred to earlier."
"We also welcome the fact that this objective is also the stated wish of the Turkish people and the policy of its elected government."
"We are looking forward to the necessary progress being achieved by the deadlines set, so that we can safeguard a positive and auspicious future for relations between the Union and Turkey."
"Mr President, Turkey has won the Eurovision Song Contest, but has not yet scored enough points for the integration festival."
"Our Turkish friends have undeniably made progress on very many fronts in recent years."
"If the country meets the Copenhagen criteria, the European Union will have to keep to the promises it has made."
"I am pleased that, in his well thought-out and sympathetic report, the Christian Democrat Mr Oostlander recognises that the universal values of democracy, constitutional state and human rights can very well be accepted and defended in a country with a clear Muslim majority."
"It is crucially important for us that Turkey develops quickly into a fully-fledged democracy, in which the armed forces are subordinate to elected politicians."
"It is for this reason that the Turkish National Security Council with its present powers and in its present form must be dissolved."
"Many quarters point to the important role of the military in guarding the secular State."
"It is said to act as a bulwark against rising Muslim fundamentalism."
"I should like to point out however that it is not only the task of the military to keep Muslim radicalism at bay, but of all responsible leaders."
"As far as necessary the structure of the State must be adapted to anchor all the democratic requirements."
"We therefore support the reforms of the political and legal system the Erdogan government has in mind."
"We are naturally very curious about the precise details of the new Constitution."
"This is not a matter of more or less Kemalism, but simply of the compatibility with universal standards and the demands of EU membership."
"We are glad that the Erdogan government has now tabled legislative proposals to strengthen freedom of speech and to permit the use of Kurdish in audiovisual resources and election campaigns."
"Nonetheless I would, with Mr Oostlander, point to the fact that a successful legislative process is not sufficient in itself."
"It comes down above all to its application in practice."
"While the police remain free to torture prisoners and human rights continue to be violated, there is no way, as far as I am concerned, that the negotiations can begin."
"A drastic softening of Turkey's attitude to the Cyprus problem is also needed."
"The failure of the Hague conference was attributable in no small part to the rigidity of the Turkish position."
"Ankara should allow itself to be led more by the positive attitude of the Turks who live in Cyprus than by the negative pronouncements of their leader there."
"Finally, Turkey will have to develop a policy of good neighbourliness with Armenia, which can then in due course lead to a political gesture of which the Armenians have such incredibly great need."
"In December 2004 we are going to take stock, but there cannot yet be any question of accession in the near future."
"There is still a very long way to go before the whole of Europe, away from the song festival, votes for Turkey."
"Mr President, the most important work on Mr Oostlander's report has already been done."
"It was in fact done in committee."
"Here what was - I have to say - an unbalanced report, whose tone was not always exactly upbeat, was transformed by radical amendments into one that is critical yet balanced, one in which a clear distinction is made between on the one hand what has been achieved and on the other the undoubtedly long, but concrete list of points that have still to happen."
"Just three brief remarks about the text."
"Mrs Uca, I am afraid that - if you listen - you have still not understood the precise implications of paragraph 3."
"In it the rapporteur in my view rightly makes a distinction between the Judaeo-Christian and humanist roots on the one hand, the universal values to which they have led on the other hand, and the fact that this is no barrier to the accession of an Islamic majority country - a formulation that I can share with all my heart."
"My second remark is directed towards the Members from the GUE/NGL Group, whom I urge to stop doing the dirty work of the Armenia lobby."
"In my eyes there is a carefully considered compromise on this question in the text and I honestly find the constant attempts to tighten the thumbscrews on this point increasingly irritating."
"Finally, a third remark in response to the rapporteur's proposal."
"On behalf of my group I can agree to the addition to the text of Amendment No 11 instead of an improvement of the text."
"Fellow Members, it is crucial in the debate to keep an eye on the background against which we are doing this now, the background against which this debate about the EU-Turkey relationship is taking place."
"It is in fact one of a constant struggle between, on the one hand, the reformers - strong in the government and in Parliament - and on the other, the conservatives - strong in the army, the police and the judiciary."
"In this struggle it is the task of the European Union, but also of the European Parliament, to - naturally - criticise the conservatives."
"We are very good at this and we must carry on with it above all. For example, if it is a question of banning the HADEP - unacceptable."
"For example, if it is a question of descending on human rights organisations - indefensible."
"For example, if it is a question of the refusal to give Layla Zana and her colleagues a really fair new trial."
"An inseparable part of this criticism as far as I am concerned however is the support for the reformers and this we are occasionally inclined to forget."
"For example, if it is a question of the new package of reform proposals that is now before the Turkish Parliament and in which, after long urging by the European Parliament, for example Article 8 of the Anti-Terrorism Act is actually deleted and in which Kurdish private media are actually being given the opportunity to broadcast."
"We must take care to retain this balance and what I very much wish to avoid is to create the impression that in Turkey it was nothing, is nothing and never will be anything."
"I believe that Turkey can implement the reforms, I think that they deserve our support."
"Finally, Mr President, we will all have to answer the question of whether we want it to be successful."
"Do we want the reformers to succeed?"
"My answer is a heartfelt 'yes', because that is good for Turkey and for Europe."
"Mr President, Mr Oostlander has written an honest, critical, as well as fair, report on Turkey's application for membership of the European Union."
"Political clarity is something from which, ultimately, all parties involved benefit."
"I share the rapporteur's view - and I would refer to paragraph 52 - that, at present, Turkey does not fulfil the conditions for the opening of accession negotiations."
"The report underpins this frank conclusion in a convincing manner."
"Three fundamental inconsistencies with the political criteria of Copenhagen - which are, after all, essential accession conditions - are all-important in this connection: firstly, the army's dominant position in the Turkish state and society, for which, see paragraphs 7, 8 and 9; secondly, the constant discrimination against religious minorities, particularly that of Christian denominations (paragraph 39); and thirdly, the disturbing Kurdish issue, mentioned in paragraphs 34, 35 and 43."
"Over the past few weeks, the dominant role of the Turkish armed forces was abundantly clear from the domestic media campaign about possible tensions within the army's most senior ranks between those in favour of reform and critics of this necessary EU route."
"The rumour machine says a great deal about the true relationship between civilian and military authorities."
"The authority relationships in the EU Member States are completely different."
"In summary, Brussels is outside Ankara's military-political range for the time being."
"Meanwhile, the governing AKP does claim freedom of religion for Muslims in its own country, but, according to Western Turkey experts, does not breathe a word about the self-same constitutional right for non-Muslims."
"The urgent call on the Commission in paragraph 40 to draw up a comparative study between religious freedom in Turkey and the EU Member States is therefore opportune."
"I would join the rapporteur in calling on the Turkish authorities to take the Kurdish South-East under their wing in earnest."
"The Council and the Commission ought to give their 100% backing to a comprehensive development plan for this seriously underdeveloped region."
"A helping hand of this kind to Turkey would do the Kurdish citizens a world of good, both internally and externally, and I would add this for the sake of Mr Oostlander, even independently of EU relations."
"Mr President, the situation of a country with the recognised status of candidate for accession to the European Union which allows old tubs full of illegal migrants to leave its ports, as happened a week ago, is peculiar."
"How can a state which bears great resemblance to a police state, like the Turkish state, which is so effective at controlling political opponents and minorities, display such weakness and inefficiency when it comes to the traffickers of the highly powerful Turkish mafia?"
"This is a point which warrants close attention on our part as we now prepare to assess the conditions for accession."
"The report, which I consider to be very well-balanced, and I endorse the firm statement contained in paragraph 52, makes no mention of the genocide of the Armenian people: this may be the result of intense lobbying, of pressure put on the Members of Parliament by the Turkish Government."
"We must not forget the rights of the Diaspora - of the children of the victims of that holocaust - who are spread throughout Europe and are European citizens, just like us."
"The situation, as described by the Human Rights Association, is certainly not encouraging: a political police which interrogates, tortures and rapes women, especially Kurdish women, and ongoing persecution of ethnic and religious minorities."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the report by Mr Oostlander on Turkey is one of the many which have been submitted from time to time to the European Parliament in connection with the various aspects of relations between this problematic country and the international community and the European Union in particular."
"The Oostlander report, however, over and above its more general objective and balanced formulations, is mainly characterised by the clarity and frankness with which it notes and brands Turkey's permanent weaknesses, shortcomings and imperfections in the fields of the rule of law, democratic governance, human and minority rights and its lawful international conduct."
"In other words, something that should have been done a long time ago, instead of the practice to date of avoiding any candid description of reality for various reasons which serve political and other interests, by demonstrating a poorly conceived tolerance, by having two sets of weights and measures and by citing misleadingly labelled arguments, such as the strategic importance of Turkey, the beloved pretext of its trans-Atlantic protectors, or the alleged need to send positive messages to Ankara - as we heard for the umpteenth time just now - and so on."
"The unproductive results of this essential beautification of what is a wholly reprehensible and censurable situation are now obvious and, with all due respect Mr President-in-Office, even the most dreamy apologists of the lenient treatment of and attempts at rapprochement with Turkey must be disappointed, because not even the positive messages which have been sent out for years have resulted in a correspondingly positive response from Turkey, nor has European tolerance been duly appreciated by the Turkish establishment which, on the contrary, has taken it - and perhaps rightly so - as encouragement and acceptance of its policy, whereas if the European position had been expressed earlier with the same courageous honesty of the Oostlander report, perhaps the prospects of the so-called European orientation of Turkey would be more auspicious and there would be fewer reasonable reservations and doubts as to the extent to which this country is legally entitled to be even a candidate for integration into the European family."
"As it is better late than never, however, and with the even faint hope that Ankara will finally understand the real message of the European Parliament and will proceed accordingly in its choices, I unreservedly support the Oostlander report."
"Mr President, I should like to take advantage of the debate on Mr Oostlander's exceptional report on the accession of Turkey to the European Union to state once again that I remain a firm supporter of its accession."
"This position on my part is based on the following reasons:"
"First, as a Greek I should like this neighbouring country of Greece's to grow and develop the creative ability of its people within the democratic frameworks which the European Union safeguards all its members."
"I believe that the Greek people and the Turkish people will have a unique opportunity to cooperate in the joint effort for a peaceful and prosperous Europe and mutually supportive, deeper bilateral relations between them."
"Secondly, as a socialist, I should like to see a democratic Turkey safeguard institutional guarantees for all the freedoms of its citizens so that they can intervene creatively and unimpeded in the development of their society in accordance with the desires, expectations, inspirations and output of their work."
"I believe that the economic and cultural development of Turkey as the consequence of the freedom of action of its citizens under the rule of law will have exponential benefits for Turkey itself to start with, for the European Union certainly and, without any shadow of a doubt, for rapprochement, understanding and cooperation on the part of the countries and peoples neighbouring Turkey."
"Thirdly, there is a personal reason why I champion the accession of Turkey to the European Union."
"I am convinced that the interventions of the military in the political life of a country, either directly or indirectly, do not solve any problems."
"On the contrary, they cause problems and impasses to accumulate in their country."
"I have no particular regard for or trust in nation-saving soldiers the world over, who see any free expression or action as a military target to be neutralised using every means, not excluding, of course, bans, imprisonment, torture and natural extermination."
"Turkey's European prospects therefore depend on the soldiers returning to their barracks and being supervised by the political leadership democratically elected by the people to govern them."
"Thirty years ago, when a military junta took it upon itself to bring the Greek people to their senses from the excesses of their democratic excitement, the EEC, as it was then, froze the association agreement with Greece and that helped us considerably in restoring democratic normalcy to my country."
"The personal reason I referred to earlier has to do with the fights and experiences of that era."
"This is an opportunity for the Turkish people to enjoy a smooth transition, without sacrifice and tragic consequences, to a fully operational parliamentary democracy, a democracy with all its accompanying parameters."
"The European challenge, therefore, also serves Turkey's democratic prospects."
"Turkey must interpret this challenge as a unique opportunity on its course towards Europe."
"It is in its hands, its political leadership wants it and the Oostlander report lays down the preconditions for avoiding misunderstandings."
"Mr President, Mr Oostlander's report has been quite substantially modified at the committee stage, as other honourable Members have already commented."
"It is now more balanced, and this is undoubtedly an improvement."
"It is to be expected that a report like this one should make mention of a certain number of deficiencies and lapses, especially relating to issues of human rights and public freedoms."
"On all these points, I believe one can only agree with the rapporteur."
"On the other hand, I cannot agree as fully with one of the rapporteur's personal preferences, which, though concealed for the most part by the amendments, is nevertheless latent and sometimes explicit."
"I am referring to what I would term Mr Oostlander's pathological aversion to secularism and the secular ideal."
"This aversion also made an appearance in the brief oral presentation during which he mentioned what he called Turkey's political philosophy."
"Through a consideration of the historical context, he likened this philosophy to totalitarianism, one of the most monstrous forms of political oppression Europe has ever spawned."
"In point of fact, Mr Oostlander, Kemalism was by no means a totalitarian system, and did not follow totalitarian models."
"Kemalism, which was unquestionably a form of enlightened despotism, set out to modernise Turkey rapidly, drawing its inspiration to a not inconsiderable degree from Western European democratic models, most notably those of the separation of Church and State and secular republicanism."
"You see, Mr Oostlander, as Turkey applies to join the European Union (and it is natural for that application to give rise to discussion and even argument), any pride it can take today in its positive historical legacy is attributable to that very attempt to introduce our European secularism into a Muslim society."
"For that, as some of the honourable Members have said, is the challenge, or one of the challenges, of the twenty-first century."
"I do not think there is any justification for adopting the disgruntled attitude you have shown towards the secular ideal in recital G of your report."
"Today's Europe is rooted in that ideal, which stands out with great clarity, to my mind, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights we have accepted."
"You ought to adopt the opposite stance, welcoming the secular ideal more warmly and valuing it more highly."
"Mr President, Turkey had the right to apply for membership."
"I believe that it will have the right to remain at the application stage for some time, for its progress is slow and must be monitored closely by us."
"That does not give us licence simply to parrot the phrase 'some progress, but could do better if he tried', so beloved of schoolteachers."
"We must not forget that application for membership of the European Union is akin, for Turkey, to the United States' experience of the concept of the frontier at the end of the nineteenth century."
"That kind of stirring, pioneering front provides the impetus to move further on."
"From that perspective, we must encourage Turkey's application."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Atatürk legacy is double-edged and somewhat ambiguous."
"On the one hand there is the secular state, on the other the strong position of the Turkish army reflected in the power of the National Security Council, which implies military power over civilians."
"In a real democracy, this should actually be the other way round."
"How can the secular state in Turkey be maintained and democracy established?"
"The army cannot be the ultimate guarantee for democracy, so far-reaching reforms are called for here."
"As is abundantly clear from the Oostlander report, the country is not yet a democracy as long as human rights are violated and as long as the rights of minorities are not absolutely guaranteed."
"Torture is a matter of daily practice."
"The position of the Kurdish language, the exclusion of the Kurds from political life, or at least the attempt to exclude them, is evidence of the fact that they do not want a political solution to this important conflict of nationalities."
"The threat of fundamentalism remains, although the AKP has adopted a reformist policy."
"We recognise that major progress has been made in legislation, such as the abolition of capital punishment, but far-reaching reforms have not yet been carried out."
"In paragraph 11 of the Oostlander report, it is suggested that serious work be done on constitutional matters."
"Needless to say, this cannot be a condition, but it is still worthwhile to suggest that a new constitution be put in place, one that makes room for human rights, but also for the autonomous Kurdish community, and one in which the position of minorities is safeguarded."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Oostlander."
"This is a splendid report, which lists all the critical points without offending Turkey."
"It is fair and open, and I believe that anyone applying for accession has the right to be treated fairly and openly."
"Second, I would like to contradict both of the previous speakers."
"It is not - as is written in the minority opinion - about precepts of an almost parareligious nature; clause 3 states specifically that fundamental European values, although based on the Judeo-Christian legacy, but also encompassing the values of the Enlightenment, do not stand in the way of the accession of a Muslim state in principle."
"In view of what you, Mr Nordmann and Mrs Maes, have just said with regard to secularism in Turkey, I can only call upon you to inform yourselves!"
"There is no freedom of religion, and there is no secularism along French lines."
"Secularism in Turkey means 130 000 state employees monitoring and harassing the non-Muslim minority."
"There are no rights for Christian religions in Turkey."
"Separation of state and religion is one thing, but guaranteeing freedom of religion is another."
"It is an inalienable part of the European system of values that every individual should be allowed to live according to his or her religion and practise it."
"In Turkey, this is not guaranteed."
"Until 1954, it was a punishable offence to provide religious instruction."
"I therefore really entreat you to inform yourselves on this issue."
"The other points mentioned were the role of the army, minority rights for the Kurds, the right to vote, in other words the fact that the 10% hurdle is still in place, the imprisonment of persons motivated by political or moral conviction such as Leyla Zana, who will soon have spent ten years in prison for speaking freely, or the issue of the heritage of the Armenians and Syrians, which is not protected at present in Turkey."
"It is a long list, and one that Turkey must work through."
"That is its obligation."
"I especially welcome the point made in clause 52 of the report that, in the light of the Copenhagen decision, this is not the start of negotiations."
"For this to happen, the conditions must be met."
"This will be reviewed at the end of 2004."
"I also agree with the fact that the review is not to take place now, but at the end of 2004."
"Furthermore, as an interim report, this report can in no way signify that Parliament has committed itself one way or another with regard to a later decision to approve or reject Turkey's application for accession."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I truly hope - and I say this from the bottom of my heart - I truly hope that Turkey will one day be a democratic country, for then some people in this House will find it hard to formulate speeches."
"My dear Mr Langen, I think very highly of you, but I have heard this speech often in the past, irrespective of what is happening in Turkey."
"It will no longer be possible to make some of these speeches because they always say the same thing, no matter what is going on in Turkey."
"In reality - and Commissioner Verheugen discussed this in some detail - we can see that a great deal is happening, but that it is not enough - quite right!"
"We want more, we criticise Turkey - quite right!"
"Please be honest, however, ladies and gentlemen! For many of you - you have heard only four speeches - all the human rights and civil rights are nothing but a facade."
"Many of you simply do not want Turkey. Just say it honestly, and then we will know where we stand."
"Let us tell Turkey straight, and we can dispense with this performance!"
"Anything else really is just a performance."
"As a Member of this House I am pleased that the Council and the Commission have a greater degree of competence as regards shaping foreign policy, because the Parliament of which I am a Member is not capable of doing so."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Nordmann expressed himself in the most eloquent terms."
"Following the example of Mr Cashman just now, I would also like to declare my support for Mr Nordmann and, taking up his arguments, join him in expressing the conviction that there are many unspoken prejudices in this report."
"Such prejudices should not figure in an objective account of the state of a nation."
"Naturally, the political beliefs of all interested parties should be respected."
"I subscribe, however, to what the honourable Member said about secularism and about a consideration of the very essence of the Kemalist state."
"Such a consideration was entirely absent from the report, as was, by all appearances, any mention of the efforts of the current Prime Minister of Turkey to bind his country securely to Europe."
"In this context, Mr Oostlander, if this Parliament had been given the possibility of producing a report as detailed as this one not only on the countries applying for accession, but also on the current Member States of the Union (I am thinking here of my own country), the fact is that it would have taken not 56 paragraphs, but perhaps twice that, to deal with conditions in Italian prisons, the state of the Italian legal system, and many other areas besides, in which things are going badly."
"In our countries too, ladies and gentlemen, or in some of our countries at least, there was a time not so long ago when people went to prison because they were Jehovah's Witnesses and did not want to do their military service."
"They were compelled to do it by force, or thrown into prison."
"Our countries have experienced all of that."
"Turkey must, of course, make significant progress."
"We cannot have it both ways, however: either we offer Turkey a landfall on the coast of Europe, or else we refuse it."
"If we opt for the latter, we not only make a catastrophic political and strategic error: we also point Turkey, push it, in a way, towards other coasts, other shores, which would be much more dangerous not only for stability but also, I believe, for the welfare of the Turks and their progress towards democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"To this end, my radical colleagues in this Parliament and myself, together with Members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, whom I would like to take this opportunity to thank, have tabled an amendment designed precisely to avoid closing the door on Turkey, as the Oostlander report does."
"The first draft of this report, whose tone brought to my mind the Battle of Lepanto more than anything else, has, of course, been improved in the meantime."
"We have therefore tabled an amendment in which we declare ourselves convinced that the conditions for Turkey to be admitted to the accession negotiations will be fulfilled as long as the Turkish Government pursues its current programme of essential reform with steadfastness and determination."
"The rapporteur has suggested that the amendment be included as an addition, showing a desire to compromise which I applaud."
"It is in a similar spirit of compromise that I accept the rapporteur's offer, following the example of the Verts/ALE Group."
"In doing so, I hope that we can also come to an agreement on a message to Turkey whose dominant theme is not that the door is closed, but that we are waiting for real progress."
"Obviously, when the moment comes, everyone will be able to take their own decisions."
"Let us at least leave that door open, however."
"With this in mind, I hope that the House will approve this amendment unanimously."
"Mr President, Mr Oostlander has accomplished a huge, difficult task, endeavouring to reconcile the extremely diverse viewpoints expressed by Parliament on a controversial and much-debated subject such as Turkey's accession."
"The result is a resolution which is acceptable as a compromise but which we might have liked to be marked and inspired by greater optimism so as to send Turkey a more positive message, as Commissioner Verheugen advocated too, despite the fact that this country still has a great deal to do and many changes and innovations to make before it can hope to join the European Union, as the resolution rightly states."
"We need to establish whether geography and religion are criteria which restrict the possibility of accession or whether Europe is conceived as a set of values and principles with the result that countries that share those values and principles of democracy and freedom have the right to apply for membership."
"It is in this spirit that, to Article 52 of the report, which notes that the conditions for opening negotiations are not yet in place - which is undoubtedly true at present - we prefer the version contained in Amendment No 11, to which Mr Dell'Alba referred just now, which expresses the positive view, the confidence that the requirements can be met if Turkey carries out the necessary reforms."
"I too am grateful to Mr Oostlander, who appears to be willing to accept this amendment, if not as a replacement for point 52, at least as an addition to it."
"Mr President, the Oostlander report has undergone a major face-lift, with 283 amendments tabled."
"Certain extreme formulations, which would have compromised political relations between Parliament and Turkey, have been eliminated."
"Although the report rightly points, however, down the road towards respect for human rights, along which the country still has to travel, it is nevertheless still a partial and ideologically charged report in my book."
"It attempts to stamp Turkey with its own view of European values."
"Paragraph 3 invokes a set of European values rooted essentially in Judaeo-Christian culture."
"If this paragraph is not amended, it will be a slap in the face for an essentially secular country under Muslim government."
"It will also be unacceptable to us Europeans, as it will mean the return of old scourges and the renewed influence of religion in political affairs."
"If we must mention Judaeo-Christian values, why do we not also mention Judaeo-Christian crimes?"
"A re-reading of The Gospel according to Jesus Christ, by the Portuguese Nobel Prize Laureate José Saramago, is necessary to remind us how many crimes have been committed in the name of our gods."
"Well, let us take the gods out of the running."
"Let us acknowledge once and for all that Europe is secular and contains many different religions."
"Let us also deal firmly but fairly with Turkey's application to join the European Union."
"Mr President, it is important that we treat our Turkish friends with honesty and openness."
"Of course, treating them honestly and openly also includes the right to be critical and to point out deficiencies."
"We want to help Turkey on its path to true democracy and the rule of law."
"Turkey deserves fair treatment, and Mr Oostlander's report is fair."
"It describes the remarkable progress that is being made, but also states in all honesty where reform is still badly needed."
"In my opinion, what is important is that Turkey itself must want to make progress in terms of meeting the Copenhagen criteria."
"It must not work on these reforms primarily to appease the critics in the EU, to do us a favour, so to speak."
"Turkey must embed the necessary reforms deep within its own society, and the reforms must have an impact in real life."
"Constitutional amendments on paper, or new laws on paper, will not be enough on their own."
"Paper is patient!"
"What is crucial is to implement reforms in people's daily lives."
"So far, however, it is precisely this that we have yet to see."
"Mr Oostlander's report describes the many shortcomings that exist in all areas."
"It notes that the conditions for opening accession negotiations have not yet been met at the present time, and calls upon the Council to take a clear and consistent position at last."
"The Copenhagen criteria - and this must be stressed over and over again - are not negotiable."
"This applies equally to all candidate countries, and so it also applies to Turkey."
"Turkey must also be fair here for once towards the EU and acknowledge this fact."
"Turkey must stop passing the buck to the EU and trying to exert pressure."
"It was not us who promised the Turkish people rapid accession within a few years; Turkish politics itself bears sole responsibility for this."
"If Turkish politics now finds itself having to provide explanations and the population is becoming impatient, it is a problem of Turkey's own making that must be resolved in Turkey and not by the EU by softening the accession criteria."
"What Turkey can expect from us - and it really can - is honesty, openness, seriousness and fairness."
"Madam President, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Oostlander for his report, and to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Yiannitsis, and Commissioner Verheugen."
"I feel that the Oostlander report is very well-balanced and frank."
"The European Union is a Union of shared values. Thus, all the countries which have become Members in the past and those which are joining the Union now share these values and, in order to join the Union, have brought their institutional, political and economic systems into line."
"This is the bottom line."
"It is not the European Union which wants to become part of Turkey but Turkey which wants to subscribe to these shared values."
"We must respect the diversities which make up the rich heritage of the European Union, but the limits are defined by respect for the Copenhagen criteria, for the principles of democracy and the rule of law, and these criteria and principles must not just be proclaimed but enforced and lived."
"I would venture to say that the countries which intend to share our European culture may become part of the European Union."
"Turkey is applying to join."
"We are not opposed to this in principle."
"We are waiting for the country to complete the process of adopting our cultural values."
"The Erdogan government must be encouraged in the process of moving Turkey closer to the values of the European Union."
"The ideological NATOists believe that Turkey's role in NATO could be its trump card when it comes to joining the European Union."
"That might have been so in the past, but we now believe that NATO, with the participation of Russia, will gradually have to assume, with a slightly more effective contribution from the European Union, an international policing role, serving a United Nations which has been reformed to safeguard human rights and democracy in the countries of the world."
"I hope that Turkey will be able to act on these proposals, to resolve the Cyprus issue and to establish good neighbourly relations with all the countries on its borders, resolving longstanding conflicts."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is two oral questions (B5-0094/2003 and B5-0095/2003) by Mr Brok to the Council and the Commission on a renewed transatlantic partnership for the third millennium."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council shares the honourable Member's deep concern about the state of relations between the Union and the United States."
"Although these relations basically remain strong, it is clear that their modus operandi needs to be re-examined by both sides."
"The Union has made it absolutely clear that it is dealing with relations with the United States as the main priority for its foreign policy."
"Working together, we can help create a better world for everyone."
"The issue for the Union is how this objective will be adopted on the basis of the already very broad cooperation taking place in the western Balkans, Afghanistan, the Middle East and in connection with North Korea."
"Focusing attention on issues on which the Union and the United States differ very often conceals this cooperation, which is appreciated by both sides."
"As the honourable Member of Parliament knows, the High Representative will submit a document to the European Council in Thessaloniki containing recommendations for a global Union strategy in the field of foreign policy and security."
"A preliminary discussion of the subject could be held in the General Affairs and External Relations Council in June."
"It is obvious that, although this will be a general strategy, it will also contribute to the development of EU-USA relations."
"It is also presumed that it will be based on the existing Union policy in relation, inter alia, to the role of the United Nations."
"The time is right, given that this will take place just before the EU-USA summit in Washington on 25 June."
"Just as the development of the foreign and security policy is allowing the Union to deal more efficiently with recent events, including its cooperation with the United States in the Middle East, Afghanistan or the western Balkans, in the field of the European security and defence policy, improving European military capabilities continues to be a high priority for the Union, so that the Union can become a more efficient partner of the United States."
"The Council continues to take the view that a multilateral approach is still always the best way to resolve the various problems that we face today in various parts of the world."
"The Council has not expressed an opinion on the question of adding the principle of reinforced cooperation in the field of the ESDP to the new Treaty."
"When we completed the New Transatlantic Agenda, we stated that we were committed to the objective of constructing a new European architecture in the field of security in which ????, the Union, the OSCE and the Council of Europe would play complementary and mutually reinforcing roles."
"This was our position in 1995 and it remains our position today."
"The New Transatlantic Agenda provides the most extensive framework for cooperation with the United States."
"The action plan may perhaps now be outdated, but that does not apply to the New Transatlantic Agenda."
"The dialogue we have with the United States is already intensive, with countless continual contacts at all levels."
"What we need is not more meetings but perhaps to focus our attention more."
"We hope that the development of an overall Union strategy will renew the dialogue with the United States and increase its usefulness to the situations developing around the world."
"Cooperation is still an absolute necessity in order to combat the scourge of terrorism."
"Following 11 September 2001, our cooperation has extended beyond all expectations on both sides."
"Over and above what is being said about differences, there is very often ignorance on both sides of the Atlantic about the essential and specific work being carried out jointly in order to combat terrorism."
"The United States need Europe, just as we need the United States if we want to be successful in combating the challenges of this century."
"The Council is fully aware of the fact that, if we are to succeed, we need to deal not only with the symptoms but also with the causes."
"And this presupposes mobilising resources in many and varied sectors, in the economic, social and development as well as the political sector."
"Finally, the transatlantic legislative dialogue is an exceptionally important element in transatlantic relations."
"Whereas the Council's contacts are to a great extent with the government of the United States, Parliament can play a vital role by reinforcing its dialogue with the members of Congress, in the aim of promoting an understanding of the concerns and priorities of the peoples of the European Union."
"The Council is not authorised to dictate to civil society the role which it can play in this dialogue."
"However, it has encouraged the development of the four specialist dialogues and maintains the view that, together with the numerous networks of universities, institutes, laboratories, ideas and so on, they can make an important contribution."
"No more cooperation frameworks are needed."
"What is needed in the dialogue with the United States is for each side to be carefully informed of the other side's opinions and mutual action."
"Madam President, our concern about the current state of transatlantic relations does not stem solely from the vicissitudes of the Iraq crisis or its possible consequences, but from deeper causes, and essentially the realisation that we are seeing a truly radical change, a truly extraordinary change in the United States' foreign and security policy, under the neo-conservative banner."
"Leadership by means of multinational cooperation has been replaced by a global unilateralist approach, the strategies of containment and dissuasion by the doctrine of pre-emptive attack and the restrictions imposed by participation in alliances and multilateral institutions by the creation of made-to-measure coalitions in which a form of subordination based on the notion that 'you are either with me or against me' tend to predominate."
"Many of us in Europe believe that this way of thinking, rather than producing a Pax Americana, may actually produce significant American chaos in the world."
"Within this context, if Europe wishes to meet its responsibilities it must turn itself into an organisation capable of playing a significant role on the international stage and, in order to achieve this, European policy must permanently pursue the objective of multilateralising the United States - an objective which is not entirely out of reach if we consider that opinion polls indicate that almost two-thirds of the American public prefer multilateral approaches to unilateral ones."
"Within a renewed relationship we must accept clearly that there are significant discrepancies, that there are many differences of perception and approach but there are also many shared views and potential points of agreement."
"If we accept this contrasting situation we will be able to make progress."
"I would finally like to say that I believe that positions expressed by the High Representative and Commissioner Patten, as well as the specific proposals presented by the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, are aimed in the right direction and we will support them."
"I would urge you not to let a reunified Europe become divided over Atlantic unity."
"Commissioner Patten is right."
"The most pressing world problems cannot, and should not, be solved by the United States alone."
"Whether these problems concern weapons of mass destruction, human rights, poverty, religious conflicts or lack of democracy, it is vitally important for America and Europe to join forces."
"Europeans must join Bush in showing the West's neo-progressive face to the world."
"The European Union can be Washington's fully-fledged partner only if it acts like one."
"If the French-German axis turns away from Washington, while the British-Polish axis moves towards Bush, we will end up not making any headway at all."
"We must put the trauma of Iraq to one side and, as the European Union, draft a joint global strategy with the United States."
"Two strategies are too many, and there is no room for either inflated national egos or conservative ideological agendas."
"Let us now reunite Europe and America using a pragmatic approach, in other words the D'66 approach."
"Madam President, I would firstly like to thank the representatives of the Council and the Commission for their speeches, and point out that when our delegation of MEPs visited Washington, Members of the US Congress asked us for help in neutralising and paralysing the neo-conservative and, in some ways, almost fascist, tendencies of the Bush administration."
"In other words, they expressed their desire for a relationship between the US and European people which contributes to peace in the world."
"If it is shown that the US State Department was providing misinformation when it said that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq - and we are seeing that this was merely a manipulation - and if we remember that in the document from that Department of 20 September 2002, the UN, the European Union and international law were dispensed with and it is stated simply that the United States are going to dictate laws in the future, I believe we are facing a great threat to the world and also to Europe."
"Fortunately, Europe is based on peace, international law and the peaceful resolution of conflicts, and must play a major role in order to make progress in that direction and prevent the new threats of this conservative Bush administration, thereby restoring the friendship between the American people and ourselves."
"Madam President, I was not aware that idealism was the dominant philosophy in the European Parliament."
"We cannot build transatlantic relations just by repeating over and over again that that is what we want."
"In the past, transatlantic relations were determined by the stand-off between the totalitarian regimes of communist countries on the one hand and the West on the other."
"This was the point made by Mr Patten towards the end of his speech."
"This situation changed following the fall of Communism."
"If, therefore, we want to have transatlantic relations, we need to redefine the relationship."
"We need to ask ourselves whether the United States and Europe are bound to have the same interests nowadays."
"Prior to the fall of Communism, that had to be the case, but is this still true today?"
"Having formulated the question the answer becomes obvious."
"The United States and Europe do not now share the same vision or the same interests."
"This is true both in terms of geo-strategy and in terms of economics."
"A new transatlantic relationship cannot therefore be built by repeatedly expressing our desire for it."
"We need to come up with a completely new definition of our relations with the United States."
"Let us take a very simple example."
"We now have the euro."
"If we are honest, the euro divides the European Union from the United States, as the euro is the dollar's main rival."
"Therefore, our strategic and economic interests differ."
"If we want to reinvigorate our economies and re-launch Europe, we need to pose a question that is of fundamental importance for Europe."
"At a global level, we must ask whether we are bound forever to pay for energy and oil in dollars."
"Where is it decreed that we must pay in dollars for the oil and gas we buy from Russia, Saudi Arabia or Iran?"
"We must have the will in terms of strategy and economic policy to make the euro a safe currency to ensure we have the funds to bring about economic recovery."
"The United States is doing just this today."
"A figure of USD 8 billion per day has been quoted."
"The US needs investment to pay off its debts."
"We therefore need to strengthen the role of the euro as a safe currency that rivals the dollar."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to discuss the subject of transatlantic relations, you must find the courage to put this problem to the United States."
"The real stakes are these."
"We will not succeed in building a new transatlantic relationship if we in the European Union do not have our own doctrine on all the strategic problems, on all the military problems, on our vision of the world and on what we want in the world."
"We need to ensure that we define our interests."
"Only then can we enter into discussions with the United States."
"Madam President, I think of partnership as a strong mutual bond, one in which the key elements are mutual trust and close cooperation based on common values and objectives."
"Regrettably, it is precisely these elements that have been absent from the transatlantic partnership over the past few months."
"The most painful manifestation of transatlantic, and at the same time European, discord was the public controversy over Iraq."
"We on this side of the Atlantic Ocean have all the more reason to first search our own hearts."
"In short, how should we take the transatlantic partnership further?"
"It is primarily the global safety situation that jumps out at you."
"Terrorism - of whatever ideological or religious hue - calls for a joint transatlantic approach."
"In concrete terms, destabilising forces in the Middle East may not play the European Union off against either one another or against the United States."
"The West's coordinated fight against terrorism makes association agreements and trade agreements with states from that region worthy of condemnation."
"Do the Council and the Commission share this vision?"
"After all, Syria and Iran are on the agenda; is that not so, Commissioner Patten?"
"There is a great deal at stake: the European Union's political credibility - including in the eyes of my electorate - and the solidity and durability of the transatlantic partnership."
"Militarily speaking, the European Union is now clearly the weaker partner in the transatlantic alliance."
"What is more obvious than a more substantial input from the Member States within NATO?"
"This would promote the transatlantic partnership."
"European military alternatives, on the other hand, would erode the crucial bond of safety with the United States."
"Moreover, I cannot see any reason why we should have faith in initiatives of that kind."
"Let us in Europe be realistic and, above all, be reliable friends and real allies to the Americans."
"Madam President, almost a hundred years of history shows us Europeans that whenever our continent has been in trouble the United States of America has always come to our rescue."
"In the First World War that became the deciding factor in preventing the expansion of imperial Germany."
"In the Second World War the US contribution was decisive in delivering Germany and France from Hitler's yoke and the rest of Europe from his aspirations to power."
"When the Cold War ended in the break-up of the Soviet Union and the liberation of countries that had been under the yoke of Central European communism and the Soviet Union it was decidedly the result of President Ronald Reagan's arms race, which the Soviet economy and its social system could not bear."
"When we say today that relations between the United States and Europe have reached a crisis it is more about a crisis in Europe's internal relations and a crisis in relations between certain individual countries and the United States."
"The way certain countries go in for unilateralism in EU internal affairs shows we are still light years away from a common foreign and security policy in crisis situations."
"Most of the 25 European countries supported the approval of the UN Security Council regarding starting a war with Iraq."
"Most do not accept America's insistence on being able to take up a position outside the international organisation in matters of war crimes."
"We disagree over the importance of the Kyoto Agreement and each day there are talks to resolve differences of opinion on economic matters."
"All this notwithstanding, the basic values we tend to share and considerations of security common to us both, where Europe is becoming more and more the recipient than the provider, are a firm basis for looking to the future and supporting the transatlantic partnership and genuinely constructing the kind of action programme that my colleague, James Elles, just mentioned."
"We in Europe can no longer catch up with the United States in the area of defence technology; and perhaps we do not need to."
"We can and must, however, resolve our differences and aspire to a common foreign and defence policy."
"Only in this way will we be a worthy partner in matters that unite us and in those we disagree with the United States over, a partner that is sufficiently strong for our views to be heeded in the United States, whose largest trading partner we are, as we heard concerning US investment in Europe."
"That shows that for the United States the positive development of our relationship is important, but for us it is vital."
"We can accept the boycott on French wines in America if as a counterweight America places an order for a hundred Airbus planes, as was the case just a week or so ago."
"Madam President, I think that everyone will agree that there is a need for a serious debate within the European Union, but also between the European Union and the United States, about the role of the security policy in transatlantic relations."
"However, for that to happen, a better foundation is required at this side of the ocean."
"Above all, we need to try to establish what we ourselves want and not get bogged down so much by what we do not want the Americans to do."
"I think that this will be a very decisive factor indeed in future."
"If we in the European Union want to leave our own mark on this discussion, we will once again need to define together what is essential to us."
"I hope that the strategy that Mr Solana will shortly be tabling will make a significant contribution to this."
"The European Union itself must be able, and have the courage, to take more responsibility."
"This can be done most effectively by continuing to build on our own defence identity in a dynamic manner, but also by carrying out security tasks independently, in - for example - Macedonia, and soon in Africa too."
"We must learn to make more efficient use of our defence capabilities, but not avoid a possible discussion about higher defence outgoings."
"The EU must be committed to a wide range of security, conflict prevention being its key priority."
"Experience in this field and the instruments that the European Union has at its disposal must be better coordinated and used more effectively."
"Involvement in multilateral frameworks, such as the United Nations, forms part of this."
"Security is sustainable only if it is founded on international cooperation."
"This is the core message, I think, to the Americans, who go all out for their country's military power."
"NATO can play a bridging role, but only if the opinion which many Europeans have about security is done justice."
"We want political equality in transatlantic relations, but there is little point in asking for it if we remain divided ourselves."
"Madam President, just hours after the Evian G8 meeting, which a growing number of citizens see as illegitimate, I feel it is essential to come up with answers to a number of questions, before attempting to consider the nature of the transatlantic partnership."
"As I do not have a great deal of time, I will only touch on some of these questions."
"First, there is the question of Iraq."
"Can we really say that the issue of the war has been dealt with when the European Union has given its blessing to the United States having complete control of Iraq?"
"Should we engage in a war against terrorism instigated by the bellicose stance of the United States that seeks to dominate, not to share power?"
"This is just increasing the threat."
"Should we then allow ourselves to be engulfed in a genuine currency war, started this time by the United States?"
"Should we give in to President Bush's decrees yet again by setting aside what remains of the European social model?"
"Should we set aside the provisions on retirement, for example, in the face of wholesale opposition as exemplified by the large demonstrations in France and Austria?"
"Lastly, what use will the meeting of the WTO in Cancun be if the European Union does not stand up to the United States' continuing failure to move on certain issues, especially that of allowing poor countries to access generic medicines?"
"The European Union is at a crossroads."
"It may choose to hide behind the strategic doctrine entitled 'for a new American century'."
"Alternatively it may choose to adopt a truly independent policy."
"If we choose the latter, how can we achieve such a policy without addressing the huge expectations of the southern hemisphere and without freeing ourselves from the ultraliberal policy that exacerbates inequalities and frustrates all attempts to promote development?"
"We must listen to the people of Europe."
"They do not want Europe to be a poor relation of the United States."
"They do not want Europe to be overcautious."
"They are hoping and praying for an independent and responsible Europe."
"They long for a Europe that promotes the interests of all in working for a world that is safer because it is more humane."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, this debate must allow us to reflect on our foreign policy relations, and therefore our economic relations too, with NAFTA and, in particular, with the United States and in the context of transatlantic relations."
"With regard to the famous CFSP, I hope and believe that the Convention will resolve the political gap, appointing a Minister for External Affairs and avoiding losses of international credibility such as that which we have suffered as a result of the Iraq crisis."
"With regard to the economic sector, however, I think the best solution is not so much to intervene via any WTO agreements as to draw up a single list which addresses the issues in terms of tax and trade concessions, for that will allow us to avoid further instances of bureaucratic chaos."
"Otherwise, I cannot see us achieving anything."
"The so-called partnership agreements relating to what is our primary market in terms of both investment and trade will play a major role if we are able to reinvigorate them, simplifying the issue by compiling a list, an agreement that could be concluded by the Commission with NAFTA, first and foremost."
"On the eve of enlargement, I believe this is a significant way of boosting our economy and the political content of our foreign policy."
"Madam President, Commissioner, as has already been said, I believe it is desirable for Europe and the United States to work together in partnership."
"It stands to reason."
"All this rhetoric about partnership should not mean, however, that we evade the choices Europe has to make and the difficulty we are faced with at present."
"Contrary to what some honourable Members have said, we in Europe are not responsible for the erosion of the type of historic links we have with the United States."
"We are having to deal with a very particular type of administration."
"It was extremely unilateralist from the outset."
"Initially, however, it did not adopt a particularly interventionist line."
"One section of the administration used the trauma of 11 September to impose its own unilateralist and extremely interventionist agenda which predated those terrible events."
"Faced with this situation, Europe has a decision to make."
"On the one hand, it could be argued that nothing can be done to counter the will of the United States, given the power it has on the world stage."
"In that case, there would be nothing to do except to give in to the United States and to go along with them, even when it comes to lies and exposing ourselves to ridicule, just like those who tried to make us believe that intervening in Iraq was justified because weapons of mass destruction posed an imminent threat."
"If we were to go down that road, Mr Elles' proposal would make sense."
"It amounts to a free trade zone or in other words a new version of the Transatlantic Market Place."
"We must, however, bear in mind that this would mean setting aside the Union's common external trade policy."
"The creation of this huge market would amount to the United States annexing the European Economic Area."
"Decisions would be taken in Washington."
"The United States would not be willing to allow Europe to have its say in decision-making on this issue."
"On the other hand, we could take the view that Europe has things to say on the world stage and a vision to promote of a world order based on the rule of law."
"This vision would entail fairer relations between the North and the South."
"In our view this is important if we are to create a world order that offers everyone greater security."
"If this is what we want to do, this is not the time to toe the line."
"It is the time to promote a common foreign and defence policy."
"There is a paradox here in that Mr Elles said we need to strengthen the common foreign and defence policy while at the same time suggesting we make certain concessions to the United States."
"In my opinion, if we believe we should promote the statute of Rome and an International Criminal Court, if we believe that we should argue for the Kyoto agreements, the non-proliferation treaty and the end of atomic testing, we must assert our independence."
"Relations between the European Union and the United States must be rebuilt on the basis of this independence."
"Our American friends will have to accept this."
"The current US administration will not last forever and I believe that our friendship will win out in the end."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 19 June 2003."
"The next item is a statement by the Commission on elections in Nigeria."
"Madam President, I have the honour today of presenting the EU Observation Mission's final report on the elections in Nigeria, which is being handed out as I speak."
"The report is very extensive and contains a lot of information and many recommendations."
"There is far too much information to sum up in three minutes, but it is all in there for you to read up."
"I would like to mention a few conclusions."
"First of all, it is, I think, important to establish that the Nigerian population, and many of its socially active organisations, greatly value this modern instrument of external EU policy."
"I am in total agreement with the Commissioner on this point."
"It is an effective instrument to promote peace, stability and democracy."
"The EU should be proud of this 'soft power'."
"Secondly, the mission, invited by the Nigerian Government, was the longest and most extensive mission which the EU has ever accomplished."
"I had the privilege of working with a very proficient core team, efficient departments in Brussels and with an enthusiastic observation team comprising over one hundred members."
"The findings of our mission have been widely discussed, both worldwide and within Nigeria."
"The main thing was that we identified the election fraud we discovered for what it actually was, rather than putting it into perspective or concealing it."
"We did not mince our words."
"This, quite simply, was what we owed to the Nigerian electorate."
"Ultimately, we established extensive systematic fraud in six federal states during the governor and presidential elections on 19 April and we discovered serious shortcomings in another five federal states."
"The same happened on 3 May, but then there were seven instead of six."
"Our findings correspond to those of 10 000 national election observers."
"Simply to call this fraud Nigerian fraud is unacceptable and an insult to the Nigerian population."
"It is, in fact, evidence of the over-organisation of those in power and not of underdevelopment."
"If we realise that about half of all the states have electoral problems, this brings into focus the significance of the legal cases which are now being brought before the specially instituted election tribunals."
"It remains a very serious matter that meanwhile, the central and regional INEC - the election council - was unwilling, not allowed or unable, to do anything about the election fraud that was discovered."
"It was, and still is, their task."
"I would ask the Commissioner actively to promote the EU, via the local EU delegation - under the excellent leadership of Leonidas - with the backing of local lawyers' organisations, being given the opportunity of actively following these election tribunals - without any involvement of course, for that is not up to us - and to inform the Council and Parliament accordingly."
"Finally, I should like to ask the Commission to reconsider its aid contract with Nigeria, which affects many states, in such a way - and I am not at all in favour of sanctions or similar action, for that would be wrong - that it becomes possible to shift, as it were, the resources for federal states which will not obtain a democratic structure or new elections - such as the federal state of Ogun - to civilian projects of democratic states."
"May I finally say to the Council that its statement contravened the facts."
"There was a low turnout and few women took part."
"Results showing a high level of participation had simply been falsified."
"The Council should have taken a more professional stance."
"It should speak with one voice."
"This would really be more helpful than engaging in external foreign politics."
"In connection with this debate, I have received five motions for resolutions submitted in accordance with Article 37.2 of the Rules of Procedure"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0097/2003)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Council."
"Mr Ortuondo has the floor for one minute for a point of order."
"Mr President, I would like to refer to Articles 6 and 7 of the European Union Treaty, which indicate, respectively, that that Union is based on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the Rule of Law."
"And that, on the proposal of Parliament or the Commission, the Council can note the existence of a clear risk of serious violation of these principles on the part of a Member State."
"All of this means, from a legal point of view, that the possible violation of freedoms and rights on the part of a State is the competence of the European institutions."
"So I would like to vigorously condemn and protest against the anti democratic and illegal abuse I have received from Mr Pat Cox, President of Parliament, who has refused to include in this part-session two questions which I have presented in relation to two possible violations of the Rules of Law, of human rights and fundamental freedoms by Mr Aznar and his Spanish Government."
"Firstly, because of an apparent lack of respect for the separation of powers, in view of his public statements telling the Spanish Supreme Court that it should agree to the annulment of 240 electoral candidatures which had been legally admitted by the ordinary electoral courts, and secondly for creating a law prohibiting Basque prisoners from studying and taking examinations at the Public University of the Basque Country, the only university that offers education in the Basque language, which may be a violation of the right to linguistic diversity."
"Mr Ortuondo, you will note that you have the right here to raise a point of order which seems to me to be inappropriate given the issues you wish to raise during a Question Time; and I must point out to you that President Cox has decided to comply with the Rules of Procedure, and several paragraphs of the Rules, in relation to Question Time, make it very clear that questions must not contain statements or judgments, which in some cases are rash to say the least."
"I will offer an example which is less dramatic than the one you have chosen to give today; as in football, we have Rules of Procedure; we must obey the Rules of Procedure, because otherwise we are caught off-side."
"There are channels for raising everything you wish to raise, but in accordance with our democratically established Rules of Procedure."
"You may respond, as you request, but please be very brief."
"Mr President, I agree with what you say about the Rules of Procedure."
"I believe I have obeyed them to the letter."
"The President tells me that this issue does not fall within the competence of the Council, but Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty indicate that it falls within the competence of the Council and of Parliament."
"That is why I put the question."
"Secondly, I would like it to be noted that my questions did not contain statements of any type. They are simply questions and the text is there to be read."
"I would like it to be noted that I agree with President Cox's approach, and I believe he has acted in accordance with parliamentary law and the Rules of Procedure."
"Question No 1 by Sarah Ludford (H-0291/03):"
"Subject: Trafficking in human beings"
"EU Ministers in the Council and Heads of State and Government have again urged action against people-trafficking in the declaration of the European conference in Athens on 17 April 2003."
"Why have all Member States not ratified the Protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking to the UN Convention against transnational organised crime?"
"Why has the Council not agreed the proposed Directive on a short-term residents' permit for trafficking victims while they cooperate with prosecution to put the criminal gangs behind bars?"
"Why do some Member States take up to a year to respond to requests from Eastern European countries for legal assistance with prosecutions?"
"Why are there immediate deportations of victims, which catch the countries of origin and international organisations like IOM unaware, as opposed to a coordinated policy of assisted returns?"
"?he Council would remind the honourable Member that, although combating people trafficking is a very important issue to the European Union, it is not expressly mentioned in the declaration by the European Council on 16 April 2003."
"In her question, the honourable Member touches on certain points on which the Council would comment as follows:"
"In its Athens declaration of 16 April 2003, the European Council reiterated the values on which the European Union is based and confirmed its intention to continue to defend fundamental human rights, both inside and outside the European Union."
"The European Council specifically undertook to continue to fight against all types of discrimination, as can be seen from the work which is under way in connection with the fight against racism and xenophobia or even the trade in human organs."
"The ratification of the additional protocol to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime signed in Palermo in December 2000 is a matter of national sovereignty for the states which sign it."
"The Council therefore invites the honourable Member to contact the relevant authorities directly."
"The proposal for a Council directive on short-term residents' permits granted to victims of organised illegal immigration or people trafficking who are working with the competent authorities is the focus of the Council's attention."
"The examination of the directive has commenced and work will continue in conjunction with the various priorities set by the European Council, and the resources available."
"As for the final question, the Council would note that it is not competent to reply on the methods used by the national authorities of the Member States to repatriate persons who have fallen victim to this sort of trafficking."
"Despite the fact that there is no new question, I should like to point out that all the efforts being made at Council level and on the part of the European Commission to develop the policy to combat illegal immigration and organised crime either at a general level or in the case of specific countries, I refer to the Balkans and to other countries too, obviously also has as one of its basic reference points the phenomenon raised by the honourable Member."
"Consequently, through these policies, the objective is precisely to combat these sorts of phenomena, which the Council also accepts are particularly problematic in Europe today and we must do what we can to combat them."
"The Presidency has raised the question of the need to coordinate the Union's policies on illegal immigrants with asylum policy and the need for an integrated policy."
"Decisions have been taken one step at a time over recent months, as they were during the previous Presidency."
"This is a new policy area for the Union."
"We support it and we hope that the issues relating to this phenomenon will also be dealt with efficiently by successive Presidencies."
"Mr President, I would ask you to grant me the minute of patience I require to explain my position in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"Today's agenda contains a question by Mr Sacrédeus - which I support - on the violation of human rights in Cuba."
"It is clear that taking measures to free the political prisoners in Cuba does not fall within the competence of the Council."
"That is clear, but this question has been allowed."
"However, I firstly presented a question on the deaths of protesters caused by US troops in Iraq - thirteen deaths in an Iraqi town - and I was told it contained value judgments."
"I amended the question, in order to remove the value judgments, and once again I am told that it is not admissible, because I asked whether the Council was concerned about the death of protesters, particularly in view of the fact that the US troops are supported by Member States of the European Union."
"I am wondering why a question on Iraq is not admissible but a question on Cuba is - although I consider that question to be legitimate since it is a universal issue."
"Mr President, it seems to me - because this is not the first time this has happened - that there is censorship on Iraq, which is unacceptable."
"In any event, I demand a reply, because I am finding it impossible to raise universal problems in this House which affect us directly."
"In any event, I would like to ask you to explain why this discrimination has taken place, Mr President."
"Mr Nogueira, the President for the sitting does not make any judgment and does not enter into a debate on the questions put by the honourable Members and admitted according to procedure;"
"I am not therefore going to compare your question, which does not appear on the agenda, with the question by Mr Sacrédeus."
"The President of Parliament has taken a decision, you have written to him, you have spoken in plenary about this issue, you have received a reply and you can contact the President of Parliament if you believe it appropriate to do so."
"Iraq has been discussed thoroughly in this Chamber, you refer to the issue; it has been discussed without any censorship; there has naturally been complete freedom of expression for all political groups and Members in the presence of the Council and the Commission, and I would ask you not to turn a point of order into a point of disorder."
"You have said what you believed should be said, you have expressed your view and your words will be recorded in the Minutes."
"Please now allow the Members asking questions to put them."
"This is not a debate about which questions are admitted and which are not."
"It is a debate on the questions which are on the agenda."
"You have 15 seconds to say your final word."
"I would firstly like to ask you to communicate my comments to the President of Parliament and secondly I spoke about the second reply, which is new, and which is for this sitting."
"It is not the previous one, it is a new one, they have rejected a modified question for the second time."
"In any event, I would ask you to communicate my comments to the President of Parliament in their entirety so that he may act accordingly, because I do not wish to create any disorder here."
"I defend the Members' legitimate right to deal with the problems affecting them and, in any event, affecting humanity."
"The President will be aware of your words from the most worthy source: from the Minutes."
"I will not act as messenger; he will know the Minutes and will know exactly what you have said, just as he knows his letters."
"Question No 2 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0292/03):"
"Subject: Network for epidemiological surveillance"
"Decision 2119/98/EC"
"The Extraordinary Council on Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs held on 6 May 2003 approved conclusions in which, having carefully examined the situation regarding Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, both inside the European Union and world-wide, and the different measures taken to address it, confirmed the importance of a quick assessment of the situation and review of future action."
"The Council considers that the network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community has provided a very effective basis for the rapid exchange of information within the EU and for a coordinated response, in which the acceding countries have fully participated."
"The Council recalled that the application of health protection measures falls to the authorities of the Member States, and confirmed the benefits of effective coordination of such measures through the epidemiological surveillance Network Committee."
"It also endorses the orientations for immediate and future actions agreed on 10 April by the epidemiological surveillance Network Committee, which are summarised as follows:"
"rapid detection of all suspect cases of SARS through good surveillance;"
"protection of those at risk of infection from the cases through effective isolation of SARS patients in hospitals, including measures to protect carers;"
"particular attention to be paid to air travel, which has been an important factor in the spread of SARS, notably through standardised screening of passengers leaving affected areas, onboard advice to passengers and effective information at ports of entry from affected areas and"
"the particular importance of raising awareness among professionals and the public and the timely and accurate reporting and sharing of information with other countries, in particular the ?EA/?FTA countries, acceding and candidate countries and with the WHO."
"Cooperation should also be developed with other partners, such as airline companies."
"The Council urges the Member States and the acceding countries to implement effectively the orientations for immediate and future actions by the Network Committee and contribute actively to setting up a specific expert group on SARS under the Network Committee to develop common modalities and advice on health measures across Europe."
"The Council underlined the need for continued cooperation between the Member States, the Commission and the WHO and called on the Member States to ensure, inter alia:"
"prompt and effective identification of all suspect and probable SARS cases, and their appropriate isolation in hospitals;"
"appropriate protection of hospital personnel treating the patients;"
"provision of guidance and information to health care workers and the public;"
"measures, consistent throughout the European Union, to provide and acquire information and traceabilty of international travellers arriving or in transit from affected areas;"
"timely and accurate reporting and sharing information with the Commission, WHO, other countries and other partners (for example, airline companies)."
"Finally, the Council encourages the Commission to"
"continue coordinating EU action on SARS;"
"keep the orientations for immediate and future actions under regular review, notably in the light of advice from the WHO;"
"consider developing a general preparedness plan on communicable diseases and health threats;"
"coordinate and network laboratory expertise;"
"financially support research and development of validated diagnostic tests, therapeutic interventions, and vaccines."
"The Council reviewed the situation and developments at its meeting on 2 June 2003, took note of the Commission's progress report on recent developments in connection with SARS and exchanged views on the current situation."
"All the Member States approved the Commission report and the initiatives taken or planned in this area."
"The Presidency emphasised the importance of coordinating the exchange of information at European level, given the cross-border nature of SARS."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"My question was put before it had even been decided to convene the Council of Ministers for Health in May and I wish to say that the President-in-Office's reply was so full and extensive that it obviates the need to ask a second question."
"Question No 3 by Bernd Posselt (H-0300/03):"
"Subject: EU/Ukraine"
"How does the Council view the current state of relations between the EU and Ukraine, and what initiatives has the Presidency undertaken to intensify cooperation with the Black Sea states?"
"The Union is closely monitoring developments in the Ukraine and recognises Ukraine's achievements over recent years in establishing itself as an independent, democratic European country with a market economy."
"The Ukraine is an important strategic partner and will soon become a neighbouring country of the ?U. The Union is dealing positively with Ukraine's European aims, but underlines that the development of relations between the ?U and the Ukraine depends, among other things, on the favourable outcome of continuing internal reforms."
"The new coalition government and cooperation between the majority and the opposition in the Ukrainian parliament in certain legislative sectors can be seen as positive signs."
"The government and the parliament are working together to adapt national legislation to the acquis communautaire."
"However, a great deal still needs to be done."
"In particular, reforms are needed in the fields of the mass media and the judiciary."
"The situation regarding arms exports, including Kolchuga, still needs to be clarified."
"Ukraine's candidacy for the WTO is an important step in the development of the country, but the rules of the WTO need to be kept and applied."
"Within these frameworks, policies and important structural reforms are still outstanding."
"Cooperation between the ?U and the Ukraine is based on the partnership and cooperation agreement which introduces the legal framework for cooperation in a broad range of sectors;"
"I would especially mention, among other things, energy, trade and investments, justice and internal affairs, legislative rapprochement, the environment, transport and regional and cross-border cooperation."
"The ?U will continue to provide assistance within the framework of the TACIS programme, based on the priorities agreed between the two parties."
"With the 'Wider Europe' initiative, the ?U has made an important step as regards strengthening cooperation with the Ukraine, which is a neighbour following enlargement."
"Within the framework of this initiative, a clear action programme is defined as regards medium-term neighbourly relations with the Union, with a view to promoting policies for political rapprochement and the gradual joint completion of social and economic structures and increasing political, economic and cultural momentum, on the basis of common values."
"The competent Council services are drafting specific measures in order to implement this initiative."
"The Union vigorously supports regional cooperation in Europe and beyond and is urging the Black Sea states to promote good neighbourly relations through the Black Sea Economic Cooperation pact."
"This regional organisation provides important momentum, thereby contributing to a considerable degree to the implementation of the stability pact for south-eastern Europe."
"By promoting economic cooperation as a means of preventing conflict, this organisation seeks to resolve conflicts peacefully on the basis of the principles of the OSCE."
"The Union notes these developments with satisfaction and supports the integration of the participating states in the European economy."
"Mr President, thank you for your very sound answer."
"Even before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Bavaria maintained a close partnership with Ukraine and my colleague Mr Radwan and I have just given a massive boost to trade with Ukraine."
"Trade and business need a framework, however."
"For this reason, I would like to raise two quite specific questions: first, to what extent is the TACIS Programme being intensified, with a focus on institution building and training up a new, younger generation of executives to work in the government, the judiciary and the administration?"
"This, after all, is where the shortage is greatest, and the reason why the economy is unable to function."
"The framework for the rule of law is not functioning."
"My second specific question, Mr President, concerns the geostrategic situation that you mentioned."
"Here, of course, the countries in the southern Caucasus play an important role, although they will not be direct neighbours of the EU."
"I wanted to ask you what the role of the southern Caucasus is in terms of cooperation with the Black Sea states?"
"Institution building is indeed a very basic element for progress and reform in these countries."
"However, I hope that the honourable Member understands that institution building also has to do with internal efforts by each country to respond to the needs of reform."
"A programme such as TACIS or any programme can, at most, have an auxiliary role in this direction."
"I cannot give an answer straight away as to whether it will be intensified from the economic point of view."
"I gladly reserve the right to reply in writing."
"As far as the Caucasus is concerned, the Presidency has noted the particular importance of the countries in the Caucasus and the need for us to develop our cooperation and our relations with these countries."
"However, these countries have a great many problems and closer rapprochement with the countries in the Caucasus is a long-term plan, I believe, in the Union's foreign policy."
"I trust that this effort will be made by successive Presidencies, just as we have made certain moves in this direction during our Presidency, because we really do believe it is of value."
"I wish to ask the Greek Presidency how the Council views the fact that Ukraine is a dangerous country for journalists to operate in."
"I also wonder how the Council views the fact that the fate of ten journalists, including that of Georgij Gongadze who is critical of the government, remains unknown and uninvestigated."
"As you know, we have no knowledge of the fate of certain journalists in the Ukraine."
"I cannot answer generally as to whether it is dangerous for journalists to work there; however, it is particularly worrying that such incidents occur."
"It is an issue which was also noted in the public statements made at the press conference which I gave together with the High Representative, Mr Solana, when we visited the Ukraine within the framework of cooperation relations, during the meeting we had at troika level a few months ago."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is your assessment of Ukraine's efforts with regard to the World Trade Organisation?"
"I cannot proceed to evaluate efforts by the Ukraine in relation to the World Trade Organisation."
"Please submit your question to the Commission."
"Without wanting to pass judgment on the questions you put, I would ask all the honourable Members to put supplementary questions, which are strictly related to the question asked, because some of them do not seem to be supplementary, and the President-in-Office of the Council knows that, in the event that they are not supplementary, he is not obliged to reply."
"Question No 4 by Ioannis Marinos (H-0309/03):"
"Subject: Problem of funding GALILEO"
"According to a report published in the Financial Times on 28 April 2003, GALILEO - the ambitious European satellite programme - will be delayed further because of a funding dispute."
"The report states that on 25 April 2003 there was a European Space Agency (ESA) meeting which failed to agree on the release of EUR 550 million from the ESA for funding the project."
"How can the Council convince the peoples of Europe, among others, that the EU has the political will to achieve ever more ambitious and expensive objectives, such as the Union's common defence policy, when programmes such as GALILEO, which is supposed to have been planned in order to make the European Union independent from the USA's satellite infrastructure, continue to suffer from deadlocks?"
"The Council attaches particular importance to the implementation of the Galileo programme under optimum conditions."
"The Council welcomes the agreement which has finally been reached between the Member States of the European Space Agency and which also puts an end to the Agency's difficulties to date as regards the cofinancing of the Galileo programme, thereby making it possible to continue the programme and allay the concerns of the partners that have proceeded to make, and will continue to make, important investments in time, manpower and financial resources for studies, designs and programmes at the pre-development stage."
"Similarly, the Council wishes to point out that it is not authorised to intervene in decisions by an intergovernmental agency such as the European Space Agency, even if the large majority of the countries which participate in it (13 out of the 15 members) are also members of the European Union."
"Mr President, I asked this question before this agreement came along, which paves the way for the implementation of this very important programme, and I am delighted that this has happened under the Greek Presidency, given that I am Greek, and I also have a great deal of respect for the President-in-Office who has replied to me."
"As this obstacle has been removed, I should like to ask the honourable President-in-Office to tell us what he calculates will be the amount invested in Galileo, if all the Member States of the European Union will take part in it and in what proportion, when the procedure to promote implementation will commence and when he calculates that it will start to provide its services, which is the most important, and if they will be of only European and/or worldwide range."
"Similarly, I should like to ask him to tell us if the objections of the United States have been answered and if, in fact, as the American side maintains, there will be a danger of Galileo interfering with the American GPS frequencies, which in fact give priority to military requirements."
"I cannot reply to all these details straight away."
"These are Commission issues."
"There are various evaluations which have been discussed from time to time and evaluations by independent researchers."
"I would ask the honourable Member to put this question to the Commission."
"I will gladly forward in writing any information which the Council has at its disposal, which answers the question he has raised."
"Mr President, I hope my question is addressed to the Council, because Member States still have authority over matters of foreign and security policy."
"I would like to point out at this juncture that although GALILEO is primarily a private-sector project, and one in which we also want to have private-sector services, in a common project for a stronger European Union foreign and security policy we should be setting the course now to ensure that in future infrastructure services and information services will be available and can be purchased at European level."
"Up to now, unfortunately, we have not had the infrastructure."
"We talk about a rapid reaction force, and in order to be able to act in future in the area of foreign policy, we must be able to rely on GALILEO."
"This is why a line should be made available here, and this is certainly something that is also in the interests of the Council."
"I agree that Galileo also has a political dimension, which is why it has also been promoted by the Council."
"Nonetheless, the Galileo programme also has a very strong commercial dimension and I would like to point out that the Council is, nonetheless, interested in its progressing, its being able to withstand competitive and economic conditions on the market and its remaining viable."
"Question No 5 by Paulo Casaca (H-0312/03):"
"Subject: List of terrorist organisations"
"As the person responsible for the disarmament of the Iranian armed resistance, the People's Mujahedeen, General Odierno declared (Agence France Presse on 11.5.2003) that the group's cooperation with the US forces and its commitment to democracy in Iran meant that its status as a 'terrorist organisation' in Washington would have to be reviewed."
"He added that an organisation which gives up its arms in favour of the alliance is clearly cooperating and that this should lead to reconsideration as to whether or not the Mujahedeen are a terrorist organisation."
"This is further confirmation of the fact that there are no grounds for considering the People's Mujahedeen a terrorist organisation."
"When does the Council intend to remove the People's Mujahedeen from the list of terrorist organisations?"
"I agree with Article 1, paragraph 6 of common position 2001/931/CFSP on the application of special measures to combat terrorism."
"The names of persons, groups and agencies included on the list are re-examined by the Council at regular intervals of at least every six months, in order to confirm that there are reasons for their inclusion on this list."
"During the last re-examination, I can inform you that the Council confirmed the inclusion on the list of the Iranian organisation Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, also known as the People's Mujahedeen."
"I thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, but you have only said what we all knew already."
"What you did not explain, and what I would like you to explain now, is how an organisation that has never been found guilty or even accused of any terrorist crime or any other crime on European soil can be included on this list, whilst Iran, for example, one of whose diplomats has already been convicted by a German court for committing a terrorist attack, does not appear on the list and is actually encouraging the proscription of organisations that oppose it and naming them as terrorists."
"This is the problem and I would like the Council to give its opinion and an explanation to Parliament and to Europe's citizens."
"The Council has judged, on the basis of an evaluation of all the factors, that this organisation should be included on the list."
"Similarly, I should like to point out that this evaluation was based on information given to the Member States in accordance with the procedures provided for and that there is a collective decision on this matter."
"The Council's response is of some interest in that it is rather hard to understand the criteria the Council uses to judge whether or not an organisation should or should not be deemed a terrorist organisation."
"I think that the rules of due process, of fair legal proceedings, should at least allow the various organisations to have the right to resort to the courts."
"Parliament is entitled to be informed of the dossier the Council used to make its decision."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I therefore have some very specific questions for you."
"Would the Council be willing to supply the European Parliament with the documents detailing the charges levelled against all the groups you consider to be terrorist organisations?"
"Would you also be prepared to define the criteria you applied in establishing whether or not the group was a terrorist organisation?"
"As we are aware, Russia has just requested that three Chechen groups be added to the list of terrorist organisations, although two of these groups are in fact completely non-existent."
"This is a particularly interesting case, incidentally."
"The common position to which I referred makes provision for all the criteria which are taken into account in order to enter names, agencies or persons on this list."
"I should like to remind you that decisions on who is to be included on the list are taken by officials of the judiciary who are independent of each Member State of the European Union and who provide all the guarantees of a correct judgment on the matter, because this is indeed a very delicate matter."
"Mr President, this second response is wholly unconvincing: we know full well that there are absolutely no clear procedures for inclusion on the list of terrorist organisations."
"Mr Dupuis has asked quite clearly to be informed of the procedures which exist for appealing against inclusion on the list."
"The truth is that the only criterion for either inclusion on or removal from the list is political judgment."
"We therefore need to ask the question again."
"We are simply asking the Council to give an opinion on this political judgment, this new political development: is it such a major political change as to really justify reviewing the role of the organisation?"
"I have nothing to add to what I have said."
"The criteria and procedures are provided for and are clear."
"The competent agency judged that it should remain on the list and, consequently, I have no criticism to make of that."
"Question No 6 by Lennart Sacrédeus (H-0313/03):"
"Subject: Violation of human rights in Cuba"
"In March this year, 78 opposition figures were imprisoned in Cuba."
"Summary trials with no chance of a proper defence or the presence of independent individuals were held in April, followed by sentences of 15 and 28 years."
"The prisoners are now serving their sentences under inhuman conditions, in solitary confinement or together with hardened criminals, most often so far from home as to make visits by relatives impossible."
"These conditions are clearly a violation of human rights."
"What does the Council intend to do to secure the release of political prisoners in Cuba?"
"What is the Council doing to ensure that the treatment of the Cuban prisoners improves and that they are moved nearer to home?"
"What steps will the Council take to support the prisoners and their relatives?"
"What consequences will these jail sentences have in terms of further negotiations concerning Cuba's possible membership of the ACP?"
"As the Council replied to question ?-0243/03 at Question Time during the May part-session of the European Parliament, as soon as the recent wave of arrests came to light, the Presidency, on behalf of the European Union, issued public statements and proceeded with intense demarches towards Havana."
"In their bilateral contacts with the Cuban authorities, the Member States also protested strongly about the arrests and executions."
"The Council welcomes the resolution by the European Parliament of 10 April reinforcing the Union's clear stand against these measures."
"At its meeting on 14 April, the Council approved the following conclusions:"
"'The Council condemns the recent actions of the Cuban authorities, notably the executions, the large-scale arrests of dissidents, the unfair trials and the arbitrary and excessive sentences imposed."
"It calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners."
"These latest developments which mark a further deterioration in the Human Rights situation in Cuba will affect the EU's relationship with Cuba and the prospects for increased cooperation."
"The Council will keep the situation under close review.'"
"The Union also supported resolutions on the human rights situation in Cuba passed within the framework of the 59th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights."
"As a general comment, the Presidency of the Union issued the following declaration stating that the ?U condemns the large-scale arrests, the unfair summary trials and the arbitrary and excessive sentences imposed on numerous dissidents for peacefully expressing their political, religious and social opinions and because they were exercising their right to take full and equal part in public life."
"Consequently, the ?U demands that those persons, whom it considers prisoners of conscience, be released without delay and also calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners."
"It is also deeply concerned at the continuing repression of members of the opposition."
"The ?U roundly condemns the recent executions of Cuban citizens carried out following summary trials and expresses its regret that the moratorium on the death penalty in the country has come to an end."
"These latest developments, which mark a further deterioration in the human rights situation in the country, will affect the ?U's relationship with Cuba and the prospects for increased cooperation."
"The ?U will monitor violations of personal and political rights, which continue to affect the Union's relationship with Cuba, very closely."
"The ?U will continue to keep the situation under close review, especially as regards the possible exercise of legal recourse for the 78 persons convicted."
"I should also like to point out that the Union is continuing to make efforts to get the political prisoners released immediately and to ensure that, in the meantime, they are not suffering or being treated inhumanely."
"As far as Cuba's application to accede to the Cotonou Agreement is concerned, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs withdrew its application on 17 May."
"I have nothing further to add."
"I have taken note of the honourable Member's proposal and we shall see if this can be done."
"I thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"One month ago we held the same debate, and I would now like to take it a little further."
"After more than a month, the repression continues in Cuba and the situation remains more or less the same, which is proof that we must go beyond statements of condemnation."
"These are important but are not enough and we have a particular responsibility because we awarded the 2002 Sakharov Prize to Osvaldo Payá."
"This is the time for us to show that the Sakharov Prize is not a nice school prize; it is not a moment of 'glamour' like the Hollywood Oscars. It represents a commitment given by the European Union, through its Parliament, to the cause of democracy, human rights and freedom throughout the world."
"Eleven of our fellow Members, myself included, have sent a letter to the President of the Council, the High Representative, the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament, asking them to work together to invite Mr Payá to come here and for the Council to draft a recommendation to this effect to all Member States for their ambassadors in Havana to do the same and invite Mr Payá to come to Europe, to visit our capitals, our ministers, our prime ministers and the President of the Commission and, in the international limelight, tell us the tragedy of what is happening in Cuba."
"This is an active way of our expressing solidarity, and of showing that the prizes we award here have real meaning."
"Who sent it?"
"Nothing else has come to my attention; consequently, I have no specific answer to give you at this moment in time."
"Mr President, I am surprised that the MEP who asked the question has come out in support of the people arrested and tried, because they were demonstrably cooperating, in return for payment, with the representative of the United Nations in Havana against their country, against socialist Cuba, which is a beacon, a shining example for the peoples of America and which, despite forty years of criminal embargo by the United States, manages to provide its people with the highest standard of living and education in the whole of Central and South America."
"This is, in fact, what the American imperialists cannot forgive the Cuban revolution and they are striving to overturn it by every possible means, including assassinating its leaders."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council who, from what I have heard, agrees with everything the previous speakers have said: What would the government of his country do if it were discovered that Greek citizens had agreed to be recruited and paid by a foreign power hostile to Greece in order to act against their country?"
"Perhaps it would have awarded them a prize?"
"How does this activity stand in relation to the exercise of human rights?"
"What comments does he have on the fact that the conspiratorial meetings organised by the US representative in Havana are also attended by Greece's diplomatic representative?"
"How does he justify the silence of the European Union about the Cubans being held in the United States because they uncovered plans to assassinate Fidel Castro and other Cuban leaders, and the failure to extradite to Cuba the Cuban hijackers who are now circulating freely in the United States?"
"For the rest, we are fighting to combat terrorism."
"Mr President, to start with, this is not a question to which I shall reply."
"I shall reply to one, not as the President-in-Office, but as the minister for foreign affairs of the Greek Government."
"You referred to the involvement of a diplomat in conspiratorial and other types of activity."
"It is altogether both comical and misleading, when you must have been told that I replied to a similar question by a member of your party in the Greek Government, when I said that it is ridiculous, at a reception given at the embassy in Cuba, the American embassy, where receptions are held every week by various and sundry people, and everyone goes here and there, to translate..."
"(interruption off the microphone by Mr Korakas)"
"Please do not interrupt... you are not worthy of a reply!"
"Mr President, how dare Mr Yiannitsis say I am not worthy of a reply."
"I have asked burning questions."
"His government is also guilty and should reply with greater respect to the questions I put to him."
"Mr Yiannitsis said initially that you had not asked him a question and that he was not therefore going to reply as President-in-Office of the Council."
"I believe we must follow the agenda with the calm habitual during this sitting."
"Question No 7 by Claude Moraes (H-0321/03):"
"Subject: Thessaloniki June Council meeting"
"Will the Council please give its view of the agenda of the June Council meeting in Thessaloniki?"
"Will the meeting discuss the question of EU border police, policing resources for the new EU external borders post-enlargement, coordination of integration issues in relation to migrants, and the issue of coordination of managed economic migration?"
"We referred extensively to the agenda for the Thessaloniki Council at this morning's debate."
"However, I should like to add that, as this concerns the first version of the annotated agenda, which was also submitted to the recent meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, the Presidency intends to limit the agenda for the European Council in Thessaloniki to the following items:"
"results of the Convention on the Future of Europe and decisions for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference;"
"asylum, immigration and borders, which are all interrelated;"
"enlargement issues;"
"the question of EU policy in the Western Balkans;"
"Wider Europe, New Neighbourhood;"
"work following on from the spring 2003 European Council and, finally"
"certain issues in the fields of external relations and security and defence."
"These items may be included in EU-USA relations: the Middle East and Iraq and recommendations by the High Representative, Mr Solana, on an overall strategy in the field of foreign policy and security, together with a wider strategy to deal with the spread of weapons of mass destruction."
"The General Affairs and External Relations Council noted these intentions on the part of the Presidency."
"As far as the issues touched on in the second part of the question are concerned, the honourable Member will know that the European Council has to examine two important reports."
"The first is on the actual application of the guidelines agreed at the European Council in Seville on measures relating to illegal immigration, the more flexible introduction of coordinated and integrated external border management, the incorporation of immigration policy into the Union's relations with third countries and the speeding up of the legislative work to formulate a common policy on asylum and immigration issues."
"The second report examines the efficiency of common financing resources available for the repatriation of immigrants and asylum seekers who have been rejected, for the management of external borders, for programmes in the field of asylum and immigration in third countries and for the application of the principle of the distribution of burdens."
"Our aim is for the Council to examine these two reports so that the European Council can issue guidelines for further action in these sectors."
"Within this framework, it is expected that, in accordance with the conclusions of the spring 2003 Council, the European Council will re-examine the issue of immigration, the integration of legal immigrants into European society and employment."
"Finally, the Presidency would remind you that the agenda for the Thessaloniki Council will be approved, in accordance with the Council's rules of procedure, by the General Affairs and External Relations Council at its meeting on 16 and 17 June 2003."
"The question was put on a personal basis."
"I can reply both personally and as the Greek Presidency."
"This does not mean that my reply reflects the position of the 15."
"As you know, there are countries which consider that these issues - relating to the integration of immigrants, in other words - are internal issues."
"On the other hand, however, failure to integrate immigrants living, in their millions no less, in the Member States of the European Union, often causes particularly acute social situations and these often also have serious repercussions at political level, with highly undesirable consequences."
"Given that the European model - this social, political and economic model - is characterised by internal social convergence which perhaps is hard to find in many other countries of the world and, consequently, we need to keep it as a very basic element both for our countries and our continent, I personally consider that, on the issue of the integration of immigrants, there must also be coordination of policies at Community level, because any serious social and political tension in one country is something that is also of particular importance to the other countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to make a brief comment regarding my question 3 concerning Ukraine: it goes without saying that this is a matter for the European Union, because the accession of Russia and Ukraine to the WTO has consequences affecting this and this will probably also be a topic for discussion at the Council in Thessaloniki."
"My question concerning the Thessaloniki Council, however, is this: the Council called for an impact study to be carried out on Basle II, the framework agreement on the creditworthiness of businesses."
"The Commission has not yet done this."
"At the last sitting you promised me you would takes steps to this effect."
"What has happened here as regards the Council's enquiry or as regards the Council's cooperation with the Commission?"
"Are there plans to undertake such a study?"
"This issue concerns the Commission and, provided the Commission submits the study, of course we shall see how we can take it into account for Thessaloniki."
"As the author is not present, Question No 8 lapses."
"Question No 9 by Richard Howitt (H-0325/03):"
