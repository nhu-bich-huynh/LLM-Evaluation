"It is a myth that only certain people are affected."
"It is moreover a dangerous myth which we usually believe to protect us from recognizing the problem. Many people say 'it won't happen to me' until they come across the problem in their own close family or circle of friends."
"Often it is fear, shame, silence and feelings of guilt which are the greatest allies of violence."
"Violence against women is a hidden crime, and if our battle against it is to succeed, we must make the violence visible."
"Only then will we have the chance to bring about change."
"This battle must be fought on all levels."
"We need laws which protect women and punish the perpetrators, whether they are husbands, pimps or rapists."
"We also need preventative work by voluntary organizations, etcetera."
"Often these organisations seem closer and easier to contact than the authorities."
"For that reason, we in the Socialist Group have also decided to support these organizations and include them in the report."
"Attacks on women affect all of us. We must work for the safety of women in Europe."
"I would also like to support Mrs Eriksson in her request to be allowed to present her oral amendment in this part-session."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, of course acts of violence against women are a result of a complex of reasons, of a system of values and actions tolerated by society and its institutions."
"Violence against women would not exist without the connivance of each individual man and without society's tolerance for each individual act of violence. It represents the most widespread violation of human rights worldwide."
"The latest UNICEF statistics on abuse of women are shocking. Shocking details are given about the abuse of women in the United States of America, in India, and in Africa - where 2 million women a year are sexually mutilated while 130 million have suffered horrendous torture."
"But we cannot regard ourselves as beyond reproach in Europe either."
"The latest horrifying data from Belgium confirm that."
"Research has shown that in the west, as in the east, few women reach adulthood without having undergone some form of violence, indecent assault, rape, incest, sexual harassment, beatings or even torture."
"However, violence against women does not manifest itself only through physical abuse."
"Other serious forms of violence are: discrimination and sexual harassment faced by women in the workplace and their virtual exclusion from public office and from political decision-making centres; the commonplace refusal of men to support their children morally and materially after divorce; the abuse of women through advertising and the media; pornography and prostitution."
"Of course violence against women is a wall of shame in our male-dominated society and action must be taken at an individual, collective and institutional level to eradicate it."
"So a massive Europe-wide campaign is needed and sufficient resources must be made available."
"The ECU 3 million that were made available during 1997 on the occasion of the events in Belgium are obviously not enough to tackle the phenomenon."
"We need services to provide aid and shelter, special units for the eradication of the crime of violence against women and children, a campaign of information, programmes of prevention, research and studies on the economic and social costs of male violence."
"I support the motion of the rapporteur to designate 1999 as European Year Against Violence Against Women and I congratulate her on her recommendation."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, oppression and discrimination against women have been the order of the day for far too long."
"It is time to match action to the many words and do something about the problems."
"So it is gratifying that we have now allocated ECU 3 million a year to combat violence against women."
"Violence against women is the brutal and unhappy consequence of a lack of equality between the two sexes, and the fact that there is still a great deal of violence against women in today's Europe is a sign that there is still a long way to go before we have a society where the two sexes have the same rights and opportunities."
"So to combat violence against women, it is absolutely necessary to work for more equality on a broad front."
"I would also like to make a few comments on the next report."
"The lack of equality between men and women is most noticeable in the world of advertising."
"In that world a woman is still a stay-at-home housewife or a sex object."
"All too often advertising agencies crudely attempt to entice people to buy products with the help of pictures of naked or semi-naked women."
"It is degrading both for the women who appear in the advertisements and for those who are forced to look at them."
"And it contributes to maintaining an outdated pattern of sexual roles."
"The world is getting smaller and smaller these days."
"Cross-border media such as satellite TV and the Internet are increasing in importance."
"So we need international rules in this area, unless the sector begins to practice self-regulation."
"If the advertising agencies are incapable of drawing the line themselves, we politicians must intervene, and in that context we are sending an important signal from this Parliament by adopting the reports by Mrs Eriksson and Mrs Lenz."
"To make further progress and combat violence against women, more of our male colleagues ought to have shown solidarity by being present in the House during this debate."
"It would have become them."
"Mr President, violence against women is a major social problem."
"It is basically a human rights issue."
"Violence against women is the most extreme expression of the lack of equality which exists between women and men."
"Physical violence is one of several strategies of oppression."
"Put simply, it is a question of men's power over women."
"I therefore welcome the fact that today the European Parliament is devoting a proper debate to this important issue, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Eriksson, on her thorough report."
"For a long time violence against women was looked on as something private."
"The general view was that women who were beaten and raped were themselves to blame."
"The situation has now changed."
"Now violence against women is internationally seen as a real problem."
"The Vienna Conference on Human Rights in 1993 established that human rights are also women's rights."
"This represented a real breakthrough and led, among other things, to a special rapporteur being appointed on the issue of violence against women."
"The United Nations Conference in Beijing also took up the question of violence against women."
"The Beijing Platform maintains that violence against women is an obstacle to achieving the goals of equality, development and peace."
"In 1993 the UN General Assembly adopted a declaration on the abolition of violence against women."
"In the resolution, the General Assembly stresses that violence against women means that women are being forced into a subordinate position relative to men."
"The issue has also been raised in other international contexts."
"In this regard I would like to praise the European Parliament for the work it has done in this area."
"As early as 1986 Parliament took up the question of women and violence in a special report."
"This has been followed up by several resolutions and now we have the Eriksson report on a campaign against violence against women."
"It is an important report."
"I would particularly like to emphasize the excellent proposal that 1999 be designated European Year Against Violence Against Women."
"Mrs Eriksson, I sincerely hope that the Committee on Women's Rights takes the initiative for a special budget item next time so that we also get the resources to be able to finance and jointly implement that year."
"The problem needs to be highlighted and explained before progress can be made."
"A campaign is one way to get public opinion behind action against violence."
"Action against violence against women must take place simultaneously in different areas and on different levels."
"We must ensure that we help women who have been subjected to violence and support the voluntary organizations working in this area."
"Everywhere, women's organizations have been the first to have set up homes for battered wives and support them and their children."
"When we discuss violence against women we should not forget the role which men have."
"We concentrate on the women because they are the victims."
"But women are not the source of the actual problem."
"When I was the Minister for Equal Opportunities in the Swedish government, I realised that we would make no further progress on equality if we did not involve men too."
"I therefore set up a men's group which used seminars and studies to encourage men themselves to start discussing the role of men."
"It turned out very well and led to increased interest among men in discussing their own role in relation to women and children."
"Of course, this is also important at European level."
"We need more research into men and violence."
"We also need men's groups which themselves tackle the question of their own male role."
"Let me stress that the Commission will continue to do what it can within its powers to combat violence against women."
"The modern slave trade in women is one form of violence I have done a lot of work on in recent years."
"Increasing numbers of young women are being brought from the countries in central and eastern Europe to western Europe to be forced into prostitution."
"It is a serious problem involving large sums of money."
"Trafficking in women has clearly become a lucrative business for international organized crime."
"Since I presented the action plan against the slave trade, we have been working on a broad front."
"We are making efforts under the third pillar, but also in other areas."
"The slave trade in women, like all violence against women, is a problem we must tackle from several directions at once."
"We now have a number of projects under way in the Stop Programme."
"These are aimed at judges, lawyers and others who, in their work, come into contact with women who are victims of the slave trade and sexual exploitation."
"The aim is to increase awareness and knowledge of the problem and to learn from each other."
"We have ECU 6.5 million for the programme which runs from 1996 to the year 2000."
"Also in the European Drug Unit, the basis for Europol, which has not yet been ratified by the Member States, a project is under way to prevent trafficking in women."
"This year, thanks to the initiative of this Parliament, we have also been able to set up the Daphne programme."
"As you know, this is intended for voluntary organizations working with issues of violence against children, adolescents and women."
"All of us who have worked on these issues for many years know that women who are victims of violence often prefer to turn to a voluntary organization than to the authorities."
"We have had a good response, and the day before yesterday I received a summary of all the projects which are now ready to be implemented."
"A second round of applications is also taking place out in the community."
"We will soon be able to start projects to support women and children who have become victims of violence."
"We have projects for immigrant women, for cooperation between the police and women's organizations with regard to female rape victims, for the setting up networks and exchanging experiences and models of good practice."
"Men's groups are also included in the latter project. I hope that the pilot project within Daphne will provide useful experience for everyone working against violence against women and children to build on."
"I hope Parliament will continue to support this initiative so that we can continue the practical and concrete work on a broad front."
"Obviously, the need is great."
"If we have the money, we can also make important contributions of this kind."
"Many of the recommendations in Mrs Eriksson's report are directed at the Member States."
"It is important that continuous work takes place both locally and nationally."
"At the same time we are studying with interest the recommendations directed at the Commission."
"It is important for the Commission to work actively against violence against women and for this to be done in a way which complements the work of the Member States."
"As I said earlier, I think that the proposal for a European Year Against Violence Against Women is an idea which deserves full support."
"It would focus attention on the issue of violence against women and also provide real support for all those within authorities and voluntary organizations who work against violence."
"Mr President, now that the debate is over, I have a small request. It is freezing in this Chamber and I hope this is not part of some strategy to keep the women super-cool during this debate on women, and stop them getting too heated."
"But could you please do something about the temperature?"
"Mrs Larive, the services responsible have heard what you said and I trust they will act as soon as possible."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12.00 noon."
"Discrimination against women in advertising"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Lenz (A4-0258/97), on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, on discrimination against women in advertising."
"Mr President, to return once more to women."
"This, too, is a question of discrimination: this time it is discrimination against women in advertising."
"Take the example of a distiller's advertisement: a picture of a woman - and a black one, at that - caught in a net, with the caption: ' Wouldn't you like to open it right now?"
"Which one, the bottle?'."
"The European Parliament's Committee on Women's' Rights has opened the bottle labelled 'Discrimination against Women in Advertising' ."
"There have been a number of articles on just how close the report has come to striking at the sensitivities of the advertising profession."
"Actually, this has always happened, even when we presented a report about women and the media ten years ago and it contained a section called 'Women and Advertising' ."
"Surprisingly, the first words of criticism came from the ranks of the German Advertising Council, even though it was itself responsible for control. Compared with international standards these instances were not bad, as is shown by the examples it quoted for criticism or condemnation."
"Are these cracks in expensive monoliths?"
"I think the question is justified."
"Over the years, advertising has become both more strident and more earthy."
"The examples make that clear. The depiction of women - and of men too, as I have seen - which many women perceive as debasing, and which frequently bears no relation to the product being advertised, or is punctuated by more or less offensive remarks, is simply hurtful to women."
"It encourages either discrimination against women as available sex objects or, in less harmful cliché situations, a role for women which is unacceptable in the modern world."
"The majority of protests to advertising standards bodies concern pictures of women, and the fact that only few official reprimands have been issued is not significant: 90 % of the pictures criticized were previously withdrawn."
"In recent weeks we have learned just how the media push ahead, and no end is in sight."
"We cannot act as if there were always a clear division between such things."
"Women's rights are human rights."
"Both the Beijing Women's World Conference and, in particular, the Vienna Human Rights Conference have shown that."
"National advertising laws and advertising control organizations in individual Member States are very different."
"National and EU legislation does not protect against unworthy depiction of women in media content."
"Television guidelines, for instance, give no definition of gender discrimination."
"The increase in cross-border broadcasting of commercials and the depiction of violence raise new challenges to for traditional advertising control mechanisms."
"The report calls for greater clarity and recommends closing gaps in national advertising control, convergence in advertising controls across the European Union, and long term evolution of the existing amalgamation of European advertising control bodies into a genuine European control organization."
"The report also recommends the creation of an advisory European Media Council consisting of representatives from the European Commission and the European advertising industry, which could draft a code against discrimination in advertising."
"Incidentally, that is something which has certainly been raised before in this House."
"The proposal for an ethics committee under each national television council also falls within this context."
"We should also like to urge, as we have done before, the establishment of a prize for the best European advertisement meeting our standards, in order to develop a realistic image of women."
"Women in advertising should also make an effort to gain greater influence over the production and decision-making processes, and establish alternative agencies producing innovative advertising. They would thus contribute to a gradual transformation of the image of women in advertising along the lines of the variety, originality and creativity of modern woman, and to a final goodbye to the myth that naked flesh makes the best salesman."
"We are aware that this report will not please everyone, and I also know that this is a sensitive area. But we on the Committee on Women's Rights - and we have also heard from many others this morning - should take up these themes and make people aware that these things must no longer happen."
"There are so many ways of depicting women - their variety, their abilities."
"The advertising profession, with its budgets of millions and billions, should also give that a thought."
"Mr President, women are not goods for anyone to buy, although that is sometimes the impression given."
"It is not the product, but naked flesh that is displayed for advertising purposes."
"As long ago as 1995 I tabled an amendment calling for a report investigating discrimination against women in advertising."
"The Committee on Women's Rights has taken steps to achieve this in its Lenz Report."
"We are not concerned with morals, I want to make that quite clear, and certainly not with censorship; we do not wish to censor the advertising profession, but to ensure that certain minimum standards for the protection of women's dignity are maintained."
"We are concerned with the implementation of the UN agreement banning all discrimination against women."
"We need a code of conduct - Mrs Lenz described it - that goes further than self-regulation within the advertising profession."
"In a market of over ECU 250 billion worldwide, the danger is it will exceed all bounds, disgusting pictures and naked flesh will be shown, and anything will be justified as long as it brings in a slice of the cake."
"However, we saw the power of women consumers In the case of a worldwide mineral water producer in Belgium."
"The company had displayed three bare-breasted women on huge billboards, with just their nipples covered by the firm's bottletops."
"As a result of protests from the Committee on Women's Rights and a threatened boycott by European women's associations the advertisement was withdrawn by the firm."
"As I said, women consumers have considerable power."
"But we in Parliament also have considerable responsibility."
"The non-discrimination clause in the Amsterdam Treaty will present us with a further need to act."
"We have the opportunity of intervening - and the Lenz Report is only one element here - and of achieving equality of opportunity in the general concept."
"We must also extend our activities into other areas of the new media."
"It is not just advertising that must observe the basic law against discrimination, but the other areas as well."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, advertising that misuses sexist stereotypes and women's bodies to market products is discriminatory, because it debases the dignity of women."
"The pointed double meanings of offensive texts and the provocative display of the naked female form cannot be tolerated, although the boundary between eroticism, with aesthetic photographs, and pornography cannot always be clearly defined."
"Amongst Member States of the European Union there are varying standards for what may be said, printed, or shown, based on varying cultural views."
"But that cannot absolve us from finding common European rules, even if our efforts are denounced as prudish, unenlightened or perhaps outmoded."
"I think reducing women to the role of an object in advertising is outmoded."
"Women have long fulfilled a variety of functions with great competence, from psychology in everyday life, through leadership qualities in the professions, to engagement in politics, culture and society."
"It would be an exciting task for advertising to prepare this reality in an interesting way, and it would underline the message more convincingly."
"There are regulations at national level for those involved in advertising and communication."
"Although not always voluntary, they still incorporate guidance and monitoring functions."
"The German Advertising Council, for instance, which has just celebrated its 25th birthday, has made effective contributions to self-regulation, including measures for public condemnation and warnings against repetition."
"Further legal regulation can be dispensed with if control is effective."
"There is no European code of ethics, however, and there are no agreements at national level."
"Advertising that discriminates against women must be stopped before it is broadcast or printed."
"For this reason those who create advertising must be sensitized."
"I was in creative advertising for more than 20 years."
"We tried to give a positive impression, design product concepts and communication content appropriate to the target audience, achieve identification with and acceptance of the products, clarify, and initiate a buying response, but without using clichés, without causing embarrassment or offence, and without being defamatory."
"That was, and is, the intellectual challenge of creative contact with customers."
"The excellent and detailed report by Marlene Lenz, and the hearing initiated by her in the Committee on Women's Rights, have clearly shown that we must keep up the fight against discrimination."
"That is particularly true after the adoption of important passages in the Amsterdam Draft Treaty."
"Mr President, I will say right away that I am going to rock the boat."
"But before I get my eyes torn out, I want to make one conciliatory remark."
"I am of course lined up with the majority, I support all action to promote equal opportunities and I oppose any instrument or act of violence that harms women."
"I think it is even more important to make that statement as a man, to avoid any suspicion of corporatism in these matters, as other speakers have observed."
"But I am also against any escalation of the problem and it seems to me that this report runs that risk: in the title itself, for example, by mentioning discrimination, but especially in the tone and in some of the arguments."
"I would say that such muddled and violent shooting goes way beyond the target."
"This is violence against violence and that seems paradoxical."
"This is a case and an area where the word discrimination can be interpreted from at least two points of view: first, women are discriminated against as the active subjects of certain advertising, it is said."
"That may be true, in fact it undoubtedly is true."
"But at the same time this action discriminates against men as passive subjects, stupid subjects, of this discrimination against women."
"The second point of view is this: men are increasingly players in identical active messages."
"Think of those androgynous beauties, think of the hairy chests, think of the well-muscled, increasingly ostentatious monsters."
"So the premise in the report, stating - and I quote - ' The clichéd view of men as bread-winners, business-like and productive, whereas women are portrayed as domestic, dependent and passive, does not reflect the social reality in Europe' is at least dated."
"But it does not reflect advertising reality either."
"Do look at some modern commercials and let us get away from the Middle Ages of advertising!"
"So, even in this case, equal opportunities are defended to the end."
"Where vigilance is actually needed, obviously, is where certain messages offend good taste and cross the boundary to pornography."
"But this applies equally to everyone, women, men, and children."
"Nor does the presence of the female shape in advertising always involve violence, because women are, after all, free to accept or reject roles offered to them."
"Instead, there is a queue - look outside any advertising agency - of women seeking to engage in this profession."
"So, I repeat, it is up to them to decide how to do so and with how much good taste."
"In addition to these reasons, in the end, where women know how to combine beauty with intelligence they emerge victorious."
"If you notice, both in the distance relationship between message and television viewer and especially in the division of roles in the commercials, it is always the man who comes across as incompetent, represented as letting himself be ensnared in the dazzling trap of some portion of the female epidermis, always shown artfully, true, but also sometimes with grace, and that needs to be stated calmly."
"The idea that men can only make a choice because a woman discloses a bit of epidermis does, I think, make the male the ridiculous figure."
"So, Mr President, if I may close with a hint of irony on an issue which, I recognize, is actually very serious, I call for a report on discrimination against men as involuntary victims of discrimination against women in advertising."
"I hardly think Parliament will agree to that request, but there is nothing wrong with proposing it."
"Mr President, the rather heated atmosphere of the original Lenz report has largely disappeared and that is a good thing."
"I can hardly imagine advertisements for lingerie, for example, without women in them and as Mrs Ewing said to me just now, the fact is women look nicer than men."
"However, I find a great deal of advertising, soap powder for instance, pretty tedious and many people agree with me."
"But is it the task of the advertising sector to undertake pioneering work to break down stereotypes?"
"I think each country gets the advertising it deserves."
"And if that advertising does not keep up with new developments or behaves unworthily, then the consumer is woman enough to give it the brush-off, because more than half of all consumers are women."
"For liberals, the boundary between press freedom, and freedom of speech, and discrimination is violation of human dignity and the unnecessary exploitation of the human body."
"These are moral limits, but there is also a plethora of legal limits."
"National legislation, self-regulation, European legislation, the code of the International Chamber of Commerce, EASA, Article 19 of the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights."
"These meant that the infamous Perrier advertisement was rightly banned."
"So is the Lenz report dealing with a non-issue?"
"Partly, but it is nevertheless a good thing for the European Parliament to draw attention to the question. However I do not think we need new legislation or harmonization of national legislation."
"I do not think we need a European Media Council dealing specifically with discrimination, or ethics committees, so my group is voting against paragraphs 15, 20 and 23 and we have submitted amendments to them."
"The appeal made by Mrs Lenz to the advertising sector is right: more women in decision-making, greater accessibility in national rules, improved complaints procedures and the EASA must as a real European selfregulating body, drawing up European minimum standards for non-discriminatory advertising and upholding them."
"Then we shall not need any extra legislation."
"If the advertising world really listened to the consumer, I mean, to all those women, then decent advertisements that meet the requirements of responsible modern men and women would be produced as a matter of course without legislation and all kinds of rules."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to say that I consider it an initial sign of mainstreaming that the debates on women are being followed not only by one Commissioner but by several Commissioners and that we are also getting responses from other Commissioners."
"As far as women in advertising are concerned, I must nevertheless say that it is a great virtue of the women's movement that in the last few years sexy men have also appeared."
"Chippendale-type men have appeared in advertisements."
"It is extremely doubtful whether that is a true image of men, because you do not come across Chippendales every day."
"There are plenty of men in this Parliament, but you have to look pretty hard to find a Chippendale!"
"To put it briefly, advertising gives a very distorted picture of reality and of course that is also the aim of advertising."
"I must honestly say that I do not think censorship of advertising would be appropriate."
"It is true that stereotypes of women are still shown a great deal, but some improvement has occurred."
"Perhaps those stereotypes have receded a little, but it would be going too far to say that the advertising world does not have trail-blazing work to do."
"Of course the advertising world can undertake pioneering work and it would also be a good thing if women were actually a lot more involved in advertising and themselves made a contribution to changing the image of women in advertisements."
"So I am not in favour of censorship but of self-regulation, and codes of conduct."
"I think we can continue to make progress in that way."
"And progress really is necessary because the situation in advertising is still not good enough."
"Mr President, at the threshold of the Twenty-first Century women's bodies are used, often gratuitously, to sell goods in order to make money for other people."
"Ask yourself exactly why Diana, Princess of Wales, was pursued everywhere she went: to make money for others."
"Women are still portrayed stereotypically even if a few new stereotypes have been added."
"This is a European matter."
"Satellite and cable television have ensured that."
"Most European countries are bad and some are appalling."
"We heard from a citizen of one of them earlier on."
"Much advertising goes well beyond the erotic to the pornographic with overtones of violence and sadism."
"This advertising cheapens all women."
"It cheapens every one of us and our daughters."
"It takes away our individuality and our humanity."
"Stereotyping of women is much more dangerous than stereotyping of men."
"It incites women to a pursuit of perfection with consequences like eating disorders."
"We know of a recent victim."
"The current legislation and self-regulation are inadequate."
"All the various pacts and conventions are inadequate."
"Mrs Lenz's proposals will do something to improve that situation."
"Colleagues, when you introduce moral issues into the process of money-making, it is never welcomed by those making money."
"They do not want to hear about moral issues."
"But moral issues matter to those people that we represent."
"I hope, therefore, that this will be taken seriously and Mrs Lenz's report will be supported by all groups."
"Mr President, this report affects freedom of expression."
"Indeed, it advocates not only professional self-regulation, which has been in existence for a long time incidentally, but goes further by stating that freedom of expression might have to be limited to protect public morality."
"What is this notion which, to boot, does not appear in the European Convention of Human Rights?"
"What is this willingness to punish, not clearly identified violations of decent behaviour, but the breaking of a mere social convention, supposedly forbidden according to the definition of some political body or other at European level, whereas sensitivity on these matters differs from north to south."
"In the past in Europe, and now today in many countries, this is how the intolerance associated with fundamentalist thinking both arose and continues to arise."
"Finally, this report seems to me to have been somewhat overtaken by events."
"Women are not the only ones whose image is used. So is men's."
"The latest Daewoo advertisement showed a man and a woman in exactly the same position and the same state of near-nakedness."
"Today, even in Belgium, Crédit Lyonnais has advertisements showing the naked body of a man in the newspapers."
"Here too, we need to adopt a more relative or qualified approach."
"It may be irritating for women, all women, not to be Botticelli's Venus, but it is just as irritating for men not to be Michelangelo's David, or the Apollo of Praxiteles. The illegitimate use of outward beauty, when abused, is criticized, sometimes to a ludicrous extent."
"But outward beauty has and always will be a motive for action in many circumstances.."
"I would like to end by referring to a passage from Amélie Nothomb's book 'Attentat ' . She writes that when Quasimodo falls in love with Esmeralda, he longs to cry out to the beautiful lady: look beyond my outward appearance!"
"But what has Quasimodo himself done except go no further than the outward appearance of this beautiful creature."
"He should have fallen in love with a toothless old woman."
"Then Quasimodo would have been credible."
"But his heart has been stopped by the splendid appearance of a beautiful gypsy girl who is only too easy to fall in love with."
"Fortunately this report will not change the face of things."
"Mr President, I would also like to add to the appreciation already expressed by other Members of the President's decision to debate all four reports from the Committee on Women's Rights together on Tuesday morning, thus giving the issues dealt with a very high profile."
"That sends a very positive signal: it certainly means that the work so many of us have done for so long, undervalued and opposed, is beginning to bear fruit and these issues are attracting more attention, in fact the feminist position is becoming common sense and received opinion."
"This is not yet the case when it comes to images of women - as we have heard - in advertising and the mass media in general."
"Despite the recommendations of the Council of Europe, the resolutions of the European Council and the European Parliament, all based on fundamental principles affirmed in international documents and agreements, despite the militant commitment of women's associations, and the decisions taken on equality mechanisms by our countries, ministries and committees, the use of the female body to sell consumer goods, that stereotype of the presumed traditional role of women, continues to infest the walls of our cities, television broadcasts at every hour of the day, and the pages of newspapers and magazines."
"In Italy, two intellectual weeklies and a left-wing periodical have both persisted for years in the bad habit of chasing high circulation by showing naked women on their covers. In fact, recently, an editor controversially explained that trying a naked man had caused a drop in sales."
"Meanwhile - and this is the other side of the coin as regards the women/mass media report - it continues to be difficult if not impossible for the associations and even ministries working to affirm women's rights to raise awareness of what they are trying to do."
"Even here, today, in spite of the politically correct timing of this debate, as we can see, some of the broadcasters who cover important debates are not present."
"The rights of half of all Europeans are not important enough for the European communications media."
"Perhaps if some of us, young and beautiful of course, had spoken in the nude....! Perhaps!"
"So Mrs Gröner has made a very timely effort to draw the attention of the European Union to this wholly unresolved problem, and in her scholarly report, Mrs Lenz, whom I congratulate, quite rightly calls for legislative initiatives by Member States and codes of conduct on the part of advertisers, and presents a series of important proposals to the Commission which I trust Commissioner Flynn will wish to respond to promptly."
"Mr President, from a scientific point of view, semantics today accepts that the language of advertising constitutes an extremely effective message."
"Today more than ever, we have to realise that this advertising message is planned, conceived and broadcast to seduce, to be assimilated, to make millions of people react in a specific way."
"We must bear in mind that these images and slogans are carefully thought out and planned to have an effect, to make a psychological attack, to have an impact, and when confronted with them we human beings tend to be passive, defenceless subjects."
"So in one sense, they could be described as an imposition using the wonders of images, sounds, colours and stimulation of the senses."
"Today, in an era ruled by the media, advertising is all of this."
"Advertising today can do wonders, but it can also commit atrocities."
"It is a very powerful instrument, as we know, and the important thing is that this powerful instrument should not contravene certain principles."
"In fact, this instrument should also be used to further the worthy aims of the human race and - why not? - to counter discrimination against women."
"Beware, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, because it is incomprehensible that we should spend so much time perfecting legal documents and guideline texts, and yet allow a poisonous, discriminatory message to be conveyed by attractive advertising and injected into the veins of thousands and millions of Europeans."
"Also, we must remember that the repetition of discriminatory messages effectively perpetuates discrimination."
"Therefore, this is a good moment to progress beyond unwanted moralizing and criticism, and say that when it comes to things that affect people, not everything is acceptable in this Europe ruled by merchandise, where some people try to turn women into a commodity."
"We have political mechanisms to enable us to say no!"
"So this report is a magnificent initiative by the European Parliament to set up a policy which should be active, non-discriminatory and in favour of equal treatment."
"Mr President, I should like to take the opportunity to thank the European Parliament for this initiative and Mrs Lenz in particular for the excellent work she has done."
"The Commission is fully aware of the importance of protecting women against discrimination in advertising and of the need to strike the right balance between respect for the fundamental right of freedom of expression and respect for human dignity."
"The report highlights a number of important issues, which I welcome."
"It makes very constructive proposals, most of which are in line with the development of the Commission's policies and activities in this particular field."
"Parliament, along with the Commission, insisted on the need for a non-discrimination clause to be inserted in the new treaty and called in particular for discrimination against women to be included in the categories of discrimination."
"Article 6(a) of the draft Amsterdam Treaty responds to this request and provides for possibilities of appropriate action in the afore-mentioned field."
"I should also like to remind the House of Council and Parliament Directive 97/31 adopted in June on coordination of television broadcasting activities, which represents the most important European instrument for television advertising."
"This directive provides that advertising shall not include any discrimination on grounds of sex."
"The integration of a gender perspective in media policy is one of the Commission's priorities within its gender mainstreaming policy."
"Concrete measures are laid down in the fourth equal opportunities programme."
"The Commission encourages the exchange of information and experience between the Member States and between relevant national bodies."
"It also encourages a balanced participation by women and men at decision-taking levels of the advertising industry and the media, in order to strengthen the influence of women in this field."
"A meeting has been planned for later on this year, bringing together major participants, experts and NGOs in the media sector in order to build on good experience."
"Mrs Lenz's proposal to include advertising in our studies is noted."
"The Commission supports an overview study of the image of women in advertising and the media and the encouragement of cooperation between professional associations, women's organizations and project leaders active at Community level."
"We cannot reply positively to the request for a European advertising prize but the NIKI Prize supported by the Commission, which aims to improve the portrayal of women on television, will be awarded again this year for good practice in the advertising sector."
"Finally, the Commission will examine carefully the proposal to set up an advisory committee for all media with the aim of drawing up a code for the advertising industry to stamp out all forms of discrimination."
"In this respect, I should like to remind the House that the recent TV directive provides for the creation of a contact committee chaired by the Commission and composed of representatives of the competent authorities in the Member States with the task of facilitating the implementation of the directive."
"The Commission could examine the possibility of creating a subgroup within the committee to prepare such a code and this would be a good example of gender mainstreaming."
"We all know that equality in practice will not become reality until there has been profound change in many areas, not least those of ideas, attitudes and images in the media."
"So, the Commission will continue and strengthen its action in this direction, taking into account your suggestions."
"I thank all those who have contributed to the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12.00 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.00 noon)"
"VOTES"
"In order to explain why I am putting forward an oral amendment, I said in the debate that this is due to an administrative misfortune."
"That is why I sincerely hope you are now listening very carefully, and will support my proposed amendment."
"I would also like to point out that both proposed amendments are controversial, and not just in this House; they are also being followed with great interest by our electorates outside the House in all Member States."
"With my proposed amendment, paragraph 14 would read as follows: ' Calls for the programmes planned by the Commission with the aim of combatting trafficking in women for purposes of sexual exploitation and combatting violence against women not to be confined to campaigns to provide information about and to prevent prostitution, but also to include support for projects to rehabilitate victims and action against pornography and prostitution ' ."
"This adds the words 'and action against pornography and prostitution' which is my oral amendment."
"Mr President, there was detailed discussion within the Committee on Women's Rights, and I do not feel that we can accept any oral amendment in the part-session."
"If Parliament has no objection, I will put the rapporteur's oral amendment to paragraph 14 to a vote."
"(The President established that more than 13 members opposed the oral amendment which was therefore not put to the vote, under Rule 124(6) )"
"Paragraph 17"
"With my proposed amendment, paragraph 17 would therefore read as follows: ' welcomes initiatives in some Member States to develop, in addition to effective sanctions, programmes for perpetrators which result in men taking responsibility for their actions, and calls for greater commitment from all Member States to adopt such initiatives' , and then my addition, ' for example, criminalization of the customers of prostitutes ' ."
"If Parliament has no objection, I will put the rapporteur's oral amendment to paragraph 17 to a vote."
"(The President established that more than 13 members opposed the oral amendment which was therefore not put to the vote, under Rule 124(6) )"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"This proposal to modify the directive on to misleading advertising so as to include comparative advertising, satisfies me in more than one respect."
"This proposal for codecision is the result of fruitful work between the Commission and Parliament."
"The text aims at a necessary harmonization in the field of advertising, and the final result of this decision appears to me to be balanced."
"The introduction of comparative advertising should make it possible to give better information to consumers, and this is the reason why I have always fought for it."
"The amendments proposed by Parliament and accepted by the Commission will limit abuses, and be reinforced in this respect by the provisions on misleading advertising already in existence."
"As the Commission has refused to include the establishment of a European control body in the directive, it is important for consumer protection organizations to be involved in checking up on tests at the Community level."
"Political leaders in the various Member States have a responsibility to encourage independent approaches along these lines."
"In the near future, the issue of the European control body will need to be raised again."
"Commission proposal on the wine market"
"I am going to vote against this document."
"I believe a support system for the wine market is fundamentally flawed in any case."
"Our group has submitted two amendments to the Commission's proposal."
"The Commission wanted to eliminate assistance for production of rectified concentrated musts in wine-growing zones C III."
"The Languedoc-Roussillon, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur and Midi-Pyrénées production regions were directly concerned."
"Our group is delighted at the vote on these two amendments, which were adopted virtually unanimously by the Members of the European Parliament, and regrets that the Commission wishes to make fundamental amendments through an apparently anodyne regulation."
"Does the Commission need reminding that we are still awaiting to a new text for the proposed reform of the COM in wine from the Commission?"
"In the spring of 1995, the European Parliament debated, voted on and amended the Commission's original proposal."
"In its proposal, the Commission has sought to reopen the debate on chaptalization and the enrichment of rectified concentrated musts."
"At the time this was first discussed, the Commission replied to the Council that it was awaiting the opinion of the European Parliament before amending its proposal."
"The European Parliament as a whole has been vigilant and has rejected this proposal from the Commission."
"The Europe of Nations Group can only rejoice at the outcome, and we thank the Members of the European Parliament for supporting these amendments."
"Simpson recommendation (Á4-0271/97)"
"The common position we are preparing to adopt is acceptable for the public service."
"It opens up the way to a degree of liberalization in the field of postal services, and hence enables some opening up to competition, which the consumers and companies wish for."
"It nevertheless sets aside important domains, such as cross-border mail and advertising mail, which are left to monopoly public postal services."
"In its deliberations, Parliament has respected the delicate balance achieved at the Council."
"Indeed, the majority of the post office ministers have been more favourable to the public service than the Commission."
"Hopefully the Luxembourg Presidency - in the person of Mrs Mady Delvaux, to whom I pay tribute for her clear and frank attitude in support of the public service in the postal field - will speedily wrap up this dossier, and conclude procedures in the Council."
"Finally, it is worth raising the question why the all-powerful wave of liberalization championed by the Commission has slowed when confronted with the postal services."
"I believe one of the essential reasons for this is the importance of the postal services in terms of social cohesion and land-use planning in national territory."
"In many cases the postman is still out there, whereas most public services have been withdrawn for reasons of cost and productivity."
"It has to be hoped that this pause in liberalization and deregulation will give decision-makers time to reflect, and the postal services the ability to work ever harder to serve customers."
"I have voted for the report."
"I think the rapporteur's amendments substantially improve the Commission's proposals, but I would like to clarify one point."
"The provision of postal services is a public service."
"Experience from other businesses shows that deregulation does not result in increased efficiency, but instead more often results in unemployment and increased regional inequality."
"Scapagnini report (A4-0268/97)"
"Nuclear energy is a non-renewable source of energy."
"Serious nuclear power accidents have occurred at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl."
"The problem of waste from nuclear power has not been solved."
"Following a referendum, Sweden has decided to phase out nuclear power."
"A reactor in Barsebäck is going to be shut down before the general election in Sweden in September 1998."
"The Centre Party has been a driving force for phasing out nuclear power in Sweden."
"The decision to shut down the nuclear power station at Chernobyl will be carried out."
"In our opinion, the EU should not subsidize the construction of other reactors as compensation for this."
"We therefore oppose EU aid for the Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 reactors in the Ukraine and that is why we have voted against the resolution."
"On the other hand we support efforts at national and EU level which improve the safety of existing reactors."
"The energy system must switch as soon as possible to renewable and sustainable sources of energy."
"Azzolini report (A4-0252/97)"
"I should like to express our group's support for the Azzolini report, since the cultural field encourages direct and indirect employment, promoting the survival and creation of small and medium-sized enterprises connected with the cultural sector, and offering prospects for the creation of employment."
"I should also emphasize that tourism and culture reinforce each other and, with our help, can increase the effects of structural funds intervention on employment."
"Regrettably, the cultural projects financed by Community structural policy only represent 3 %, which is too low if you consider the influence of culture on regional development and the achievement of economic and social cohesion."
"So the new Treaty on European Union should include a section to promote explicit support for cultural projects, and increase the number of Community regional development initiatives which have cultural aspects, with the aim of strengthening the link between the structural funds and cultural action itself."
"Finally, I should like to stress that local and regional bodies should continue to play an important role, to ensure good results from the European Union's development strategy, based on culture and the creation of employment."
"We are voting for the Azzolini report on the link between cohesion policy and culture and the promotion of employment for a number of reasons, and we highlight the following:"
"1.For the first time an effort is being made to have a more systematic and coherent approach to the enormous potential in conservation of cultural and natural heritage, whether rural or urban, national, regional or local, and cultural investments in general, for sustainable development, defence of identity, and to combat desertification and exclusion.2.The current foot-dragging over this approach and the inadequate funding - specifically funding of structural measures, still dogged by an inadequate and indeed restrictive regulation, moreover - are recognized and there needs to be a change as soon as possible, and preferably in the current financial framework."
"This must all be done without prejudice to the presentation of proposals and guidelines with a view to improving awareness and empowering synergies between cohesion policies, culture and employment.3.The importance of preventing excessive interpretation or identification between the tourist industry and the promotion of cultural policies is recognized, but we would like to stress this to make it even clearer."
"Without prejudice to a desirable and useful link between tourism and culture, it would certainly be perverse and profoundly limiting if support for cultural promotion were to be conditioned by and/or subordinated to the strategies of the tourist industry.4.Attention is drawn to the consequences that the budget cuts required for fulfilment of the nominal convergence criteria are likely to have by weakening or reversing the growth trend in employment in cultural activities, as these depend, at least in part, on government finance, whether national or regional.- Kestelijn-Sierens report (A4-0257/97)"
"I am not particularly impressed by this report which is full of clichés."
"It goes without saying that no sensible person would oppose equal rights for men and women."
"But just as obviously I am not in favour of all kinds of quota regulations that all in all are rather degrading to women."
"When, for example, I hear several speakers in the debate this morning complaining about the fact that there are still far fewer girls than boys in technical education - and that something must be done about it - then I do wonder whether we actually know the difference between 'equal opportunities' and 'equal treatment' ."
"With regard to combining family and working life, my party in Flanders has for many years been arguing in favour of a proper carer's wage that would give one of the two parents the opportunity to bring up and take care of the children at home."
"It should be a real choice, based on real free will and no longer on financial necessities."
"Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens report goes a long way in many respects, but as far as parental leave is concerned, it gets stuck in the well-worn paths."
"That of course has everything to do with the fact that bringing up children in the family may nowadays no longer be considered as valuable and socially essential work and that women who - voluntarily - choose this path are actually regarded with some pity."
"Essentially, I regret that the very important section on work and family life has got bogged down in political correctness."
"Kokkola report (A4-0251/97)"
"On the Kokkola report (A4-0251/97) on the Commission communication on incorporating equal opportunities for women and men into all Community policies and activities and on the KestelijnSierens report on the Commission's annual report on equal opportunities for women and men in the EU 1996 (A40257/97)."
"I and many British Conservative Members of the European Parliament wholeheartedly support the principle of equal opportunities for women and men and agree that mainstreaming is a valuable tool in helping to put that principle into practice."
"We welcome the increasing recognition of the problems experienced by women in particular and the increasing efforts being made at all levels to remedy the situation."
"We are not convinced, however, that the best way to achieve an equal representation of women in decision-making, for example, is through artificial discrimination of the sort proposed in both the Kokkola and Kestelijn-Sierens reports."
"The fixing of temporary quotas, though perhaps attractive in the short-term, is not the answer."
"We consider the suggestion in the Kokkola report that Commission working groups and expert committees should be made up of equal numbers of men and women to be particularly impractical and unhelpful."
"We firmly believe that appointments to such positions should be made on merit and qualification."
"To impose so-called positive discrimination in the way suggested may have the short-term benefit of increasing the figures of female representation in decision-making bodies."
"In the long-term, however, it could only be detrimental to the position of women in general."
"The proposal in the Kestelijn-Sierens report that the Commission should include a gender-impact assessment in its proposals for legislation is equally impractical."
"What is needed is practical concrete measures to give women the opportunities to achieve the qualifications and freedoms which will allow them to compete on a fair and equal footing with men on the jobs market and in the decision-making arena - not airy statements of the likely implications of proposed legislation, which in most cases are impossible to define or quantify with any degree of accuracy."
"Improvements are needed in many areas, not least with regard to the difficult task of combining work outside the home with family responsibilities."
"However, to suggest, as Mrs Kokkola's report does, that social services, such as care for children and the elderly, school meals and public transport, should be financed by the structural funds, is nothing short of ludicrous."
"I am glad that Parliament as a whole voted against this proposal, although I note that British Labour MEPs voted for it."
"We also do not believe that it is the Commission's role to decide how fiscal measures and social security benefit can be used to help bring work in the family into the official economy."
"These are all matters which should be dealt with at national, regional and local level in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"The Kokkola and Kestelijn-Sierens reports rightly highlight the difficulties involved in achieving equal opportunities for men and women today and contain some very salient points."
"I and my colleagues will vote for these reports because their ultimate aim and motivation is to the benefit of women in Europe."
"We nevertheless wish to place on record our regret that they contain some suggestions which are unlikely to help women, and risk bringing the EP's work for women into disrepute."
"Eriksson report (A4-0201/97)"
"Mr President, I speak from local experience of the zero-tolerance campaign run in Thurrock in my constituency."
"Colleagues from the South Essex Rape and Incest Crisis Line tell me that posters in shops, public houses and at bus-stops enabled the issue of violence against women to be discussed in the open and validated the private experiences of many women for the very first time."
"This local project fully supports the extension of zerotolerance campaigns to other European countries, backed up by rape crisis telephone helplines, also absent in many of our countries."
"Another local women's project in my constituency - the Southend Women's Refuge - also supports this initiative."
"I helped them recently to open their new 'dove' project - an open drop-in counselling centre for women who are victims of domestic violence."
"In just a few weeks five new women a day came forward for counselling."
"These two local examples show how far sexual violence is a reality for women today."
"They fully justify today's parliamentary decision to respond with a European-wide campaign."
"In the multicultural and pluralistic European Union, people clearly find it difficult to show respect for different opinions."
"With laughter and scorn, Parliament rejected the opportunity to vote on Mrs Eriksson's two oral amendments to support active work against pornography and prostitution and to welcome initiatives from Member States concerning the criminalization of the customers of prostitutes."
"These are amendments which we would naturally have supported."
"That prostitution and pornography are the reason for the misconceptions about women which often lead to rape and beating etc., is something we are convinced of, and we regret that Parliament did not have the courage to reach a decision on the proposed amendment."
"We would also like to stress how important it is that society gives vulnerable women and children help in the form of national legislation, and also in the form of help to take on a new identity, a new area to live in and a new job, and thereby the opportunity to escape their tormentor."
"We also call on Member States to give financial support for women's refuges and for legal aid."
"Violence against women is basically a matter of human rights, something which most people claim to defend."
"In spite of this, violence against women takes place all over the world and in all social classes."
"Making 1999 an EU campaign year against violence against women should focus attention on the problem and help make the issue a topical one in the Member States."
"However, this requires sufficient funding to be allocated in the EU's next budget, and we hope that will happen."
"Lenz report (A4-0258/97)"
"Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Lenz on her report calling for an end to discrimination against women in advertising."
"It is a call that is ignored, derided and considered old-fashioned by the advertising industry."
"The advertising industry believes that as long as a sardonic quote or a look can be incorporated into the advert, it is open season for portraying women's bodies in any derogatory way, to sell anything from cars to underwear."
"In my local paper, the Birmingham Mail, I am told that an advertisement is going to be unveiled in Birmingham this week in the form of an electronic, 20-foot-high billboard showing a woman taking off her clothes continuously."
"The AA, the Automobile Association, is warning that it could be a source of distraction and could lead to accidents."
"I quote this as an example of the lengths to which the advertising industry in Britain is going at present in order to sell products: women in chains to sell cosmetics, women who are overweight portrayed in the most derogatory terms."
"Mrs Lenz's call for self-regulation is a laudable one but I fear that the industry will ignore it."
"The European Union institutions must use their combined forces and recognize this as a growing problem in the 1990s."
"They must act to provide a Europe-wide code of conduct for the advertising industry in order for this discrimination to be stopped."
"Mrs Crawley, I happily allowed you to exceed your time because your previous experience over a number of years as chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights and your activity in this Parliament give you the right to justify exceeding your speaking time, when the Chair can allow it, and I was very pleased that you were able to complete your remarks."
"The Danish Social Democrats are voting for the Lenz report on their own initiative."
"Because the media operate across borders, it is necessary to take up this issue at EU level."
"It would be desirable for the advertising sector to exercise more self-regulation and to recognize that it is discriminatory to show naked or semi-naked women in advertisements."
"If the sector itself is incapable of setting and maintaining certain guidelines for good marketing, it could become necessary to regulate this area at EU level."
"That completes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Draft budget for 1998"
"The next item is the presentation by the Council of the draft budget for 1998."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Commissioner, as required by tradition and by the budget procedure, it is my responsibility to present to this House the draft budget for financial 1998, as drawn up by the Council on 24 July last."
"Mr President, I would like to emphasize that, from the start, this budget procedure has - and I am delighted about that - been marked by excellent and open cooperation between the three institutions."
"Before the Council drew up the draft budget, the three institutions undertook to enter into a real and open exchange."
"Each wished to show its willingness to listen to the other, and even to go some way down the other's path, on every occasion possible."
"The budgetary procedure laid down by the treaty is a highly significant moment in the collaboration between the three institutions."
"The 1993 interinstitutional agreement established the framework."
"Since then, the interest in and the need for such cooperation have become clearer from one year to the next."
"The launch of the budgetary procedure in 1998 has been, in our view, exemplary in this respect."
"Hence, the trialogue on the likely priorities for the forthcoming financial year gave rise on 21 April to in-depth exchanges of views between the Presidency of the Council, the Parliament and the Commission with, as a corollary, the introduction of milestones leading to a number of points of convergence of views."
"Subsequently, the trialogue of 26 June last ensured that the Council was in a position to understand Parliament's principal wishes better."
"This further exchange was extremely valuable for the concertation meeting of 24 July, the very day of the Budget Council."
"This meeting enabled the parties to set out the points they considered essential, and grapple with the specific difficulties they regarded as inescapably important for this particularly difficult and tough financial year."
"Your representatives, Mr President, drew our attention to their priorities for strengthening the measures aimed at encouraging job creation, research and development, preparation of candidate countries for membership and programmes intended for youth and culture, the environmentalization of the budget and the ongoing restructuring of Community administration, in order to ensure greater efficiency and more flexibility in the allocation of resources."
"On behalf of the Council, I had the opportunity to emphasize that the institution which I represent was preparing, in the 1998 draft budget, to adhere to the same principles of budgetary rigour as those imposed on themselves and their citizens by the Member States in pursuit of the effort already broadly undertaken in 1997."
"This ad hoc concertation made it possible, in my view, to bring about a significant if not complete convergence of views between the two branches of the budgetary authority, with the help of the Commission, particularly as regards agriculture and fisheries expenditure."
"In a word, in my view, these contacts were extremely useful."
"As regards the CFSP, and over and above the consensus on the total amount of funding recorded in the 1998 budget, we agreed to continue the consultation which was provided for under the institutional agreement signed on 15 July last."
"In the light of the results of this meeting, the Council, as required by its obligations, drew up its draft budget for 1998."
"In order to meet the inescapable requirement for rigour and budgetary discipline, the Council believed that a number of fundamental measures were indispensable."
"These were: maintaining the funds in the preliminary draft of the budget under Category 1 of the financial perspectives; taking into account the current agricultural legislation regarding arable crops and the price package for the 1997-1998 financial year; a reduction of ECU 1 billion in payment appropriations, as compared with the preliminary draft budget, under Category 2, ' Structural Action' ; significant reduction in the payment appropriations for the whole of headings 3, ' Internal Policy, ' and 4, ' External Actions, ' with a consistent expression of these in terms of commitment appropriations."
"Finally, a very rigorous approach towards administrative expenditure."
"Mr President, in the Council's opinion, all these measures add up to an indissociable whole."
"And by the words 'indissociable whole' , I mean the symmetrical handling of both agricultural expenditure and structural expenditure which, taking into consideration the priorities and concerns of the Council, is and will remain essential."
"The Council fundamentally expects and relies on Parliament's adherence to this strategy."
"In this context, the Council noted with satisfaction that, in its orientations regarding budget procedures for 1998, Parliament recognized and underwrote the need for budget headings to be made in a spirit of maximum realism."
"The measures proposed by the Council in its draft budget tend towards that very thing: restricting budgetary allocations to what is strictly necessary, taking account of the realities, but without interfering with the essential policies of the Community, all the while respecting commitments, and in particular those of the Edinburgh European Council."
"Mr President, I shall now deal briefly with the essential components of the draft budget drawn up by the Council at first reading."
"I shall begin with agricultural expenditure."
"In this field, the Council made major changes to the Commission's preliminary draft."
"First, under the overall strategy of making savings which I have just outlined, the Council has decided to maintain the spending envelope planned for the 1998 budget, at the level proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget, that is, ECU 40, 987 million, an amount which is some ECU 2, 276 million below the guideline, including the monetary reserve."
"Agricultural expenditure is set at ECU 41, 487 million, a very limited increase of some 0.44 % over the current financial year."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this decision implies a certain number of deeply incisive measures."
"To take into account the agricultural regulations in force, the chapter relating to arable crops has been increased by ECU 1, 353 million, the increase of ECU 55 million arising from the decisions on the price package for the 1997-1998 financial year."
"In order to comply with the overall spending envelope, the Council then decided on an across-theboard reduction of some ECU 1, 408 million on all lines of agricultural expenditure."
"It was also decided to place ECU 329 million in the B 040 reserve for additional savings identified by the Commission within the framework of a first updating of forecast expenditure for 1998."
"The Council has thus implemented the provisions discussed at the meeting of 24 July."
"The Council most earnestly urges the European Parliament to underwrite this approach."
"I say this with all the more conviction as these measures have been taken while awaiting the presentation by the Commission of a rectificatory letter in the autumn, taking into account the updated forecasts of requirements."
"I now come to the field of structural actions."
"The Council has recorded all the commitment appropriations proposed by the Commission under the structural funds, that is, ECU 3, 482 million, in line with the final decisions of the Edinburgh Council."
"This amount implies substantial growth of 6.14 %."
"On the other hand, this is a point which has been widely discussed and debated with representatives of your Committee on Budgets during the ad hoc concertation."
"The payment appropriations for this Category have been reduced by ECU 1 billion, a Council decision introducing the second part of its overall savings strategy."
"In so doing, the Council wishes to state that such a measure - due to the major difficulties with which we are familiar - should in no way call into question the proper operation of the essential policy financed by such funding. All the more so as the payment appropriations recently made in various sectors."
"This is the reason why the Council decided not to entertain the slightest reduction in regard to objectives 1 and 6 of the structural funds and the disadvantaged regions."
"The countries which have joined the European Union most recently will therefore not be affected."
"The funding decision represents growth of 2.95 % compared to 1997."
"If this is not enough to de-escalate the debate, I would add that the Council has agreed not to touch the cohesion fund."
"The cohesion fund was not involved in the across-the-board reduction."
"Indeed, the Council accepted all provisions in the preliminary draft budget for the cohesion fund, that is, ECU 2, 871 million in commitment appropriations, and ECU 2, 649 million in payment appropriations, hence an increase, as compared with 1997, of 4.40 % in commitment appropriations, and 13.88 % in payment appropriations."
"As regards Community initiatives, the Council decided that the additional allocation of ECU 100 million in commitment appropriations, proposed under the Peace initiative, that is, for the Northern Ireland peace process, would be covered by the envelope of commitment appropriations intended for Community initiatives."
"Consequently, the Council deleted the negative reserves written into the preliminary draft budget."
"This issue, whose political impact requires no further emphasis, was also the subject of a considerable degree of mutual understanding at our meeting on 24 July."
"For all these structural actions, the amounts entered into the draft budget were ECU 33, 461 million in commitment appropriations and ECU 27, 400 million in payment appropriations, which have increased by ECU 1, 980 million or 6.3 %, and ECU 1, 100 million or 4.18 %, respectively."
"In conclusion, Mr President, on structural policy, I invite the European Parliament to adopt an approach directly in line with that of the Council."
"As regards internal policies, this year the Council has once again placed the emphasis on the two priority policies of the Community, research and the transeuropean networks."
"Hence, the Council accepts all of the commitment appropriations proposed by the Commission for sub-section B6, i.e. ECU 3, 476 million, virtually equivalent to the status quo in 1997."
"As regards payment appropriations, the Council decided, in the light of budget constraints, to reduce the proposed amount from ECU 3, 216 million to ECU 3, 066 million, an overall reduction of ECU 150 million distributed between the Common Research Centre, in an amount of ECU 5.6 million, and the fourth framework program, in an amount of ECU 144 million."
"As regards the transeuropean networks, within the framework of chapter B5-7, the Council accepted the preliminary draft budget allocations of commitment appropriations for the financial support of transport networks, in an amount of ECU 475 million, a considerable increase over 1997 of ECU 123 million or 35 % for recorded payment appropriations."
"Although ECU 27 million below the amount proposed in the preliminary draft budget, the appropriations increased by 56 %."
"As regards energy networks, the draft budget is ECU 2 million below the preliminary draft budget for payment appropriations."
"In the telecommunications field, the draft budget is slightly down, in both commitment and payment appropriations."
"For amounts under this Category as a whole, the Council has recorded substantial amounts, ECU 560 million in commitments, and ECU 413 million in payments, a rise of ECU 95 million in commitment appropriations or more than 20 %, and of ECU 86 million in payment appropriations, or 26 %."
"In so doing, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council very clearly expressed its determination to give preference to these two major policies, and to these two major lines of Community action directly influencing growth and hence employment."
"Consequently, as regards other internal policies, the Council has been faced with the need - and this you will understand - to make extremely hard choices."
"Hence emphasis has been placed on only those policies which are truly important, such as education, vocational training, and youth, which have been granted ECU 325 million in commitment appropriations, and other social actions, which have been allocated ECU 118 million in commitment appropriations."
"Priority was also given to policies which are now well established, such as the environment, with ECU 135 million in commitment funds, a rise of 2.45 %; consumer protection, with ECU 18 million and ECU 16 million, and the internal market, with ECU 207 million and ECU 188 million."
"The margin, and this will certainly be of interest to you - as the Parliament from the outset made a tight connection between the margin under Category 15, for agricultural expenditure, and the expenditures under headings 3 and 4 - the margin left by the Council under this financial prospects Category amounts to a substantial ECU 619 million."
"The Council earnestly hopes that the other branch of the budget authority will approve similar measures, and hence adopt the Council's approach, which restricts itself to realistic budget spending headings, and devoting European taxpayers' funds solely to those policies which hold out the promise of concrete results."
"I now come quickly to the last of the major Community policies financed by the budget, i.e. external actions."
"For the whole of sub-section B7, the Council, aside from its reserve for emergency assistance, has allocated ECU 5, 476 million in commitment appropriations, and ECU 4 billion 207 million in payment appropriations, a reduction of ECU 145 million in commitment appropriations and of ECU 341 million in payment appropriations."
"These overall figures include different special provisions."
"In effect, in this field, the Council believes that the budget authority cannot escape its responsibility for restricting the use of the Union's financial resources strictly to genuine priorities."
"So the Council has accepted all the commitment appropriations set out in the preliminary draft budget for the central and eastern European countries, and for third party Mediterranean countries, namely ECU 1, 125 million and ECU 1, 142 million respectively, an increase of 15 %, in accordance with the conclusions of the Cannes European Council."
"In relation to international fisheries agreements, and in the light of the further information supplied by the Commission in the course of the concertation procedure on obligatory expenditure, the Council accepted a reduction in the amount planned for commitment appropriations of ECU 5 million, the justification for which was exclusively an overestimate in the forecast."
"For fisheries and for obligatory payments, the amounts agreed are ECU 292 and ECU 297 million, a payment appropriations increase of 5.7 % and 20.6 %."
"Spending in the field of cooperation with Latin America, Asia, and Southern Africa, including South Africa itself, amounted to ECU 730 million in commitments, and ECU 334 million in payment appropriations."
"As another essential arm of the policy of cooperation with the independent states of the CIS, these countries were granted ECU 510 million in commitment appropriations, in line with the preliminary draft budget, and ECU 460 million in payment appropriations."
"The share for Tacis amounts to ECU 480 million in commitment appropriations, as provided for in the preliminary draft budget, and ECU 445 million in payment appropriations."
"Cooperation with former Yugoslavia has been allocated ECU 259 million in commitment appropriations, in accordance with the preliminary draft budget, and ECU 180 million in payment appropriations."
"Furthermore, and once again, the draft budget largely accords with the request of the Commission regarding other cooperation actions, ECU 315 million being allocated to commitment appropriations, particularly for actions for the defence of democracy and human rights, both in central and eastern Europe, and more particularly in Yugoslavia, or in the newly independent states, as well as in Mongolia, Latin America, and the Meda zone."
"So while on the one hand the Council has been determined to preserve the fundamental policies under Category 4, by voting for considerable commitment appropriations, it has believed it to be both necessary and its duty to call for further contributions in respect of the payment appropriations required for 1998, while ensuring respect for the requirements of the financial settlement and the interinstitutional agreement, particularly as regards the costefficiency ratio, the possible payment of the funds voted, and, of course, the existence of the appropriate legal arrangements."
"As regards foreign and security policy, the Council has adopted a new nomenclature, using six headings in chapter B 8.O1, following the interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament, the Council, and the European Commission, relating to provisions for the finance of the common foreign and security policy, signed on 16 July."
"The Council has accepted the funds proposed in the preliminary draft budget, namely ECU 30 million in commitment appropriations, and ECU 20.25 million in payment appropriations, which were the subject of an exchange of views on 24 July last."
"The Council has transferred these funds from reserve B 0.40 to the budget lines of the new nomenclature, by application of the interinstitutional agreement."
"The remaining margin, under Category 4 of the financial perspectives, amounts to ECU 725 million in the draft budget."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, finally I come to Category 5 of the financial perspectives, that is, expenditure relating to the administrative operation of the Union institutions."
"The Council's decisions in this field are based on the following principles."
"Firstly, zero growth for all expenditure relating to Category 5 of the financial perspectives, although this does not necessarily exclude quite unavoidable exceptions to the principle; there is also a refusal in principle to create new jobs, except when required for enlarging the Union, while functional requirements must be met by the redeployment of existing resources."
"The Council has set total administrative appropriations for all institutions, European Parliament and mediators included, at ECU 4, 301 million, an increase of ECU 18 million, or 0.42 % above the funding agreed in 1997."
"Excluding Parliament's budget, the overall amount is ECU 3, 386 million, a reduction of ECU 9.7 million, or 0.29 % compared to the 1997 budget."
"Mr President, the Council has held an exchange of views on the impact of funding relating to pensions within the Commission's operating funds."
"The Council is of the opinion that, with the support of the two branches of the budget authority, pensions expenditure should be appropriately shared between the institutions."
"Indeed, it is not equitable to abide by the negative growth of 2.4 % for the administrative expenses of the Commission alone, as this is the result of rising expenditure due to the redemption of pension rights accruing under institutional arrangements, but charged to Commission services."
"With the delegation led by Mr Detlev Samland, we held in-depth exchanges on this question which, if it were to lead to an agreement between the Council and the European Parliament, would in fact restore to the Commission an amount of some ECU 20 million for the 1998 financial year, on the understanding that the principle of zero growth, as decided by the Council for the other institutions would not be called into question."
"Following on from the work of the Council, the margin below the ceiling of Category 5 amounts to ECU 239.7 million."
"Here I would like to recall the Council's wish, already expressed at the time of the budget meeting of 24 July last, to see Parliament become broadly convinced of the need for the rigour which has guided the Council, and to see the administrative expenditures adopted, if possible, at a single reading."
"So, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those are the main elements of the draft budget drawn up by the Council for 1998."
"There is no need to remind you that this final draft, as presented, is shaped by the rigorous measures that the Council has decided upon."
"This draft, ladies and gentlemen, is the very opposite of an easy option."
"Sacrifices have had to be made by all the Member States, but it must be recognized that the sought-after balance has been achieved through measures which now appear best suited to that major objective, which the Member States are called on to pursue in the domestic field, with a view to the introduction of economic and monetary union."
"Furthermore, the Council is perfectly aware of the fact that close collaboration and understanding with your Parliament is essential for the implementation of the balanced budget effort that the Council is proposing."
"Mr President, the Presidency will make every effort, throughout the budgetary procedure, and alongside Parliament and the Commission, to finalize a budget which will best serve the interests of the Community."
"In conclusion, let me thank all those who have worked in this direction and who will continue to do so in the months to come."
"By this, I mean those in the ranks of the Parliament, Mr President, and in particular members of the Committee on Budgets, notably the chairman, Mr Detlev Samland and the two rapporteurs, Mr Tillich and Mr Tomlinson."
"On the Commission side, I would also like to thank Mr Erkki Liikanen, in particular, and the departments with responsibility for the budgets, for their excellent collaboration, which the Presidency has been fortunate enough to enjoy throughout the last few weeks."
"So, Mr President, that is the summary of the key points of the draft budget for 1998."
"The Council and above all the Presidency remain at the disposal of Parliament to reply to any questions that may be raised."
"For my part, Mr President, I thank you for giving me the floor, and for your attention."
"Mr President, Mr Fischbach, just a few remarks with regard to the draft Community budget for 1998."
"In general, the Dutch and Luxembourg Presidencies have been, and will certainly continue to be, serious in their efforts to contribute to a rigorous and solid Community budget for 1998."
"The draft budget, however, falls somewhat short in both respects."
"The most important sector - agriculture - looks rigorous but relies on changes in estimates."
"In other parts the provisions are not sufficient given the commitments of the Union."
"As far as agricultural spending is concerned, the key factor in strict budget discipline for the Commission was the proposed cut in per hectare aid for cereal producers."
"I can only repeat my regret that the Council has been unable to agree on this or any equivalent real saving measure."
"Of course, the Council did not receive much encouragement from Parliament either."
"Without any real savings, the efforts of the Council are reduced to cuts in estimates."
"At least there is the agreement between the institutions on a rectifying letter before the end of October."
"This will make it possible to improve the estimates on the basis of the most up-to-date information."
"With regard to payment appropriations for structural funds, the most recent information available to the Commission confirms the amount entered in the preliminary draft budget."
"The implementation of the 1997 budget is very high and the available information from Member States indicates ambitious spending targets for 1998."
"With regard to categories 3 and 4, Parliament will obviously express its own priorities."
"The Commission is ready to work with Parliament and the Presidency of the Council to find the most effective contribution the Community budget can make to the November jobs summit."
"Nevertheless, the overall outcome for the budget should leave no doubt that all Community institutions accept and support the budgetary rigour which is a prerequisite for the successful start of economic and monetary union."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner's last remark prompts me to follow on straight away, although I actually intended to deal with this as my final point."
"So that the ladies and gentlemen present do not get lost in the Council's maze of budgetary items and gain the impression that we in the Community will be spending more money in 1998 than in 1997, I should like to make a few facts clear: the Commission's budget proposal is about 1.15 % of Community GNP!"
"For 1992, six budget years ago, this figure was about 1.20 % as a maximum spending limit."
"And the Council has now managed to bring this down from 1.15 % to 1.12 %, thus making it clear that the challenges the Community will face as from the 1998 financial year are really not economic ones."
"In the same breath the Commission lays before us Agenda 2000, in which it presents the introductory phase of the eastward enlargement beginning in 1998."
"The Council furthermore accepts additional cuts for that same financial year, and to top it all the Council tells us: Dear Commission, if you are very good and go along with a proposal to cut funding in Category 2 of the budget - structural policy - then we will give you back ECU 20 million for administrative costs."
"Now this is a game that goes beyond the mendacious, and has nothing, absolutely nothing whatever, to do with the challenges facing the Community."
"Let me now come to the point I actually meant to start with. I wanted to praise the President-in-Office of the Council."
"The Luxemburg Presidency has been diligent and active. But it is clear from the results of the vote on the first reading of the budget that it does not matter how diligent and active anyone is: if there are some people sitting on the Council who will not agree - and the majority of them will not - then the result is what we have now, namely an inadequate response to the challenges facing the European Union, both from within and from outside the Union."
"Mr President-in-Office, I should like to comment on some of the points you raised. First, agricultural policy."
"We made you a fair offer which did not come easily to us."
"That was not simple on our side of the House, because the budget and agriculture experts have different views."
"But we offered to make a cut in expenditure which was not just done with a lawnmower moving horizontally across the agricultural policy expenditure line, but was aimed at the resources that have always been underspent in recent years."
"What could be a better solution, than to examine recent years for evidence of where the budget has been consistently unrealistic in the past?"
"You had neither the courage nor the willingness of your fellow opposition in the Council to undertake such a cut in expenditure."
"You agreed merely to do the simplest thing budget-makers can do, namely, make a horizontal cut across all budget items."
"I welcome the fact that you have created a reserve, and we invite you to continue to maintain that reserve, because we wanted it."
"We wanted a reserve and we should like it if the reserve were even to grow a little during the months leading up to the second reading of the budget in the European Parliament."
"A third point. You have had a field day in that 20 % of the expenditure is where you wanted it, just as it is every year."
"That was no surprise to us; that was nothing new."
"We know the budget items after all, including those to be cut; when you cut Leonardo or Socrates, or when you cut the new voluntary service for young people, none of that is any surprise."
"The problem you present us with, however, is that you behave as though you were this European Union's radical savers."
"Where it hits the citizen hardest, that is where you are the radical savers of expenditure!"
"But here, where the citizen is most indirectly affected, you show the courage to cut expenditure by a thousand million."
"When I compare agricultural expenditure and cuts, and compare that with expenditure on youth policy, then in youth policy you are showing 24 times the courage you are showing in agricultural policy!"
"Mr President, Parliament cannot take that line."
"Nor can we take it at the first reading of Parliament's budget."
"We realise that we shall have to apply corrective action to show those we represent that the European Parliament stands for the interests of people."
"For us, saving is not an end in itself, but is actually used to achieve the priorities this Parliament has established. That sentence bears repeating."
"Throughout the whole debate, whether in my homeland or in the other Member States, whether in relation to monetary union or regardless of monetary union - because we would still have to make savings if there were no monetary union - throughout this whole debate, discussion has only been about saving."
"I would like to see the savings discussion at last turn into a discussion of financial management."
"After all, saving, in itself, has absolutely no value, whereas there is a lack of an orderly management of the budget, a form to the presentation and implementation of the budget."
"You have made it very easy for yourselves by adjourning the debate until next year or the year after, just by drastically reducing the financial resources."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"The Council passed its first resolution at its first reading on 24 July following our coordination meeting, and the Council Presidency has today tried to sell us its allegedly good product, as any good PR man should."
"But it is not a good product and the objectives of the Council, unlike those of the Commission and the European Parliament, are stamped with the aim of achieving zero growth at all costs."
"So far so good."
"However, even the Council knows that this concept contains risks."
"No other interpretation can be placed on the formal declaration by the Council that, should the budget for 1998 be insufficient in certain policy areas, particularly payments, it would look favourably on a supplementary budget proposal from the Commission."
"I beg leave to say that that is very unusual and has nothing to do with serious budgeting."
"The Council proposal differs from the Commission proposal for payments by minus ECU 1.8 billion."
"For this reason, the European Parliament has asked the Commission for a position statement to see if there is any legal way in which Parliament could accept the budget under these conditions, as in our view there is a real chance in some areas that budgetary provisions for policies arising from the relevant treaties could not be financed."
"The individual specialist committees must state their views, hence the reason for this appeal to colleagues in the House."
"In 1985 this was the reason for rejecting the budget, and the situation then was similar in every respect."
"The Commission said yesterday at the meeting of the Committee on Budgets that there were no basic doubts from their point of view, but that in the area of Category 2 - structural policy - doubts certainly continued to be felt."
"On the subject of Category 1 - agricultural policy - Mr Samland, the committee chairman, has already made a firm statement, so I shall not comment on that again."
"Just one more thing for my colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture, and for you as President of the Council: in April we came to an agreement regarding agricultural expenditure, and we know that that ad hoc procedure has yet to be concluded."
"There is still a lot needing negotiation here, including the resources you have placed in the general reserve."
"Now to Category 2. You spoke about it at length, Mr President-in-Office."
"We cannot and will not accept the cut of ECU 1 billion in structural funds payment appropriations."
"As long ago as April this year the Commission proved that the outflow of funds had long overtaken the arrears from previous years, and that we were now almost within the budget figures."
"The Commission made no secret of the fact that it doubted the legality of its measures regarding cuts in the payment appropriations."
"In the tripartite talks on 6 October we expect from you, Mr Council President, and above all from the Commission, a binding proposal on how we should proceed with the peace initiative for Northern Ireland."
"Neither the Commission's proposal nor the proposal from the Presidency of the Council - is acceptable to Parliament."
"In the meantime the Commission has also adopted this view and is ready to issue a proposal whereby, regardless of existing initiatives and other programmes, that is, without offsetting against them, appropriations which have not been spent may be made available."
"We all want the same thing: to help the people of Northern Ireland in a normal way."
"Turning to Category 3, Mr Samland said of the general situation that every year it is the same, but it is just a little worse this year."
"That puts it in a nutshell."
"At Amsterdam stress was laid on the need to inform citizens about the Euro and the Treaty of Amsterdam, but these funds appear in the budget marked ""reminder' - which means, for the benefit of those in the public gallery, that the figure is zero."
"Had you used this ""reminder' in general information policy, we might have been able to understand it, but you used these funds in the reserves for the Prince initiative, which is concerned with the campaign on the Euro and the Amsterdam Treaty, and thus reduced them by about half."
"That is incomprehensible."
"I would remind you of a decision you yourselves made in Amsterdam: the European Council emphasizes the paramount importance of providing citizens and business with unlimited information about the single market."
"You have cut funds for the single market by ECU 17 million and those for public information, section B-33, by 50 %."
"The same goes for social actions."
"On the one hand the European Council stresses yet again the major importance of supporting employment and reducing the unacceptably high level of unemployment in Europe, particularly amongst young people, the long term unemployed and the less skilled. On the other, you promptly cut social action by 25 %!"
"As regards Category 4, one is left in principle with the impression that, here too, initiatives have been neglected in favour of zero growth, instead of having a balanced policy for the whole world."
"There is no other way of interpreting the fact that you limit your priorities solely to the Mediterranean countries and central and eastern Europe."
"In general one may say that the initial attempt, at the end of the debate on the 1998 budget, to target zero growth has become redundant."
"Despite the fact that your first reading took place after the Amsterdam Summit, I note that there is no reflection of the importance of employment policy in the premises of the draft budget."
"I should like to invite you, as well as the Commission, to join us in searching for solutions."
"I know that the Luxemburg Presidency supports that."
"So I call on the other 14 Member States: this affects the credibility of us all, after the resolutions you made in Amsterdam."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, I should first like to welcome Mr Fischbach."
"I am sure he will understand if I say to him that I welcome him more than I welcome his message."
"I learned at an early age that it may sometimes be necessary to kill the message without shooting the messenger."
"In the discussions we had at the trialogue I made one undertaking on behalf of Parliament, one that Parliament had already committed itself to."
"That was to honour the arrangements we had always informally agreed to, namely that Parliament would not take more than 20 % of Category 5 appropriations."
"Last night I had a discussion with Parliament's Bureau and we concluded the modalities by which that will happen."
"There will be a cut of some ECU 4.5 million in the first reading of Parliament's budget that will secure the necessary cuts and will take Parliament, as we always said we would, below the 20 % of Category 5 appropriations."
"Those cuts will come principally in Chapter 11 of Parliament's budget and the principal contributory factor will be the beneficial impact of exchange rates between the ECU and the Belgian franc which makes substantial savings possible."
"Having said that, the budgetary problems facing us as a Parliament are largely the consequence of decisions taken by the Council itself."
"If we look at Parliament's budget and why we ever had the problem about going above 20 % of Category 5 appropriations, we must look at those three places in Europe that have one thing in common - Edinburgh, Maastricht and Amsterdam."
"The rather ludicrous decision taken at one and reaffirmed at another are now encapsulated in a draft treaty at the third which says Parliament shall meet like gypsies round Europe and which forces us to create a surplus of hemicycles, an abundance of offices at public expense."
"These chaotic and expensive organizational surpluses are something the Council has to accept responsibility for."
"Over and above that, when we sought to make the provision of those necessary buildings at the lowest possible cost, Council itself produced the obstructions to us doing so."
"The fact that Parliament will have to buy its D3 building in Brussels by using a special purpose vehicle might be to the advantage of the Luxembourg taxpayer who will receive certain benefits from the additional taxes we pay in Luxembourg, but it will cost the European taxpayer about ECU 1 million more in year one than if we had followed the Commission's proposal of direct Community financing of the acquisition of our buildings."
"So, the acquisition of buildings in consequence of those decisions has been one problem, but of course in our budget for next year the disposal of our surplus buildings is the other side of the same problem."
"I suppose, as rapporteur on Parliament's budget, I have felt precious little like a budget rapporteur and rather more like a peripatetic estate agent, trying to dispose of our surplus physical assets on whoever might be interested in them."
"Certainly, as far as Parliament is concerned, next year's budget is seriously contingent upon our ability to dispose of the leases of Belliard I and II building and of the Van Maerlant buildings."
"Parliament will accept that challenge, will do those things, will produce its budget and will live within a 20 % of category 5 ceiling."
"Having said that, I do not think there is anybody in Parliament, as we go through the necessary cuts to make that possible, who will weep crocodile tears for those who say that this is a necessary contribution towards those Member States who are having to curtail their expenditure in order to meet Maastricht convergence criteria: many of us see the generosity with which they can treat some of their domestic spending programmes and the rather parsimonious approach they adopt towards Europe's budget."
"Parliament will play its part this year but we do it in the context of a rather boringly constrained budgetary ceiling which is unnecessary if we are going to meet the aspirations of the citizens of Europe."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, I seek the floor very briefly, and do so first to thank Mr Samland and the two rapporteurs, Mr Tillich and Mr Tomlinson, who have spoken in this debate."
"Mr Liikanen has replied very concisely and I have nothing to add."
"I will just say that the message from the Members of Parliament, the chairman and the two rapporteurs, has come across loud and clear."
"But I would like to qualify some of the comments that have just been made."
"Obviously I accept that we are arguing very openly, but it must be remembered that even the President of the Council, and all Presidents of the Council, who are either ministers of finance or budget ministers, know perfectly well that the art of budgeting is not to spend more, but to spend more wisely."
"I think that this is an exercise to which we are committed on a daily basis in our Member States."
"So I do assure you that we are extremely attentive to what you have said."
"However I would say to Mr Samland - who is perfectly aware of this, moreover, but did not wish to say so here - that expenditure now amounts to some 1.15 % of Community GDP, whereas three or four years ago, it was around 1.20 %."
"It should not be forgotten that the basis of calculation has changed over the last three or four years, and that the GDP of Member States, at Community level, has increased by 2.5 %."
"So we must compare like with like, and it should not be insinuated that, in the final analysis, the Community is spending less than it was some four years ago."
"We all of us know that constraints have changed, and that in a certain number of fields, the urgent considerations are such, that we cannot indulge in the luxury of making savings to the detriment of the priority interests of the Community, and hence of the European Union itself."
"I would also like to tell Mr Tillich that we are well aware of the fact that these deletions from the budget, and even these reductions of payment appropriations are a matter for discussion, but I do not accept that there should be any doubts cast on the determination of the Council to honour the obligations of the European Union."
"We made it crystal clear at the Budget Council - and I think Parliament knows this and appreciates it at its full value - that we were prepared to give favourable consideration to any proposal from the Commission, in the event that the payments were not enough to cover commitments entered into."
"I think that that is a very important point, and - although I risk the reproach that in the final analysis the Council has made a declaration which does not match its willingness and determination to achieve zero growth in the 1998 budget - I would say that the Council is sufficiently realistic and reasonable to share Parliament's view of all the legal obligations of the European Union."
"I will end by saying that the Presidency of the Council is dependent on the Parliament."
"It is now up to the Parliament to shoulder its responsibilities."
"I await with impatience the discussions that will take place in this hall on 21 October."
"I shall certainly be here."
"I shall listen very carefully to Parliament's message, and we shall then see."
"But there is no need to feel sorry for the Luxembourg Presidency: we are very small, but we are quite strong enough to channel the Council's debate in the right direction."
"The debate is closed."
"Common organization of the market in bananas"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on the position of the World Trade Organization panel on bananas."
"- (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the World Trade Organization's appeals panel recently presented its report on the common organization of the market for bananas."
"Following the negative decision of the panel which was set up by the WTO at the request of the USA, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico, the European Community went to appeal. The report will be presented to the next meeting of the WTO committee for resolving disputes on 25 September."
"I cannot disguise the fact that the European Commission is very disappointed with this report, because in it the appeals panel reaches the conclusion that several aspects of the COM for bananas cannot be reconciled with WTO regulations."
"Amongst the measures which cannot be reconciled with the WTO Treaty, according to the ruling, are those intended to meet our obligations to protect the less stable economies amongst ACP states."
"Banana exports to the EC are an important pillar of the economy in these countries, and a guarantee of their political stability."
"The composition of the import rules, too, which were intended to further the marketing of banana products from the EC and ACP states, were not considered to be in accordance with WTO regulations, as were aspects of our agreement with the most important countries of origin which were part of the agriculture chapter in the Uruguay Round."
"The European Commission fears that the appeal panel's ruling could have very wide repercussions on the interpretation not only of the banana regulation, but of a whole range of important WTO regulations affecting the obligations and policies of all WTO members going well beyond the banana regulation."
"The Commission also wonders, with some concern, how the ruling could affect current banana regulations."
"The Commission is currently undertaking a careful assessment of the consequences of the WTO process."
"Having regard to the European Union's international obligations we shall then arrive at a balanced view of the content and effects of the ruling."
"In this the obligations of the EU towards our own banana producers, the ACP countries within the Lomé Agreement, and the effects of the Uruguay Round on our relations with Latin American exporting countries will have to be given equal consideration."
"Mr President, the truth is that Mr Fischler's words are not very reassuring."
"If I have understood his speech correctly, he is disappointed with and concerned about the ruling on the common organization of the market, and he says the Commission is worried, but I think this was the right time for the Commissioner to have told us a little more."
"As he correctly reminded us, the appeal decision will probably be ratified on 25 September, and then the Commission has a month to decide what to do - whether to implement the decision or propose some type of compensation."
"We would have liked the Commissioner to have given us a little more guidance today, because something he mentioned only briefly seems very important to us. Namely, that the banana regime is not just a deal for the Community and the ACP states."
"As he well knows, for many mountainous countries it is virtually the only export, and it has a decisive influence on their social, economic and political structure. So for many ACP states, raising questions about this regime can mean raising questions about their very economy and political life."
"That is why it is so important for us to emphasize this."
"And we urge the Commission to do something more than worry about being disappointed."
"We want the Commission to tell us what solutions it is proposing in order to redress the situation, which is of vital importance for peripheral areas of the Community and for third countries with which we have long maintained relations."
"I repeat, disappointment is not enough."
"We want the Commission, as the executive, to be able to offer positive responses for the future of something which is tremendously important for the economy and the social and political life of other countries."
"We want a little more effort from the Commission on this problem."
"Mr President, Commissioner, just as in Chronicle of a Death Foretold by Gabriel García Márquez, we find that the omens which have been hanging over Community and ACP state banana production in recent years are being fulfilled almost inexorably."
"It is my duty to report, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, that our group accepts (indeed, we could not do otherwise) the appeal panel's ruling on the common organization of the market for the Community's banana import regime."
"This report contains elements which are extremely negative for Community agricultural and commercial interests - not just for the banana sector - as Mr Fischler himself has admitted this afternoon."
"I should also say that we welcome the Commission's stance, which was made known here at a part-session last May, and its subsequent actions."
"Unfortunately, these actions have not been successful in the way that was intended."
"And in this respect I must also express our regret that the Commission failed to adopt other initiatives earlier, to change tack in view of the events."
"Nobody can deny that the panel of experts which produced the World Trade Organization's preliminary report last spring was highly qualified technically."
"But nor would anybody try to claim that those three experts, from Hong Kong, Switzerland and Australia, were previously pro-Community."
"I wonder whether we should not have taken steps to prevent an American citizen very close to the Government of the United States, and previously linked with it, being appointed chairman of the appeal panel on the common organization of the market in bananas."
"I am not passing judgement on intentions, Commissioner, only drawing attention to certain facts."
"It is only fair to acknowledge now that perhaps more could have been done."
"Some of us warned that that was the case, but obviously without success."
"However, we are not here today to feel sorry for ourselves."
"We must try to be constructive and look for solutions."
"We are aware that the common organization of the market in bananas is the result of a complex legislative procedure which seeks a balance between interests which do not always coincide."
"We have many arguments in our favour, Mr Fischler."
"The current regime has meant that both producers and exporters, including important American distribution companies, benefit from the European market."
"The European banana market is the largest in the world, because of both its volume and its prices."
"Current guidelines guarantee access of the dollar-banana to markets which were previously closed to it, yielding prospects of considerable growth in the future."
"Not only does the maintenance of Community and ACP state banana production guarantee the survival of a source of economic resources and employment for less privileged regions and nations, but any of the known alternatives is worse, and probably more expensive, for the Community budget."
"The Commission now has some time - only a little - and several possible courses of action."
"It seems reasonable for it to have announced that it is important to have a technical report to assess the consequences of the Geneva ruling before taking any of these."
"But the time has come for negotiation. A way must be found for dialogue, to find a point of contact between the content of the COM decision (especially those parts relating to the licensing system), and the maintenance of the banana production and income levels of European and ACP farmers."
"In seeking and achieving these aims, Commissioner, you and the Commission have the support of our group and probably of a large majority of this House."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, like the earlier ones, this latest diktat from the World Trade Organization in this banana war is deeply disagreeable in tone, not to say unacceptable to the European Union."
"The Commissioner has informed us of the bureaucratic terms of the diatribe, which is his job."
"However, as rapporteur for this Parliament on the common organization of the banana market, it is up to me to mention another aspect of the problem, which cannot be reduced to mere economics and law."
"Production of bananas in ACP countries, overseas territories and the Community represents more than an item in the trade balance; it is a crucial factor in general economic and social equilibrium."
"The banana is an endemic crop in these countries, it represents the history of the inhabitants but it may have no future if this absurd trade agreement continues to be escalated."
"The high cost of production and marketing means ACP bananas are not competitive on the world market with dollar area bananas, predominantly produced in South America and marketed by United States multinationals."
"These bananas have a monopoly of the United States market and are also conquering the world market."
"In Europe they have 70 % of the market, compared with 30 % for Community and ACP bananas."
"At least this has been the case up to now as, with the contesting of the recent common organization of the market, the trend will be to remove even this small portion, which the poorest depended or depend on thanks to the compensation mechanism."
"The World Trade Organization states that those who fail to be competitive must stop producing bananas, use them themselves and grow something else."
"It is difficult to imagine diversification with such traditional products, and it would also be like changing the cultural connotations, as well as the environmental and economic ones, of entire regions."
"In addition, it would legitimize a highly speculative system."
"In Ecuador the growers get $3-4 a box which is then resold at $22-23."
"An ACP box has a cost price of $8-9 and is sold for $16-18."
"Besides, dollar area bananas also rely on a heavy reduction in duties."
"The compensation to ACP countries serves to guarantee the survival of this crop."
"I am not even sure if the item involved merits a trade agreement."
"Try asking that in Guadeloupe, Martinique, the Dominican Republic or the Canaries."
"Finally, Mr Commissioner, Somalia."
"Not one of the clauses contained in the COM document approved by this Parliament has yet been applied."
"The endemic state of civil war continues to prevent the export of Somalia's quota."
"And the absurd thing is that, on the one hand, we do not help them to be self-sufficient, but on the other we rush to help them with humanitarian aid and even then, Mr Commissioner, it is always the American multinationals who gain."
"Mr President, when we endorsed the GATT Agreement it implied that we also agreed to an independent body to settle disputes."
"We also knew at that time that certain statements before this panel could turn out badly for us."
"That is now clearly the case, but I think there is no alternative but to respect it."
"The first question that arises is what the Commission proposing to do."
"For my group, how banana producers in the European Union itself will be affected is important."
"We feel that these producers must be treated in the same way as other producers of agricultural products in Europe."
"The second point, if I have understood correctly, is whether or not this decision adversely affects the Lomé Agreements."
"If that is the case, then it is important to know what reference quantity the Commission will use."
"The decision says we must use the pre-1991 quantities."
"What exactly are they?"
"Before 1991 there was no common market in bananas."
"How will this quantity be accurate?"
"With regard to the Lomé Agreement, it is also important to know what sort of compensation may be available for the ACP countries."
"Can they diversify their economies with European support?"
"And finally, Mr President, perhaps it is still possible to devote some attention in the Commission's statement to a point that I also mentioned in May and that is, is it possible to give rather more preference to 'fair-crate' bananas, bananas which have been produced in an ecologically sound way and in a socially acceptable manner?"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the United States do not produce bananas, nor do they export them."
"So it is to defend the interests of the great banana companies that exploit Latin America and dominate the world market that they have made a complaint to the WTO against the Community banana imports system."
"The WTO appeal panel has just confirmed the initial conclusions, by rejecting the Commission's appeal."
"This decision is unacceptable."
"It proves once again that, as in the case of hormone meat, the WTO is solely guided by the blind pursuit of free trade, without any concern for the interests of the poorest, the developing countries and Community producers."
"It must be accepted that the WTO ruling was favoured by divisions between the Member States, which weakened the Community position."
"From this point of view, the German leaders played a very harmful role by disputing the common organization of the banana market, even before the Court of Justice."
"Just like German livestock breeders or cereal growers, Community banana producers have a right to have their incomes protected and Community preference applied."
"Commissioner Brittan has just called on the Member States to comply with WTO decisions, by accepting the good with the bad."
"This is not the position of our group."
"In agriculture, be it bananas or hormone meat, there is only the bad and the very bad."
"In its proposed resolution, our group insists anew that neither the European Union nor the Member States should give in to the dictates of the WTO, and that they should do all in their power in order to protect the vital interests of the Community producers and the ACP countries."
"What do you intend to do, Mr Commissioner?"
"For our part, we say we must refuse to change the banana COM, just as we must refuse to pay financial compensation."
"By resisting the WTO ruling, it will be possible to open the way to revising the mechanisms of that organization and its procedures for settling disputes so as to take more account of social, health, cultural and environmental concerns."
"Mr President, even in 1994, following the decision of the GATT group of experts, it should have been clear that the common organization of the banana market did not conform to the rules of free international trade."
"The GATT and the WTO are blind to the requirements of consumer protection, environmental protection and social standards."
"The GATT agreement obeys only the logic of unfettered free trade."
"Even in December 1994, we Greens rejected the WTO Basic Agreement in this Parliament, and were half criticized for it."
"So it is nice to see that some of those in the grand coalition of uncritical WTO-sympathisers have in the meantime found their way to a somewhat more realistic assessment of the World Trade Organization. There are some here in Parliament, and - if Mr Fischler can be believed - there are apparently some in the Commission."
"The WTO threatens the development policy aims of the Community."
"I am afraid the ruling against the common organization of the banana market will become a precedent for condemning all cooperation with ACP states."
"The Lomé Agreement is subject to a WTO exemption only until February 2000."
"Then the World Trade Organization regulations will force a basic modification to the development cooperation of states in the European Union."
"I do not mean by this that the banana COM was perfect in every way."
"Clearly it did not only serve development policy objectives, but because of the system of licensing allocations, it also fuelled competition for market share between the banana multinationals."
"Quotas should be allocated to producing countries, not to importing companies."
"Small and medium businesses, and fair trade initiatives in particular, need appropriate access to the European market."
"An explicit fair trade quota, as has always been demanded by the European Parliament, must at long last be introduced."
"By just such a generously tailored quota for production resulting from social and environmental agreements, EU development policy objectives can be made more visible."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, we were all really eager to see what was going to happen and, following your brief speech, we are all a bit disappointed."
"On behalf of our group, I want to express our definite support of any initiative the European Commission may take, whether legal or administrative, in order to be able to maintain and improve the Community banana regime and thereby guarantee the interests of our producers and those of the ACP states."
"We must prevent the weight of the North American multinationals, whose only aim is to obtain high economic benefits, from weakening and destroying a sector with as many social repercussions as the banana sector."
"This is a sector whose importance for certain regions of the Union (such as the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments) and certain ACP countries goes beyond economics and simple profit, since it represents their system of survival."
"I sincerely believe, Commissioner, that this aspect should be kept very much in mind."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it appears that the WTO panel is preparing to decide against Europe and its ACP partners on 25 September, as regards the Community regime for banana imports. Such a decision would be extremely serious."
"It would make perfectly clear, to those who wish to deny it, the scale of the perverse effects of the WTO, which operates as an exclusive club for the rich countries."
"This decision would indeed call into question a unique form of cooperation, which is both original and effective, and based on a system of commercial preferences arising from the determination of the European Union to develop the economies of its partners in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, by setting great store on high value-added sectors, such as bananas, the spin-off from which has a positive effect on their economies."
"We know the conditions under which bananas from South America, which already represent 75 % of total exports, are produced."
"They bear no relation to the conditions which prevail in ACP areas."
"I am thinking in particular about the French Overseas Departments and Territories, where social standards are those of mainland France."
"How can they be compared to the huge South American plantations, which are regularly criticized by human rights associations for their coercive working methods."
"The results of an award against the European Union would be disastrous in many respects."
"It would call into question the bonds of trust which those involved in cooperation between the ACP and the European Union have forged over long years, sweeping away the obligations that we had entered into as part of the banana COM."
"It would cause the greatest difficulty to the whole of the economy of several of these countries, where banana production can represent as much as 60 % of GDP, because the banana regime is a factor in political stability."
"The social consequences would be disastrous, both among our ACP partners and among the banana producing territories of the European Union."
"So is the Commission going to allow the WTO to dismantle the cooperation that we have built up with the ACP countries?"
"After hormones, veal and bananas, will the Commission allow a continuous and systematic undermining of our arrangements by the WTO, or will the Commission begin to ask serious questions about the way the WTO panels operate and the way they are made up?"
"I have received six motions for resolutions under Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, the banana story is drawing to a close. But this is not a happy ending."
"The story is an example."
"It is not just a matter of an import licence arrangement, a purely technical dossier, it is yet another stage in the great transatlantic war for the control of plant and animal proteins, for the control of the food weapon, with all the familiar stages in that war: wheat war, maize war, genetically modified organisms war, meat war."
"Sometimes we win, or we gain a little time."
"For somatotropin, for hormone milk, the codex alimentarius has granted us one extra year."
"For non-pasteurized cheese, we have one extra year."
"For mineral water, we have been able to impose our definition, which is stricter than the wide definition in the United States."
"The water will really have to come out of the ground, and not be a sort of mineral Coca-Cola."
"But on hormone meat and on bananas, well, we are losing."
"We know the story: Mexico, Ecuador, Honduras and Guatemala, four states enslaved to the United States, have decided to make a complaint - all the others have made an agreement with us - supported by the United States who have no direct interest in the business, except that these countries are where Chiquita, Delmonte and Dole have taken up residence."
"These banana-dollar billionaires say that they are the victims of discrimination."
"They dispute the preferential regime granted to the poor people of Africa, the Caribbean or the Pacific, and in so doing they are calling into question the policies of the European Union, and even the European Union itself, which might possibly be the least negative aspect of this whole affair."
"So first our cooperation and development policy is called into question."
"Lomé IV is being disputed."
"This is the preferential regime granted to the Cameroons and the Ivory Coast, which goes back to General de Gaulle in 1960."
"It was also one of the conditions of the Common Market."
"All these small growers, who have a low level of technology, only account for 7 % of the Community market, some 850, 000 tonnes as against the 2, 500 million tonnes offered to the North American multinationals, and all of this is supposedly getting in the way of the giants."
"This is a perfect expression of economic imperialism, which has gone so far that compensation is being rejected."
"Even if we were prepared to pay compensation, the United States would not take it."
"They want crushing domination."
"Our regional policy for the ultraperipheral regions is called into question because we produce at ECU 50 a day in the Canaries, Madeira, Guadeloupe and Martinique, whereas the multinationals produce at a cost of ECU 50 per month, with their slaves."
"With regard to Honduras, I would remind you that the Honduras army is in multinational hands, and that when the Honduras tax authorities wish to levy taxes on a crate of bananas, they are forbidden to do so."
"Our budget policy is called into question."
"Indeed, at ECU 75 of customs duties per tonne, multiplied by 2, 500 million tonnes, under the pretext of the accession to EU membership of Austria, Sweden and Finland - this all adds up to a gift of ECU 2 billion in banana duties."
"I don't know where Mrs Gradin is, who shows such concern about the financial interests of the European Community and about fraud, but here is a wonderful case of fraud, fraud on the weight of the crates, not to mention the German political parties, who may not be lily-white with regard to Chiquita."
"Finally, our sovereignty over standards is being called into question, our legal sovereignty. European law has had judgement made against it in the first instance, and in the second instance, in Geneva, by a small panel made up of Australians, Swiss and British."
"The superiority of Community law is called into question, by which I mean the law of the Court of Justice of the European Community, the Costa decision against ENEL in 1963, where Community law prevailed over national law."
"Now Community law is dominated by Geneva law."
"This is the victory of globalization over regionalism. And the single currency, may I say with your permission, would not have changed things very much."
"We have been despoiled of our national sovereignty, in favour of Brussels."
"Brussels is abrogating its rights in favour of Geneva."
"What is left of the European Union sovereignty, before it has even been constituted?"
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his comments and I especially welcome those comments which, in effect, suggested that the repercussions will go far beyond bananas."
"That is true."
"This ruling spells despair for many ACP countries."
"They now have a tremendous fear of future WTO rulings."
"Unlike some of my colleagues I did not expect too much from the Commissioner's statement at this point."
"The reason I say that is because I hope he is still discussing with his colleagues what approach to take to arbitration on 25 September."
"What we need to know is whether the Commission is determined to get as good a result as it can."
"We now have to make the best of a bad job."
"The ruling has been made, whether we like it or not."
"What we now have to do is try to salvage something from it."
"When Mrs Kinnock, Mr Thomas and I were in the Windward Islands in May it was quite obvious that the producers there were living in fear - and I mean fear - of the WTO ruling."
"Now that it has appeared, goodness knows what they feel like."
"They said to us that they accept that liberalization and globalization are inevitable in the future."
"But what they need more than anything is time - time to adjust to a very competitive market; in some cases it will take at least five years and in other cases it will take a far longer period until they can compete with dollar-banana producers."
"I therefore ask the Commissioner to take that on board."
"It is essential."
"If he can get those types of concessions from the arbitration deal on 25 September he will have done the Windward Islands a tremendous favour."
"Parliament wants to help."
"We want to play our part."
"We will do so and we will support you; but we need a commitment from the Commission that this is a real attempt to salvage something from this deal."
"I am afraid that in this case free trade means that those countries are free to see their economies and their democracies actually collapse."
"This arbitration outcome is essential."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been discussing the banana regulations in this Parliament for a considerable time and many of the arguments that have been presented ever since I entered Parliament, rather more than three years ago, have been repeated today."
"The debate in this House has moved on a little, however, and I want to emphasize that for anyone who has not entirely grasped that fact."
"In May we held a discussion about the first WTO ruling."
"Our debate at that time was very heated, and so was the discussion in our delegation; there were even some who felt that the ruling was unacceptable."
"The majority decided, however, not to support the wording that the ruling was unacceptable, and I made sure that the liberal group did not support that move either at that time."
"So some movement has entered into the debate."
"If you now read the motion by the Group of the European People's Party, many of you may be surprised that the PPE of all groups is calling for the Commission to present a proposal to amendment the common organization of the market."
"Why has this happened?"
"Obviously it is primarily due to the WTO."
"I believe we have no alternative but to initiate an amendment, because there is no further appeals procedure at the WTO."
"Many may perhaps think that we could now offer compensation, but that is certainly not correct."
"Those who have complained can make us a proposal for compensation."
"If they do not do so - and that appears to be the case - then debating compensation is not an alternative."
"The only alternative would be to call the whole WTO into question, but I do not think the majority of this House would want that."
"Although the WTO could be further developed, social and environmental standards could be more strongly represented, a majority of this House would not essentially question the existence of the WTO."
"For my second point I should like to mention the reason why we should like to see the market regulation amended."
"But it is my personal opinion, and there is still heated debate in my parliamentary group about it."
"I believe it exhibits important weaknesses."
"This is not something I know nothing about: I have investigated the situation in Guadeloupe and St. Lucia, as well as in Latin America."
"This is in no way a case of the good guys being in the ACP and European producer states, and the baddies in Latin America."
"That is simply not so."
"In Ecuador there are more small producers than in the whole of the Windward Islands put together."
"In Ecuador 60 % of the bananas are marketed by small producers, and they particularly suffer from lack of access to the European market."
"They are coming under even more pressure from the multinationals."
"This cannot represent the intention of the initiator."
"I feel, therefore, that it is high time for the COM to be amended."
"The concept of fair trade as proposed by Mr Miller and Mr Kreissl-Dörfler should in my view receive greater emphasis, regardless of the origin of the bananas, as far as that is possible."
"In any case, we cannot avoid an amendment, and I am pleased that here, too, the debate is moving forward."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure I need not remind you that the Community regulation setting up the COM in bananas is the result of a compromise respecting a balance between the interests of the various sources of Community supply (ACP and dollar area), and takes into account earlier commitments of the European Union, namely Community preference, preferential access for ACP state bananas, and GATT rules with regard to third countries."
"The facts available to us, and your speech, Commissioner, lead to the conclusion that the COM in bananas will disappear."
"If such is really the case, it is not just the banana marketing system that is under threat, but the entire Community banana policy."
"Aside from the question of Community preference and privileged access for our traditional partners, there is a point that I, for my part, would wish to raise, and which, unless there is an agreement between ourselves and those who are attacking our production, would finally condemn European production. This is the question of the distribution of licences, as laid down in regulation 404/93."
"The distribution of licences for imports of the allowable quota was set up to establish a balance, in the European Union market, between different types of operator."
"If the basic regulations of 404/93 had granted operators import certificates and customs quotas only on the basis of purchases of Latin American bananas made in the three years prior to the COM, B operators, who had never in the past purchased these bananas, would not, on the basis of that criterion, have had access to the import certificate."
"By setting out a specific provision, namely the granting of 30 % of import licences for Latin American bananas to B operators, the basic regulations precisely avoided the maintenance in the EU single market of the de facto monopoly granted prior to the COM by operators who had always marketed exclusively Latin American bananas."
"The maintenance of this monopoly would have been all the more unlawful as Latin American bananas are less costly and would furthermore have been the only ones under the regulations to benefit from the increase in consumption of bananas in the Community market, due to the restrictions on deliveries of Community and ACP bananas, while the customs quota is adaptable in the light of increase in consumption."
"Also, everything must be done to maintain the banana COM in its current form."
"Banana producers have a right, under the same heading as other agricultural producers, to support from the Union and to the benefits of Community preference."
"Production in the Caribbean, which is regularly hit by natural disasters, will not survive if the principle of distribution of licences is not protected."
"I would like to remind you that in the ultraperipheral regions, the banana is the driving force in the economy."
"Mr President, the rejection of the European Union's efforts to retain the banana regime spells utter disaster to small banana-growers in the Caribbean, in Europe and elsewhere."
"This decision demonstrates how the world free trade system, which we are building, enables rich and powerful multinationals to destroy the livelihoods of poor but hard-working people."
"The producers who have been hit did not represent any threat to the principal banana-growers and suppliers on the Latin American continent."
"The plantation workers of Chiquita, Del Monte and the other multinationals will not receive much benefit."
"Their remuneration is poor, their conditions are bad and their rights to organize TUs are limited."
"At this stage it is difficult to see what can be done to defend the victims of this situation."
"I had hoped that the Commission would spell out the options more carefully."
"Every possible effort must be made to provide help if the changes go through."
"But we should also consider all alternative means of supporting the banana industry in these circumstances."
"We should consult the governments and representatives of all those affected and go back to the World Trade Organization and say that this decision is totally unacceptable."
"More must, however, be done if this results in the ruination of small economies, increased poverty, a boost to drug production and criminality."
"We must seek to put in hand measures to modify the system itself."
"The Commission, Parliament and the Council should come together to formulate a programme, perhaps convening a conference and conducting a campaign to safeguard the interests of all small producers at risk, of whom the small banana producers are typical."
"And, we must, of course, continue to the end to give every possible support to those people who are the victims of this decision."
"(Applause )"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the European Union has a priority obligation to defend, at all times and in all circumstances, the interests of the Member States and their regions, and also to honour the commitments it has made with third countries."
"This position is all the more compelling when it involves the defence of the interests of European regions which are heavily penalized by negative structural factors in their economies and limited development, aggravated by peripheral geography and territorial discontinuity."
"Banana production in European regions like the Autonomous Region of Madeira constitutes the principal and sometimes the only source of income for many thousands of Madeiran families and makes a strong contribution to the environmental balance of the region."
"The economic and environmental damage, amongst other things, of having to reduce banana production in Madeira drastically, as a result of complete liberalization of trade in this product, is incalculable."
"It will be unacceptable for the European Union not to maintain and defend a policy of quantitative management of the European market."
"Especially when - as is widely known - Community producers are not competing under the same conditions as others in a completely free market."
"We think it would be appropriate to affirm now that, along with this policy of quantitative management, the European Union must continue to have available a system of income support, already in existence moreover, and that it must not only be maintained but must be fundamentally strengthened."
"The policy of cooperation and support to the development of ACP countries established for decades and enshrined in successive Lomé agreements and in the European development fund is a necessary and sufficient basis to make it unacceptable for the European Union not to be able to apply preferential treatment to these countries in the banana sector, when it maintains this same preferential treatment in many other sectors."
"For all these reasons and many more, which fall outside these terms of reference, we would like to corroborate and strengthen here the motion for a resolution presented by the Group of the European People's Party."
"And, if possible, we would also like to know the Commissioner's views."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, no-one would ever have thought, even me, who voted against the GATT agreement, that it would be transformed, in the name of 'free trade' , into an extremely protectionist organization."
"That is exactly the perverse effect that has been achieved."
"An oligarchy has been established, dominated by the United States, which is protecting itself."
"Increasingly fat, increasingly rich, bent on a trade war without quarter."
"This is what the free trade position actually means, and everyone here knew that."
"Only 80 or 90 Members voted against."
"But I cannot content myself with the disgrace of others and the blunders committed: the truth is this Parliament has no moral authority to criticize, at this time, the very monster that it allowed to be created at that time."
"It was this Parliament that gave it strength, it was this Parliament that fed it, and it is this Parliament which now bewails the destruction wrought by the monster it created!"
"What right do I have, coming from a small country which has an island where there are nine thousand banana producers, to protest here? 'Nine thousand banana producers?"
"Let them do something else!' say the Americans."
"But what, when there is no alternative? 'Do something else, or ask the Japanese how to commit harakiri' ."
"That is a solution because, in fact, there are no alternatives, there is no protection, no protectionism, at this time, only the free traders enjoy it, because they have judges who are, of course, biassed on issues of this kind."
"Mr President, I realize that, because of the delicacy of the issue, Commissioner Fischler has been extremely cautious this afternoon."
"Next week the Commission will have to make an important decision, and I think it is a good thing that we have the opportunity to express our opinion to the Commissioner before the Commission makes that decision. I also hope that the Commissioner is taking note of what is being said in this Parliament which, as the Commissioner will see, is composed of a wide political and geographical spectrum, in which not only the banana-producing countries but also the majority of Parliament defend a stable regime."
"I should like to draw the Commission's attention to a point which has perhaps not been sufficiently stressed this afternoon."
"What we have been dealing with is free trade. Has it occurred to the Commission or the World Trade Organization that the greatest attack on free trade at the moment is being perpetrated by the multinationals who have turned the world banana market into a cartel?"
"The other day I travelled on a plane with some independent producers from Ecuador, who represent about 25 % of the banana production, and they assured me that they have no freedom - they have no choice but to hand over their fruit to the multinationals."
"Besides having converted the world market into a cartel and having 100 % of the North American market, which is a very rich market, the multinationals at the moment have 65 % of the Community market."
"If current attempts to establish this regime in the name of free trade lead to the loss of the small 30 % of the Community market which is all that remains to Community producers and ACP countries which have traditionally exported to the Union, then we will have done away with free trade."
"I believe, Mr Commissioner, that at this moment the Commission has some regulations about free competition under Community law which the World Trade Organization has failed to take into account; it must be remembered that the World Trade Organization also has powers relating to services. What is being attempted is precisely the destruction of free trade."
"Free trade is not being defended."
"It is we who must defend free trade against the cartelization of the banana market by the large multinationals."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is important for the European Union to respect international agreements and, as part of this, the rulings of international courts."
"It is important for the very reasons that we want Member States of the EU to respect EU rules."
"We have entered into these agreements because in many respects nation states are too small and because it pays to cooperate within a common set of rules, even if in some cases we think the rules are against us."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is founded on the realization that free trade benefits the world economy and our own economy."
"That is why we participate in the World Trade Organization."
"Within that organization we have, like other countries, made certain commitments which must be respected."
"If we break them because they do not suit us, other countries will break their commitments when it suits them but does not suit us."
"The discriminatory import barriers which we are now discussing were introduced because, if they were given a free choice, consumers would to a large extent prefer to buy bananas from other sources."
"Imports should therefore be deregulated also out of consideration for consumers."
"Import barriers lead to bananas being more expensive than they would otherwise be."
"If this import system did not conflict with international agreements we have entered into, such a price increase might possibly be acceptable, but then only on condition that the import barrier really provided proper support for the development of the ACP countries."
"But it does not."
"The import regulations are very complicated and have given rise to a trade in licences as a result of the extra money consumers are forced to pay."
"To a considerable extent this money ends up in the hands of bureaucratic middlemen."
"Therefore the EU must change its current rules on the banana trade for several reasons: because it is in accordance with our international commitments, because it would benefit consumers, and because there are more effective ways to support the developing countries within the ACP in their efforts to find forward-looking structures of production."
"If we do not follow the WTO's ruling we will be exposed to costly counter-measures."
"The EU's credibility, when we talk in the WTO and elsewhere about free trade and respect for agreements entered into, will be damaged."
"Mr President, I thank Commissioner Fischler for affording us this opportunity to discuss a very important issue."
"I am sure he would acknowledge, as I do, that the clear winner after this WTO ruling is Chiquita bananas."
"It is as a direct result of the improper influence which Chiquita exerted over the US Administration that the complaint was originally made to the WTO."
"As I am sure he is aware, a Senate committee is now looking at this influence and perhaps will shed some light on what was a rather sordid part of the US presidential election campaign."
"The Caribbean producers have been somewhat perplexed at the ruling of the WTO."
"They were denied full participation in the WTO, their legal representatives were expelled from the WTO and then, to cap it all, an American chaired the appeal."
"If you can call this impartial or if you can acknowledge that this is completely insensitive to the needs of the Caribbean, then I am sure you would wish to do that."
"Last week I visited the United States and I was astonished at the number of times I had to remind them that aid is no substitute for trade and that we have a very important development commitment here."
"It is one that they are completely ignorant of, and they are completely ignorant of the impact of this decision on the Caribbean."
"I would like some clarification from the Commissioner on whether the precedent set by the Japanese agreement of 15 months ago on compliance is one which the Commission will be sticking to."
"I would also like to know whether the Commission is aware of the American amendments to our regime which have been drawn up at this moment and whether it intends to object to them, as I hope."
"Finally, I would like to ask whether we might have some consistency from the Commission."
"Sir Leon Brittan says that we have other irons in the fire and that therefore we must accept the hormone/beef decision and the banana decision."
"Commissioner Pinheiro says that we must have very clear development objectives in our international economic relations."
"Commissioner Fischler says that we should not implement the hormone panel findings but provide compensation."
"He is no doubt right."
"So why can we not consider a similar approach to the banana dispute as he has adopted to the hormone panel disputes?"
"Mr President, it is hard to do justice to the extreme injustice of this decision in one minute but I will try to portray to Members the conversations Mrs Kinnock and I had in Washington last week."
"I have to say that the Caribbean ambassadors were utterly devastated by this decision."
"They feel they have nowhere to turn, that they have been heavily penalized and hammered by a large country and squeezed out by multinationals."
"We believe that this is unfair."
"They represent only 3 % of world trade."
"As European consumers it is our right to be able to buy bananas from those areas which represent good value for money and which reflect the democratic rights and good social standards that we expect and promote in those countries."
"I believe that the Commission has a very firm obligation to help out those countries."
"It is no good saying, as the US has said to us, that diversification is the answer."
"They said very glibly 'textiles is the answer' , but it has to be pointed out that the US is one of the most protectionist countries in textiles in the world."
"That is not the answer for those countries."
"We want to exercise our right."
"We want to ensure that they do have a right to grow bananas, in particular in the interests of the many people involved in banana production in those countries."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 noon."
"Chernobyl, Khmelnitsky and Rovno 4 nuclear reactors"
"The next item is the oral question by Mr Scapagnini (B4-0519/97 - O-0087/97), on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, to the Commission, on the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor by 2000 and the completion of the Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 nuclear reactors in Ukraine."
"Mr President, today our committee would like to put on record that eleven years after the Chernobyl disaster, the problem is still unresolved."
"The solution is linked to the will to affirm the role of the European Union in the recovery and development of countries like Ukraine where distortions linked to the move from a state economy to a market economy persist, distortions which are a burden on daily life."
"We have heard and you will hear from Mr Adam how this state of affairs continues to weigh down everyday life in those countries."
"The European Union has an instrument - pretty limited, true - in the Euratom loans to improve the safety and efficiency of reactors in third countries."
"It is also true that we, as a Community, are the principal contributors to what is called 'nuclear safety' at the EBRD, created to manage G-24 aid to the eastern countries."
"The Memorandum of Understanding signed in Ottawa in December 1995, provided for the closure of the Chernobyl reactor in the year 2000, completed by a long term energy strategy including, as a least cost investment plan, the completion of reactors K2 and R4 which you, Mr President, have mentioned."
"The report, chaired by Professor Surrey of Sussex University, was followed, as we know, by an avalanche of documents, including the Lahmeyer and Stone & Webster report, the subject of analysis by our parliamentary committee."
"All this has done no more than create further confusion on the matter and has not indicated a clear route for taking a decision at Community level."
"We recall that we have held specific hearings on this issue, we have listened to the experts, we have also analysed the positions of those countries, of the energy committees and agencies, but the plain fact is that nothing has changed."
"The EBRD itself has established a series of working groups in order to clarify to what point the conditions of economic viability, environmental viability and nuclear safety are respected in the chosen option - least cost investment - to complete the Russian-designed WWER 1000 megawatt electrical power Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 reactors, to meet the safety standards approved by whoever originally conceived of these nuclear reactors."
"Time is passing and the decision of the EBRD is still awaited."
"That is why we strongly urge the European Commission to let us know its own position on this matter and to make it very clear whether we should await the position of the EBRD or not; otherwise - clearly - we have to assess whether the European Union should dissociate its actions as regards Euratom loans from the activities of the EBRD, whose logic could diverge from the Community's modus operandi on this particular dossier."
"Mr President, despite the multiple difficulties we have faced in getting to the truth of the matter, we are now aware of a range of different interpretations of the facts themselves and we have succeeded in getting a general picture of the situation thanks to the excellent work of Mr Gordon Adam."
"As you know, the vice-chairman of our committee has been to Ukraine several times, he has kept us up-to-date on what is going on and will be in a position to summarize it to the House with full knowledge of the facts."
"In May he returned with extremely important news, backed up by the interparliamentary delegation chaired by Mrs Erika Mann."
"Mr Adam's excellent report in fact ends with a disturbing analysis of the need for Ukraine to be independent in present and future energy resources."
"Mr President, we anxiously await the Commission's response to this question."
"The importance of this issue and the tragedy of a situation, unchanged for eleven years, and capable of having dramatic repercussions on us all at any time, escapes no-one."
"Mr President, I am sorry to interrupt this debate, but I am somewhat confused."
"I understood that we were to have a response from the Commissioner to the previous debate and that we would not just move on to the next debate."
"Do we have to wait until the end of this debate to give Commissioner Fischler the chance to respond?"
"What exactly is happening?"
"Mrs Kinnock, the Commission did not ask to reply on the last item and that is why I closed the debate, precisely because there was no request to speak."
"We are now on another item."
"Mr President, first of all I want to apologize for being late."
"I would like to go into Mr Scapagnini's question about Chernobyl and I will begin by giving a brief general picture concerning Chernobyl before dealing with specific questions in more detail."
"In December 1995 the G7 decided on a comprehensive programme to support the decision by President Kuchma to proceed with the closure of Chernobyl in the year 2000."
"In 1995 the Memorandum of Understanding was drawn up, containing various measures for the reform of the energy sector in Ukraine with the aim of establishing an energy sector that conforms with the market."
"The emphasis is on the implementation of measures to achieve energy saving and greater energy efficiency."
"Furthermore, there are also measures to modernize non-nuclear generation and to increase the safety of the existing nuclear reactors."
"The G7 has now made considerable progress in the implementation of this programme."
"Some US$ 1 billion in the form of loans have been made available for investments in non-nuclear projects and some $ 500 million have been raised for the purchase of equipment, the subsidizing of technical studies and projects relating to the closure of the Chernobyl power plant."
"The $ 100 million recently made available by the Commission for the renewal of the sarcophagus also forms part of the sum of $ 500 million."
"Important aspects of the G7 policy for Ukraine are therefore the modernization of thermal and hydro-electric power stations, the promotion of energy saving, but also, as rightly stated by the European Parliament, the financing of the dismantling of two nuclear power stations, Rovno 4 and Khmelnitsky 2, still under construction."
"As is well-known, the financing of this project has been the subject of frequent consultation within the G7."
"A number of important points are at issue here."
"The agreements in force as laid down in the Memorandum of Understanding must be observed in full."
"Because the objective of closing Chernobyl in the year 2000 can in no way be jeopardized."
"Particularly as the only reactor still in operation, unit 3, is in poor condition as was recently confirmed again in a report by independent experts."
"Moreover, financing by us offers the only guarantee that the dismantling of the uncompleted plants will take place in accordance with international nuclear safety standards."
"As stated in the MOU, the financing of the reactor must take place on the basis of the least cost principle; however, in practice it has transpired that it is difficult to come to unambiguous conclusions on this point."
"Renowned international organizations and experts differ in their opinions on the parameters to be taken as the starting point for studies of least cost."
"Future economic developments in Ukraine and the resulting demand for energy, for example, are difficult to determine and estimate."
"Taking all this into consideration, after serious and in-depth deliberation with the other G7 partners, the Commission has come to the conclusion that a phased implementation of the Rovno 4 and Khmelnitsky 2 project offers the best guarantee for the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding."
"This implies that after the completion of the preparatory work in the first half of next year, the financing of the first unfinished reactor can be set in motion by Euratom."
"The Commission is, however, of the opinion that this can only happen if at that time the other international financial institutions, in the first place, and particularly the EBRD, have also played their part and made a loan available; if, furthermore, the Ukraine authorities have again confirmed that Chernobyl will be closed in the year 2000 and also if sufficient guarantees are obtained for the dismantling of the reactors on the basis of international nuclear safety standards; and if, finally, a number of other technical and financial conditions have been met satisfactorily."
"That brings me to the more specific questions."
"Mr President, I have sensed a certain dissatisfaction in Parliament about the provision of information on this complicated but at the same time politically sensitive subject."
"As a result of this I have instructed the Commission departments to send you immediately, Mr President, copies of studies, reports and other relevant material."
"I have also in the last few months personally had detailed discussions on a number of occasions with individual members of Parliament concerned about these problems."
"With the aid of our Tacis technical assistance programme a safety programme for the two uncompleted reactors concerned has been developed."
"Guidelines from the International Atomic Energy Agency underlie this programme."
"Independent experts have also carried out a study of the current state of the two reactors."
"As you know, they are 70 % completed but the work has been stopped for some years."
"The condition of the reactors has therefore deteriorated to a certain degree and some additional work will probably be necessary."
"There is close collaboration between the EBRD and the Commission with regard to the preparation of the loan applications, although the criteria and procedures for the EBRD on the one hand and Euratom on the other hand do differ from each other."
"The EBRD in particular has not yet prepared a final judgment on the loan application submitted to it."
"We are also awaiting, I believe, a final study by the European Investment Bank before the Euratom loan can be finalized."
"The Commission recently responded to the report by the European Court of Auditors on activities of Tacis in the field of nuclear energy in Ukraine."
"On the basis of this report, a number of mainly administrative measures have been taken."
"The report, however, did not contain any explicit reference to the two unfinished nuclear reactors."
"Finally, I would point out that there is no direct involvement of the EBRD nuclear safety account in the implementation of the R4/K2 project."
"As far as I know, this programme is being implemented with due regard to the content of the relevant Council decision."
"Mr President, few countries in the world have more difficulty producing, importing and using energy than Ukraine."
"I quote from the International Energy Agency's report on energy in Ukraine which was published very recently."
"We are faced with a mix of economic and political issues on a grand scale."
"First of all, the Ukrainians are very concerned about their energy dependence."
"They are very dependent on Russia for oil and gas and they do not want to become any more dependent than they are at present."
"The prospects in their own coal industry are not good so it is not surprising that they have decided to carry on with their nuclear industry."
"I have to say that I do not think there is any likelihood of the country giving up its nuclear option."
"That is something we have to come to terms with. It becomes a question of what sort of safety culture is going to operate."
"Is it going to be the old Russian standards, or is it going to be the safety culture we have developed here in Western Europe?"
"The other problem they are facing is the question of introducing a free market, in particular in electricity."
"Private customers are not doing badly in paying their bills but the large industrial consumers are still trying to barter."
"There is not an electricity market in anything like the sense that we would understand it. We cannot expect it be done in five minutes."
"After all, it took our own European Council six years to work out how it would have an internal electricity market here."
"Energoatom, the company which is managing a privatized nuclear industry with considerable funding from the European countries is now operating under a new chairman and under a new energy minister but it has a long way to go to fulfil anything like the conditions that are set down."
"This is the sticking point."
"We have not been able to make the financial provision."
"Study after study tells us what has to be done on both the thermal and nuclear side but we seem to be incapable of making the financial arrangements."
"If I understand the Commissioner correctly, what has now been decided is that the two reactors are going to be completed with funds from Euratom and the EIB and that the EBRD is going to have no part of that."
"I find that a bit surprising because the whole tenor of my argument was going to be that the EBRD had to make its mind up as quickly as possible."
"That is where we need clear-cut decisions so that we can see where we are going."
"The Ukrainians want to have us as their friends."
"We have to show greater willingness than we have in the last two years."
"Commissioner, as Mr Adam said, we would like to have firm information and not just guesses about whether the EBRD is going to respond or not - you still don't know - and whether Euratom and the EBRD will finance these two reactors if Ukraine makes certain promises."
"We are always talking and doing studies, yet the question is so simple."
"We are not talking about whether there should or should not be nuclear power, nor are we deciding the energy policy of Ukraine (which only the Ukrainians have the right to do)."
"We are saying that the whole of Europe, and the Ukrainians most of all, want all the Chernobyl units to be shut down, especially unit 3, which is currently operation, the sarcophagus to be repaired, and the necessary efforts made."
"As Mr Adams rightly said, the economic situation in Ukraine is still extremely difficult."
"The regime and situation are still the same as when they were under socialist control. Either we give them real technological assistance or help them economically, or it will all continue to be just empty words."
"In truth, as Mr Adam also explained to us so well, they do not want to depend any longer on Russian gas."
"They find it very difficult to pay for, because many customers also do not pay for it."
"Also, many people do not receive their pay, and the economic and social chaos in the countries of the former Soviet Union makes life very difficult. That is the reality, but that is not what we are talking about."
"So, Chernobyl must be shut down."
"But they have to produce electricity somehow, until they can use less. It should be very easy to save electricity in Ukraine, because they waste it."
"But, Mr Commissioner, you know better than I that it is very expensive. Saving energy requires enormous investment, starting with the introduction of metres to measure electricity, then creating a market, renewing equipment, replacing power stations and doing all sorts of things."
"Surely nothing requires more investment than saving energy, even when it is absolutely necessary."
"Therefore, since we all want Chernobyl to be shut down, the Ukrainian Parliament has said that if the Khmelnitsky 2 group and Rovno 4 are not completed - and soon, I should imagine - they will start up another of the inactive Chernobyl units."
"Do the Ukrainians want to take risks?"
"Well, of course not, but we all know - at least those of us who understand the sector - that they need electricity to get out of the extremely difficult situation they are in."
"All in all, it seems to me that the Union's support is essential for really working out how to save energy. It may perhaps be as simple as installing electricity and gas metres in homes so that people can pay for it, even if it is at a very low price."
"There is no better way of persuading people to save energy than giving it a reasonably appropriate price. It is also true that for that method to work, people will need to be paid, which in many cases does not happen."
"But this programme to re-equip new power stations, which I think is excellent, should deliver more. $ 1, 000 million have been given."
"It is true that much more is needed."
"It is also true that the Chernobyl sarcophagus needs $ 700 million - it has been an effort for the Tacis programme to contribute $ 100 million."
"But something else will have to be done, Mr Commissioner, because the whole of Europe, not just this Parliament, not just the Members, not just the representatives of the people, but the people themselves, think the Chernobyl problem must be solved once and for all, and this involves measures from energy-saving and safety to the remodelling of the sarcophagus."
"And, above all, the Ukrainians are tired of our criticisms; they beg us to criticize them less and help them more."
"Unfortunately, that is the situation."
"Mr President, we are all agreed, Chernobyl must close in the year 2000."
"But that was clearly linked to taking the least cost principle as the starting point for dismantling the two nuclear power plants."
"That was agreed in December 1995 between the G7 and Ukraine."
"And that principle has now been abandoned, by the Commission as well."
"The EBRD panel is well aware that dismantling the two existing nuclear power plants is a poor use of funds."
"So the principle has been abandoned."
"I do not think that the phased implementation of the two nuclear plants under construction to be the best way."
"We disapprove of this and we understand from the Commissioner that next year the Euratom financing for the two existing nuclear plants will commence."
"That means that $ 410 million will be provided by Euratom, $ 340 million by the EBRD and $ 200 million by the G7."
"That is money badly spent, not accounted for to the voters."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner if the Commission can still turn the tide to some extent by only supporting either K2 or R4 financially, and I hope it can."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I will not repeat what my colleagues have said because I think we concur."
"We are naturally in agreement on closing Chernobyl, and we agree on increasing safety generally."
"However, Mr Commissioner, please allow me to widen the issue a little."
"What are we planning for beyond the millennium?"
"The year 2000 is very close."
"How many nuclear power stations are there in existence or still being built in Eastern Europe, installations using old technology, dangerous nuclear technology, and to what extent will we be committed to them?"
"For how many years will we be committed to them and to their poor safety conditions?"
"That, I think, is the big problem."
"The second problem, and I agree entirely with Mr Eisma, who emphasized it, is the cost."
"As we ask economics students at university, is there an alternative to this very high cost?"
"Is it possible for us to accept such a high cost, which will, in my opinion, have controversial results, and not examine alternative uses for these funds for future energy solutions that will be safer and, in the long term, possibly more productive?"
"That is the essential point, Mr Commissioner. I know that I am moving away a little from the specific question about Chernobyl, but I believe we need to think again about the whole issue."
"Thank you very much, Mr Papayannakis."
"The debate is adjourned."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is question time (B4-0520/97). We will take questions to the Commission."
"The Commission has examined Mr Escudero's question very carefully."
"It is a question which obviously has implications which go beyond the Kaleidoscope programme, since it indirectly affects all the cultural programmes which have just come into force."
"These programmes provide for projects involving all the various activities to be presented at periodic meetings, and for these to be made public."
"As a result of these meetings, the Commission receives many projects from the cultural organizers - projects which need to be evaluated throughout the selection process."
"For this process, the Commission can seek the opinion of competent individuals within the cultural sectors. These experts have a purely consultative role and take no decisions about the finance awarded to each project."
"It is the Commission's responsibility, in accordance with what has been agreed with Parliament and the Council, to finalize the list of those projects which it considers should receive Community support."
"In appointing these experts, the Commission can accept names proposed by the appropriate national authorities. But it can also, when appropriate, call directly upon acknowledged experts in the various cultural sectors."
"The Commission is careful to rotate the experts, so that opinions are not always sought from the same people."
"It tries to bring in new experts, and ensures that their report is arrived at completely independently and in accordance with objective criteria."
"On behalf of the Commission, I should like to inform Mr Escudero that the names and professional qualifications of the experts consulted in this way are available to Parliament and the Council."
"I therefore place the names of these experts at his disposal, and that of Parliament."
"As I said, they rotate over time, because we believe that they should not always be the same, in accordance with the two criteria I mentioned a moment ago."
"Mr President, I should just like to thank the Commissioner for his reply, which has clarified things greatly for me."
"The fact that the experts are changed periodically seems to me a very important point."
"When it is convenient, I should like to avail myself of the Commissioner's kind offer to let me see the names of the experts who have taken part."
"I just want to say I can give Mr Escudero the list of these people immediately, in the form he has mentioned, so that he can make use of it as he sees fit."
"Mr Commissioner, I have two questions: first, the extent to which the advancement of minority groups and/or minority languages, perhaps better called 'languages less often used in the European Union' , play a part in Kaleidoscope; and secondly, what role is played in Kaleidoscope by the eastward enlargement and the preparatory process for the candidate states."
"First, I want to tell you that I have an enormous respect for all languages."
"Obviously, some are less used than others because of the number of people who speak them, but the Commission clearly demonstrates the importance of every language, and not just the official languages but also those other languages which, while they may not be the official language of any State, are used in a certain community or region."
"The Commission bears all these aspects specifically in mind."
"As regards your other question, I should particularly like to thank you for having raised it because, on various occasions during the structured discussions which we hold with countries which have applied to join the Community, the question has been raised as to what extent they can participate in the cultural sphere."
"As you know, in many of the proposals this is covered by some existing Community programme which can allocate resources, such as the Phare programme itself, but the choice is theirs."
"Something I try to encourage in my discussions with these countries is that they should not just use the aid for strictly economic purposes, but should also use it for cultural matters."
"I believe that is very important."
"Although these countries can still have problems with the development of a market economy or the application of Community patrimony, nevertheless there is no doubt that they can contribute to the final composition of the cultural sphere."
"Question No 23 by Birgitta Ahlqvist (H-0596/97)"
"Subject: The 'Television without frontiers' directive"
"Following the Commission's rejection on 14 February 1996 of the amendment to Directive 89/552/EEC (Television without frontiers), the purpose of which was to prohibit advertising directed at under-twelves, Commissioner Oreja promised that the Commission would conduct a wide-ranging study of the effects of advertising on children."
"On Wednesday, 9 July 1997, the Court of Justice ruled in the De Agostini case that Sweden could not ban advertising aimed at children carried by TV channels broadcasting from other countries, such as TV3 or Kanal 5."
"Sweden does, however, have the right to take action against misleading advertising broadcast by the same TV companies."
"The Court's judgement could be contradictory because, as pointed out in the Swedish National Board for Consumer Policies' study of children and advertising, "" younger children in particular often take literally what is said about various products' ."
"If that is true, then advertising aimed at children must be deemed to be misleading."
"What progress has the Commission made with the study it promised, and when is it planning to brief Parliament on its findings?"
"The 'Television without frontiers' directive was approved in 1989, as Mrs Ahlqvist well knows."
"We are now in the process of revising the directive and hope that it will soon be able to come into effect as a result of its transfer to the various Member States."
"It has taken us nearly two years to make the leap from the previous to the current directive."
"Well, that 'Television without frontiers' directive, as approved in 1989, contained two articles about the protection of children. Article 16 established effective, concrete, specific resources designed to prevent advertising from harming children morally or physically."
"Article 22 of this same directive established general resources designed to prevent television broadcasts from damaging children's physical, mental or moral development."
"The Court of Justice, in its rulings on these measures and certain well-known cases (the Agostini affair and TV Shop) describes them as a complete set of measures specifically designed for the protection of children from television programmes in general and television advertising in particular."
"Also, the Court of Justice makes a clear distinction between misleading advertising and television advertising designed to attract children's attention."
"So these are two clearly separate questions."
"Therefore, the Commission is not worried about the possible contradictory effects to which the honourable Member refers."
"We have carefully examined the honourable Member's question, but we do not believe these contradictory effects occur."
"In fact, by modifying the 1989 directive with the adoption of this new directive, the measures in question are strengthened, but without going as far as prohibiting television advertising directed at children."
"In fact, neither Parliament, the Council nor the Commission felt that such a prohibition was necessary or justified. The three institutions actually reached agreement on that in the end."
"Nevertheless, taking account of a petition from a delegation to the Council, the Commission did promise to carry out a study into the repercussions of television advertising and telesales on children, with a view to re-examining this question when the directive underwent its first revision."
"As you know, the directive has several years of life, so to speak, before being revised again."
"When I took up this portfolio in 1994 I found that the time-limit had expired, and that is why we carried out that revision, and there will be another one soon."
"We are certainly going to pay particular attention to this matter."
"I should like to tell the honourable Member that I am extremely aware of the matter she has raised, and I share her concerns."
"But I believe that we have found an answer in the directive itself, and we will continue to be very vigilant. It is for precisely that reason that we want to carry out the study on the effects of television advertising and telesales on children."
"As I say, the Commission is going to carry out that study in plenty of time, bearing in mind that Article 26 of the directive states that the Commission has to present the report on its application by 31 December 2000 at the latest, with proposals for its alteration, if necessary."
"And of course, the European Parliament will receive a special briefing on the report."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Oreja for this answer."
"I am very pleased that you are positive about carrying out a study on children and how they react to children's advertisements."
"However, I also received the same promise from the Commissioner in the Committee on Culture in February."
"I was under the impression, in fact, that the Commission had started this study."
"I therefore hope that a start will be made as soon as possible, since this is a major problem, not only in our country, Sweden, but throughout Europe."
"Children should not be a means of making profits."
"Nor should they be exposed to these sales messages which they cannot properly interpret because of their lack of experience."
"I shall keep coming back with this question until this study is started, which I hope will be very soon."
"Consumers in Sweden have, by the way, reacted very strongly against the unrestricted children's advertising found in Europe."
"Mr President, I should like to inform Mrs Ahlqvist that the study has already started and there is no reason why it should not be discussed even before it is finished, probably within the framework of the Committee on Culture rather than the part-session."
"And it will be very valuable for the Commission to follow up the various viewpoints which may be expressed, so that in the end we can present a text which I hope may be acceptable to everybody."
"I come from the same country as Mrs Ahlqvist and I am not particularly happy with this answer."
"As I understand it, you expect to have an answer by 31 December 2000 at the latest."
"That is a very long way off."
"At least, that is the impression you gave me just now."
"The choice of media is growing very fast."
"There are more and more TV channels, and advertising is taking greater and greater liberties."
"I think it would not be out of place perhaps if we received a somewhat more definite answer about when this study will be completed since it has been one and a half years since the issue was first raised in this Parliament."
"The answer which was then given was that a study was under way."
"I think that the answer could be made more precise than simply giving a date in the Twenty-first Century."
"Mr Lindqvist, I should like to point out that Parliament has already expressed its opinion on this matter, because there was an amendment, and that amendment did not receive sufficient votes when the 'Television without frontiers' directive was debated."
"So the current position has had the backing of Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"I put it to you that you are now trying to alter something which was approved by Parliament only a few months ago, when the transfer of the current directive has not yet come into force in any country."
"We are therefore talking about the future, about what the law ought to be."
"This is a subject to which the Commission is particularly sensitive. As you well know, we have not been content with just a directive but we have also brought out a Green Paper in which we tried to respond to the important problem of the protection of children."
"Thus we do not believe that the existing legislation is enough, but rather we want to investigate what can be done in the future."
"I want to show you that there is no lack of interest on the part of the Commission."
"Parliament made its decision, and there was an amendment along the lines of what has been suggested by the two Swedish representatives here."
"That amendment did not get enough votes and that is why it has not been included in the directive."
"That, therefore, is the situation currently in force - the law as it stands."
"What I can assure you of is that the Commission is keen, and that is why we are carrying out a study."
"There is no need to wait for the study to be finished before it is made known to Parliament. Instead, we can exchange our views within the framework of the Committee on Culture."
"It will be very valuable for us to hear your ideas, the experiences you have had, and the examples you can give us."
"We have not finished the study; we have hardly started it."
"Your contributions will therefore be very useful to us."
"At the moment I cannot tell you what the outcome of the study will be."
"I understand the honourable Member's impatience, because he wants a quick answer and I can not give him the final answer at this moment. We will know it at the end of the study."
"What I can tell him is that we are not going to carry out this study in isolation, but in collaboration with you. And not only with you, but also with those members of the European public who have something to say to us on this matter."
"It is a matter which interests and concerns us, and which we want to get right. So I can assure you that we will act together, we will listen to your ideas, we will make progress within a few months."
"I hope to be able to go to the Committee on Culture and tell you how far we have progressed in our deliberations and, finally, on the agreed date, the Commission will formally present the document."
"Question No 24 by Mr James Fitzsimons (H-0676/97) will not be taken because it is on the agenda for the current part-session."
"Question No 25 by Irini Lambraki (H-0563/97)"
"Subject: Agreements between airlines"
"What action does the Commission intend to take to protect the European public against agreements between airlines which infringe IATA safety rules and EU competition rules, as in the case of the agreement between Sabena and Virgin?"
"The Commission is satisfied that agreements between airlines have not resulted in violations of existing safety rules."
"All Community carriers possess the appropriate licences and operator certificates under the terms of the 1992 Council regulation on the licensing of carriers."
"If an agreement between air carriers results in substantial change in their activities, the air carriers concerned must notify those changes to the national licensing authorities."
"Those licensing authorities are therefore in a position to monitor the possible consequences for air safety of any agreement entered into between Community carriers and, of course, they fulfil that duty."
"As far as competition is concerned, air transport within the Community is subject to the competition rules of the Treaty on the basis of the 1987 Council regulation."
"Under Article 85 of the Treaty any agreement between air carriers which may affect trade between Member States and which results in the restriction and distortion of competition within the common market is incompatible with the common market and is therefore prohibited."
"The exception to that rule, as provided for in both the 1987 and the 1993 regulations, is those agreements which may ultimately result in better services for consumers when such agreements have as their purpose the joint planning and coordination of schedules, the joint operation of services on new or low-density routes, the holding of tariff consultations and slot-allocation and airport scheduling."
"Mr President, I am sorry but I do not entirely agree with the Commissioner because, as a passenger, I have experienced distortion of the regulation."
"As a passenger travelling from Rome, I felt I was being exploited, first because half the people on the same flight had paid a reduced charter rate, while I had paid the normal price because of my Sabena ticket."
"Secondly, my ticket was issued by Sabena, a company which is a member of IATA, while I was travelling, without my knowledge, with a company which was not a member of IATA."
"I think it would be worthwhile for the Commission to investigate these matters seriously because, in my opinion, this represents clear violation of the competition rules."
"Secondly, I feel even more strongly that it is a question of passenger safety and, at least now that so much is heard about airline companies, we must bear in mind the safety of thousands of people who travel both in Europe and elsewhere."
"For my part, I will study the regulations that you mentioned, Mr Commissioner, and I will come back, but I think it would be a good idea for you to investigate the particular case that I referred to in the question."
"I should like briefly to respond to what is obviously a genuine concern of the honourable Member."
"Firstly, unless the airlines involved, like all other air carriers in the European Union, satisfied the safety rules, they simply would not have licences."
"Consequently, if the honourable Member has identified what she believes to be unsafe practices, then I hope that she will be able to provide evidence of that, which I am certain both the airlines concerned and the regulatory authorities would want to assess."
"Secondly, the honourable lady is obviously entitled to her view as a consumer and passenger and entitled to make complaint."
"That is her right."
"But what is not appropriate is to make an allegation about distortion of competition when, basically, her complaint appears to be about the quality of the flight that she is offered in return for the price she has paid."
"I would invite her to take that matter up specifically with the airlines concerned - as I am sure she will - and, if she wants to convey their response to me I will be happy to reflect upon that."
"What I hope that she is not going to do - and I know that she does not have any lack of responsibility in this matter - is to confuse her complaint and allegations of discomfort experienced as an air traveller with the possibility that either there are severely uncompetitive practices or that safety is somehow compromised; clearly, neither I in the Commission nor the national regulatory authorities would accept that for one moment."
"Question No 26 by Felipe Camisón Asensio (H-0598/97)"
"Subject: Competition policy and cartels"
"The Commission has been championing a competition policy which seeks to ensure maximum transparency while combatting cartels and dominant positions. The Commission has claimed that this year 14 cartels are being investigated."
"Which are they?"
"It is certainly true that the Commission always has a whole series of investigations in progress regarding cartels, agreements and possible abuses of dominant positions."
"I gave a figure about this the last time, if I remember well, when we had a debate in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"But I hope that honourable Members will understand that when we are dealing with such investigations, we must comply with the rules and the procedures that naturally prescribe that such investigations be conducted discreetly."
"For example, when an investigation is started up when inquiries may be made on the spot, it would be completely irresponsible for statements about it, on our part, to be circulated or indiscretions to be organized with regard to the material that is found."
"That is simply necessary because the Commission really fulfils a kind of judicial function here."
"It is only at a later stage that the Commission can come outside when the investigation has been completed, when the conclusions must be drawn and where appropriate sanctions must even be imposed and the Members of Parliament know that when that time has come, I am always the first to inform Parliament about it."
"So in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you to take account of the fact that the basic rule is that such investigations must take place discreetly, also with regard to company and business secrets and so on, because if the Commission does not do that, then the companies concerned can of course take us to court and rightly so because we do not respect their rights as affected parties."
"That is how it should be in a democracy and therefore I would once again call on your understanding that we cannot provide more information until the time when the investigation is completed, the necessary conclusions can be drawn and I am very willing to keep the respective parliamentary committees or Members of Parliament informed on this subject."
"Commissioner, I was not asking for details of the cartels."
"I was simply asking which they were - nothing more."
"I notice that this matter is still approached with care, since the 26th report on competition policy also said that the Commission will continue the task of modernizing its legislation and increasing the transparency of its policy. It also added that it was actively investigating 14 cartels - I only wanted to know which ones, not the details - and that the Commission receives an increasing number of complaints about attempts by companies in dominant positions to prevent new operators from entering their market."
"In your introduction, Mr Commissioner, you emphatically said that the fight against these secret cartels continued to be at the forefront, and that you hoped to step up the fight even more in the future."
"We realized that this was a very good aim, and therefore we tried to encourage you in this action, although we asked that it might be done in a transparent manner."
"Very briefly, first of all, sometimes the companies where on-the-spot visits take place make them public, and by making them public indicate that something is going on."
"We do not do that ourselves, for the very good reasons I have just explained."
"From time to time it is known that we are investigating cases and that the Commission is pursuing a case from the point of view of cartels or dominant positions."
"It would be improper for us to reveal cases which we are looking into on our own initiative and there are very good reasons therefore to stick to our policy."
"I can mention one case which has been made public by the companies concerned."
"We heard complaints from publishers of newspapers that the price of newsprint was going up very rapidly and they suspected some kind of cartel."
"So then we started investigations, which were made public by some of the companies where on-the-spot visits took place."
"So it is well known that we are looking into this case."
"But if the companies concerned do not reveal that, we do not do so on our own initiative."
"Question No 27 by Ludivina García Arias (H-0605/97)"
"Subject: The privatization of the Spanish Steel Corporation (CSI)"
"Does the Commission consider that, as part of the process of privatizing the Spanish Steel Corporation (CSI, S.A.), the acquisition of a third of its share capital by a major European enterprise, and its business management, constitutes a European merger as well as a transfer of the decision-making centre to another enterprise in which institutional and public investors of another Member State have a majority shareholding?"
"In accordance with the relevant articles of the ECSC Treaty, has the Commission looked at the effects of this operation on the European market?"
"Has it ensured that the shares that were sold off were properly valued, in accordance with the European Union's competition policy?"
"On the basis of the information currently available to the Commission services, I believe that the acquisition of 35 % of the shares of CSI by the ARBED group will give rise to a concentration that will have to be examined under both the merger regulation and the relevant provisions of the ECSC Treaty."
"As the details of the operation and in particular the relationship between ARBED and the Spanish companies which are negotiating for up to 50 % of the capital of CSI, have yet to be finalized, no notification has been made to date and no investigations have been carried out in relation to the concentration."
"So, we are still waiting for the relevant documents to be tabled."
"Only then can we start investigations."
"As far as the proper valuation of the company is concerned, prior to its sale, it appears that ARBED paid the full market price for its shareholding, as its offer was made in competition with other steel producers."
"I am sure you are very well aware of the fact that a lot of people were expecting that some other European company would win the contest. But, at the end of the day it was ARBED."
"So, this proves that there has been normal competition for participation in CSI."
"The concentration cannot be completed until it has been authorized under the two regulations I just mentioned."
"So, in any case, we will have to wait for the investigation and the final findings."
"Having said this, as you know there is a lot of movement in the steel sector and we will probably end up with four or five big European steel companies."
"By the way, by the time the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty expires in 2002 we are likely to have a kind of European common market for steel."
"Up to now we have had an addition of national markets, usually with publicly-owned steel companies."
"So, finally we are close to a European steel market."
"This is enhanced by the fact that more and more alliances are being concluded, our concentrations are happening, our acquisitions are taking place across borders."
"This is in line with Community policy but it has to be looked into properly from the point of view of competition rules and state rules."
"This was done a few years ago when we discussed difficult cases in Spain, Italy, Germany and so on."
"Mr Commissioner, what is being presented to the public and the European Commission as a strategic alliance between ARBED and CSI is really a strange privatization operation, or absorption. We Spanish socialists think it is a present from the Spanish Government to a company, strangely enough, with public participation."
"As you know, following the major restructuring authorized by the European Union, CSI is a completely reorganized company with no debts, with 10, 000 million in the bank. It was restructured socially (at Spanish taxpayers' expense, by the way) and at the moment it is in a privileged position compared with other large companies such as USINOR, ARBED, Thyssen or British Steel."
"It is a beauty, Commissioner."
"According to the share-transfer formula, the implied holdings of CSI in ARBED are greater than the estimated cash outlay by ARBED for the acquisition, and ARBED's holding is valued at a level way above the market price. This is based on a report by Salomon Brothers, who were previously advising against buying ARBED shares."
"You are right. It is not that there was no competition from other companies."
"But the problem lies in the offer, in the gift which the Spanish Government was making right from the start. This may have been for dogmatic reasons, to get rid of a company which has cost much human sacrifice, and economic effort from Spanish taxpayers too."
"I think, Commissioner, that you really ought to study this right from first principles and perhaps see, with the advice of independent companies, what the true valuation of this Spanish company is, and whether or not it has been bought at below market price."
"It was not the Commission which took the decision to privatise the company."
"That was a decision made by the government."
"We did not impose it."
"Secondly, since there was a transparent procedure under which a lot of other companies were asked to bid for CSI, we must assume that the winner offered the best terms."
"It was up to the government of Spain to make up its mind and that is apparently what it did."
"As far as I know, we certainly did not receive a complaint that the procedure was not transparent or was not a fair one."
"Question No 28 by Niels Sindal (H-0617/97)"
"Subject: Government aid"
"It is deplorable that, while opposed in principle to national government aid, the Commission and the Council continue to give the go-ahead for packages of massive national aid, particularly to ailing shipyards, most recently in Germany, Spain and Greece."
"This double entry book-keeping obviously goes some way towards undermining confidence in a consistent and credible effort to reduce government aid which distorts competition."
"More resources must be set aside to monitor government aid."
"This issue is currently relevant to the shipbuilding industry but also to other sectors."
"What steps will the Commission take to set aside more resources to monitor government aid in order to obtain an up-to-date and comprehensive picture of the scope and nature of such aid?"
"Mr President, I shall also be brief, as these decisions were taken some time ago already, and as the honourable member knows, these are cases that have been with us for years."
"In the case of Greece, the delay in the payment of subsidies which had been authorized some years earlier, prompted the Council to accept the Commission's proposal, under which interest relating to late payments could be added, but nothing more."
"In the case of Spain, things were a little more complicated."
"I remind you that Spain had, as part of the OECD negotiations, obtained a number of concessions relating to investment grants and for social and labour difficulties associated with restructuring, in the shipyard sector."
"Here too, there was late payment, and hence extra interest, for which compensation had to be made."
"Then, as a result of late payment, a certain extra amount was granted for investment."
"The Council considered that this was a matter of settling a case from the past, and that consequently, there was in reality nothing new."
"It was a matter of closing the dossier."
"I draw your attention to fact that at the same time, the Spanish authorities made the following commitment: if at the end of next year the shipyards in question were still loss-making, were not viable, they would draw the necessary conclusions, and would not come knocking on the door of the Commission for still further requests for assistance."
"Firm commitments of this kind have been made both to the Commission and to the Council of Ministers."
"This was what made it possible for a large majority of the Council of Ministers to accept these commitments."
"Finally, capacity must be reduced. As you know, we entered into a commitment to inspect this four times a year."
"The Spanish authorities produce reports on the state of the progress in the commitments, four times annually, and we send teams on site to check, in the shipyards, that commitments have effectively been met."
"The last case involves Germany."
"Here too, this was the consequence of a drama that had involved Bremen Vulkan."
"It was finally agreed to allow the two East German shipyards to continue to work under the conditions which had been previously determined."
"But as the money had been taken out by Bremen Vulkan, compensation had to be made."
"Here too, a commitment was entered into for the last time."
"If the shipyards are privatized in the future, there will be no question of anyone coming back to knock on the door and ask for more public money."
"Furthermore, as you know, a very considerable reduction in capacity will take place in Bremen, in Germany."
"This is the context in which things are done, and done in a manner which can be defended."
"Now I come to my conclusion, and to two points."
"We are still not certain that the United States will ratify the OECD agreement."
"The solution and way out is there, but the United States is not budging."
"We have, however, ratified the agreement."
"As soon as they ratify it, it will immediately come into force."
"If that is not the case, we must prepare for the future."
"The Commission, Before the end of this month, the Commission will put a proposal on the Council table, given that the seventh directive will come to an end at the end of next year, a proposal relating to the future of the shipyards in this sector."
"I can tell you already, that the Commission will take a fairly strict attitude with regard to assistance in this sector."
"Of course, I am sure we shall have the opportunity to come back on this, once I have presented this proposal to my colleagues, and the college has accepted it."
"I am naturally perfectly ready to stand before you and discuss this in Parliament."
"First I would like to thank the Commissioner for a very satisfactory answer and generally to say thank you for the Commissioner's work in connection with state aid."
"My question was equally concerned with what will happen in future generally, that is, in other areas as well, with regard to state aid."
"Since I put this question, fate has decreed that a Kellogg's breakfast cereal plant, which stands beside a shipyard which has been closed in my hometown, is now going to close to as it is being moved to Spain and Manchester."
"They are objective areas - objective 1 and objective 2 - where subsidies are also provided in a different way."
"My question therefore equally concerns what the Commission is going to do to ensure that there is capacity in the Commission to monitor how aid is provided from both Community and state funds in future."
"We have had the case of Boston Scientific in Denmark, we have had Renault, and now we have Kellogg's: businesses which move around in Europe, all depending on where conditions are most favourable with regard to capital."
"I wish to suggest to the honourable Member that we continue this discussion later because in the coming weeks and months there will be several initiatives by the Commission, including some by Monika WulfMathies in the field of the structural funds."
"As far as national regional aid is concerned, I will be trying to reduce the eligible regions - at least to some proportion - and also to reduce the levels of aid intensity linked to a whole series of other initiatives to tighten the rules and try to develop a stricter public aid policy."
"So there will be plenty of opportunities to come back to that issue, and I will be readily available to Parliament to discuss it in depth."
"Mr Commissioner, I should like to inform my colleague that I don't know what he means by 'ailing shipyards' ."
"I think he should visit some of those 'ailing shipyards' , and he will realize that they are competing with shipyards in other countries such as Korea."
"The Commissioner has mentioned the OECD agreement and the renewal of the next directive on state aid. If the United States does not ratify what has been agreed, and if other countries such as Korea continue with discussions about shipyard aid, then we will commit suicide by not compensating for a control of subsidies which we cannot exercise in other countries."
"I should also like to remind my colleague that it is companies in the richest countries which receive most government aid. The Commissioner will correct me if I am wrong."
"I would just suggest to the honourable Members that they wait a few weeks and then there will be a proposal from us on the future of shipbuilding in Europe and what we think might be envisaged from the point of view of state aid."
"So there will be many opportunities to discuss it further, and I reiterate our willingness to discuss it fully with Parliament."
"Since the time allocated to questions to Mr van Miert has now run out, Question No 29 will be dealt with in writing."
"The protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty establishes a general principle."
"It means that all Member States in the European Union shall be considered to be safe countries of origin."
"The protocol's single article is formulated so as to limit the ability of EU citizens to seek asylum in another Member State to four specific situations."
"These are found in four separate paragraphs of exceptions."
"Mr Sjöstedt's question concerns the protocol's fourth paragraph in particular."
"This stipulates that a Member State, regardless of the protocol's basic principle, always has the right ultimately to decide for itself whether or not an asylum application shall be examined."
"If a Member State chooses to examine such an application for asylum, the Council of Ministers must be informed, and the application shall always be assumed to be manifestly unfounded."
"However, the protocol expressly states that this in no way affects the Member State's right of self-determination."
"It could therefore be said that what is new is that the Member States are put under an obligation to inform the Council of Ministers if and when an application for asylum from an EU citizen is being examined."
"Although I personally regret that this protocol has been included in the new treaty, I welcome the fact that in the preamble to the protocol it is expressly established that the spirit and letter of the Geneva Convention shall be respected with regard to the granting of refugee status."
"Member States have the right to take the administrative measures considered necessary to fulfil the requirements of the Geneva Convention."
"A special declaration which was attached to the protocol also expresses clearly and unambiguously that agreements in no way have a prejudicial effect in this regard."
"A further declaration is directly linked to the fourth exception paragraph."
"It premises an examination of how one can best speed up the procedures for examining manifestly unfounded asylum applications from EU citizens."
"Let me summarize my answer in three points."
"My understanding is that the Amsterdam Treaty's Asylum Protocol means the following: Firstly, that the obligations Member States have under the Geneva Convention remain unchanged."
"Secondly, that an application for asylum made by an EU citizen shall not normally be seen as valid, since the Member States are to be regarded as safe countries of origin."
"Thirdly, that all Member States retain their right to make decisions and can therefore always examine applications for asylum from EU citizens on condition that the Council of Ministers is informed and the examination is done on the basis that the application is manifestly unfounded."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner warmly for her answer, in particular for her personal observation on her view of this protocol, which I fully share, and her opinion that what has happened in the Amsterdam Treaty is unfortunate."
"I also think it is important to establish that each Member State has a perfect right to examine each asylum application itself."
"At the same time, it is impossible to get away from the fact that an attempt is being made here to put pressure on the Member States to apply a partly different practice."
"Strong criticism has also been directed by, for example, the UN High Commission for Refugees, against these formulations and also by organizations which work with refugee cases."
"It would be best if this could be reconsidered, since it is in fact a dangerous example; if, for example, it is followed by other areas of the world, which could use it as justification for them to restrict in various ways the right to seek asylum and to have one's asylum application heard."
"Remember that this proposal was not put forward by the Commission."
"This is what the Member States have agreed."
"Therefore the question should perhaps have been put to the Council of Ministers."
"I feel that I must speak now that the whole debate is in the beautiful Swedish language."
"I would just like to put the following question to Commissioner Gradin."
"When you say that an application for asylum in a Member State shall not normally be seen as valid and that the examination shall be done on the basis that the application is unfounded, exactly how do people think this will be implemented as far as the law is concerned?"
"We have a legally independent judiciary."
"Shall it in some way start saying that the score is 1-0 against asylum being granted?"
"I do not know whether the Council has considered this, but to me it appears to be a totally impossible juridical problem."
"I do not think people will turn this into legal red tape."
"What is important is that under these provisions each country has the right to examine an application in accordance with the Geneva Convention."
"Secondly, I would like to say that I cannot answer for the Council of Ministers."
"It is the Council of Ministers which is responsible for this."
"It was in the Council of Ministers that this was adopted, and it was not at the Commission's request."
"Firstly, I should like to thank Mrs Gradin for her very full and thorough explanation of the Commission's interpretation of the protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Mrs Gradin, you have confirmed firstly the independence of the courts; secondly, the sovereignty of Member States to examine any application for asylum; and thirdly, that these applications will be considered unfounded from the outset if they originate from citizens of a State which guarantees all the basic rights and is therefore considered a safe place to live."
"These are the normal conditions."
"Is it not also true, Mrs Gradin, that the extent of political integration currently enjoyed by the Member States of the European Union does not exist in any other part of the world at the moment?"
"Let me once again sum up the Amsterdam Treaty's Asylum Protocol."
"It means, firstly, that the obligations Member States have under the Geneva Convention remain unchanged."
"Secondly, an application for asylum made by an EU citizen shall not normally be seen as valid since the Member States shall be regarded, as the protocol states, as 'safe countries of origin' ."
"Thirdly, all Member States retain their right to make decisions and can therefore always examine applications for asylum from EU citizens on condition that the Council of Ministers is informed and that the examination is done on the basis that the application should be manifestly unfounded."
"Question No 31 by Jan Andersson (H-0616/97)"
"Subject: Measures to combat trafficking in synthetic drugs"
"Trafficking in synthetic drugs is on the increase in Europe."
"Much of the production and distribution is based in countries applying for membership of the European Union."
"How will the Commission, in membership negotiations, attempt to persuade those countries in which production and distribution takes place to tackle the problem of synthetic drugs?"
"The Commission shares Mr Andersson's concern over the spread of the new synthetic drugs in Europe."
"Until a few years ago amphetamines and ecstasy were produced mainly in the Netherlands and Belgium."
"Today production is increasingly taking place in some of the central and eastern European or Baltic countries."
"I understand, for example, that around half of the amphetamines which are seized in Stockholm now come from Poland."
"In May this year the Commission issued at my suggestion a communication with a thorough analysis of this development."
"We also proposed a number of measures, including increased co-operation with central and eastern European and Baltic countries on this issue."
"The battle against narcotics was also a major issue in the structural dialogue during the Irish Presidency in spring 1996."
"At that time I took up in particular the question of the spread of synthetic drugs."
"None of the Ministers from the applicant countries who were present can have any doubt that this is a high priority question in the European Union."
"This is something I have also taken up during all my visits to the applicant countries."
"The Commission has explained very clearly that this is an area which will attract a great deal of attention during membership negotiations."
"The applicant countries are expected to adopt our acquis communautaire ."
"This also includes the battle against narcotics in general and chemical drugs in particular."
"It is important therefore to be able to live up to the rules we have with regard to the control of precursors, money laundering and the like."
"On 16 June the Council of Ministers passed a resolution to set up what we call an early warning system."
"This means that in future the Member States will get information much faster than today when a new type of chemical drug appears on the market. This will be very useful."
"For the applicant countries all this is, of course, a delicate problem."
"From the Commission's point of view we shall therefore provide as much help as we can."
"Moreover, since 1993 we have provided technical assistance through Phare, not least for the control of chemical precursors."
"A lot remains to be done, of course, and I am working intensively to ensure that this issue will continue to be prioritized in future in our cooperation with the new democracies in the east."
"I thank the Commissioner for her answer, which was quite excellent."
"In connection with the eastern enlargement, we often discuss questions which concern economics, and on the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, on which I sit, we also about social rights, etcetera."
"That is extremely important, but the cross-border trade in drugs is also a major issue."
"I am very pleased with the answer and with the work which the Commissioner presented, but I have two questions in connection with this."
"Firstly, I wonder what reaction the Commissioner received from Poland and the Baltic States when all these measures were presented."
"Did the countries take it seriously, were they positive and do they intend to do anything about it?"
"Secondly, in spite of everything there is also production in our own countries."
"I therefore wonder whether you have ever been asked this question: ' Shouldn't you put your own house in order?'"
"The applicant countries covered by structured dialogue and with which we have had talks on visits have understood very clearly that we consider it very important that they make sure they get to work on issues such as synthetic drugs."
"There is no doubt that the majority of these countries do not currently have an adequate legal basis to do this. They still need to get laws and regulations which provide them with better tools - that is one thing."
"The other is that they get to grips with corruption, not least on borders, etcetera, in order to further intensify their activities."
"On the question of our own countries: when we proposed the communication in the spring the idea was that we should put our own European house in order, that is, we in the fifteen Member States should also recognize that we are producers too and make sure that we find solutions."
"That is why this early warning system has been put on the agenda."
"Question No 32 by Richard Howitt (H-0647/97)"
"Subject: Harmonization of immigration policy - discrimination against a constituent"
"An immigration case involving the Russian spouse of Mr Clark of Leigh-on-Sea, one of my constituents, whereby a settlement visa has been awarded by German immigration authorities but not by UK immigration authorities, highlights the fact that harmonization of EU immigration law, as provided for in the European Treaty, does not yet exist in the European Union."
"What action can the Commission take to help Mr Clark return his wife to the United Kingdom and what further action to ensure that greater harmony of immigration policy exists throughout the EU so that cases such as this do not recur in the future?"
"The question from Mr Howitt concerns the fact that immigration rules are part of Community law in certain cases and are governed by national legislation in others."
"This sometimes creates a certain amount of confusion."
"The situation is currently as follows: It is only when an EU citizen exercises his or her right to freedom of movement and takes up residence in another Member State that the members of his or her family are covered by Community law."
"In such cases a family member can assert his or her right to family reunion."
"For citizens of third countries who need visas, Community law requires that a visa shall be issued at no cost and without burdensome procedures."
"However, if it is a citizen who lives in the country where he or she is a citizen, the family members are covered by the national rules and laws applicable in that country."
"According to rulings by the European Court of Justice, a person can assert his or her right to freedom of movement and right of residence against their own Member State."
"This applies when he or she returns to their homeland after having resided in another Member State."
"It is quite clear that the decisive factor with regard to the rights of family members to immigration and residence under Community law is that the EU citizen is exercising or has exercised the right to freedom of movement."
"It is therefore difficult for the Commission to judge in what category Mr Clark or his wife belong."
"The Commission would obviously prefer to see common immigration rules for the whole Union."
"On 30 June the Commission adopted a draft convention on rules for immigration throughout the European Union."
"The proposal is an important first step in the work of creating a more homogenous immigration policy in our Member States."
"One paragraph in the proposal covers precisely the problems raised by the honourable Member."
"It means that the same rules on family reunion would apply everywhere within the European Union."
"I hope, of course, that the European Parliament will give the Commission all possible support to the proposal which will begin to be discussed in the Council of Ministers in the autumn."
"Thank you, Commissioner for taking this question."
"I accept, as you said, that the role of Member States in this matter is crucial."
"Indeed I welcome the abolition of the primary purpose rule by the UK's new Labour Government, which will very much assist in cases such as this."
"However, what I would like to press the Commissioner on is the fact that Community law is being discredited."
"We cannot continue with a situation whereby citizens of a Member State enjoy rights under their own national law which are less favourable than those they enjoy as EU citizens in other European countries."
"Mr Clark, a British national, found that he could bring his Russian wife into Germany but not Britain - unless he lived for six months in Germany first."
"If he found that he had a Greek grandfather he could claim Greek citizenship and again have no problem."
"If he was Italian there would be no dispute at all."
"Such anomalies generate a sense of grievance amongst Europe's citizens, not least my own constituents."
"I call on the Commissioner to argue with some force in favour of the proposals to which she has referred to support the right of genuine family reunion in all European countries."
"I agree with the honourable Member that it is very confusing that we have these contradictory rules and regulations in the Union."
"The reason behind the Convention that I have now presented to the Commission and that has been accepted, and that will be discussed by Parliament and the Council of Ministers, is that we will get common rules for all our citizens concerning migration and admittance to our countries."
"Nobody can understand what is going on sometimes."
"This is very confusing."
"I am very concerned that Commissioner Fischler should have been here at 6.40 p.m. to take the questions."
"I think, out of all courtesy to this House, he should be here promptly and I would like an explanation as to why he is not here."
"Mrs McIntosh, I share your concern entirely. I am very surprised, because I insisted that the parliamentary services should call upon the Commissioner to be here."
"In fact, Mrs Gradin has been kind enough to overrun by 6 minutes the length of time she had promised to spend with us."
"I do not know why the Commissioner is still not here, but I imagine there must be a good reason."
"But, with Mrs Gradin's help, we will continue our work."
"Question No 33 by Bernd Posselt (H-0649/97)"
"Subject: Sharing the burden of refugees and asylum applicants"
"What is the current situation as regards burden-sharing among the Member States where asylum applicants and sudden movements of refugees are concerned, and when will the Commission submit to the European Parliament an overview of the rights and material benefits that these two groups of people enjoy in the various Member States?"
"Against the background of the Bosnian refugee crisis, the Council of Ministers initiated a debate on how the division of responsibility for asylum seekers shall take place in mass refugee situations, that is, burden-sharing."
"This initial debate resulted in the Council Resolution of 25 September 1995 on the division of responsibility with regard to a temporary solution for the admission and residence of people in need of asylum."
"This was followed by the Council of Ministers' Decision of 4 March 1996 on an early warning and contingency system."
"The Commission has tried to take the question one step further with its proposal in April this year for joint action on temporary asylum for refugees."
"The proposal requires a joint decision-making mechanism for the introduction, review and phasing out of temporary asylum."
"It also establishes certain minimum rights and conditions for the reception of refugees."
"The idea is that this joint decision-making process will form the framework for a real division of the burden of responsibility with regard to the mass immigration of people who are refugees and in need of asylum."
"The European Parliament has also contributed to stimulating concrete efforts for a division of the burden of responsibility by introducing two new budgetary lines."
"Line B5-803 is intended to cover the costs of carrying out pilot projects with regard to the reception of refugees."
"It is based on the idea of shared responsibility between the Member States."
"The other line, B7-6008, covers the Community's financing of pilot projects which aim to facilitate the voluntary return of people who have received temporary asylum in the Member States."
"The Commission has already successfully got the necessary legal instrument through the Council of Ministers, based on Article K 3(2 b), for the implementation of these two budgetary lines."
"The Council decision was taken on 22 July."
"It has made it possible for the Commission to start pilot projects in these areas in accordance with the budget notes."
"The Commission will evaluate the results of the pilot projects financed during the year and intends to return with a proposal for a programme lasting several years in 1998."
"As far as the other part of the question is concerned, I would like to refer the honourable Member to the document which the Commission produced in connection with the joint action on temporary asylum."
"It is a summary of the central points of the Member States' policies in this area, in particular the rights and obligations which each Member State gives people who are granted temporary asylum."
"According to the proposed joint action, the Commission should report annually to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers on how the rules on temporary asylum are being implemented in the Member States as well as the financial effects."
"Thank you, Mrs Gradin, and may I say how grateful we are to you for having patiently remained here way beyond the call of duty. You have covered for an absence that would certainly have hindered the work of this House."
"Questions Nos 34 and 35 will be dealt with in writing."
"."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as stated in the question, Directive 93/119 on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing provides that this directive is not applicable in the case of the killing of animals at cultural or sporting events."
"The Commission is of the opinion that in these cases national authorities are responsible for the welfare of the animals in question."
"This approach is in accordance with the Protocol on Animal Protection to the Amsterdam Treaty agreed in June 1997."
"As animal protection is not an express part of the Treaty of Rome or other agreements, the Commission can only repeat its earlier advice to the governments of Member States to do all in their power to bring to an end all unacceptable practices where animals are killed during cultural and sporting events."
"It is always a pleasure to see the Commissioner albeit, on this occasion, quite late."
"How would the Commissioner satisfy my constituents, and I am very happy to copy every single letter I have had from them on this point - particularly in relation to killings in cultural and sports events?"
"Is it not the Commissioner's duty, under the Protocol to the original Maastricht Treaty, to ensure that every piece of legislation and every act does comply with the animal welfare provisions which were agreed on in that Protocol?"
"While I have already stated in my question the fact that I realise that Directive 93/119 applies, constituents still have substantial misgivings about the unnecessary and needless suffering of those animals which are killed in cultural and sporting events."
"They are not satisfied - not in my own country but in other Member States - that the Protocol is being adhered to or that the directive is being complied with."
"If the directive is being breached, do they have an action which can be taken before the Court of Justice?"
"Mr President, Mrs McIntosh, as I said earlier, one must first bear in mind that the question of animal protection is not solely the task of, or not solely regulated by, Community law, but that merely specific aspects of animal protection are regulated at Community level."
"Anything more than that comes within the authority of Member States and their legislation."
"Member States must also be responsible to this authority."
"Where regulations under Community law are concerned, in this case Guideline 119/93, Member States are also charged with the execution and application of these Guidelines."
"Where it is discovered during an inspection that a Member State is paying insufficient attention to the regulations, or has undertaken unsatisfactory measures for the execution of the guidelines, it has to be decided if a charge of contravention should be initiated against such a member state."
"I should be pleased to send my colleague, Mrs Bonino, information on this, as the subject of inspection of animal protection measures, according to the new distribution of responsibilities within the Commission that was mainly demanded by Parliament, now falls within her province."
"Mr Commissioner, you have said that even though this may not be within the jurisdiction of Community law, you hope that Member States will soon cease these practices, which you consider cruel."
"Is it not rather the case, Mr Fischler, that this is one of the basic legal precepts of Article 128, that is, subsidiarity applies fully because it is a cultural matter. Is it not also true that there is still no unifying view of what constitutes animal welfare when cultural interests are involved?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think I have made it quite clear that there are separate responsibilities here, if you want to call them that, in accordance with subsidiarity."
"We as a Commission have to obey the requirements of the treaty, but I should like to stress that we also have to ensure that the treaty is complied with."
"If there are any transgressions to these guidelines, then we are obliged to correct those transgressions."
"Question No 37 by John Iversen (H-0550/97)"
"Subject: Pesticides"
"One of the results of the new Treaty of Amsterdam will be that a number of directives now based on Article 43 such as the Pesticides Directive, 91/414 will instead be based on Article 129."
"This will give the European Parliament greater influence over the criteria used in the approval of pesticides in the EU as the matter will fall under codecision."
"Will the Commission therefore temporarily refrain from approving active substances on the positive list of pesticides, as it is now said to have begun doing?"
"Is the Commission prepared instead to review the directive now so that any requirements the European Parliament may put forward may be taken into account before the new substances are approved?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Guideline 91/414 concerning the dissemination of plant pesticides has been in effect since 1993."
"The first testing stage for previous active agents and the testing of certain new agents has just started."
"The Commission does not, therefore, yet have sufficient evidence at the present stage of guideline implementation to make it imperative for the basic criteria concerning approval of chemical synthetic agents to be modified, or for the testing programme to be stopped."
"Any future Commission proposals concerning modification to the criteria that were made subsequent to ratification would, of course, be binding on the corresponding new regulations."
"Thank you for your answer Mr Commissioner."
"I understand the answer to mean that there could be a situation where there is a period of overlap because there is insufficient information."
"That is at least how I understood your answer."
"As such, I think it is quite excellent and I would just like to urge you, if the new treaty is very close to coming into force, not to hurry some things through on the basis of the old standards if new information is needed."
"As such, it is a kind of suggestion or request to you, Mr Commissioner, to delay looking at these new chemicals until the treaty has entered into force, even if it appears, as I understood you, that there will be a certain period of overlap."
"Question No 38 by Raul Rosado Fernandes (H-0554/97)"
"Subject: Vine growing - Directive 193/68/EEC"
"In order to survive, the EU's vine growing sector needs to be constantly renewed with selected vegetative material which will enable it to achieve optimum productivity or quality based on market requirements."
"Vine growing is still governed by Directive 193/68/EEC , which was an excellent piece of legislation for its time, but now growers in Greece, Spain and Portugal are in practice unable meet the health standards, which are interpreted differently nowadays."
"Since vine cultivation in these three countries has not been subject to selection over a period of decades as in the 'founding' vine growing countries, it is important that the above directive be interpreted in a way which meets their needs, so that strains which can never be imported from the more advanced Member States can be preserved."
"Why does DG VI not explain objectively the criteria to be met when applying the directive in accordance with the historical situation of each country?"
"Why does the Standing Committee referred to in Article 17 of Directive 193/68/EEC not include representatives of the private sector?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this question concerns the bringing into circulation of so-called vegetative propagation material from grapes."
"Unified quality standards were introduced for this, which the Member States have to meet on circulating such material."
"The aim has been to increase productivity in the wine industry."
"Relevant offices of the Commission are currently preparing a revision of these guidelines, not only in order to simplify them in view of relevant legal and technical developments and to update them, but also to remove existing trade barriers and ensure conformity with the internal market."
"The Commission will probably lay the proposal before Council, and hence Parliament, towards the end of this year."
"The various plant health regulations referred to by the honourable Member in his question have their origin in the requirements of the guideline itself."
"For in this guideline Member States are expressly given the freedom, under certain circumstances, to apply additional requirements for their own products. They are also permitted to apply certain other requirements according to various circumstances in individual wine-growing regions."
"Legal developments and likely problems in applying the regulations were mentioned by experts from Member States in the Standing Committee on Seed and Plant Material."
"During this the situation in each individual country was carefully investigated."
"As for the participation of representatives of the private sector in meetings of the Standing Committee, the relevant Council decision establishing the Committee only permits representatives of Member States."
"Representatives of the private sector may, however, present their points to those consultative meetings of the Commission in which important new developments in legal regulations may be mentioned."
"The relevant offices of the Commission have held direct consultations for this revision work with professional associations having relevant knowledge on the subject of propagation material for vines, and specialize in it."
"Mr Commissioner, there is a degree of tolerance for the commercialization of Portuguese grape varieties that are grown from unclassified cultivated rice material."
"That can only be explained by the fact that the Portuguese authorities are fairly strict - it is an old tradition since our Inquisition, if not a very wise one!"
"For this reason some are grown in France, then loaded and sold again to Portugal."
"There have already been complaints about it."
"For instance, Mr Legras received a complaint on 1 September this year, which can be easily established."
"That is just for your information."
"I would just like to respond quickly to that."
"I have, of course, little influence on the wisdom of the Portuguese authorities."
"But I can assure you of one thing: if there are definite complaints, then we shall investigate them."
"I f complaints stem from the private sector, that is, from businesses or plant propagation cooperatives, then these may be made in addition within the framework of consultative committees and discussed at specialist level."
"Question No 39 by Arlindo Cunha (H-0595/97)"
"Subject: The Commission's strategy for CAP reform"
"The next CAP reform must provide the EU's farmers with the resources and conditions they need to adapt to the increasing external competition caused by eastward enlargement and GATT."
"This means that the reform cannot be carried out on a purely sectoral basis, since, over and above alterations to certain common organizations of the market, the emphasis of the policy needs to be shifted towards boosting rural development and establishing a minimum level of income support for all farmers."
"Only in this way can unacceptable social and political discrimination be avoided."
"How does the Commission plan to reconcile all these aspects of the problem?"
"Does it intend, as in 1991, to submit a general discussion and strategy paper to facilitate debate with technical, professional and political circles?"
"As everyone in this House knows, the President of the Commission presented Agenda 2000 on 16 July this year. In this the Commission gave a wide overview of the development of the European Union and its policies from the millennium into the middle of the following decade."
"For agriculture, the Commission proposed a further expansion of the reform introduced in 1992 - which was established under Mr Cunha when he was a minister and President-in-Office of the Council - and the development of a coherent policy for rural areas in support of this process."
"By changing from price subsidy to direct payment the European Union can greatly improve its competitiveness through lowering the price of grain, beef and milk. This will also help producers in the European Union to have access in full measure to positive developments on the international market."
"At the same time, food hygiene and food quality, as well as food safety, will be improved."
"The proposals for development of a coherent policy supporting rural areas have as their objective, on the one hand, to secure a suitable income for the rural population. They should also play a part in creating stability of agricultural incomes and new sources of employment and income for farmers and their families."
"The Commission intends to present to the Council, after consultation with the European Parliament, a first report on the Agenda 2000 package of measures, and then to suggest relevant legal texts and distribute concrete proposals for individual areas following the Luxembourg Summit."
"Mr President, I am grateful for the Commissioner's reply, but the fact is that the Agenda 2000 proposal will continue to exclude the producers of certain Mediterranean products, like wine, fruit and even rice, from direct aid."
"This will lead to more than half of agricultural production in certain countries of southern Europe being excluded from the premiums of direct aid to income, creating discrimination difficult to sustain at the political level."
"The Commissioner knows that."
"We cannot explain to Portuguese, Spanish or Italian farmers why half of their agricultural production is not entitled to premiums, when in other countries, which have other production, almost all of agricultural production gets premiums."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner what the Commission intends to do to prevent this discrimination between countries, as this is a difficult political issue which we, the politicians, must try to resolve."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make a very clear distinction here."
"First, as far as Mediterranean or southern products are concerned, Agenda 2000 says that the Commission intends to make firm proposals for the tobacco and olive oil sectors."
"I should like to remind you that here in Parliament it has been repeatedly urged that the Commission should only make such proposals when reports on these two sectors are being discussed in the European Parliament, and when a view has been expressed on them."
"We are complying with that."
"Concerning the wine sector, there is a proposal here for reform which we believe, however, should not be processed in its existing state."
"I see here the necessity of presenting to the Commission a new proposal."
"You may rest assured that these concrete proposals will be made available just as punctually - at the end of the year, or the beginning of next year - as the firm proposals for the areas grain, milk and beef, so that these southern products can be discussed within the framework of more general discussion."
"A situation like that of Reform 92 should not arise, therefore, whereby it is really only possible to deliver a Council declaration at that time, work on reforming southern products having to be dealt with afterwards."
"I should also like to draw attention to the fact that there is naturally a fundamental difference between grain, milk and beef products - although I must add in parenthesis that these products are also of the greatest importance in southern countries - and that is, that we are recommending here a marked reduction in price guarantees which will result in prices falling in these areas."
"In the other sectors we are making no recommendations that would result in a fall in market prices for olive oil or tobacco grown by tobacco farmers within the European Union."
"This aspect, that of the target income for agriculture, we must regard in future along with many others as one of the primary objectives."
"Mr Commissioner, can we deduce from what you have said that there will be guarantees and prospects for the future of Mediterranean agriculture?"
"Please be more specific, because the last Council of Ministers caused a lot of anxiety."
"In what you have said so far I have not heard any details."
"Mediterranean farmers need you to give them these guarantees of future prospects, as you do for other parts of Europe."
"Please be more specific."
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I agree with you that farmers throughout the European Union need a plan for the future."
"That is precisely the purpose of Agenda 2000: to offer the farmers of Europe a vision for the future."
"We want to make no differentiation between farmers from the south and those from the north."
"The future of agriculture must be secured throughout Europe, and the reform proposals should, amongst other things, help to clarify what we can secure this future with."
"Mr President, what I really want to ask the Commissioner is that, since it is quite clear that we are not going to reach the large number of questions on BSE, could he please ensure that the written answers which Members will receive go to everyone who has tabled those questions, because all of us would be interested in the answers to the other questions."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Hardstaff."
"Honourable Members, this is a question for the Presidency, and my answer to Mrs Hardstaff is that this Presidency will see to it that Questions Nos 40 to 85, which have not been answered directly, will receive written answers as soon as possible."
"Since the allotted time for questions to the Commission is now up, Questions Nos 40 to 85 will be dealt with in writing ."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Since it is now significantly later than the timetable envisaged, I should like to thank the parliamentary services for their patient assistance. May I remind you all that the work of the part-session will resume tonight at 9.00 p.m."
"The sitting is suspended."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.15 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Chernobyl, Khmelnitsky and Rovno 4 nuclear reactors (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the oral question by Mr Scapagnini (B4-0519/97 - O-0087/97), on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, to the Commission, on the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor by 2000 and the completion of the Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 nuclear reactors in Ukraine."
"Mr President, the sarcophagus at Chernobyl is in a worsening condition and new risks are emerging, including the plutonium dust cloud release, so that securing it and closing the remaining unit are more urgent than ever."
"The completion of K2 and R4 nuclear reactors is part of an agreement between the G7 and Ukraine on the closure of Chernobyl."
"The agreement stipulates that the nuclear option must, however, be least-cost and the independent least-cost study commissioned by the EBRD makes clear that the nuclear option is far from least-cost."
"Other least-cost studies were unofficially undertaken later, but these were not done by an independent panel of experts."
"Any other report is unofficial and suspect under the EBRD's own operating principles for investment."
"I must labour this point."
"The official economic due diligence, I must emphasize, was done by an independent panel of experts and it follows that in the absence of a weighty published critique of the panel's work, any work, such as that being done by Stone and Webster, is unofficial and its basis must therefore be suspect under the EBRD operating principles for investment in the energy sector."
"Indeed the Stone and Webster study has changed the assumptions to try to make K2 and R4 economic, and the model produced a long list of other projects which became economic before K2 and R4."
"If they tried to make K2 or R4 economic, the investment bill for the bank would be astronomic."
"A computer model cannot, without human intervention, make one reactor least-cost and the other uneconomic, so I was actually quite shocked at your own reaction today, Mr Commissioner."
"ECU 30m nuclear-safety funds have already been committed to the K2 and R4 reactors through taxes."
"Despite EP budget responsibility, decisions are being taken in a secretive manner without any consultation or proper information being given to Parliament or any clarity on the decision-making procedure."
"Parliament is, along with the Council, the budgetary authority."
"The budget for 1997 includes a stipulation that requires that Parliament be consulted in advance about individual Community loans."
"To date this has not happened."
"This lack of consultation is inconsistent with current proposals from the Commission to increase the level of the Guarantee Fund."
"I am also alarmed at the Court of Auditors' report."
"If we want to close Chernobyl we need to look carefully at what is actually being done in that particular area."
"Mr Commissioner, you did not and cannot answer the question on consistent safety standards tonight."
"The truth is that these reactors cannot be completed to Western safety standards."
"You are planning to spend upwards of ECU 800m on unsafe reactors."
"We will not be forgiven if we fail to close Chernobyl and create another accident zone."
"Mr President, the more we hear about this whole project the more alarmed I have become."
"I have the feeling that this Parliament could become embroiled in a cause célèbre with the Commission."
"If it is the case that the EBRD is evading its own requirements to go for the lowest cost option, this is a serious matter which could have serious repercussions."
"The European public also will fail to understand why Ukraine is being encouraged to rely on the nuclear option instead of going for what would appear to be a very fruitful alternative, i.e. energy saving, energy efficiency, and renewables."
"A big push in that direction would be signalled by not replacing the Chernobyl-era plants."
"That is the direction in which the European Union's policy should be pointing."
"It would be very strange indeed if Chernobyl, which to the West stands as a terrible warning of the dangers of nuclear power, and should therefore lead to the phasing out of nuclear power, was instead to become the symbol of its replacement by a new generation of nuclear power."
"This is - or could be - a historic turning-point."
"Instead of propping up the Western European desire to renew the nuclear energy of Ukraine, we should be looking to alternatives."
"This would be in the best interests of the European Union and of the people of Ukraine who have suffered long enough from nuclear contamination."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the closure of the nuclear power station at Chernobyl is an extremely sensitive subject, in the light of the dramatic accident which occurred, and which we naturally all remember."
"In the light of the dangers of this type of power station, it is in the interests of all that the closure of Chernobyl should occur as soon as possible."
"However, the Ukrainian government has put a prior condition on the closure of the unit still operating at Chernobyl, namely finance for the completion of the replacement nuclear power stations at Khmelnitzky 2 and Rovno 4."
"This position is understandable, if Ukraine's requirements in energy are taken into account. However, it appears that loans from the EBRD intended to finance the replacement power stations may be rejected, under the criterion of least cost."
"It appears to us completely unacceptable that the achieving of a goal as essential as that of the closure of a supremely hazardous power station should be deferred for purely technocratic and budgetary reasons."
"If the EBRD is to be managed as a private bank under common law, one cannot really see why there is any need for its existence."
"It is clear that, if the logic of the least cost were to carry the day, the closure of Chernobyl would be indefinitely postponed."
"After all, it was also for reasons of cost reduction that power stations such as Chernobyl were built in the past."
"The adoption of stricter safety standards would have increased costs and led to the construction of more technologically sophisticated power stations."
"Here it is quite apparent that the European Commission's logic is a budgetary logic."
"Of course, that has its merits for day-to-day administration, but in our opinion, this should not win out over the need to insure oneself against major nuclear risks."
"Furthermore, it appears to us regrettable that the European authorities which, in general, and fairly systematically, it must be said, push for the integration of European states, even when this goes against the wish of the population, as can be seen in Bosnia, does not recommend Ukraine at any time to intensify its energy cooperation with the Russian Federation."
"However, the interests of the two countries are indissociable one from the other, by reason of a long common history, and it is absurd not to take into consideration such a historical heritage."
"If ever Ukraine were to be short of nuclear-powered electricity following the closure of Chernobyl, why not envisage supplying energy from Russia and Central Asia - which is already being done - but on a much greater scale, as the oil and gas resources of these regions are considerable."
"Here of course this is really a question of politics, and not a matter of mere experts."
"We believe, indeed, that this possibility has only been excluded in order to marginalize the Russian Federation and deliver up Ukraine to the economic appetites of the west."
"Such an attitude does not appear to us to be reasonable in the long term, and it is essential in our opinion to breach the law of silence which benefits western policy, and founded on the determined pursuit of limitless profit."
"The wish increasingly to dissociate members of the CIS one from another, and so make them into Western economic colonies, in a manner of speaking, may well be profitable in the very short term, but probably not in the longer term."
"To isolate Ukraine, to impose upon it ever more rigorous financial standards, appears not to be the best way to render it service."
"This logic is tantamount to doing nothing about the hazards of Chernobyl, which is perfectly scandalous in human terms."
"It is therefore, we believe, necessary to grant the priority loans which Ukraine needs, or alternatively - and this is not incompatible - to prompt Ukraine to draw closer to Russia, and finalize a common energy policy with Russia."
"Why would any form of rapprochement between the Russian Federation and Ukraine be taboo, whereas everywhere else, there is a push to closer links between states?"
"In our view, only such a political line of rapprochement could provide some safe outcome, first for the urgent needs of short term nuclear safety, and secondly, for the need to create a climate of peaceful cooperation in Europe, reminding ourselves of this obvious truth, which is apparently too often forgotten: the Russian Federation is also in Europe, and no-one has the power to expel it."
"Thank you Mr President, and thank you too, Mr Commissioner, for your attendance and for your answers this afternoon."
"Perhaps they were not all quite as detailed as we had hoped but perhaps you will get another chance to comment."
"We would be particularly interested in any fall-back plans you might have should things not go according to our expectations."
"Clearly we need a solution to Chernobyl."
"I am sure there is complete unanimity on that."
"Also, it is quite obvious that you, Mr Commissioner, will be safeguarding the European Union by not simply accepting the wishes of Ukraine without imposing certain conditions."
"We are indebted to our colleague, Gordon Adam, for his extremely thorough report - quite characteristic of that very diligent person - on the situation in Ukraine, which is clearly terrifying."
"This is not the time for a debate on whether or not nuclear power is a good idea and I urge colleagues not to misuse this debate for that reason."
"We are looking at a specific case."
"We are asked, and indeed President Larosière of the EBRD did raise the four safeguards that we would all want, whether, as a result of the EBRD loan we will have the highest possible existing standard of safety."
"Are we doing something which is sound in financial terms?"
"What is the bankability of Ukraine?"
"Are we putting money at risk?"
"Are we doing what is the least costly solution?"
"Other aspects also arise."
"Clearly, in western Europe, constructing nuclear power stations in our market and in our conditions is not always the least-cost at the moment."
"This worries me a lot: will the long term operational management be satisfactory?"
"If we have any doubts can we ensure through specific help, through a long term programme, that there will be backing for these people who are living through very traumatic times, so that whatever solution is chosen they will not be abandoned in a period of difficulties?"
"We know that it would not be acceptable to you, and certainly not to us, to have lower standards, money at risk, public money wasted, and we want the assurance from you that this is not contemplated."
"The energy situation in Ukraine raises much wider questions than those we have posed this evening and we have alluded to some other aspects and, indeed, other possibilities."
"They include the geo-political situation of Ukraine and its relationship with its neighbours and former masters, which we have to take into account."
"We have to look at the need to use the available western expertise in nuclear power."
"What we want more than anything else, though, is to know that no rules are being broken, that they are being kept and that what we are doing is sensible and can be justified in the eyes of the public."
"Mr President, safety aspects also militate against completion of the two nuclear power stations."
"Neither project accords with the allocation guidelines of the EBRD, and I have the results of studies which come out most clearly against the construction of these nuclear power stations."
"The modernization and completion programme planned by the operators will never satisfy Western safety principles."
"The planned modernization programme will not even comply, Mr Commissioner, with the new Russian safety standards, as the construction of the reactor type used in K2 and R4 still fulfills the old Russian standards."
"Furthermore, the modernization programme does not even meet all post-Three Mile Island requirements."
"If the project were so to be modified that it met all the above requirements, then the financial means needed for it and the time frame required for a corresponding re-equipment programme would alter so radically, that it would greatly exceed all the assumptions so far made."
"With regard to the fourth condition - environmental friendliness and citizen participation - I leave it to your assessment just what citizen participation might look like in Ukraine today."
"There must be no retreat on the closure of Chernobyl."
"On the contrary, everything possible must be done to close this damaged reactor for all time as quickly as we can."
"I think it is irresponsible to allow Chernobyl to run for even one more day, or perhaps to use it as an excuse for the construction of two more, equally problematic, nuclear power stations."
"A few days ago the President of the EBRD, Jacques Larosière, was in Austria, where he held talks with members of the Austrian Government."
"Austria came out quite clearly against any financing of these two nuclear power stations."
"As an alternative, Austria supported, amongst other measures, the modernization of existing calorific power stations."
"When one considers the heat loss of everything being built in Ukraine - up to 60 % - that is so huge that one can easily imagine that one could help the people there with far fewer resources and in a much less dangerous manner."
"Austria will obviously help to finance the sheathing of the ruined reactor at Chernobyl, and it will also pay into the corresponding funds."
"Chernobyl was one catastrophe."
"In God's name let us not create potential new catastrophes through the completion of these two doubtful nuclear power stations!"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I shall address myself directly to you, because this debate seems to me to be utterly absurd."
"It is suggested that about ECU 1 billion be collected to buy the closure of Chernobyl from the Ukrainians - let us be blunt about it - and then we should finance with this money two new nuclear power stations, which will be - as Mrs Flemming has just said - an ongoing risk. A risk not only for Ukraine, but for Europe as well."
"And at the same time they will produce energy which Ukraine does not even need!"
"I think that is an absurd development."
"By all means assist the eastern and central European countries to move away from nuclear power, but not one single ECU for the construction of more nuclear power stations!"
"Mr Commissioner, I exhort you to represent this line in the Commission, because it is the only energy policy line which can sustain the future. Anything else would be a continuation of, and a support for, a policy that is recognized as wrong."
"I exhort you to allow this line of development in energy policy generally, and particularly in this special case. Above all, to allow the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to withstand pressure from the nuclear lobby, and not to permit the very opposite."
"Mr President, the results of the disaster at Chernobyl have hung like a sword of Damocles over Ukraine and the whole of Europe for more than ten years."
"It was only possible two years ago to negotiate serious closure programmes and put them into action."
"Just how difficult this is can be seen from the question that we have put to the Commission today."
"This is a matter of more than just the completion of two nuclear power stations which - as has previously been said - are very complex and expensive, and above all do not meet Western safety requirements."
"The International Atomic Energy Agency has undertaken a safety assessment and was unable to discover this degree of safety in all points."
"In fact some important points were omitted."
"A main argument that Ukraine always raises, when alternative forms of energy are discussed, is the supply of fuel."
"If Ukraine does not want to be dependent on Russia, which would have to supply the gas for a gas power station, then I ask myself where the big uranium mines are in Ukraine, from which it could obtain its own uranium."
"This is exactly the same sort of dependence."
"I believe we have to look at energy policy in its entirety."
"We should start with least cost planning - which the bank also prescribes - and invest no money in projects that do not meet our concepts of safety and electricity output."
"It is interesting, by the way, that there has been a reduction in power production in Ukraine, where mainly calorific power stations have been closed down."
"Mr Commissioner, I very much regret that we find ourselves in a situation where we must apparently choose the lesser of two evils. I urge you to produce an energy policy with the eastern European countries which is orientated towards the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, occasionally we end up standing on our heads."
"Everybody knows today that Chernobyl must be definitively closed."
"This summer, a report from the nuclear operators throughout the world was unanimous in saying that unit 3 was now exposed to a major risk along the lines of the 1986 accident."
"Everyone agrees that Chernobyl must be closed."
"Now other nations are saying to us: we want the Ukrainians to agree with out point of view."
"The Ukrainians are independent people, they have decided to undertake an energy policy which is suitable to them, and they have asked us to help them."
"If we do not help them, what will happen?"
"We had experience of this in 1996."
"They built a nuclear power station at Zapörozhe, which is an exact replica of Chernobyl, without containment, and without the safety facilities that we employ in the west."
"If that is what we want, that is what we shall get, and you will always be able to say in Austria, or elsewhere, or in Portugal, that you don't like it, but the power station will still be there."
"Alternatively, some say, we need only recommend the building of coal, gas or oil-fired power stations."
"Well, I say that this will cost you more, and I hope that the Commission will confirm what I am saying: $ 100 million a year for a coal-fired power station which emits more CO2 into the atmosphere than is acceptable."
"And hence, curiously, the ecologists will come up to demonstrate that the nuclear power station is hazardous, while accepting coal combustion pollution."
"You need to be clear on what you want."
"What is the problem we face today?"
"It is simple: two nuclear power stations are 80 % to 85 % completed."
"In no way, ladies and gentlemen, are we to accept a new Chernobyl."
"Already western companies from France or Germany are working to install in Ukraine the facilities employed in their own western nuclear power stations."
"I would like to say to those who are exposing us today to a twin danger, that their calculation is all wrong."
"On the one hand, we shall have a nuclear accident if we do not close Chernobyl. On the other hand, we shall have pollution, if we accept power generation by archaic resources."
"This is why, today, the Ukrainians wish to be independent, and do not wish to be in the hands of the Russians, either for gas, or for uranium, or for coal, and are therefore asking us to provide them with assistance. Shall we in response to their expectations simply keep our mouths shut?"
"Or shall we implement the policy that suits the circumstances?"
"Mr President, I should be pleased to go into the matter more deeply on another occasion perhaps."
"I would say to those who have the feeling that they are not well informed, that the European Commission, I believe, has shown the necessary transparency on this point and spoken on this matter many times with the members of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy."
"I agree with the comments that have been made that we cannot hold a debate this evening for or against nuclear energy."
"We have here a debate about closing down Chernobyl and how it can be made as safe as possible. When two weeks ago, during a summit with Ukraine, we again asked President Kuchma whether he was able to confirm that his earlier political commitment to close Chernobyl in the year 2000 was still applicable, he said that it was, inasfar as the international community is also prepared to honour the commitment that it made in the Memorandum of Understanding in 1994 and 1995."
"That not only involves assistance in implementing a large energy saving programme, also in the MOU, which is also jointly financed."
"But it also involves, among other things, supporting completion of the two nuclear power plants under construction."
"If the international community does not come up with the financing - let us also be realistic about this - then we know that Ukraine has already reserved funds in its own budget at the moment in order to achieve the dismantling of the two reactors in another way, but that of course does not give the West the opportunity to lay down the safety conditions that now form part of the loans that we wish to provide for the dismantling of the reactors."
"Also, in order to avoid any misunderstanding, I understand very well that there is a dilemma at the EBRD."
"I also understand very well that scientists have argued with each other about whether this is a matter of a least cost solution or not."
"We can discuss this with each other for a long time, but in the meantime the closure of Chernobyl would be jeopardized."
"Therefore the Commission said at a given moment: we will in any case comply with what was agreed within the G7 at that time, inasfar as it is within the power of the Union."
"That implies that we are offering joint finance via Euratom loans for everything on condition a) that Chernobyl complies with the safety requirements and b) that the EBRD is prepared to jointly financed it."
"In addition, it will also be financed by Ukraine itself and third party donors will also part-finance it."
"We are awaiting the statement by the EBRD."
"The Union is spending an enormous amount of money, hundreds of millions per annum, in contributions to eastern Europe, former countries of the Soviet Union in order to ensure that unsafe nuclear reactors are either closed down or made safe again."
"I would refer you to the many discussions that we have had with each other about Kosloduy, Mochovse and so on. These things concern all of us."
"We do not take it lightly and we are not trail-blazers who purely and simply wish to promote nuclear energy."
"But we are facing an enormous dilemma here, in which, as has just been said, the Chernobyl plant and particularly unit 3 has now been declared unsafe again by international experts."
"We therefore do not have very much time left for discussion."
"We must act."
"The Commission will shoulder its responsibilities in this regard."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Van den Broek."
"I have received six motions for resolutions under Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 noon."
"The debate is closed."
"Innovation action plan"
"The next item is the report (A4-0269/97) by Mr Rovsing, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the Commission communication 'The first action plan for innovation in Europe - Innovation for growth and employment' (COM(96)0589 - C4-0624/96)"
"Mr President, at the summit in Florence in March 1996 the European Council mentioned that the efforts for employment would continue to have top priority in the Union and Member States."
"As part of a strategy aimed at achieving this goal, the European Council has asked the Commission to draw up an action plan for measures which can be implemented in the area of innovation."
"Parliament agrees with the Commission that this area is important."
"It concerns employment and earnings in the European Union."
"The post-industrial, information-based society has fulfilled a substantial part of the basic needs of citizens."
"The great challenge now for business and public institutions is to create quality and not just quantity."
"The task will be completely different from the task of building a mass production society."
"Often technological developments and changes in the social and institutional framework have quickly deprived a business of the basis of its business concept."
"Information about the socio-economic aspects of the fifth framework programme, which the Commission's DG XII presented in January 1997, reveals disturbing traits in the European Union."
"Average unemployment in the EU stands at 10 %."
"The figures for the USA and Japan are 6 % and 3 %."
"The latest estimates suggest that the businesses in which the number of jobs in Europe will rise substantially, will be those which require high qualifications, and that the jobs are more likely to come in the service sector than in manufacturing."
"Statistics show that the technology gulf between the developed and less developed regions in the European Union is twice as large as the cohesion gulf, and there is much to suggest that the gulf is widening."
"In the report we note that small and medium-sized businesses are in need of special attention."
"General instruments, tax incentives, joint industrial research projects and the exploitation of the results are more suitable than quantified set targets in the specific programmes."
"However, these measures are outside the Commission's mandate."
"Innovation indicators and finance should both be developed."
"Experience shows that a lack of access to finance is seldom the most important obstacle to innovation, even though it is often used as an excuse."
"The right financing after the introductory development phase can, however, be decisive as to whether new business are a success or a fiasco."
"There is plenty of risk capital available in the European Union, but innovations do not always meet the market's requirements."
"Risk capital and innovations will catch each other's attention if the risk capital side is convinced that prospective customers and other interested parties believe in a new business and if the entrepreneur or inventor understands that the risk capital investor wants a reasonable return on his investment."
"The education of risk capital investors and risk capital providers is necessary to enable them to spot the new business opportunities."
"It is wrong to believe that the European Union can solve the problems of unemployment."
"That is chiefly a task for the individual Member States."
"We should not give our citizens the idea that the Amsterdam Treaty can solve the problem of unemployment in Europe."
"It can only make a modest contribution to that end."
"In our report we stress that innovation policy in the Member States is a substantial part of the education system, and we point out, among other things, that in the short term neither legislation nor measures will contribute to a genuine culture of innovation."
"We are also of the opinion that high environmental standards will give rise to innovation in the area of new technologies to the great benefit of mankind."
"We call on the Commission, among others, to prioritize its proposals and to make EU research more innovation-orientated."
"Finally we call on the Member States to review courses and teaching methods to stimulate creativity and enterprise at as early a stage as possible and to consider what essential changes must be made in the training of teachers."
"We urge them to create greater mobility of people between universities and industry and to consider favourable tax conditions for investment in innovative projects or businesses."
"Finally our proposal emphasizes a desire to give the Commission greater powers to guide research and development projects under the framework programmes, so that the Commission can change projects and start new projects when developments in basic research and new technologies make this appropriate."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur Mr Rovsing for an excellent report."
"It is one that has been very helpful to our debates."
"It is appropriate that the first action plan for innovation in Europe should come from Florence which was the centre of so much early European civilization."
"We are aware that the correlation between research, technological development and innovation on the one hand and productivity growth and job creation on the other is very strong."
"We are aware too that the European Union is less efficient than its competitors at exploiting the ideas we have."
"Indeed, we currently have a deficit of ECU 24 billion per annum in hi-tech trade with Japan and the USA."
"Clearly we need education and skills development."
"Clearly we need, and are seeing, benchmarking by our companies."
"Clearly we need better provision of finance for small businesses."
"Essentially this will be at the individual, local and national level but it is important that the Union sets the operational environment. That it can do in areas such as competition, intellectual property and the functioning of the single market."
"And not least too in assisting with finance for small businesses."
"This action plan is good and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy of this Parliament welcomes it."
"But we need to prioritize to a greater extent, which is not easy for the Commission but which is essential, to create more opportunity to provide equity finance and to work on the European company statute."
"There is much to be gained."
"The great giant, IBM, recently looked to a small Belgian company when it was looking for voice recognition technology."
"Clearly there is a lot that can be done in Europe."
"Far more will be achieved through programmes such as this than ever will be achieved through the jobs package which is being dressed up by the European Council to convince our citizens that we are doing something about employment."
"I welcome this report and believe that Parliament should spend a lot of time looking at what the Commission is doing and ensuring that our innovation policies, which will really foster jobs, will take us forward into the next century."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have been appointed rapporteur on the current and future situation regarding European industrial competitiveness, and I am therefore working urgently on this important dossier."
"I can also tell you that I am a militant Web-surfer, and therefore extremely conscious, not only of the great importance of the Net, but also of our considerable backwardness in this field."
"I therefore read Mr Rovsing's report with great interest, and I can say that I accept, that the Socialist group accepts, many of the observations, reflections and proposals contained in that report."
"I can also say that I shall include a number of those observations, reflections and propositions in my own report, which is due in a few months."
"In the few minutes available to me, I wish to go to the essential, in the three briefest of points."
"First point, in the European Union - you have said so and everyone has said so - we are short of innovation, which is the consequence of the relative trimming back in our research effort. This has occurred in spite of the initiatives of the European Commission."
"The shortfall in research is, without any doubt, one of the causes of the rise in unemployment in the European Union in the last few years, and the situation has been aggravated by very substantial delays in the field of new technologies - a dossier with which I am also well acquainted - and in particular, the take-up of new technology among the population, and especially among the youth, through our national educational systems."
"Additionally, as has been said or can be read here and there, in the fields of information technology and communications, we are still in the Middle Ages, in a manner of speaking. And as some countries will move from the Middle Ages into the third millennium in the next ten or twenty years to come, we should take stock of the urgency and importance of the efforts required in Europe to improve research, develop new technologies and promote innovation, and in particular in communication."
"For this, we need larger budgets, as everyone will agree, but also priorities in our actions, a proposal with which I also agree."
"Can I say that it will be necessary perhaps, everywhere in Europe, to put everyone on Internet, and in particular political and economic managers and senior decision makers, who often spend their time talking about things they know little about."
"This is either because they have no personal experience, or because they ensure that that experience is confined to their secretaries. This for me would be a real, a new, a great service to be developed, one which would indeed be universal, and in the general public interest."
"Madam Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today much is being said about employment."
"However employment presupposes economic growth, which itself requires research, technological development and innovation."
"Hence, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Commission and ministers - who are not represented here this evening - maybe we need to combat all temptations or attempts at bringing cost cutting of the Malthus style into our budgets."
"Mr President, we in Europe are experts in consumption, but not very good at investing."
"We are experts in taking money from businesses, after which we set up aid programmes which give part of the money back."
"We are experts at taxing initiative and poor at rewarding it."
"We are far behind the USA and Japan with regard to technological innovation."
"We have only 2 business scientists per 1, 000 employees, while the USA and Japan have 6."
"That is why we in Europe also have twice the unemployment of the USA and three times the unemployment of Japan."
"We have, in other words, ' difficulties with innovation' ."
"We have problems with flexibility, which is noticeably worse, perhaps because we in Europe cultivate rights instead of incentives, and rules instead of opportunities."
"When we paralyze innovation or restrict it, we also restrict job creation."
"But those who cling to the jobs of the past restrict the jobs of the future."
"The way to more jobs, better workplaces and a better environment and working environment is through innovation."
"Christian Rovsing's outstanding report rightly stresses that innovation is not created by laws and rules, but what you can do is remove burdens and hindrances and promote a competitive and rewarding business sector, and you can reward innovation."
"So we can do something for education and research."
"We can foster a culture of independence, and the European institutions should also practise what they preach to others."
"That applies to this Parliament where I myself have the honour of being responsible for technological innovation in connection with the new buildings, but it also applies, for example, to European schools, which should be an example, but which from a technological point of view are definitely not an example, perhaps because they are subject to a centralized form of management."
"Mr President, our group values Mr Rovsing's report highly and considers it to be very good overall. We also think that the Commission's communication is a positive step."
"We agree with Mr Rovsing's appraisal of communication failings and about the need to establish priorities and clarify the European Union's obligations."
"However, there are various contradictions and ambiguities, which mean that in the end our opinion is not entirely positive."
"Firstly, it is said that innovation will result in more jobs, but the innovation and employment statistics from the last 25 years indicate precisely the opposite."
"The increased productivity yield per hour worked means there is a decrease in the number of jobs."
"Secondly, there are calls for European policy to improve the structure of research - which we think is correct - and also its relationship with small businesses."
"But the way the framework-programmes have developed in recent years means that there is a growing concentration of resources in a few outstanding regions, and a privileged link with large industries."
"Thirdly, we think that although the investments supported by the Commission are important and result in improved funding, the Maastricht criteria are nevertheless imposing budgetary restrictions on research as well, both overall and in each country."
"Fourthly, it is said that there is a need for a favourable climate, but students' training causes an increase in competitiveness and individualism, and this can hinder that favourable climate."
"Finally, we believe that we need to rely much more on the workers and the unions, both within companies and outside them, to be able to create this climate of technological innovation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has a special place within the industrial world."
"Alas, that position is one of particularly low growth, and particularly high unemployment levels."
"Under such circumstances, innovation is effectively a necessity, not only for the present, but also for the future."
"Mr Rovsing's report rightly emphasizes the comparative weakness of the research and development drive in Europe as compared to the United States and Japan."
"While this is easily said, the solutions have yet to be found."
"In this respect, I wish to remind you that innovation is above all a matter of business, and those who work in businesses."
"As has so rightly been said by the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, the public authorities, be they regional, national or European, are not the best place to decide on the skills and qualifications required by businesses."
"The role of the authorities in this field, as in many others incidentally, is to create an environment favourable to corporate innovation."
"Indeed, it is only if society as a whole is borne up by a spirit of enterprise, with the risks and innovations that this involves, that enterprises will effectively be able to develop a dynamics of research and development."
"The key factor is therefore to ensure that national legislation applies to the patents and know-how which promote innovation. But we must also ensure that the burden of taxation should not be intolerable and discouraging for companies that might no longer have the resources to invest in research and development."
"We therefore need to congratulate the rapporteur, who has emphasized the need to avoid excessive regulation."
"The report's recommendations lay great emphasis on the role of small and medium-sized companies."
"Their role is clear, but you will allow me to give equal emphasis to the major role of the larger companies in this field."
"We should also, possibly, have raised the question of technology transfers and cooperation between large and small companies, particularly large companies and sub-contracting companies."
"In regard to small and medium-sized companies, it should be noted that they already consider that they are all too often at some considerable distance from the national authorities."
"Hence, the Community authorities will appear to them to be even more remote."
"In this field, as in others, the principle of subsidiarity must not only be raised, but also respected."
"Finally and in conclusion, I would like to insist on the fact that innovation can only develop in an economic and social climate which is favourable to enterprise, and that it is vain to promote special campaigns in this field and to devise assistance and incentives, if economic policy is locked up in narrow monetarism, and does not favour growth."
"Innovation, and here I repeat myself, is above all the business of the enterprise sector itself, and of the men and women who give that sector life."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate concerns an extremely interesting subject."
"I wish to bring forward a few points in this debate that I personally feel are of great importance."
"I have also found them in the Commission document and in the excellent report by the rapporteur."
"The financing of innovative companies and especially young people starting up and pace-setting companies by means of investment and risk capital is one of the keys to innovation."
"From research we know that innovation is especially to be found among these young, new companies."
"We have spoken here about getting the discussion going."
"If we debate this subject with each other, then I should very much like to mention the phenomenon of the role of the bankers and the large pension funds."
"There are enormous amounts of money there."
"I think they could be made better use of and in order to get the banks in on this, I think this debate could be an excellent way of doing this."
"I also want to ask again for attention be paid to the European company statute."
"It has been dropped again."
"It was often discussed in Parliament in the past."
"Also very important is the role of education, the role of the combination of universities and business and last but not least I believe that the SMEs in particular can play a large part in this innovation which is something that we all want."
"As my very last point, I therefore wish to refer to the letter from the chairman of the Committee on Culture who is afraid that we just keep on talking to each other and invites us to do something."
"I think that is a message we should take to heart."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Parliament for the interest it has shown in the first action plan for innovation."
"This has benefited from extensive scrutiny, as three Committees - the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - have given their opinions to the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy."
"My thanks go first to Mr Rovsing for the quality of his report."
"It is stimulating in its criticism and motivating for the Commission, because the report invites the Commission to do more, particularly in the fields of finance for innovation and management of Community programmes for research and development."
"The Commission is sensitive to the rapporteur's recommendation, which invites the Commission to set up priorities on four points."
"The Commission shares the opinion of the rapporteur with regard to the priority to be granted to the question of finance and innovation."
"This, as you have rightly emphasized, is a vast question, which covers company start-ups, venture capital, transeuropean capital markets for high-growth companies, stock options, equity finance, etc. The Commission on 1 July 1997 launched a pilot project - Hightech, Innovation and Technology Equity Capital - in collaboration with the European Investment Fund, to encourage private venture capital operators to invest in the start-up phases of technologically innovative projects."
"The project was very warmly welcomed, and in two months, many funds were committed to playing a more active role."
"The European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund should also in the future, and in accordance with the resolution of the European summit for growth and employment held at Amsterdam, contribute to the improvement of the potential for innovation among companies in the European Union."
"The second point is that of intellectual property, and this is one of the priorities of the Commission."
"On 25 June 1997 the Commission adopted the Green Paper on the Community patent and on patent systems in Europe."
"The Green Paper was to be an incentive to extensive debate and was intended to result in measures for substantial improvement of the current system of patent protection."
"And you know that in this field there is much that needs to be done."
"I rely on the support of Parliament in the approach adopted, which will be absolutely decisive."
"The Commission also intends to introduce an assistance and information service on questions of intellectual property for the fifth framework programme."
"It is vital that results financed out of public money should be better exploited, and this service should contribute to that."
"The third point is that the framework programme should mark a change in Community policy towards research for innovation."
"Innovation should become a concern to be included in the operation of theme-based programmes."
"The innovation and participation programme for small and medium-sized companies should be attentive to this as part of its co-ordinating and supporting role, while carrying out its own activities."
"The rapprochement between the themes of innovation and small and medium-sized companies within a single programme should make it possible to open up this framework programme more widely to small and medium-sized companies, and to ensure they benefit more broadly from its results, by making a better evaluation of their requirements."
"The improvement in methods of management of the framework programme should facilitate the re-orientation of programmes or projects currently in their execution phase, in the light of technological and social requirements."
"Finally, and this is the fourth point, the Commission is convinced of the importance of the educational and cultural dimension."
"This is one of the three themes retained by the action plan."
"Competitiveness and employment in Europe depend upon mastery of information, of knowledge and of adaptability."
"The implementation of the proposals of the White Paper on education and training, in particular Erasmus and apprenticeship, and the pilot projects such as 'Learning in the information society' , should contribute to promoting innovation and ensuring its image is democratized."
"In conclusion, the debate around the Green Paper and the publication of the action plan have raised awareness of the importance of innovation for company competitiveness, for growth and for employment."
"Mr Rovsing's report provides a critical and enriching back-up to the approach of the Commission."
"This report encourages the Commission to pursue its efforts and even to go further on some points."
"Parliament's recommendations and suggestions will be taken into account by the Commission in the implementation of its action plan and in the preparation of the Luxembourg summit on employment."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Cresson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Imports of CFC products from China and Russia"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:"
"B4-0522/97 - O-0106/97 by Mr Teverson and Mr Eisma, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party to the Commission, on the illegal network importing CFC products from China and Russia into the European Union; -B4-0523/97 - O-0107/97 by Mr Dupuis and Mr Macartney, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, to the Commission, on illegal imports of CFCs."
"Mr President, one of the things that impressed the world most in terms of global environmental action was the Montreal Protocol - the agreement, that was unique at that time, between 24 nations to work towards a ban on CFCs."
"That has now grown to 163 countries and indeed production is now banned in the European Union, in OECD countries and will be in developing countries from the year 2010."
"That protocol was a unique combination of determination between NGOs, government and business to solve a vital environmental problem."
"But that good work, as we have seen from a number of reports recently, has been undermined by smuggling, estimated at up to some 20, 000 tonnes a year, a third of world trade, undermining quite substantially the legitimate industry that is trying to provide substitutes."
"Europe has been described as being awash with illegal CFCs."
"These have come primarily from Russia, often relabelled as being recycled products - Russia appears to be contravening the Montreal Convention - and from China where output is actually growing."
"The solution must be a ban on sales; not just of virgin CFCs which is important and taken on board quite substantially by the European Commission and a number of European nations, but a total ban because of the problem of relabelling and lack of control."
"While those sales go on there must also be a licensing system world-wide that is fully accountable and fully traceable."
"I, personally, have always been a great subscriber to the principle of subsidiarity in European decision-making, but this is one area in a global environmental issue where there is no room for subsidiarity."
"Europe, the Council of Ministers, the Commission and Parliament together should be working for the highest standards to make sure that the principles of the Montreal Protocol are not undermined but are indeed strengthened."
"Industry is behind it."
"The health of future generations, certainly in the northern hemisphere, is very much threatened by this smuggling and continued use of CFCs."
"I ask the Commission, which has been a strong advocate of reform, what step it is now going to take to stop this smuggling of CFCs into the European Union?"
"Mr President, we generally keep an extremely close watch on the action of the Commission services, and we often recommend they show more vigour."
"However, in the matter about which we have just received information from our colleague, the Parliament should be invited to congratulate the Commission services, which are frequently put in a difficult position because, in the field of combatting fraud, they bring to light fraud which very often is more or less covered by the administrations of the Member States."
"Our group therefore wishes that the action of the Commission services should be supported by the whole of the Parliament."
"It should be remembered that production of CFCs has been banned since 1995 in the European Union, and is also in general banned in all the developed countries, and will be so in all the developing countries from 2010."
"For the present, we accept the import of these products into the European Union, on a quota system."
"However these quotas must be respected!"
"Nevertheless, we see that the lack of international customs cooperation and the poor quality of cooperation between the customs departments of the Member States, in matters affecting the environment, creates breaches in the protection to which our countries should be entitled."
"The intervention of UCLAF is therefore a major victory, in so far as coordination at European Union level seems to have borne fruit."
"The Group of the European Radical Alliance wishes to invite Parliament to make progress towards total prohibition of CFC imports into the European Union."
"It invites the Commissioner and the Commission to work in close cooperation with the parties to the Montreal Convention, in order to set up a very strict regime of sanctions against those operating illegally."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission was warned, some time back, of illicit transactions in substances which deplete the ozone layer, and has therefore taken and continues to take measures at various levels."
"The European Commission unit for combatting fraud has intervened, as you emphasized, to institute and coordinate inquiries with the customs departments of the Member States."
"These inquiries have recently resulted in discoveries of illegal imports into a number of Member States (Germany, Netherlands, Belgium) of some 1, 000 tonnes of CFC and halon of Chinese origin."
"The merchandise was seized and the persons suspected of the fraud arrested."
"Other inquiries relating to situations and products of different types and provenance are underway."
"Simultaneously, several initiatives have been taken to reinforce the control system and seek out possible sources of illegal imports."
"In these past few days in particular, parties to the Montreal protocol on substances depleting the ozone layer have been studying the problem as part of a tenth anniversary meeting, and are discussing a proposal whose aim is to oblige all parties to set up a regime of licences for the import and export of substances of this type."
"The European Community is already managing a system of quotas and licences for the import of these substances. However, it goes without saying that the efforts of all parties should be coordinated to prevent illegal trading."
"The Commission intends, at the time of the revision of Council Regulation 3093/94 relating to such substances, to propose the prohibition of the sale and use of CFCs, whose production has already been banned since 1995."
"The prohibition of sale would eliminate demand, and hence the temptation of illegal trade."
"In parallel, the European Union has, under the Montreal protocol, submitted a proposal to all the industrialized countries, and this is also under discussion."
"The regulation lays the obligation on all Member States to set out persuasive sanctions in the event of non-compliance with provisions, but it is their responsibility, clearly, to apply these sanctions effectively."
"Mr President, I am pleased to hear what Mrs Cresson says."
"It is certainly different from what the Commission said last year when Mrs Bjerregaard spoke on the subject."
"First of all, I must welcome the report by the Environmental Investigation Agency which has exposed this trade and provided the undeniable evidence which means that the Commission must act against this illegal trade."
"Despite the report and questions from the Institute of International Affairs and questions by myself and other Members in the past, the Commission has been slow to act on this."
"Indeed, in May last year Mrs Bjerregaard said: ' we obviously are interested to study reports from the UK, but we will have to see if there is enough information to take the matter forward' ."
"Well, I am pleased to hear that the Commission is taking the matter forward at last - at last - but not far enough!"
"Anybody who has studied this trade knows quite clearly that it is a classic example of the operations of illegal crime and illegal trade in general."
"The Commission must not just take action against the demand, it must take action against the supply."
"There are clearly alternatives to all existing uses and the Commission has been slow to ban the use and the sale of CFCs within the Community."
"But the matter does not stop there, Mrs Cresson."
"You have got to take action against the supply as well."
"A World Bank plan exists to buy out almost half the world's production in Russia, costing only $ 27 million, yet the response by Member States so far has been poor."
"Britain has offered $ 3 million, Denmark has offered $ 2 million, Norway - it is not in the Union, but at least it is a responsible country - has offered $ 2 million."
"The Americans have also offered money."
"I would call upon the Commission to get its full strength and full weight behind this proposal to buy that production out, to isolate the remaining production in China and to ensure that this illegal trade is stopped."
"You can buy it out - it costs peanuts."
"Why has the Commission not done it?"
"Why has it not acted in the interests of the people of Europe in response to calls from their representatives like myself and others who have asked questions in the past?"
"It has been slow to act and the consequences are severe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two old proverbs to start with."
"Whenever money is to be earned by circumventing the law, crime cannot be far away."
"The other: the fact that UCLAF, the European Commission's fraud squad, has got onto the trail of these nefarious dealings shows that the controls are working."
"At the forefront of the oral question are illegal imports from China, and possibly also from Russia."
"In Germany they have just uncovered the illegal import of 1, 000 tonnes of CFCs from Great Britain."
"There is also evidence that some other countries in eastern and central Europe are not obeying the current agreement on ending the production and use of CFCs, which have been identified as an ozone killer."
"Ten years ago 24 states and the European Union signed the Montreal Agreement, the aim of which was, and is, the phased cessation of CFC production and a phased renunciation of other agents which are most damaging to the ozone layer."
"CFCs have been forbidden in industrial countries since 1996."
"Despite this, some 240, 000 tonnes are still produced worldwide every year."
"Consumption still rises worldwide by about 4 %, mainly in the developing countries."
"Even here in Europe CFCs have not been entirely abandoned in existing installations, for instance, condenser plant. This is not merely on grounds of cost - the replacement of all these installations would swallow enormous sums - but also for environmental reasons."
"There are insufficient plants across the world to remove these CFCs without causing environmental damage."
"To satisfy the need for an alternative there is the so-called quota system, and in the resolution motion which we are voting on tomorrow we shall be unable to pass point 6, because here the question is raised about what is to happen to the quantities that cannot be removed."
"We in the European Union must not only see that the existing laws and treaties are obeyed, and that offenses are strictly penalized, but we must take every step to ensure that developing countries and those in the former Eastern Block are persuaded to forgo the use of CFCs earlier than hitherto foreseen - by the year 2010, in fact."
"For this they need our financial and technical support."
"We must likewise do all in our power to reduce the use of other ozoneharmful agents."
"Methyl bromide, which has two thirds of the damaging potential of CFC, and is used mainly in developing countries in agriculture, is principal amongst these."
"The same applies, though, to the partially-halogenated hydro-chloro-fluorocarbons, the HCFCs, which are being increasingly introduced throughout the world as replacements for CFCs, and whose damaging effect is only 20 % of the CFCs' potential."
"For this reason we cannot vote under point 7 for inclusion of the HCFCs."
"We should like it removed, because it is simply impossible."
"Throughout the world there is resistance to an earlier end to the use of these materials."
"The European Union should, as already agreed, lead with a good example here."
"Mr President, in this one minute I can merely say that I am very worried about the illegal trade."
"Another 96, 000 tonnes of CFCs, and in July of this year it was discovered that 150 tonnes of these dangerous substances were being dealt in illegally and that they come particularly from China and Russia."
"But I have not completely understood from the Commission what specific action and sanctions they now wish to impose on the dealers in these illegal substances."
"Perhaps the Commission could just have a better look at this matter."
"If I have understood the Commission properly, during the Montreal conference that ends tomorrow, it will also put forward proposals to prohibit the sale and use of all CFCs worldwide."
"But I should also like to know, and I ask the Commission once again, whether in the one remaining day of the conference it also wishes to ban the substitutes for CFCs and methyl bromide."
"I hope we will receive a report on this Montreal Conference and the effort that the Commission has made and we would ask the Commission to let us have the report as quickly as possible so that we will know what the Commission has done."
"Mr President, as many speakers have already mentioned, part, in fact a very large part, of the illegal imports of freons comes from China."
"Some also comes from Russia. A while ago German newspapers reported on how a seller of fire-fighting equipment had been arrested for illegally importing freons from China."
"The profits which can be made from this are thought to be up to around 300 per cent, and around 10, 000 tonnes of illegal freons are said to be imported into the European Union each year."
"This is therefore a very serious problem as everyone has stressed in this debate."
"The question is how we are to overcome it."
"The World Bank is now trying, as some speakers also mentioned, to buy out the people who produce these substances. For example, by providing DM 140 million to Russia so that they will refrain from producing what they have committed themselves by agreement not to produce."
"This is perhaps a doubtful method, but you must still ask yourself whether it is not a necessary method."
"Since developing countries now have the right to produce freons until the year 2010, there is perhaps no alternative but to buy them out in one way or another."
"It would be interesting to know whether the Commission has thought about this; in other words, what is its view on the World Bank's project and is it prepared to support it?"
"Is the Commission further prepared in the case of China to open special discussions with the Chinese government to see whether the Chinese authorities can be of assistance in stopping this at source?"
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, smuggling occurs when it brings in a lot of money."
"The contraband CFCs that have been discovered are surely a mere fraction of what is being smuggled into the Union."
"My colleague, Mr Bowe, has drawn attention to that fact."
"I, too, have put a series of questions to the Commission in this context, because rumours of smuggling have repeatedly arisen."
"They are not being smuggled because they are themselves so valuable, but because their manufacture is prohibited, and yet much equipment and many installations that cannot function without CFCs are still in existence."
"This is, I believe, one of the main points we have to bear in mind."
"It is not enough to prohibit manufacture."
"It is not enough to prohibit sales."
"It is not enough to prohibit imports."
"One must also work towards the phased removal, modification or replacement with new models of all those installations that still operate with CFCs today."
"That is most certainly also an area which must be researched, not just into replacement materials, but also replacement equipment and installations."
"If someone owns a car cooled with CFCs, replacement for the air conditioning costs over $ 200, and that money can buy a car in the USA."
"So this means that if we are serious about the matter, we must start with the total removal from use of this material, which causes long term damage to the ozone layer."
"Many of us will not live to see the day when the ozone layer has so far recovered as to equate once more with pre-1970 levels."
"I believe it will also be necessary to reinforce control measures in Member States, to examine quotas carefully, and perhaps to buy more equipment like that used in the USA to detect smuggled CFCs."
"This also would be an important step, but all that can only be one measure to bring about a faster end to use."
"As far as I am aware, Directorate General XI is preparing a document that will also enable the Union to introduce an earlier end to the use of HCFCs."
"We should all work together on this, as far as both investment and replacement compounds are concerned."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall try to reply to the questions which have been raised, and this will enable me to give details of the Commission's position."
"Some of you have raised questions as to the exact scope of this traffic."
"For some time already, complaints have been made about illegal imports of CFCs, and the industry believes that such traffic could involve volumes of between 10, 000 and 15, 000 tonnes annually."
"Furthermore, an NGO, the Environmental Investigation Agency, which is principally in charge of such problems, in a recent publication made reference to imports ranging from 6, 000 to 20, 000 tonnes."
"Others have raised questions as to the resources available to the Commission for undertaking legal action against customers involved in traffic of this kind."
"The follow-up on violations of European legislation - that is, the obligation to set up a system of licences, prohibition of imports, and the relevant sanctions - falls within the responsibility of the Member States."
"As I said earlier, the European Commission anti-fraud unit has opened and coordinated inquiries with the customs departments of the Member States."
"Sanctions differ from one state to another, and are not homogeneous."
"Yet others again have raised questions about the current situation on the application of Community legislation in the various Member States."
"The Community stipulations relating to the inspection of substances depleting the ozone layer are applied thanks to regulations which directly involve economic operators."
"Another question raised relates to the continuation of CFC imports."
"Basically, are there no replacement products?"
"If we look at the various sectors in which the CFCs were originally used, it can be seen that in aerosols, with the exception of inhalers for asthma treatment - where their use is essential - solvents have been suppressed, and foams are now totally CFC-free."
"Replacement products used in this sector are hydrocarbons, HCFCs, and to a lesser extent, HFCs."
"In the refrigeration equipment field, the industry believes that a volume of between 50, 000 and 100, 000 tonnes of CFC is still contained in existing equipment."
"Increasingly, HCFCs are used as a substitute for CFCs."
"Ammonia and hydrocarbons are also increasingly used in the new equipment."
"The question may arise as to whether the Commission believes that total prohibition of the sale and use of CFCs - which is equivalent to drying up the supply of CFCs - would also be the most appropriate means to eliminate demand and facilitate inspections."
"Effectively, a provision which would make it unlawful to maintain CFCs on the market, for example, prohibition of sale, would certainly contribute greatly to ease of control."
"What strategy does the Commission intend to adopt now, particularly within the framework of the Montreal conference?"
"At the Montreal conference, the Community is working for the introduction by all parties of a regime of licences for the import and export of substances which deplete the ozone layer."
"The position of the Commission is therefore very firm."
"Furthermore, the European Community has put forward a proposal whose aim is to forbid the sale of CFCs in all industrialized countries."
"Mr President, the Commissioner was about to tell us whether or not the Commission believed that a total ban was going to be Commission policy or not and then, certainly as far as the interpreting was concerned, I never heard the answer to that question."
"I seek clarification."
"Does the Commission believe that this strong policy of stopping sales altogether is a Commission policy or not?"
"Yes, Mr Teverson, you are quite right."
"The European Community has presented a proposal whose aim is to forbid sales of CFCs in all industrialized countries."
"I also said that, clearly, the prohibition of CFC sales would facilitate the combat against fraud."
"These two proposals therefore overlap."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Cresson."
"I have received four motions for resolutions under Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 noon."
"The joint debate is closed."
"Helms-Burton Act"
"The next item is the oral question (B4-0521/97 - O-0102/97) by Mrs Castellina, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, to the Commission, on the negotiations between the Commission and the US administration on the Helms-Burton Act."
"Mr President, this is an oral question put by the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"I am grateful to Commissioner Brittan for being here."
"Next Thursday the second bilateral meeting between the United States and the European Union will begin in Paris on setting common criteria for the definition of rules to guarantee the safety of investments. These rules are to be included in the multilateral agreement on MIA investments currently under negotiation."
"We do not know what was discussed and what guidelines were adopted at the previous meeting."
"But we do know that they will be decisive, given the weight of the two players in the CSCE."
"That is also why the Committee on External Economic Relations is raising the need to be better informed during the actual course of the discussions, before being faced with a take-it-or-leave-it agreement."
"We are all convinced that guarantee rules for all should be established at the international level, but we are still concerned, all the more so as the decision on this closer consultation between the European Union and the United States was part of an agreement which led to the suspension of the WTO panel when the United States was in the dock over its Helms-Burton Act."
"This suspension has already caused concern in this Parliament which had, moreover, like the Council, taken a firm position against the American embargo."
"So we would like to understand better how and whether the rules intended to guarantee investments will safeguard the sovereignty of our countries, so as to continue to guarantee their legislative autonomy."
"Your colleague, Commissioner Fischler, himself raised the same question the other day on the BSE issue, asking whether and to what extent, within the context of this general liberalization, it would still be possible to take the necessary steps to protect the health of European citizens."
"In short, we do not want obligations introduced through this agreement to distort our legislation and, I think, many European constitutions as well."
"But, more particularly, we would like clarification on any proposed retroactive effect of the rules in question."
"What is intended?"
"Is it really intended to reopen the nationalization chapter?"
"And if it is, starting from when?"
"I hear that a Polish citizen, who at one time had his Warsaw mansion expropriated, is now reclaiming the building which is now the property of the American embassy, which has naturally refused to hand it over."
"That is only one example of what could happen if this chapter is reopened."
"Finally, and this is a basic clarification, if there is a wish to apply a retroactive criterion to Cuba and support the approach of the United States on nationalization issues, given that in that country a large part of the property belonging to foreigners or Cubans who have emigrated to the United States was nationalized 36 years ago, and considering that, while virtually every other state has for years sought compromise solutions on its citizens' nationalized property, the United States has refused to do so, the new rules under discussion could be extended to any commercial operation, any investment in that island, in contradiction, I repeat, to the decisions which have been taken by the European Union."
"Mr Commissioner, these are the clarifications the Committee on External Economic Relations would like to have."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I say first of all that looking at the question generally, the existence of the World Trade Organization and the ability to take a case to the World Trade Organization has been the best and perhaps the only effective weapon the European Union has against the completely unacceptable attempt of the United States to export its policies and impose them upon us."
"Without such a dispute settlement mechanism, without those rules, we would have very little ammunition indeed in this contest."
"I say that because it illustrates very well the importance of the European Union staying loyal to the principles of the World Trade Organization because they enable us to defend our interests."
"But we have to use them in the right way."
"In answer to some of the other points, I will reiterate the facts of the matter."
"The understanding of 11 April 1997 reached between the European Union and the United States calls for the development of disciplines which 'should inhibit and deter the future acquisition of investments from any state which has expropriated or nationalized such investments in contravention of international law and subsequent dealings in covert investments' ."
"It is clear from that language that the understanding does not necessarily provide for the negotiation of disciplines which would prohibit future investments in expropriative property because it talks about inhibiting and deterring and also refers to investments in contravention of international law and not otherwise."
"Of course not all such investments will be in contravention of international law."
"In addition and in parallel, the understanding also calls for the European Union and the United States to work together to address and resolve through agreed principles the issues of conflicting jurisdictions and secondary boycotts."
"It is very important to note that the negotiations on this point have to be parallel with the negotiations on investment disciplines."
"There is one thing that is of interest to the United States; there is the other which is of interest to us."
"Therefore it is a balanced agreement."
"Another element of the understanding is the D'Amato legislation."
"The full implementation of the understanding would call for the United States to grant the European Union a multilateral regime waiver under this legislation, which is not the subject of the case in the WTO but nonetheless is part of our agreement with the United States."
"The understanding presupposes the continued waiver of Title 3 of the Helms-Burton Act and also that Congress will amend Helms-Burton to permit a presidential waiver of Title 4."
"With regard to the observation that the European Union has committed itself to join the efforts of the United States to promote democracy in Cuba, which is referred to in the text of the oral question, I would remind the honourable Member that the language of the understanding is quite clear."
"It does not contain a commitment on the part of the European Union and the United States to take action jointly."
"Each side remains free to judge how, where and when it wishes to raise these issues in Cuba."
"Therefore, on the question of whether the Commission considers that such disciplines would make it impossible to invest in Cuba, taking account of the historical factors mentioned by the honourable Member, I would say clearly once again that the coverage of past expropriations is not excluded by the wording of the understanding but that it presupposes that a clear violation of international law has taken place and, as I have indicated, the understanding only commits the European Union to disciplines which would inhibit and deter investments, and not to disciplines which would prohibit investments."
"The latter would in any case be difficult for the Community owing to our almost complete freedom from capital movement restrictions as set forth by Article 73(b) of the EC Treaty."
"The next question relates to the fact that international law provides rules on investment protection, including rules on the legality of expropriations."
"One of the criteria for determining the legality of an expropriation is whether prompt, adequate and effective compensation has been paid by the expropriating state."
"The Commission and the Member States have consistently in our negotiations insisted on the fact that under the understanding, disciplines could only apply to expropriations which have taken place in contravention of international law."
"The precise conditions for determining when that has happened are still a matter for discussion."
"It will be clear from what I have said that the negotiations are currently at a complex and delicate stage."
"The Commission's objective remains to achieve a balanced solution covering both the disciplines for investment in expropriated property in the sense that I have described them, and the principles on conflicting requirements and secondary boycotts."
"Any deal would have to lead to Congress adopting the legislative amendments to permit a waiver of Title 4 of the Helms-Burton Act; and the United States' Administration would also have to grant a multilateral regime waiver under the D'Amato Act."
"The negotiators are in Paris this week for the sixth round of negotiations and further discussions are scheduled for the month of October."
"For the moment we do not have an agreement but those are the principles and procedures which we are applying."
"Mr President, I am glad the Commissioner has reminded us of the terms of the agreement which was reached between the European Commission and the Clinton Administration (and subsequently modified in part by the Council of Ministers of the European Union) because, as the Commissioner has well demonstrated, this is not just any agreement, but is conditional. Sir Leon has reminded us of the conditions, but I would like to stress the two basic ones."
"On the one hand the European Union suspended the World Trade Organization complaint proceedings, and the United States promised to postpone the application of Title 3. President Clinton renewed this promise on July 18, incidentally provoking a further six months' worth of sarcasm from the Cuban authorities, who jokingly said that the United States were postponing the sovereignty of the rest of the world for another six months."
"As I understand it, the second basic condition accepted by the United States authorities was the amendment of Title 4."
"But, Mr President, I have heard nothing to say that this amendment to Title 4, which requires the intervention of the United States Congress, has yet happened."
"And as the Commissioner knows perfectly well, the Clinton Administration is one thing, and the United States Congress is quite another."
"All these agreements were forged, Mr President, on the understanding that if any person physically, legally or morally belonging to the European Union was affected, or if the conceded annulments did not happen or were altered, the European Union reserved the automatic right to re-initiate the normal WTO complaint procedure."
"And we have never accepted the extra-territorial principle of the act, which interferes with the trade relations of the European Union and its Member States with third countries such as Cuba."
"I should like to say, Mr President, that our political group has always rejected the Helms-Burton Act. This is mainly for three basic reasons."
"Firstly, it increases the already great suffering of the Cuban people. Secondly, it introduces an extra-territorial aspect which deeply offends any sovereign state, as I have previously stated to this House."
"And thirdly, Mr President, it calls into question the authority of the WTO as a body devoted to settling and resolving these conflicts."
"Sir Leon has told us that it is the best guarantee of defending the basic concepts of the European Union."
"Going by the results of the recent banana and hormone panels, I am not sure about that."
"Anyway, as regards this Helms-Burton Act proposal, it is absolutely clear that the European Union has right on its side, but it has nevertheless sought an amicable solution for the time being."
"Bearing in mind that when the European Commission signed this agreement with the Clinton Administration the time limit was 15 October, it would perhaps be a good idea if the Commission could tell us the position of the United States Congress as regards the amendment of Title 4."
"I was recently in the United States, with the delegation which I head, and judging from what we heard on the subject of the amendment to Title 4 from congressmen and senators, their position is not at all clear."
"I end, Mr President, by saying that we reject the terms of this act because, although the aims include the promotion of a peaceful transition towards freedom in Cuba, as regards human rights and democratic liberties, we do not agree with the method. These boycott policies which have been going on now for 40 years have not led to the slightest advance in these matters, as mentioned by the European Union in its statement of 2 December."
"Mr President, we have debated the Helms-Burton Act here many times and passed resolutions on it, and the position of my group with regard to the extra-territorial provisions in this Act is unchanged."
"The American Congress simply cannot lay down the law for our companies and if there are disputes then arbitration is in the hands of the WTO."
"The WTO exclusively."
"Mr President, I have two questions for Commissioner Brittan."
"Why did the Commissioner go it alone in the negotiations with the Americans on the Helms-Burton Act?"
"Only 20 % of this act deals with trade policy in the context of the WTO and that is the prime concern of the Commission and Parliament."
"But 80 % of it involves investments in Cuba by third countries and then in former American ownership."
"The latter, if we are dealing with investments, is the prime concern of the Council."
"It is therefore not surprising that the Commissioner going it alone causes irritation in this Parliament but also and especially in the Council."
"And the result was no new powers within the framework of Article 13 for the Parliament and the Commission in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"My second question concerns the multilateral agreement on investment that is currently being prepared by the OECD."
"The agreement will be signed in May, if it is good, by 29 countries and the Union."
"It will provide for a ban on investments in illegally expropriated property."
"The question is whether the American property expropriated in Cuba 36 years ago was illegally expropriated."
"Because there was no international law in that field and at that time the Americans categorically refused an offer for compensation."
"Can we reasonably speak of illegal expropriation?"
"I should like to know the opinion of the Commissioner on these two questions."
"Mr President, the last time Sir Leon was here it was also to speak about the Helms-Burton Act, and as my compatriot, Mr Salafranca, recalls, he said that if the United States did not keep their side of the agreement, by continuing to postpone Title 3 and by revoking Title 4, the Commission reserved the right to go back to the WTO panel."
"Although Title 3 may have been postponed for a further six months, it seems to us that not only has Title 4 not been revoked, but the United States Congress has made the Helms-Burton Act worse with eight amendments demanding strict compliance with it."
"In other words, the wishes of the United States Congress lead in completely the opposite direction to what Sir Leon told us."
"Furthermore, Sir Leon says that investments are not going to be prohibited, but inhibited."
"I wonder what the formula for this inhibition is."
"This is a concept which I have never heard mentioned in international law and I would like to know what it consists of, especially in view of the fact that until not long ago the European Union had been holding talks with the Cuban Government in order to reach an agreement on trade and cooperation since, as I should like to remind you, Cuba is the only country with which we do not have such an agreement."
"We think this is unfair."
"It seems to us that the discussions at the WTO are resulting in greater acceptance of the premises put forward by the United States, and do not safeguard the interests of the European Union - the sovereignty of the countries of the European Union."
"When they talk about regulating investments, they are of course thinking about Cuba - as you know as well as I do, Sir Leon - about Cuba and the investments which certain countries in the European Union are putting into Cuba."
"It seems to us that we are going down a dangerous path, and the European Commission should re-register its objection with the WTO."
"Mr President. Our debate today would be completely unnecessary in a fully-functioning democracy."
"The will of this Parliament would have been respected and the intention of the WTO panel on Helms-Burton would have been implemented."
"But in May this year, Mr Commissioner, you proceeded independently and we reprimanded you."
"We learned that you had had a private audience with Big Brother to calm things down."
"You made completely unacceptable concessions."
"That had nothing, absolutely nothing whatever, in common with staying loyal to principles."
"Two months later we were proved quite right."
"On 11 June the US Congress further increased the internationally much-criticized US embargo."
"We had voted for the exact opposite and for that very reason had demanded the panel you circumvented."
"Mr Commissioner, the citizens of Europe as a whole have become more than sceptical about the WTO."
"The World Trade Organization has run into a real crisis of legitimacy."
"What do we need such an organization for, if it only acts as a referee when the matter concerns opposition to social achievements, or opposition to conservation of the environment?"
"What do we need a WTO for, if those with power continue to machinate independently, as soon as they themselves come up for public scrutiny?"
"What do we need a WTO for, if it gets round its own rules in secret negotiations, and then even proposes to use the results of these as the basis for a multilateral investment agreement affecting us all?"
"We demand detailed information and the participation of everyone at the negotiations for an MIA, which has so far been at OECD level and will certainly later continue at WTO level."
"At least a significant number of developing nations must vote for it, in order for such an agreement to be made at all."
"I think the point made by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel is very relevant."
"To return to the matter of Cuba. The EU must not continue to knuckle under, but must sensibly fund the existing budget items, instead of deleting them."
"It must at long last introduce a treaty of cooperation with Cuba."
"The investment protection that the USA has set at such a high level is no current problem at all for Europe."
"I would point only to Cuba's investment protection agreements with such countries as France or Germany."
"Miami vice is really not our business!"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, relationships between the United States and Europe are studded with misunderstanding and divergences in approach, even in fields where the objectives sought are in reality identical."
"The case of the Helms-Burton legislation is a supreme example of this type of transatlantic misunderstanding."
"The Member States of the European Union and the United States of America wholly share the aim of democratization in Cuba, even if, within this Parliament, romanticism of Castro still seems - and this is strangely out of tune with the times - to be quite popular."
"But the European Union is seeking to promote democratic change in Cuba by a proliferation of human, economic and political exchanges and trade."
"The Americans, who are more sensitive to the pressure of those who have had to flee the Castro dictatorship, and are very close to the country concerned, believe that the only effective line of conduct is that of firmness and sanctions."
"The goal sought is the same, but the orientations are radically different. There are two approaches, each of which is as legitimate as the other."
"It nevertheless remains true that the use of legislation which has such extra-territorial repercussions is totally unacceptable."
"Now, the Commission's compromise is closer to an exercise in pure pragmatism, since the Commission has given up on getting results by sticking to principle."
"This is a poor figleaf for the total absence of concessions on the American side."
"We have hardly anything to be proud of, in my view, as regards the exemption which will be made in respect of companies belonging to the European Union, when we leave our partners in the third countries to face the power of America alone."
"Since there has been no success over the principle of the unacceptability of extra-territorial provisions, nothing now stands in the way of the perverse proliferation of such legislation at all political and administrative levels from the United States."
"This defeat on principle is, on the contrary, an encouragement to such proliferation and sends out a bad signal."
"It is already deplorable that towns or cities have made enactments whose consequences are extra-territorial, without Mr Clinton's government having the resources to oppose them."
"Proliferation is of all the more concern in that it very often advances the politically correct concern to fight for human rights or the protection of the environment, in order, in reality, to winkle out foreign firms and prevent their competition in tenders for American government contracts."
"This compromise, in the eyes of our group, is a poor one."
"It will not, I fear, prevent there being further discomfiture."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, It must feel strange to you, as a convinced supporter of free trade who has always demonstrated that fact, to find yourselves receiving criticism of the sort just expressed by Mr Wolf."
"I want to leap immediately to your defence, because it was not merely rhetorical overstatement, but above all did no service to the subject."
"The situation is as follows. Cuba is a democratic country, but the USA is trying, contrary to human rights, to penalize democratic countries such as those united in the European Union, because they are on the wrong road."
"We all considered it right to call in the WTO, not in order to make an example in the interests of the WTO's negotiating freedom and free international trade, but in order to enforce our legal rights."
"It was difficult to understand how the Commission could attempt - not in secret negotiation, as Mr Wolf supposes - to find a compromise or take a path whose success is more dubious."
"If it should not be successful, it will be difficult to start again on the path left for the compromise, that is, to complete a successful WTO panel procedure."
"The Americans negotiated differently in the banana dispute."
"They followed the matter through to the end, and it is still being discussed today."
"I mention that because here we have, something I quite understand, due respect for the internal policies of the USA."
"Anyone following the way in which Mr Helms is behaving in the matter of the nomination of ambassadors - bearing in mind that he is himself the one who drove through the Helms-Burton Act - will know how difficult it is for the President of the United States to force what he promised through Congress."
"Be that as it may, that is an internal matter for the USA."
"When we see that it was mainly the USA and Europe that established the WTO, and that the beneficiaries are those who replaced the GATT, and when we see the concern with which the third world reacts, lest it should suffer whenever the major powers frame agreements, then we should not really be surprised when, as in Singapore, Asian and other countries grow to suspect that the WTO is really only there to serve the rich, who could settle their disagreements in any case."
"For this reason I put this request to you on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party: If it appears that your efforts to reach a compromise are unsuccessful, return speedily to the path of virtue and pursue a legal case wherever one may be required."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I think Europe can be proud of its policy."
"We have been very successful."
"Our expansion into the east was successful and marked by mutual agreements and negotiations."
"The Americans have only sought confrontation with Cuba and have lagged far behind Europe."
"I think it is simply essential when talking to Helms and Burton, who have after all adopted a clear position and are not ready to negotiate, to make a case for our modern strategy. This involves the offer of alternatives, the practical search for a system that supports the democrats in Cuba, that supports the market economy in Cuba."
"If we employ a policy that offers alternatives, in order to support those forces in Cuba that also pursue our aims, and do not look for blind confrontation, then we Europeans shall be successful in Cuba as well."
"I have received six motions for resolutions under Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 noon."
"I would like to reply briefly to some of the points that have been made and put the matter in perspective."
"If I may say so, the views put forward by Mr Rübig and Mr Kittelmann are closer to reality than some that we have heard."
"Let us start from first principles."
"We share with the United States an objection to the non-democratic government in Cuba."
"We differ as to the way in which we should handle that and we object to the United States trying to impose on us its policy."
"We object so strongly that, uniquely, we have taken legislative action through this Parliament and through the Council of Ministers in order to impose blocking legislation."
"We object so strongly that we went to the WTO to assert our rights. not only with regard to Helms-Burton but also, although not in the WTO, with regard to the D'Amato legislation affecting Iran and Libya which is equally objectionable."
"We are and remain quite prepared to proceed with the WTO case."
"But a strong wish was expressed repeatedly in the Council of Ministers that we should try to find a negotiated settlement."
"And we have achieved a settlement of an interim kind which enables us to go back to the WTO if that settlement is not observed and if our objectives are not achieved."
"What are our objectives?"
"By definition a settlement means that you will not get a ringing declaration saying that we are right and the Americans are wrong in an international tribunal."
"But we and the Member States have rightly taken the view that what is important is to protect the interests of the European economy above all else and to ensure that no action taken by the United States could damage us."
"The consequence has been that the President of the United States has suspended Title 3, the most damaging title of this legislation, and that since the understanding there has been no action under Title 4."
"We then entered into a negotiation which, if successful would have the effect of permanently suspending Title 3, so that European industry and individuals were never threatened in that way, and of giving the President of the right to do the same with regard to Title 4."
"In addition, as a result of this negotiation we were given the prospect and the possibility of obtaining a waiver from the operation of the other objectionable legislation, namely the D'Amato legislation."
"And what has happened is that we are engaged in negotiations."
"There is nothing mysterious about it."
"The MIA negotiation is another matter which is broader than this and which we are also engaged in."
"It does not affect the developing countries."
"We hope to negotiate with them later in the WTO on a broader agreement."
"The 15 October target date is a serious one and we have told the Americans that."
"We are free participants in the negotiation."
"There is no obligation on us to agree to anything which is not in the interests of Europe and we will not do so."
"The negotiation is not concluded."
"The Americans also have their task to do what is needed to satisfy us in the negotiation."
"I believe that if we are successful in the negotiation, we will have protected the interests of the European Union in a very effective way and we will actually have used the WTO procedure, which is valuable."
"For only by bringing the case will we have led the United States to suspend Title 3, not to take further action under Title 4 and to do something with regard to the D'Amato legislation as well."
"If we do not succeed in our objectives we will have the full right to return to the WTO, to resume the case and to seek its resolution through the WTO."
"Therefore we have lost nothing, we have gained a lot, we have every possibility of gaining more."
"If we are unsuccessful we can resort once again to the international forum which we have helped to create and which we must defend in order to achieve our rights."
"That is the true position as it stands."
"The negotiations are complicated and incomplete but I can assure you that we will not come to a conclusion or agree to an agreement which does not protect fully and adequately the interests of the European Union as I have defined them."
"Commissioner, if I am here at 11.00 p.m. and ask you questions, I hope you will answer my questions and not only answer people who have the same view as you on this."
"I had two questions."
"You did not answer them."
"I thought I made it absolutely clear that we have not gone it alone, as you put it, with the Helms-Burton problem."
"We have repeatedly reported to the Council."
"I have explained the matter to committees of this House repeatedly."
"The interim understanding has received the support of the Member States."
"That is the answer to your first question."
"Nor is there the slightest reason to think that the reluctance of the Member States to change Article 113 has anything whatsoever to do with this issue."
"As to the question of what is illegal expropriation, that is an issue which has not been determined in the negotiations and therefore it is impossible to give an answer to it."
"But in my opening remarks I indicated the principles of international law which determined whether expropriation was illegal or otherwise, in relation to the question of compensation."
"Mr Commissioner, the question of who will decide what is an illegal expropriation is a very interesting one if it opens the possibility that a big country, by its legal system, decides effectively what is constitutional in other countries."
"For instance, in the Federal Republic of Germany, we have Clause 15 which allows for expropriation on a legal basis."
"But if the American Congress judges that this is inappropriate, would this then be illegal?"
"I can assure the honourable gentleman that we will not allow this matter to be determined by the United States Congress."
"To the extent that it is covered in the negotiations, we will have to be satisfied that there is an adequate definition which satisfies us, not the United States Congress."
"Obviously, in the negotiations, the United States administration will also have to be satisfied, but it is not something that is going to be unilaterally imposed on us."
"Mr President, this is not an attempt to reopen the debate but rather, as my colleague has said, to ask the Commissioner to be more precise, as far as he is able."
"He has told us that the negotiations are in a complex and delicate phase, and the question is as follows. The interim agreement was signed in April."
"April has now passed, as have May, June, July and August. It is now 15 September, and on 15 October the time limit set by the Clinton Administration and the Commission for reaching an agreement, expires."
"Does the Commissioner think that the problems currently under consideration will be resolved before October 15?"
"Secondly, does the Commissioner think that the mood in the United States Congress will allow the President to amend Title 4, in accordance with the Clinton Administration's promise, although it has not yet come into effect?"
"15 October is indeed the target date for the conclusion of the negotiation."
"In my experience of all negotiations it is very, very rare for there to be any conclusion except, at least, on the date which has been specified."
"At this stage, therefore, it is impossible to say whether we are going to have a successful conclusion."
"We are quite a long way from it but we have made some progress."
"To say any more would be to give a greater precision than the facts warrant."
"As to whether the mood in the Congress permits a solution which would enable the requisite amendment to the legislation to amend Title 4, I cannot answer that either."
"All I can say is that unless that amendment is passed, there is no deal with the European Union."
"I have great admiration for the diplomatic ability of Sir Leon and I am certainly not going to comment on what he said because I have to study carefully the significance of 'eventually' , ' inhibiting' and ''not preventing' and all these nuances."
"These really have to be studied carefully before I can judge what he said and what it means."
"I understand that while one is negotiating it is difficult to talk about it."
"Nevertheless, my question is: are we going to be informed of what is going on before there is an agreement?"
"We are worried about Helms-Burton and its effects on Cuba."
"This is one point on which concern has been expressed by my colleagues."
"We are also worried by the more general implications of the Multilateral Investment Agreement."
"How is the sovereignty of our countries going to be affected by an agreement which may give the right of property an interpretation which is very different from the one which is in the European tradition."
"This is a point I would love to understand."
"The answer to the question is very simple."
"Sovereignty does not arise."
"Every European country, quite apart from the European Union, is constantly entering into treaties."
"The entry into a treaty is not an abdication of a sovereignty but the exercise of sovereignty because no country that enters into a treaty is compelled to do so unless it thinks it is in its interest."
"In negotiating the multilateral investment agreement in the OECD, of which of course the members of the European Union are members, the Member States will not agree to an agreement unless they think it is in their interests and compatible with their approach to these matters."
"As everybody knows, but just to clarify it, the MIA negotiation is something that existed long before the Helms-Burton issue arose."
"It is seeking an agreement which covers many things and it would be in our interest to encourage investment."
"That is why we are doing it and why all the Member States of the European Union are very enthusiastic that such a thing should be completed."
"This issue rose at a late stage in negotiations and we are talking about a particular provision which will have to be agreed in the same way as any other provision."
"Of course, that is only part of the settlement of the Helms-Burton agreement as a whole and as far as that is concerned, I will follow all the normal constitutional and parliamentary practices in keeping the House informed."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Brittan."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I just wish to draw the attention of this House to the agenda for this week, particular the agenda for Friday, when the only item on the agenda is the Hallam report..."
"which is on the agri-monetary system for the single market, 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996."
"Between you and me, Madam President, this is hardly earth-shattering news."
"I am wondering whether it might be wise for Parliament, rather than to have a half-hour debate on a Friday - I am very flattered we are having this debate - to bring it forward and have it with the Hardstaff report on Thursday, delay the vote until the following Wednesday in Brussels, and thereby save the taxpayers of Europe thousands of pounds by not opening this building on Friday."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Hallam, you have raised a delicate point which has in fact been considered by the Conference of Presidents."
"You will be aware that, because of an exceptional chain of events, yours is in actual fact the only item on the agenda for Friday."
"Nevertheless, colleagues have made arrangements, changed their flights and so on."
"It seems to me - and this is my personal opinion, the Conference of Presidents may, of course, look at the question again - but I think it would be extremely strange to alter our agenda so abruptly by missing a morning's plenary session."
"I do not doubt for an instant that after the powerful plea you have just made, Mr Hallam, all our colleagues here will be intent on attending the presentation of your report, to which I strongly invite them."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"It concerns the Rules of this House. As chairman of Parliament's Delegation for relations with the United States, I had arranged a meeting this morning with President Santer in advance of our visit next week to Washington to discuss those issues that are pressing in relation to European-US affairs."
"We were told that because of the Rules of this House we could not meet on a Wednesday morning with the President of the Commission, we could only meet on Wednesday afternoon."
"I now find that the Conference of Presidents has called an extraordinary meeting this morning to meet President Santer to discuss the Commission's work programme."
"Madam President, you might find it an amusing issue, but let me tell you that there seems to be one set of rules for the chairmen of groups in this House and a different set of rules for the rest of this House."
"I would like the President to write to me, so that I can explain to the Delegation for relations with the United States why we were refused a meeting with Jacques Santer but you later this morning will be having a meeting with the President of the Commission."
"Mr Donnelly, your comments have not made this member of the Bureau either laugh nor smile."
"You are aware that I do not participate in the Conference of Presidents, but I see some group leaders here, and I will allow them to reply."
"Mrs Green has asked for the opportunity to reply to Mr Donnelly, I believe."
"Madam President, I do not wish to reply to Mr Donnelly: I want to confirm what he has said."
"In fact I spoke with the President at the Conference of Presidents last week and asked him to make a room available for the Delegation for relations with the United States, given the nature of the issues that we have to discuss between Europe and the United States."
"I was assured that that would happen, so I am somewhat dismayed if what Mr Donnelly has said is correct."
"We will clarify that point. We will see."
"In any case, Mr Donnelly, I will make sure that this sort of incident does not happen again, as far as it is within my capacity to do so, of course."
"I now hand over to Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, for a procedural motion. I repeat, a procedural motion."
"Madam President, I asked the Presidency in this House three months ago, how it was possible for the Dutch President-in-Office of the Council, when asked at the CITES Conference in Zimbabwe what the view of Parliament was, to reply that Parliament does not have a view, even though Parliament in an emergency debate three days earlier had expressed its views perfectly clearly."
"I was told by one of your colleagues - I do not now know just which President that was - that I would receive an answer."
"Up to now I have received no answer, and I am beginning to think, to be convinced, almost, that we go to a lot of trouble to pass resolutions here, but do not know if they ever reach the recipients."
"It appears that they have not."
"If that is so, we might as well scrap the whole of Thursday evening's debate and go home!"
"I would like an answer now!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, if I am to understand it correctly, you have been promised a reply which you have not received."
"We will look into this and make sure that an answer to your question is obtained as quickly as possible."
"Situation in Algeria"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and Commission on the situation in Algeria."
"Mr Wohlfart, President-in-Office of the Council, has the floor."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, by way of introduction I would like to thank the European Parliament for offering me this occasion to explain the Council's position with regard to the situation in Algeria."
"From the outset, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can assure you that the Council fully shares your apprehension about the situation in Algeria, which we are following closely."
"As we pointed out in a press release published last Friday, the European Union is deeply shocked by the wave of assassinations and other atrocities which are now bringing bloodshed to Algeria."
"The estimated figure of more than 60, 000 victims over the course of the last few years is an eloquent and tragic testimony to this."
"We are all deeply moved by the upsurge of violence in Algeria, culminating in these last few weeks."
"It is hardly necessary to remind you that hundreds of people have been brutally assassinated with axes and sabres, had their throats cut and worse."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, young girls have been kidnapped and raped, only to be murdered shortly afterwards."
"Newspapers, radio and the television report murder after murder, affecting not only isolated rural areas but also the capital."
"Only a few days ago, Algiers was the site of a mass murder."
"More than sixty people were killed at Sidi Yessef under particularly atrocious conditions."
"I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that like yourselves the Council clearly and firmly condemns these acts of terrorism and blind violence."
"As far as the political position of the Council is concerned, it is scarcely necessary to remind you, Madam President, that on many occasions the Council has re-affirmed its unconditional support for the process of political and economic reform being undertaken by the Algerian authorities."
"We have therefore expressed our satisfaction concerning the legislative elections held on 5 June, whilst noting the statement by joint international mission of observers regarding certain significant shortcomings."
"I already had occasion to refer to this last July, during Question Time."
"Nevertheless, we consider that these elections, which took place under what can be termed generally satisfactory conditions, marked a step forward in this process and enabled the Algerian people to participate directly in the building of a democratic and non-violent society in which human rights must be fully respected."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to human rights issues, international human rights organizations, and Parliament itself, have expressed criticism of the way in which Algeria is fighting the armed Islamic groups."
"The Council is well aware of this, and does not hesitate to insist that the Algerian government adopt a moderate attitude in the face of crisis and respect human rights."
"The Council emphasizes that, with a new association agreement in preparation, it is entitled to expect that a country going through such a crisis should settle its problems as far as possible with wisdom and moderation."
"As far as the association agreement is concerned, I am convinced that this new agreement will be able to contribute significantly to the process of democracy and economic reform in Algeria."
"Consequently, the Council hopes that the Commission will be able to bring the negotiations with the Algerian government to a rapid and satisfactory conclusion."
"With regard to the local elections, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight the fact that the Council is encouraging Algeria to follow the path of democratization and to respect the next date for the elections - as you know these are local elections - which is expected to be 23 October, following the presidential elections of 1995, the revision of the constitution in 1996 and the general elections in June of this year."
"In conclusion, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is following the internal situation in Algeria with concern."
"It is hardly necessary to emphasize that Algeria is an important partner of the European Union in the Barcelona process."
"Our vision of Algeria is necessarily part of a long term perspective."
"Algerians themselves must find a solution to this serious and deep crisis which their country is enduring, through the completion of the reform process, both on a political and on an economic level."
"It is in this spirit that the Union is determined to continue negotiations to conclude a new association agreement."
"Madam President, the Commission agrees and shares the opinion of the Presidency of the Council about what has happened in Algeria. Naturally, we believe the Council's statement on the Algerian situation of 12 September reflects fairly well what is happening in that country."
"As Mr Wohlfart said, the Union could not remain silent in the face of these acts of blind violence."
"There is no doubt that the Algerian people are suffering one of the most ferocious outbreaks of terrorism the world has ever known."
"We have discussed Algeria before, in July, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Political Affairs, and nobody can deny that Algeria is experiencing a serious political crisis."
"It is true that institutional normalization exercises have been carried out, subject to the imperfections and limits imposed by the situation, of course."
"The organization and development of the presidential and parliamentary elections are an example. They were perhaps not perfect, as we had the opportunity to discuss in July, but given the internal situation there can surely be no doubt that they are steps in the right direction, which the European Union must recognize."
"What we would like is for the internal situation to allow the municipal elections to take place as well, on 23 October, as planned."
"What can the Commission do?"
"We are in a very early phase of the association agreement."
"We have had a few sessions of negotiations, but it seems unlikely that these can be divorced from the current Algerian political situation."
"I still think, as I said in the July debate, that it would be a good thing if these negotiations allowed us to bring Algeria further into the Barcelona process, to enable us to form more bonds with that country through agreement with the European Union. I am not going to hide the fact that I still think this is a difficult thing to do, and that these negotiations are not going to be easy."
"However, I think it should be done because, regardless of current events, Algeria also needs an international response. If that response comes from the European Union, then so much the better!"
"Furthermore, human rights, democracy and freedom form part of the central axis of the type of political dialogue we are developing with the Mediterranean countries. Therefore, association agreement negotiations will allow us to open up another line of political dialogue with the Algerian authorities and tackle a situation which is frightening, of course, and extremely complicated as regards both internal and international politics."
"Initially, the Commission is working at the technical level and we are expecting the Algerian Government - the new Algerian Government - to tell us what type of negotiations they want to pursue."
"And, as I have already said, when Algeria gives us details, the European Commission will try to work in the normal way. We shall try to work normally, but in the knowledge that the situation is very difficult."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, what you have presented today is certainly a position we can very broadly support and accept from the outset, and which represents the situation in Algeria."
"I feel, however, that we as a Parliament must be even franker, to try to change the immensely difficult situation in Algeria today."
"Each attempted assassination and each terrorist attack is a blow, not only for Algeria, but also for Europe."
"For this reason we must make it clear to the Algerian Government that this is not a case of outside influence, or intervention, but of our concern for an area and matters of mutual interest."
"I think our proposals from Parliament should be understood in this sense."
"We in Parliament condemn the use of force just as unreservedly as do you in the Council and Commission."
"Force destroys not only people, but the soul of a people."
"Force must not be successful, not even, and most particularly not, in Algeria!"
"For that reason we emphatically support all measures aimed at limiting or preventing the use of force."
"At the same time, however, human rights must be maintained."
"We sometimes get the impression that human rights are being regarded as secondary."
"To some extent that is understandable in a difficult situation, but here limits are sometimes crossed, and we can in no way accept that."
"There are also doubts, let us be quite frank about it, in many media about whether force is being combatted everywhere with the utmost rigour."
"The government is accused of not proceeding with the required degree of decisiveness."
"We do not mean to cast any aspersions here, and that is why we have included nothing on that in the resolution."
"I must make a most heartfelt request to the Council and Commission, however, to find out if these rumours and accusations are indeed relevant, and how force can be more effectively withstood."
"People must not be tortured for hours, murdered in their villages, without intervention by the police, army or other security forces."
"I should like to draw particular attention to that point."
"In the context of what the Commissioner said about the association agreement and the Barcelona process, we emphatically demand that the dialogue in Algeria be continued."
"There have been repeated set-backs."
"People who declare themselves ready for dialogue, and who renounce the use of force, are still not met with the support and the positive reaction which both they and the situation deserve."
"It should also be noted that the dialogue should be carried out with those who renounce force."
"Just as in all crisis regions, however, like Ireland or other parts of the world, one must naturally take many steps to convince those who currently support the use of force that it is better to renounce it."
"A really effective dialogue can clearly be held only with those who say no to force."
"But we must persuade as many political, social and religious movements as possible to renounce the use of force."
"For that it is necessary to make contacts within, to give advice to, and above all to encourage the Algerian Government."
"I consider it unacceptable that the Algerian Government is being relatively hesitant and reserved."
"We want to go ahead with this dialogue, and that is why we seek this dialogue between the European Parliament and the newly-elected Algerian Government."
"That cannot be a unilateral offer, but must be a real dialogue that keeps the peace process and the maintenance of human rights in the forefront of the priorities."
"To return again to what Commissioner Marín said about negotiations."
"We, too, hope that negotiations on the association agreement include Algeria more closely into the whole Barcelona process."
"This is how I understand what you have said and should like to offer you my full support on behalf of my group."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Commissioner, everyone present realises the gravity of this debate and is happy that Parliament has finally decided to participate in a debate which should lead to the re-establishment of peace in Algeria."
"Firstly, you are right, Mr President, to place our actions within the framework of a much larger perspective."
"Algeria must know that we have not lost hope and that, at a time when alliances are being formed throughout the world, Europe cannot remain indifferent to the situation in the Maghreb and, in particular, in the youngest and most powerful country in that region."
"We therefore need to envisage, not bilateral relations between Algeria and any particular country - I am French so you all know to what I am referring - but between Europe and Algeria, a country endowed with such resources that it lacks nothing to whet the appetite, and I am referring to no-one in particular, not even a great ally."
"It is firstly necessary to re-establish civil peace. We must avoid two pitfalls."
"Firstly, to give way to despair in the face of the extreme violence used by the radicals on all sides and perhaps also by armed gangs during critical periods."
"We must also avoid - our colleague from the Party of European Socialists may question our strange passivity but this is still not the most important thing - making Algeria think we are going to interfere in her affairs."
"We must therefore express a hope and find a way of discussing the issue."
"The hope is clear."
"Algeria is gaining, little by little, democratic institutions."
"There is no such thing as perfection. And we cannot in any case launch into a frenzied attack on what has been done and what continues to be done."
"The political forces who believe in democracy, or who want to express that belief, must take their place within these institutions."
"Secondly, through the measures that have been taken concerning Mr Madan, we must encourage all gestures of the Algerian government which enable dialogue to be re-opened, and we must also encourage the political, moral and religious authorities of the country, those which still have the strength and power to express themselves, to call for a rejection of violence. Without this, Algeria will continue its journey towards the abyss."
"So, within this framework, what are the powers of Parliament?"
"Firstly, it is good to be able to say that we - Council, Commission and Parliament - all express the same views."
"We need to participate in the re-establishment of dialogue, firstly by expressing the hope that dialogue inside the country continues."
"Secondly by drawing to the attention of the Algerian authorities the fact that the association agreement will not be signed unless a clear indication is given to European, western, indeed world, public opinion, of a return to peace."
"And there, perhaps, we have a very narrow gate to get through."
"Our Parliament must enter into dialogue with the Algerian Parliament."
"We must say that we are open to discussion with any political force which renounces violence."
"Of course, the assassin, the radical, the extremist, who reject all prospect of - I was going to say peaceful - discussion, must be excluded from the debate, even if that offends them."
"But our Parliament, faced with a parliament in Algeria which was newly elected at the beginning of last year, must make contact."
"It is necessary - and I am addressing myself not only to the Bureau of Parliament, Madam President, but also to the presidents of the various groups - that Parliament works out, decides on the setting up of an extraordinary ad-hoc delegation which will go to Algiers prior to the Algerians visiting Strasbourg - I mean this Parliament and not the actual territory of a given state within the Union - in order to commence a dialogue with the political forces."
"The individual states will not be involved, the Council will not be involved, the Commission will not be involved."
"Parliament to parliament, there where democratic debate is born, there where public opinion is expressed through universal suffrage, there we can start, perhaps weakly, perhaps hesitantly, but at least certainly, to tread the path that will lead to peace."
"This is what Parliament's contribution could be."
"And if the Council and the Commission considered that our Parliament had accomplished something useful, all the better."
"Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party which has, on many occasions over recent months, requested a discussion on the serious crisis which is raging in Algeria."
"This has been refused until today."
"I thank the Council and the Commission for finally having answered this request."
"I am, however, very disappointed by the inconsistency of their statements in the face of such a tragedy."
"Their lack of responsibility leaves us flabbergasted."
"Respect for human rights is a prior condition for the maintenance of our agreements."
"What will the Commission and the Council do from now on when they are not respected?"
"The absence of a common foreign policy has once again resulted in the failure of our international policy and has highlighted the need for reform of our institutions in this area."
"More than six years after the vote which gave victory to the Islamic Salvation Front was ruled invalid, Algeria lives in fear of tomorrow."
"Barbarity has reached an unbearable level: 60, 000 people have been massacred and the Algerian Government confines itself to eradicating terrorism by answering violence with violence."
"The recent legislative elections and the constitution of a new government have not led to the long awaited dialogue between different sectors of Algerian society."
"On the contrary, the few signs of democratic goodwill on the part of the Algerian authorities have been wiped out by blind terrorism."
"What is worse, information has shown the powerlessness of the forces of law and order to foresee and prevent even massacres perpetrated near barracks."
"We think that only an initiative on the part of the Algerian authorities, aimed at bringing together all the life blood within civil society, including the Islamic movements, will enable an agreement on the rejection of violence to be reached, based on a respect for human rights and cultural minorities."
"The European Union must support the setting up of a true national dialogue likely, let us hope, to put an end to the terrorism which is hitting the Algerian people ever harder."
"It is not a question of interference, but of helping a people in danger."
"We cannot stand by and do nothing whilst assassinations are committed on a daily basis in a country with which we have deep historic, cultural and friendship links. It is our duty to act."
"Our joint resolution calls for the establishment of an ad-hoc parliamentary delegation which will be able to engage in a dialogue, both here and in Algiers, to help restore peace and strengthen cooperation between Algeria and the Union."
"We must not let this opportunity pass us by."
"We cannot allow ourselves to fail."
"Moreover, we will be able to help the Commission, which will have a predominant role to play in the democratization process to be established during the negotiations for a new Euromediterranean agreement with Algeria, with respect to human rights."
"I would not want to end without paying tribute to the courage and tenacity of Algerian journalists who, at the risk of their lives, continue to keep us informed and I would like to commiserate, in their terrible grief, with the families touched by a barbarity which has gone beyond all bounds."
"It is to be hoped that this friendly country will very quickly return to the path of peace and stability."
"Madam President, the Algerian people are suffering a new escalation of terror that is without precedent since 1992."
"Armed Islamic groups excel themselves in a horror which intimidates the population in order to create a situation of chaos in the country, destabilize the Algerian government and force it to capitulate."
"My group would similarly like to express its indignation at and vigorous condemnation of these barbarous acts."
"But it is necessary to go further and denounce without ambiguity the fanatical fundamentalists and their leaders who are the true authors of and inspiration behind this wave of terror."
"The recent remarks of Abassi Madani, the lately liberated former leader of the ISF, shine an alarming light on his responsibilities."
"The blackmail he tried to exert by agreeing to do his best to stop the massacres if the authorities submitted to his conditions proves his full and complete complicity with the terrorists."
"That is why our group, which refuses to give lessons to others, will not take part in any manoeuvre, wherever it may come from, which aims at including within the negotiations the fundamentalist forces responsible for, and complicit in, the massacres, for example by means of an international conference."
"We reject any interference in the affairs of the Algerian people."
"The Algerian people have within them, their history proves it, the necessary strength to overcome terrorism and to contribute to their social, democratic and cultural emancipation."
"Algerian women have a considerable role to play in this fight, with a courage which demands admiration and which should be praised."
"In our opinion, it is not in the search for compromise with the fundamentalist forces that Algeria will find its salvation and the path to democracy and social and economic progress."
"Europe can contribute by reaffirming its solidarity with the Algerian people, by encouraging a strengthening of cooperation between the European Union and Algeria in close contact with the lifeblood of the country, notably through debt reduction, assistance with modernization of infrastructure and building local authority housing."
"In order to express our support to all who fight, risking their lives against terrorism, my group similarly proposes that our Parliament send a delegation to Algeria to meet the members of parliament as well as all the forces who are courageously struggling in that country."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Algerian people are a martyred people in history."
"Angelism in the face of fundamentalism is synonymous with cowardice and abdication."
"Angelism in the face of eradication is synonymous with intellectual perversity."
"The situation is both complicated and very simple."
"When a country goes through such a crisis, it is very difficult for a government to follow good policies."
"But when the crisis reaches such a degree of violence, government reaction determines whether there is a possibility of finding a solution or not."
"If secret detention centres exist, if massacres are also perpetrated by government forces, it does not mean the government is no better than the terrorists, but it means that the government is accentuating the spiral of violence set off by the terrorists."
"Thus when we say 'no' to eradication, it is not the same as saying 'yes' to fundamentalism, but it is saying that a different solution to Algeria's problems must be found."
"That is my first point."
"Secondly, let us not deceive ourselves!"
"It is obvious that if we want dialogue, then this dialogue must go as far as possible. This dialogue must reach those who, at one point, thought they could gain their liberty through the gun."
"It is precisely those guns that need to be disarmed."
"It is therefore necessary to try to hold a dialogue with the worst of them."
"If you only dialogue with the good, you will always be good, but you will not accomplish anything."
"Talking to the bad guys does not mean you support them, or accept them, it means you want to persuade them that they have no future."
"So we will go to Algiers together, we will hold discussions with the human rights committee of the Algerian Parliament, with all the political forces of the Algerian Parliament, we will discuss with the lifeblood of Algeria, even with the perverse in Algeria so that the perverse stop being perverse."
"I am sure that hope will be reborn in Algeria when the Algerian population feels that there are people who do not want to interfere in Algeria to give them lessons."
"Since when have communists not wanted to give others lessons?"
"It is an intellectual abdication."
"As for me, I maintain that a lesson in dialogue must be given to those who do not want to dialogue, whether it be in Algeria, Afghanistan, Cambodia or anywhere else."
"And to do that the European Parliament must use every means to tell the Algerians: you are a part of our world, a world in which dialogue is the only solution to massacres and any other problems."
"Madam President, this morning the Council confirmed its support to the Algerian Government for the economic and political reforms it has undertaken."
"I consider the elections which took place on 5 June to be a step forward, and I regard the association agreement as a factor for progress."
"It may be so. But the Council, like the Commission, has not put forward any concrete proposal, any initiative to stem the horror, the slaughter and the violence, and it concludes by stating that the Algerians must find the solution to their problems on their own."
"Well, that is not the view of the Alleanza Nazionale, because we think their problem is also our problem, Europe's problem."
"The progressive and increasingly rapid descent into barbarism in Algeria has now made horror a daily event in that martyred country."
"Senseless violence, carried forward by the spiral of blind terrorism and subsequent repression, is feeding on the blood of an innocent population."
"If the responsibility for this state of affairs lies, in part, with the past dictatorship of the National Liberation Front, born of the tremendous anti-colonial struggle which preceded its rightful independence, it cannot be denied that today it is also our responsibility and our countries' responsibility to put an end to this martyrdom."
"For a young population like the Algerian population, which has known nothing but the poverty of five year plans, then to slide into the horror of a civil war sparked off by the fight for religious freedom, is a time bomb which threatens not only the Maghreb and the whole vast Arab world but constitutes a very serious threat to Europe which should not be undervalued."
"Restoring hope to Algeria must be a priority objective for the Union, which confirms the validity of a cultural and civil model based on a tolerant, democratic and lay state, open to freedom of association, thought and religion."
"So it is not facile rhetoric to affirm that the struggle of the Algerian population, hostage to violence, is our struggle."
"To isolate the extremism and establish a dialogue between the parties is certainly possible, and we Europeans have the means to get it accepted. But it requires a political will which already proved lacking, unfortunately, when it came to the war in former Yugoslavia."
"Failure to restore peace in Algeria would confirm the image of a faint-hearted Europe, turned in on itself, incapable of acting and hence of reacting, making it dangerously vulnerable to separatist ideologies, the symptoms of which are already being felt and could grow in strength."
"The Alleanza Nazionale is conscious of the external, but also internal, dangers of this situation, should it persist, and hopes the European Parliament will take the initiative to call a conference to bring the parties involved - the Union, the Maghreb countries, the CSCE - together."
"We ask that the European Parliament pledge the governments of the 15 countries to a determined battle against fundamentalism of any kind, and we ask that no concessions be made to those who have brutally exterminated women, old people and children."
"We maintain that the west also has a responsibility for letting violence take hold."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Madam President, if we are absolutely honest with ourselves, we do not actually know what to do about Algeria."
"All that we have heard so far confirms that."
"In fact this was clearly illustrated last February, in Parliament, when we failed miserably to agree on a resolution about Algeria."
"What we do know is that the violence is barbaric and unacceptable and should be condemned absolutely and without any conditions attached to that condemnation."
"We also know that the situation is not as simple as some speakers this morning seem to think it is."
"We have to ask ourselves questions such as why it is that some of these murders have taken place close to security positions; why it is that the military have not been able to protect their population."
"Not all these murders have taken place in obscure rural villages, some were in built-up areas."
"Why have these murders happened?"
"We also know that we increasingly seem to be seeing the development of death squads along the lines we are familiar with in South America."
"We know from the South American experience that once that happens you begin to completely lose control of a political situation."
"Because Algeria is so close to the European Union, we know that this dangerous instability could ultimately undermine the European Union."
"Therefore, we have to develop a strategy."
"It is essential that the common foreign and security policy starts to have some teeth and starts to take effective action."
"Clearly we have to start on political dialogue; clearly we have to develop inter-parliamentary dialogue."
"We have to try and use the association agreement, as Commissioner Marin has indicated, in order to develop that dialogue and allow access to Algeria by non-governmental organizations that can begin to assess the reality of the situation there."
"We should be encouraging that dialogue, in order to establish greater freedom of the press in Algeria so that we can all become aware of what is happening."
"Also, as Mr Dupuis has said, we need to encourage further economic reform."
"Ultimately it is only through improvements in the economic situation that we will begin to ensure a more peaceful development in future in Algeria."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in response to this tragic crisis, I utterly and firmly condemn the terrorist acts ravaging a country a few sea miles from the European Union, a country which aspires to associate itself with our Community and set up a free trade area with us. I would also like to express a few thoughts."
"First of all, I think there should be more emphasis on the possibility that the events in Algeria may cross the country's frontiers and spread to nearby Tunisia and Libya."
"Indeed, this is a factor of great concern which prompts me to ask for the European Union to pay the greatest possible attention to all three of these countries."
"My fear fundamentally arises from the fact that I consider the terrorism in Algeria to be the direct consequence of a socio-economic crisis rather than a cultural and religious one, which is why, given the similar economic situation in the other Maghreb countries, terrorism could also emerge dangerously elsewhere."
"Assessing the Algerian crisis as socio-economic in nature, I believe that the Euromediterranean policy undertaken in Barcelona is fundamental and that, therefore, the European Union must respond to the terrorist attacks with instruments of structural development and financial engineering rather than diplomatic ones."
"It is therefore necessary to implement the association agreement, as a first step. In fact encouragement is needed which runs the gamut of economic and social aid and not the isolation which Europe and the western world are now, in substance, decreeing."
"I also support the fact that at least the European Parliament is doing all it can to promote dialogue and respect for human rights, sometimes forgotten in all the drama and repression."
"I welcome with great satisfaction the idea that a delegation from this Parliament is going to make an urgent visit to Algeria to begin as constructive a dialogue as possible with the new Algerian Parliament."
"But I would mention that there is already a delegation on relations with the Maghreb countries, which carries out its duties with a sense of responsibility and which, if required, can be broadened for the occasion, so as to represent the whole of the European Parliament better."
"I hope this delegation can make contact with both majority and minority members of parliament and the social movements, and that it can lay the foundations for a new Euromediterranean dialogue in the spirit of that Europarliamentary forum repeatedly called for as necessary to the development of a dialogue which, in cases like these, can undoubtedly provide support and a clarion call to all the European democracies."
"Finally, it has to be said that the paralysis and, perhaps, the fear the European Union has for too long been victim to in the face of the spread of Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism, and this carries the risk of discrediting, if not swamping, every Euromediterranean initiative."
"But having said that, I believe we need to avoid too simplistic a comparison, which some people are making, between the procrastination and failure of the European Union - and it certainly occurred - in the tragic Yugoslav civil war and the response to the Algerian crisis."
"While equally tragic, they are obviously different situations."
"I have deliberately talked about civil war in the Yugoslav case and crisis in the Algerian case, just to emphasize that it is quite impossible to regard the Algerian events as a clash of ethnic groups or opposite sides in society."
"In short, we should not make the mistake of seeing the Algerian terrorists as combatants in a civil war, thus giving them international recognition and legitimacy."
"In saying that, I am not trying to justify the European Union, I simply believe it is essential to identify the appropriate means of correcting the serious delay that does exist as soon as possible."
"Madam President, as regards the escalation of raging barbarity which we are seeing in Algeria, it must be remembered that this is also a question of a struggle for political and economic power."
"Today we have raised the matter in this House, with wide agreement it would seem."
"I believe it is important for Europe - the European Union - to take up its responsibilities for the sake of its interests and obligations, and because of its solidarity with certain countries - particularly France."
"And the question we have to address is what we can do."
"The Council has told us that it is in favour of the association agreement - within the joint political viewpoint which we share."
"The Commission tells us that it is waiting for the Algerian Government to want to negotiate, if I have understood correctly."
"The problem is, what should we do in the meantime, besides showing our disapproval by voting, as we are going to do?"
"I think that as regards our negotiating partner (which basically is the Algerian Government) there are some things we can and should do."
"Firstly, as regards that reaction to interference, we should remind them that the Euro-Mediterranean Agreements do not involve the European Union alone."
"They involve many countries which also share the values of respect for human rights and democracy, and some of these countries are Islamic."
"Secondly, we should remind them of another important thing, which is that one of the responsibilities of a legitimately formed government is the maintenance of public order, starting with the protection of the right to live."
"This is something which is the responsibility of the Algerian Government."
"Furthermore, we are prepared to help to achieve this in a democratic fashion."
"Thirdly, Madam President, there is the question of dialogue."
"I believe that we need to talk and to support dialogue."
"First, with those democratic Algerian political forces, of which there is no shortage, which can also join in this process."
"Next, there is a pre-condition for dialogue with the terrorists - because people are still calling them men of violence - who are murdering the population on a massive scale."
"The pre-condition is that they should be isolated and made to disarm."
"It is not just a question of working miracles, but we have to know what our responsibilities are."
"Madam President, we have to ask ourselves the reason for this terrible violence which is staining Algeria with blood and killing civilians, soldiers, town- and country-dwellers and, above all, women and children, cruelly and with incomprehensible barbarity."
"During the last century that territory never experienced a state structure like those which were headed, for example, by the sultans of Morocco or the beys of Tunisia. Perhaps that made it easier for the French influence to take root."
"It became so great that France really and sincerely believed that it was another part of its own territory. Certainly, that was the reason why the struggle for Algerian liberation was subsequently so violent."
"It was led, as was natural, by an armed movement, which took power. It was a totalitarian power - not just total - which was military rather than civil and which, by the way, mistakenly operated economic policies similar to the Soviet five-year plans."
"This created huge structures of low productivity, squandered resources, probably destroyed the traditional sources of wealth to a large extent, bred corruption and, finally, deprived the Algerians of hope, especially the young. This in turn led many of them to turn to solutions which are supposedly based on religion but which are far removed from the true Islamic faith - solutions which border on magic and even false miracles."
"And let us admit that when electoral victory for the IFS seemed likely, we were too ready to accept the cancellation of the subsequent general elections, once again because of the French Government's attitude."
"We should recognize that now."
"The truth is that elections have taken place, despite these excesses of blood and suffering. Of course, we know that they were not perfect, but they were valid enough to allow us to enter into dialogue and, in fact, speaking from Parliament we have to talk about parliamentary dialogue."
"I do not believe that an ad hoc delegation is needed, and on this small point I differ from what was said by my friend, the chairman of the Committee on Human Rights, Mr Soulier."
"As Mr Viola has just mentioned, we have a delegation for relations with the Maghreb, which by the way has visited Morocco and Tunisia on several occasions, but not Algeria."
"Well, there is now an Algerian Parliament whose president, as I have been informed, wishes to receive such a visit, and I believe that our Parliament must send that delegation."
"Perhaps the ad hoc response will be to arrange for it to be sent now , rather than make Algeria wait its turn. Perhaps another ad hoc response could be to somehow increase the number of members in the delegation, in order to cover as much ground as possible."
"Also, of course, to talk with all the political forces represented in that parliament, and perhaps also to make contact with other political forces able to switch soon enough from an attitude of violence to one of moderation and peace - for that violent attitude not to be thought of as irreversible."
"Madam President, we Europeans have a long and violent history which has often been stained with blood."
"Well, we have now arrived at an era when we can give a modest example of dialogue to others who are currently in a violent phase."
"Of course, we should encourage the Council and the Commission in their decisions on the cooperation agreements, as we are indeed doing, but above all we should set an example with an initiative of our own - we ourselves should initiate that dialogue."
"Mr President, over the last few weeks I personally have been particularly shocked by the resignation with which the international community has reacted to the horror in Algeria and I am therefore pleased with the tone that has been set for the most part in this debate and also with the proposal to send a delegation from this Parliament."
"I am nevertheless convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that any steps taken by this Parliament will only be meaningful if we remain objective and if we are not selectively outraged."
"It is of course clear to everyone that this is fundamentalist terror at work which wants to force its ideology on people by violent means, and I actually believe that we must not only show respect for the women who are organizing but also support them from here."
"But there is also something else and fortunately it has already been mentioned a few times in the debate today."
"More and more journalists and human rights organizations attest to the fact that violence also occurs by armed gangs associated with the army."
"And may we not ask any questions about the impunity with which murders are carried out?"
"May we not ask any questions about the army's impotence to protect the civilian population?"
"May we not ask any questions about the fact that the Algerian authorities react by restricting press freedom, human rights and the rule of law?"
"It is important that the parliamentary delegation also discusses these problems with their colleagues in the Algerian Parliament."
"Finally, colleagues, I should like to point out our own responsibility in this debate."
"Algerian refugees are still being sent back to their country without guarantees for their safety."
"The UN Commissioner for Refugees has already made several dramatic appeals to a number of Member States still applying these practices."
"He asks that for the time being these states suspend the sending back of these refugees until the situation in Algeria changes."
"I am convinced that this can only succeed if all Member States together take this decision and I invite the Council to come up with a proposal in this regard."
"I hope Parliament will also be able to support this."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Algerian people have had enough of violence and as Mrs André Léonard has already said: neutrality in these circumstances would amount to refusing assistance to a people in need."
"Madam President, in the face of the tragic events taking place in Algeria, the temptation is great for friends of Algeria to remain silent."
"To remain silent because words cannot express our feelings of sadness, horror and indignation at the escalation of barbarity which people are suffering in that unhappy country."
"To remain silent, too, since it is evident that the fanatics will not hesitate to massacre the populations of entire villages and are completely insensitive to all calls to reason."
"To remain silent because the Algerian leaders seem to consider any word spoken about Algeria, any interest taken, the slightest interest regarding the Algerian population, as a scandalous attack on national sovereignty, as an unacceptable interference in the domestic affairs of the country."
"And yet now, more than ever, is the time to cry out, and especially we Members of European Parliament."
"Cry out because in the eyes of many throughout the world, this House is considered the voice and conscience of the European people."
"If we remain silent in the face of such events, when else will we have the right to make our voices heard?"
"Cry out so that those in Algeria who risk their lives daily, fighting and suffering for democracy and human dignity can hear us express our solidarity with them in their fight, their ordeal and also their hope."
"Cry out, too, to awaken the international conscience which, apart from occasional bursts, often seems scandalously quiet with regard to Algeria."
"Cry out to show that we are neither impressed nor intimidated by the Algerian Government's shameless blackmail about interference."
"One sometimes has the feeling that the savage brutality of the Islamists serves as an excuse for the government to restrict the liberty and rights of the people."
"Let us never forget that the legitimacy of the president, a legitimacy which comes from the elections, does not authorize any behaviour he chooses."
"Let us never forget that the legitimacy of power wears out very quickly when you permanently betray the principles on which that power is based."
"In any case, when a government shows itself incapable of defending its citizens, or preventing massacres from being committed, day after day, like those to which the Algerian people are victim, it is the duty of the international community to exercise the right of assistance to a people in mortal danger."
"But since the European Union has entered into economic negotiations with Algeria, let us not hesitate - of course at the same time condemning vigorously the dreadful crimes committed by the fundamentalists - to put pressure on the Algerian Government so that, whilst fighting terrorism, it does not support or organize criminal behaviour or serious attacks on human rights; so that they allow NGOs, in particular Amnesty International, to carry out their specialist investigations, as they do in many countries around the world, with particular emphasis on the prisons; so that the international media may freely accomplish its mission, and finally so that the Algerian government may search constantly and with courage for dialogue with all the forces in the country who are ready to renounce violence, including the perverse and the wicked, in order that this country may return to peace and Algeria may once again take her rightful place in the Euromediterranean group, where we await her impatiently."
"Madam President, over and above other considerations it is good for Algeria and the Algerian people to be able to see that there is an enormous feeling of support and a wish for mutual progress here in the European Parliament."
"The most important challenge is one which we both have in common, and we can do a great deal towards meeting this common challenge."
"It is the challenge of working towards a decisive link between Algeria and the European Union."
"We propose stepping up political and parliamentary dialogue, opening a dialogue between the European Parliament and the Algerian National Assembly within the framework of the partenariat."
"We support the determination to set Algeria on the road to progress, to consolidate it as a democratic state and to promote human rights."
"We condemn unreservedly the brutal scourge of terrorism which the Algerian people are suffering, and support the people and the country of Algeria."
"Madam President, as this debate comes to a close I do not want to end by repeating what has already been said, so eloquently, by previous speakers on the subject of the horror we feel at the Algerian tragedy, and our admiration for those fighting for peace and liberty."
"I am thinking particularly of the women, doubly targeted and doubly courageous!"
"On the other hand I would like to counteract the idea, which is all too widespread, that there is nothing immediate or concrete that we can do to relieve the Algerians' ordeal."
"In fact, there is a concrete gesture that the European Union can immediately make since it depends only on her, and it consists of offering protection worthy of the name to Algerians, male and female, who have chosen to flee the hell in their country."
"You will say that it falls to the Geneva Convention to play this role."
"Paradoxically, it seems that Algerians cannot benefit from this Convention - Mrs van Lancker alluded to this just now."
"The law of the Member States notes that protection under the Convention can only be offered to those persecuted by state authorities."
"This understanding of the law was confirmed as recently as 1996, by the common position of the Council on this matter."
"It is a paradox because the Islamists, rightly considering that they are persecuted by their government, can claim protection in the European Union whilst their victims, those fighting for liberty whom I have just mentioned, cannot."
"Nevertheless, this interpretation, which is contrary to that of the UNHCR and contrary to the spirit and the letter of the Convention, is now established in Europe."
"That is why I am arguing for the establishment of a form of subsidiary protection which would be half way between the convention's status and temporary protection, currently under study."
"It is not a far-fetched idea since it has figured for many years in the Council's programme and I am delighted that France - my country - is currently considering it, but I think that such an arrangement will not make complete sense or be completely effective unless it takes place at European Union level."
"Whilst waiting for this, Madam President, I hope that the European Union will have a more open attitude towards the position of Algerians seeking protection in France, protection which today's debate has demonstrated is completely legitimate."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank all those who have spoken in this debate, an animated and passionate but dignified debate, which has well reflected the horror, the challenges and the dangers of the current situation in Algeria."
"I would also like to thank the speakers for the quality of their contributions, even if some have been disappointed by the Council's statement on the role the European Union should play in Algeria."
"I believe the unanimous watchword in this House has been that we cannot be indifferent to Algeria, that Algeria - and I would go further and say the whole of the Maghreb - needs the European Union."
"But, on the other hand, the European Union needs an Algeria and a Maghreb that is peaceful and politically stable."
"I pay tribute to the initiative taken by Parliament, to face up to its responsibilities."
"The Council has its role to play, the Commission has its role to play - in particular concerning the future association agreement within the framework of the Barcelona process - and the European Parliament (this is a purely personal opinion) also has its role to play."
"We have talked about constructive dialogue. I would add 'watchful dialogue' on everything involved in this sensitive area of protection of human rights."
"Certainly, nearly everyone is in agreement that the circle of participants in the dialogue in Algeria must be as large as possible, but this is a long drawn process and it has to be said that, unfortunately, in Algeria as in other crises, there are people who do not want to talk."
"Our common effort will therefore take a long time."
"Algeria is worth supporting because, by and large, the people want peace. This has been stated by one of the speakers and was proved by the people themselves at the last elections and the ones before that."
"Before handing over to Vice-President Marín to present his conclusions in his capacity as representative of the Commission, I would like to conclude by saying that our role is to accompany and encourage the different institutions to assume their proper role in this long process of peace, but that all the lifeblood of Algeria and all willing Algerians are called on to resolve this problem."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I support what Mr Wohlfart has said on behalf of the Council, and I should simply like to add that if the European Parliament would like to set in motion a mechanism for political dialogue at the parliamentary level, the Commission would put itself at your disposal, because just at the moment, anything which can help to open new channels of dialogue with the representatives of the Algerian people is interesting."
"When it comes down to it, the association agreement negotiations have a precise mandate, and their methodology and language are also precise. Regardless of whether the discussions are of politics or not, the overall framework and the negotiating brief do not allow political dialogue with the Algerian authorities to be entered into."
"In other words, circumstances dictate that the Commission's discussions are limited in an objective manner by the nature of the negotiating brief."
"In contrast, I think that the European Parliament could perhaps represent a far more open route for opinions to be expressed - much more open, and also wider, more global in a certain sense, and much less restricted than diplomatic language. If this Parliament decides to act in this way, then I support what Mr Wohlfart has said; we would set up all the mechanisms to encourage progress in this political operation."
"Thank you, Commissioner Marín."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 noon."
"Situation in the Middle East"
"The next item on the agenda is the statements by the Council and Commission on the situation in the Middle East."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad we are also able to tackle the issue of peace in the Middle East this morning, which is a very important issue."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you that the Council's position regarding the current situation is based on two elements."
"Firstly, co-operation on the issue of security and secondly, negotiations, all under the umbrella of 'land for peace' ."
"The Palestinian authorities must do all they can to prevent acts of terrorism."
"The Council speaks regularly, notably through its special envoy, to the Palestinian authorities to encourage total cooperation with Israel on the issue of security."
"We have suggested to both parties that a permanent security committee should be set up which we consider could prevent the extremists from taking the peace process hostage."
"We must at all costs avoid the stalling of negotiations after every incident, however tragic, however abject and reprehensible it may be."
"Negotiations leading to acceptable results for both sides and to a real improvement in the economic position of the Palestinians is the only way possible to create, little by little, the climate of confidence that is essential for the re-establishment of a situation where a maximum of security can be guaranteed."
"Mr President, on the subject of honouring the Oslo agreements, the President-in-Office of the Council seized the occasion of the recent visit of the American Secretary of State, Mrs Madeleine Albright, to the region, to reiterate the position of the Council regarding the honouring of agreements reached and to ask Israel to honour her obligations and commitments."
"Real and credible confidence building measures, such as the unblocking of projects essential for the viability of the Palestinian economy, are more than ever necessary."
"Both sides must adopt a code of conduct."
"Any revival in the negotiations regarding the final statute must be accompanied by the parallel and complex drafting of an interim agreement."
"We particularly want to see the next phase of redeployment taking place as agreed."
"Both parties must avoid unilateral acts, which could prejudice the final statute, which implies that Israel must suspend all new expansion of colonies."
"Regarding the Palestinian economy, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, its situation is, to say the least, precarious and since the recent attacks in Jerusalem, the Israeli government has continued to enforce strict measures over the population of the Palestinian territories."
"In addition to the cordoning off of the territories, Israel continues, in particular, to freeze the tax receipts due to the Palestinian authorities, even though as recently as Monday they announced they were going to free up half the amount due to the Palestinian authorities, that is 50 % of the amount, which equals some 50 million shekels."
"The Council has, on many occasions, repeated that it respects the legitimacy of the Israeli government to defend its population."
"However, the measures taken by the Israelis are, to our mind, excessive and do not affect those who are truly responsible for the attacks."
"We have insistently requested that Israel respect her obligations by handing over the full sum of tax revenue to the Palestinian authorities."
"In order to help the latter face up to its immediate needs, we are going to send, as a matter of urgency, ECU 4 million and, in the same context, we are going to look into the possibility of creating a medium term revolving fund for the Palestinian authorities."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to say a word about corruption within the Palestinian authority itself."
"The Council is particularly worried by the apparently quite widespread unhealthy practices within the Palestinian authority and with regard to this we have urged President Arafat on many occasions to make a serious effort to put this situation right."
"Having said this, the fact that critical reports have been published by the Palestinian authorities themselves shows a willingness on their part to be transparent and I can assure you that the Council will follow this very closely, along with the other main donors."
"I would also like to add a word on relations between the European Union and Jordan, a country which plays a major role in the process I have just mentioned, a country with whom it was possible to announce, during the General Affairs Council last Monday, that the negotiations led by the Commission had finally ended in a Euromediterranean association agreement, the final two obstacles being removed at the last minute."
"It is a result with which I am extremely pleased."
"I will finish by mentioning Syria."
"I think everyone is aware that Syria has an important role to play in the peace process and the meetings our special envoy has had with President Assad have confirmed previous impressions."
"In fact, Syria would be seriously interested in re-opening negotiations with Israel."
"Of course, Mr President, the most difficult part is yet to come, that is, defining a basis on which discussions can be re-opened."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would be difficult for the Commission not to go along with what Mr Wohlfart has said on behalf of the Council."
"His description is correct and the Commission agrees completely."
"There is no doubt, especially since the Israeli Government's decision to build a new settlement in East Jerusalem, that we have entered a vicious circle which has placed the Middle-East peace process in a frankly delicate situation."
"You are all familiar with the United States' initiative and Mrs Madeleine Albright's visit."
"It seems that a meeting between Palestinians and Israelis, not involving the United Nations, is planned for next week."
"We shall see whether a United-States package can finally achieve significant progress in a situation which has deteriorated at internal, regional and international levels."
"Lastly, I am not going to try to hide from you the Commission's primary cause for concern, which is that it will be our responsibility to manage the financial package which was approved by the Council and supported by the European Parliament."
"I am afraid that, as a budgetary authority, we will have to take that responsibility in the future, because of the Council's decision."
"The Palestinian economy has been placed in an absolutely impossible position because of numerous factors. These include border closures, restriction of movement, cases of corruption and lack of transparency in the management of the Palestinian budget, and financial sanctions - such as not handing over taxes, and so on."
"What has been created by the European Union and particularly the Commission - which has had responsibility in the Palestinian case - has been a system of social security, financed by the international community, rather than a model of economic development."
"The events of last year mean that this economic model is not now viable, unless a peace plan can be resurrected quickly. This also needs to allow the Palestinians the opportunity for economic development in the medium and long term."
"The peace process will not be able to rely for ever on large-scale financial efforts by the international community, and particularly the European Union, as it has done for the last four years. As you know, the European Union contributes the most financially - much more than the United States, the so-called moderate Arab states, the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund."
"And because of our extensive experience the Council, at the Commission's suggestion, has again decided to grant urgent financial aid in an attempt to salvage the political momentum. Once again we are going to salvage the political momentum so that the Palestinian Presidency can pay for the government, the police, the hospitals and the local authorities."
"It has become traditional for the European Union to perform this operation."
"Finally, the Council authorized the Commission to make a rapid transfer of approximately ECU 4 million and to present a new financial engineering system by means of a cash fund. We want to consolidate this, to help the Palestinian Government in their struggle against the problems of border closure or the failure to receive their share of the taxes collected by the Israelis, which stem from the Oslo agreements."
"When the time comes to calculate the new distribution, we will have to find an adjustment to set this new political decision in motion. This will allow us to grant a special aid programme for the peace process in Palestine from November, depending on how well the money problems of the Palestinian Government may have been resolved."
"We should think about this, because the current aid programme expires next year."
"This is not the moment of the Oslo agreements, or the elation in Washington or Casablanca - this is not a moment for elation."
"But the Community and its Member States have agreed to a financial effort, which by the end of the process will probably amount to about ECU 2, 000 million."
"We have rescued some very difficult situations by injecting financial resources, but we are stretched to the limit."
"The reason is that up to two million Palestinians living in the territories are in a desperate situation because the Palestinian economy is based essentially on international donations and because of regular border closures, restricted circulation in the territories, and being unable to export to the European common market as a result of infrastructural problems and systematic obstruction by the Israeli authorities."
"So one of the things the Commission must do is regularly approach the Council and the European Parliament with a whole series of important questions. As Mr Wohlfart has said, this is a long-term matter, and next year we will have to define what we are going to do."
"The special budget runs out next year. I mention this because last week we were very distressed because the Council asked us to provide finance to help Palestine and the Arafat Government, and we could not do so because we have no money left."
"So we will have to find a solution in November, using the Notenboom procedure. And from 1999, we will have to think very carefully how to spend the same amount of money as we have spent in the last five years, or more."
"We certainly do not want to perpetuate political difficulties or obstacles. Instead, we want to provide a regional solution for the Middle East and, most importantly, a viable and sustained economy for the Palestinian people."
"Otherwise, I doubt whether the international community can sustain this enormous financial effort which, despite all attempts, has not been able to prevent the Palestinians becoming even poorer this year, and having fewer investments than four years ago."
"A population living in a desperate situation, where there is not only no peace but also increasing poverty, where the level of private investment has plummeted, especially in the last year, and there are no investors from Europe, the United States, or the ""moderate' Arab states, is, as you will appreciate, a situation which does not favour restraint."
"And I want to assure you that we will come to Parliament again, and I hope we will have your sympathy and support in finding a solution in November, when we discuss the problem of the reassignment of resources."
"On behalf of my parliamentary group I should like to thank the representatives of the Council and the Commission most sincerely for their clear, frank words. We shall certainly support you, Commissioner Marín, in your efforts to find money, which will be, and will have to be, used efficiently."
"We are confronted here once more with a spiralling use of force which is difficult to break."
"Thus we regret all the more emphatically that the Israeli Government has undertaken measures that increase yet again the conditions for force."
"As Mr Marín has just said, the reply to the use of force that the Israeli Government has just given will naturally lead via more misery and greater problems for the Palestinian population to further escalation in the use of force."
"This is not to say that such escalation can in any way be justified, supported or condoned, but it must be quite clear what responsibility the Israeli Government also bears for the overall development of the situation."
"It is of course the settlements policy, above all, that was the starting point for the new spiral in the use of force."
"We reject a settlements policy, which seeks to create a fait accompli before talks have even started and negotiations begin."
"The present Israeli Government finds itself in a situation where it can no longer control the forces it has conjured up, because there now exist new activities that involve too great an intrusion, even for this Government, into the Palestinian area."
"In this context, however, the question of land will have to be negotiated."
"It is totally unacceptable that people who sell land, from Palestinians to Israelis, should be ""punished' by death in a legal or illegal manner."
"Yet it is obviously the right of any community and any country, particularly in such a difficult phase, to take steps to ensure that the peace process is not impeded again by arbitrary land sales. I believe that here, too, one must find a solution by dialogue with the Israelis and the Palestinians."
"As has already been said, the Israeli Government 's reaction to the use of a force that they had to resist was appropriate, but it was inappropriately intensive and it has created new conditions for force."
"The financial restrictions, the restrictions on freedom of movement, lead a people to the point where even those who previously rejected the use of force now support it as the only way out of this situation."
"I consider that to be catastrophic, and I hope that the measures announced by the Council and Commission, and also those presented today by Commissioner Marín, which I hope Parliament will approve, will at least cover the financial aspects."
"The fact remains, though, that freedom of movement is being massively restricted here, and also that the only peace partner there is, Arafat and the PLO, is being divorced from the support of its own population."
"I believe that this last point is very important, and I am delighted at the statement by the President of the Council."
"We want an independent Palestinian State."
"I think that is the only chance, and more and more groups in Israel are saying that themselves."
"It has to be, however, a democratic state and one free from corruption."
"I emphatically request that efforts be made so that we, as friends of the Palestinian people, may be assured that the new state to be established is a democratic one, and one that respects human rights."
"I also request the Council and the Commission to ensure that the measure announced against corruption is also enforced, as no one in the European population will be prepared to spend a lot of money if there is the slightest suspicion that it will not arrive where it belongs, namely, with the people of Palestine."
"Mr President, first of all I would also like to warmly congratulate both the Presidentin-Office of the Council for his very important words and also the honourable Member of the Commission, Mr Marín, for his very detailed analysis."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that this is yet another critical moment for the Middle East."
"It is not for this Parliament to make a list of charges and to restrict ourselves to a discussion of what is at fault."
"The European Union must now deal with specific measures and recommendations to restore the peace process."
"These would include the following four general measures and preconditions. First, actions to end terrorist activities."
"This is a necessary precondition since, in addition to its many human victims, terrorism gives rise to strong feelings of insecurity in Israel, creating problems in the development of Israel and in its participation in the peace process."
"This is a very difficult undertaking and there are two aspects to it."
"The first aspect is repressive: finding and capturing the terrorists."
"The second is long term: eradication of the origins of terrorism."
"Secondly, actions to end all those terrorist acts and the decisions that they provoke."
"As an example I will refer to the subject of the settlements."
"This is something that must end, as must other, related, activities."
"Thirdly, actions to implement the Oslo agreements in full, since, because of their international nature, these agreements are the basis of any peace process in the Middle East."
"And fourthly, actions to ensure the success of the proposed new New York process - a process that will proceed in two phases: a bipartite phase, namely Palestine and Israel, and a tripartite phase, namely Palestine, Israel and the United States."
"Here we must bear in mind that this new New York process should not be a process which has to produce an immediate result within 48 hours."
"Of course this will not happen."
"But it should be a conference at which two things will be determined: first, the agenda for future negotiations, and secondly, and most importantly, the process to enable those negotiations to take place."
"In addition there are other, more specific, proposals."
"I congratulate the Council on the two proposals it has already made public, that is, the creation of a standing committee on security and the recommendation for a code of conduct."
"These are two extremely important issues."
"But I would like to propose the following: first, a re-examination of the European presence in the Middle East."
"And secondly, in place of a special envoy, I propose that the Council, the Commission and, dare I say it, the European Parliament, should create a task force which is linked with the standing committee on security."
"It would be helpful if the Middle East peace process could come under the heading of the Barcelona process and if it could become a permanent, on-going conference, within the Barcelona process for the Middle East peace process, which would be based on the creation of working groups."
"And I would like to propose four such working groups: a group on security, which would deal, among other things, with the issue of terrorism and the relations with and actions towards other countries, such as the Lebanon and Syria, which play a role in the peace process."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I personally believe that we must devote a lot of time to these negotiations and processes."
"We do not need spectacular results for television at this time."
"We need results with substance."
"Mr President, the Middle East is an area where colonial powers have created the background to the present situation by means of divide and rule tactics, for their own advantage."
"The situation appears to be far removed from any logic and full of paradoxes."
"I shall just remind you of some of them."
"The Arab world has again dug up the weapon of the economic boycott."
"It is true that economic relations with Israel have not been broken off, but they have been put on the back burner."
"People who trade with each other should also speak to each other."
"There were suicide squads when the peace process was going well, as well as now when it is blocked."
"The Israeli government makes agreements about Hebron, which is a positive sign, but at the same time begins to build houses in Jerusalem, which is a negative sign, to reassure their political supporters."
"The closing of the borders increases the security of the Israeli citizen, but reduces it at the same time."
"Islamic leaders in the mosques of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Iran continue to praise the Palestinian suicide squads literally as religious martyrs."
"I will spare you the actual texts, but personally I am horrified by them."
"This all means that the Israelis do not make a logical connection between the peace process and their own personal security."
"And unfortunately the element of doing away with terrorism threatens to be an important negotiating instrument."
"That can obviously not be the case."
"The confidence of Palestinians and Israelis in their own leaders has decreased."
"The European proposal to get the process going again by means of a code of conduct will not work, in my view."
"Only the emotional consciousness of the inevitability of the existence of Palestinians and Israelis as peoples in this area of the world can stimulate the process again."
"That is now exactly what the American Secretary of State is trying to encourage by letting the parties for the moment stew in their own juice, because in the end they will have to get along with each other."
"But at the same time Mrs Albright has talked over the heads of the Palestinians and Israelis and over the borders of Israel to the surrounding areas."
"I cannot quite understand Mr Dimitrakopoulos' idea about a task force, but with regard to the area surrounding Israel there can certainly be a role for Europe."
"It is important that the association agreements with Jordan and Egypt get off the ground as quickly as possible."
"I agree with Commissioner Marín that this Parliament must do everything it can to guarantee financing for the Palestinians and the long term economy."
"Because without taking into account the rational economic and social development of Israel's neighbours, the jealousy and fear of Israel, a hard-working democracy, will remain."
"Finally, Mr President, I consider it an important task for this Parliament to guarantee that it will stimulate the reconciliation process in Israel from the Meda funds."
"Mr President, this is a cry for help and not a study because we can call on Mr Wohlfart and Commissioner Marín for studies, for which I thank them most sincerely."
"The peace process has got into an extremely bad state."
"Everyone knows that."
"It seems to be as good as dead and if new impetus is not given quickly, it will die."
"Even the attempts at mediation by the American Secretary of State did not manage to break the deadlock."
"In a spiral of bomb attacks by Hamas and retaliatory measures, the peace process seems dead and gone, and has only produced losers."
"The terrorism by Hamas must be fought in every way possible and Arafat must be made to keep his promises."
"But by the long term closing off of the Palestinian areas and the freezing of 60 % of the national income of the Palestinian authorities, the Israeli government is creating its own enemies in an atmosphere of frustration, poverty and hopelessness."
"The political leaders have lost the initiative owing to a lack of political guts and extremists on both sides, with escalating outrageous acts, have created a climate of mistrust and hatred that is probably stronger than two years ago."
"If the momentum sinks further, there is the risk that the parties involved in the Middle East will lose their way even further in their own sandstorm and be blinded."
"Where are the visionary politicians who set the peace process going?"
"A new breakthrough in the deadlock is needed now."
"That is easy to say, but difficult to achieve."
"On the basis of the Oslo agreements we must seek a definitive solution to the disputes and in this approach there is no room for taboos and certainly no eye for an eye or tooth for a tooth approach as between Israel and the Palestinians and between Israel and Lebanon."
"We are living in a modern age with modern slogans and hopefully with a modern peace."
"Mr President, last Saturday, the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Oslo agreements in Washington, should have been a day of rejoicing, both for Israel and for Palestine."
"It was, in fact, a day of anguish for the peace process which is now only held together by a thread."
"It was also, and I am delighted, a great day of struggle."
"The united gathering in Tel Aviv against the policies of the Netanyahu government and for the defence of the people is a sign of hope that we must hail."
"More than ever the line of demarcation separates not Palestinians from Israelis, but those in favour of the peace process from those against."
"The reaction, impressive in its dignity, of the mother of little Smadar, one of the victims of the latest attack on Israel for which Hamas claim responsibility, a criminal act that we have strongly condemned, is significant. To Benjamin Netanyahu, who was accusing Yasser Arafat when those who plant the bombs are his worst enemies, she retorted, ""It is your policy that killed her' ."
"This policy, which the French Minister for Foreign Affairs was right to qualify as catastrophic, will lead straight to an explosion of violence and to war, if nothing is done to counteract it in time."
"If the colonization of the West Bank and Jerusalem continues, if the autonomous territories remain closed off and isolated from each other, if the port of Gaza remains blockaded, if the airport is closed, if thousands of political prisoners who are still in detention are not released, if the withdrawal of troops that was explicit in the agreements is not carried out, even if Tsahal dares to venture once more into the autonomous territories, and the worst is possible, efforts made up until now to try to guarantee the security, peace and mutual development of all the people of the region will at once be ruined."
"So what can Europe do other than provide aid - emergency aid and development aid - more than ever needed by the Palestinian authority?"
"The problem raised by Mr Marín regarding this is absolutely crucial."
"But beyond that, what can Europe do on a political level to save peace in the Middle East?"
"I will say it once again here, the immediate suspension of the association agreement between the European Union and Israel would seem to me to be a healthy measure since it would make clear to Israeli opinion that it was aimed not at Israel but at the current government in order to try to put the required political pressure on it to drive it to respect the obligations undertaken in Oslo and in Washington."
"Europe often regrets not playing a more worthy role on the international scene."
"Here is an opportunity to demonstrate clear political will, that of saving the peace process of the Middle East."
"Mr President, the other day, the French intellectual Edgar Morin compared Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu to the fugitive Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic."
"The comparison could be seen as exaggerated, but on reflection it has a lot of truth in it."
"In Palestine both sides are indeed committing acts of violence which we all condemn, not least the latest insane acts of terrorism in Jerusalem."
"The remarkable thing is, however, that on the Palestinian side it is the friends of peace who have the political power and the peace saboteurs who are hunted by the police."
"In Israel it is the other way round."
"According to the Israeli opposition politician Yossi Sarid, Prime Minister Netanyahu was even in agreement with the latest illegal Jewish acts of colonization in a Palestinian area in Jerusalem."
"Why does Netanyahu react in this way?"
"The answer is quite simple: he represents an ideological extremism which lives and thrives only in strife, only when insecurity is a part of normal Israeli life, only when an Arab threat can be portrayed with some credibility."
"What would become of Netanyahu, Sharon and the other Israeli 'hawks' if there were a final peace settlement with a Palestinian state?"
"Of course, they would be swept away by the peace-loving Israeli electorate."
"That is why there is, sadly, reason to be concerned about the future in the region of Palestine."
"In the international press there is now talk of Palestinian revolt, a new intifada , in response to Israeli provocation."
"There is also talk of Israel waging a ""preventative' war against Syria."
"We have seen that kind of thing a number of times before in history."
"We shall of course condemn all acts of violence."
"We shall of course examine all those involved, including the Palestinian authorities, and not least Arafat's own authoritarian methods and the opportunities for corruption which the Palestinians themselves have also now investigated."
"But in the European Union's actions there should be no doubt that the main responsibility for the current threat to the peace process lies with the current Israeli Government , not with the Israeli people."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, bombings in Israel, attacks on buses, in the market, are once again sowing grief and death."
"Everyone who goes off to work in the morning has the right to return home alive in the evening, and every national authority has the right to protect its civil population."
"That is an absolute fact."
"To do this, is it necessarily the best thing to establish military control along all the roads of the West Bank?"
"To confiscate thousands of hectares from your neighbours?"
"To shut off hundreds of thousands of citizens in their town or village, thus condemning people to unemployment when their only crime is to have been born an Arab?"
"Is it the best thing to blow up the home and family of someone suspected of belonging to an extremist movement?"
"Is it the best thing to move colonies of people armed up to the hilt into the territory of your neighbours?"
"To maintain mercenary militia in South Lebanon or to prevent the Palestinians from exporting their own produce?"
"The Israeli authorities seem to think it is the best thing, in any case, it is a necessity."
"The least that can be said is that if it is necessary, it is certainly not sufficient."
"The renewal of attacks on Israel demonstrates that there is clearly an error in the path that has been chosen."
"Obviously, such an attitude is deplorable."
"If you turn your back on peace you draw together once again all the conditions for the fanatics to devote themselves to new attacks."
"The European Union must join in the efforts which have been deployed tirelessly by American diplomacy for years, to whom I believe we should be grateful at least in a small way, since the few advances that have been achieved up to now, at least in the last few years, are really due to this activity."
"I am sure everyone remembers the weekly trips to the Middle East by Mr Baker, to obtain a signature."
"In any case, Mr Marín has reminded us, and I must admit that his comments have terrified me somewhat, that the European Union injects considerable quantities of money and energy, but probably not under the right conditions needed to make it effective."
"It would be fitting therefore if this same effort could be deployed on a political level, through pressure on the Israeli government, but also, and perhaps at least in the same manner, on the Palestinian authority so that it reforms its methods and its customs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in his remarkable work, ' Christians of the Orient' , between jihad and dhimmitude, the Israeli Jewish historian Bat Yeor observes that if Christians have often been unfaithful to the message of the love of Christ then Muslims, when they devote themselves to violence, do no more than imitate the prophet Mohamed himself, cruel leader of the war of Medina, who cut off the heads of his enemies by the thousand and gave the women and children to the men."
"It is true that numerous sorats of the Koran - I am referring to the Pleiad edition, approved by the University of Al Azhar, order the annihilation of non-believers and, depending on the interests of Islam, death or a saved life for the people of the Book, Jewish or Christian, according to a statute of dhimmi."
"There is unfortunately no alternative Koran."
"But, opposing the fundamentalist violence of Islam, there is also the fundamentalist violence of Judaism."
"I must here pay tribute to the work of a professor at the University of Tel Aviv, Israel Schak who, in his book '3000 Years of Israel' courageously denounces the foundations of what the famous Jerusalem philosopher, Yoshua Leibowicz, did not hesitate to call judeo-nazism in the French newspaper 'Le Monde' ."
"Let me give an example. Believing cynically that it would go no further, the Regional Councillor for the Ile de France, the eco-Communist Konopnicki, proclaims in No 463 of ""The Ark' his admiration for the famous rabbi Élie Munk, great commentator of Maimonides who, in his book 'The Lost People' , page 615, claims that the Turks and the Negroes are not men and develops in some depth the need, and I quote, ""to kill, in the name of the Ten Commandments, the descendants of idolaters, even young children, along with their fathers and grandfathers' ."
"Rooted in Maimonides, the religious ideology of Élie Munk, to consider but one of the mentors of Konopnicki widely diffused in France and notably at the great Jewish Colbo bookshop explains, I believe, along with many others, the behaviour of the Netanyahu government, coming from both this theocratic culture and the extremist nationalism of Gordon, the mentor of Ben Gurion."
"It is through this terrible confrontation, the exterminationist logic professed by the distant children of Abraham, for centuries brothers yet enemies, that unfortunately the Israeli-Arab war is perpetuated."
"But Mr Netanyahu is mistaken."
"Israel cannot win peace by continuing to crush the Palestinian people, which will in the end lead to a revival of Arab solidarity."
"I once believed that perhaps the Afrikaners were not so wrong to want to organize, in South Africa, the separate development of peoples so different."
"When I saw the reality of apartheid, its world of barbed wire, of townships and of homelands, I immediately understood the madness of both the policy and the practice."
"It is the same with Israel who, although they receive immense support from the United States, will not be able to coop up indefinitely, in a number of small territories, between watchtowers, a Palestinian population - poverty-stricken but young, courageous, intelligent and enterprising."
"The policy of apartheid is madness for Israel, just as it was for the Union of South Africa ."
"If Israel does not find a solution in keeping with the dignity of people and peoples, nothing will save it from disaster."
"So when you consider that the Arab citizens of Israel do not even have the same identity cards as the Jews, you can but shudder."
"I would like to put a question before I end, Mr President."
"Why do some people in France, who want to grant, without limit, the rights of French people to foreigners, accept that over there, the Arabs, who are in their own country, are so badly treated?"
"An error on the banks of the Seine is certainly not the same as a similar error on the banks of the Jordan."
"Mr President, we still refuse to admit that the Oslo agreements are dead, because we see no alternative other than war."
"If there are alternatives to Oslo, as sometimes seems to surface in press statements by Israeli spokespersons, the international community at Oslo - that is, the United States, Europe and Russia, which stood guarantor for those agreements - has the right to know about it now."
"The peace process has been going through a very severe crisis, which is why every effort has to be made now to prevent it being destroyed with no alternative in sight."
"There is not much time because the situation is on the brink."
"For this reason, we support the proposal from the President of the Council to set up a permanent security committee between Europe and the United States to exercise the maximum possible pressure on both sides."
"A code of conduct is needed to reverse the rout which is leading to catastrophe, but the next New York summit, at the end of the month, must primarily clarify the strategic position: is the peace process still in the minds and amongst the basic options of the two protagonists?"
"The summit must determine whether the peace process is still valid for the Israeli government."
"This is an essential point, because it looks as if the answer is no!"
"If it is not valid, the summit must come up with a new proposal, explicit and comprehensive, which is, as I have said, surfacing every so often in the press."
"Without this fundamental clarification, no partial proposal will have any effect."
"Certainly if this point is made clear in New York, the code of conduct can be approved, the measures the Palestinians intend to adopt against terrorism can be examined and a common approach can be agreed in the fight against terrorism which does not rely entirely on the armed forces and the police."
"I say that because Hamas terrorism is not the only terrorism in the world."
"In countries where terrorism has been isolated and defeated - and I could give many examples - it has always happened on the basis of a political defeat first and foremost, and not a police or military one."
"The Israeli government seems to forget that terrorism can only be defeated when it is isolated from the people and not by carrying on as at present, creating all kinds of difficulties for Arafat, for example, political and economic, and undermining his credibility."
"The terrorists can be isolated if the people see the peace making progress, see the benefits, see what the leaders, starting with Arafat and Rabin, have done in the interests of the people."
"If the process is shattered the forces ranged against it will naturally gain strength, terrorism first and foremost."
"Isolating terrorism is the only way."
"This is a very important point because the Israeli government's requirement for security, and the accusation against the Palestinians of not doing enough, is based on an approach to fighting terrorism which must be questioned, because it is probably a method which does not produce results."
"As regards Commissioner Marín's requests, I will be brief."
"You are right: in November the European Parliament will try to do its share."
"Madam President, I must say that it is with a large amount of sadness that I participate in this debate today."
"We have been for a long time hoping that the peace process in the Middle East would come to some form of conclusion."
"I recall very well when the European Parliament delegation visited Israel earlier this year that I came home with a great deal of sadness."
"There seemed to be no unanimity within Israel or within the PLO, and the Palestinian cause generally, as to how to proceed."
"When there is a lack of unanimity it is very difficult to come to a conclusion."
"I listened very carefully to what the President-in-Office and the Commissioner said this morning."
"I must say that I thought that Commissioner Marín was extremely frank and very open and, indeed, courageous in his remarks."
"These things have to be said at the present time and Parliament will have to come to a conclusion because it has a role to play in this process."
"But there are many others who have a role to play and it is not always appreciated that we need better coordination of the way we are approaching the difficulties that are currently being faced in the Middle East."
"Syria, as I have mentioned before, is a key player and has a lot to answer for in terms of the failure to find a solution to the peace process which we all want to see succeed."
"And likewise Iran."
"Those two countries in particular should be brought to task, not only by the United States but also by the United Nations and by the European Union."
"I hope that the EU in particular will try to encourage the United Nations - which at this very moment is undertaking reforms - to respond to events in the problem areas of the world."
"It is not necessarily right that we always depend on the United States to be the world's policeman."
"The European Union certainly has a role to play."
"We have great interests there as has been pointed out: the financial contribution we make to the Palestinians and also, of course, the trade association agreements we have with the Israelis."
"But, overall, I was encouraged to hear Mr Colajanni say what may be the one thing we can all agree on - that terrorism must be isolated."
"However that is to be achieved, it must be with the cooperation of Syria and with the Iranians."
"I was encouraged also to hear that our relationship with the Jordanian Government - which has a key role to play in this issue - is currently good."
"The Egyptians have always believed that they have a major role to play in the Middle East and I would encourage them to be full participants in this overall discussion which we must surely try to address from that international perspective."
"We all hope that the discussions in Washington next week will be successful."
"But let us also remind everybody that life goes on in the Middle East."
"There are 30, 000 Palestinians crossing the Israeli border every day to go to work."
"We have a great opportunity as a European Union to make sure that we can bring those conclusions and peace process together so that we do not need to continue this debate on a never-ending basis."
"Mr President, I believe the greatest error that Parliament could make today would be to bury the peace process prematurely."
"If we look at the situation we can see that, according to the famous saying, it is serious but not desperate."
"Mrs Albright's visit to the Middle East did not have such a negative outcome as some bright spirits would have us believe."
"The removal of the blockade, this is one measure which is by no means negligible when it concerns a country obliged to defend itself from the daily threat of terrorism."
"What we have to try to avoid is pouring oil on the fire."
"In this respect, the recent comments of the French Minister for Foreign Affairs are regrettable."
"The peace process will take place between the Palestinians and the Israeli government, both democratically elected."
"To insult either of them would be to insult the peace process."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that it would be a serious mistake to try to reduce the current crisis in the peace process in the Middle East to a question of security."
"We all roundly condemn the unacceptable outrages which have been suffered by innocent victims in Israel."
"But we all know that the key to what is happening in that region lies in the failure to observe the Oslo agreement, principally on the part of Benjamin Netanyahu's government."
"Prime Minister Netanyahu is trying to renegotiate, or rather to impose something different from what was agreed, and not just in relation to the settlements."
"For example, he is not carrying out the withdrawal which was agreed with the Palestinian National Authority, he is blockading the territories under that authority's control, he is detaining thousands of prisoners."
"What is Netanyahu achieving with this harmful policy?"
"First, he is weakening President Arafat; secondly, he is frustrating the Palestinians and encouraging the terrorists; and lastly he is encouraging the Israeli extremists, who are currently committing regrettable and provocative actions such as those of Ras al Aloud."
"Mr Netanyahu goes even further by carrying out actions against the Lebanon, to which that country's army have had to respond, quite legitimately."
"In other words, it is Mr Netanyahu who is mainly responsible for what is happening, because he is not keeping to the Oslo agreement and he is disregarding international law."
"The United States is gradually losing its role as arbitrator in this matter."
"For example, Mrs Albright is acting in a manner directly opposed to Mr Baker."
"She has gone to give support to Netanyahu, not to condemn what needs to be condemned."
"Europe should ask the United States to play a relatively balanced role again and to put pressure on Netanyahu, for example by freezing the current agreements with Israel, and of course encouraging aid for the Palestinian National Authority."
"In this respect, I want to support Mr Marín's proposal."
"Mr President, missio pacis , mission of peace."
"The bible of the old church used this translation for the name of Jerusalem."
"Is it possible to maintain this name in view of the barbaric terror used by the enemies of peace?"
"Not only must it be maintained, but it can be, because this city, the city of Yad Vashem and of the Grove of the Righteous of All Nations, is a symbol of the vulnerability of terrorism."
"Terrorism can be vanquished, but only by one method: by the unshakeableness of the conviction that there is no alternative to peace and the peace process."
"For this reason I should like here - and I am aware of the bias of my vote - in the name of my parliamentary party to call upon Prime Minister Netanyahu and his Government to fulfill the Oslo agreements to the letter, comprehensively and in the spirit of the peace process."
"Because, whereas security is the central point of his policy, it is also clear that security for the Israeli people can only be achieved in this one way, begun in Washington and Oslo."
"Mr President, the Alleanza Nazionale wishes to express its full solidarity with the Israeli people over the recent criminal terrorist attacks they have suffered."
"At the same time we firmly condemn the resurgence and advance of Islamic fundamentalist fanaticism which, whatever right there may be on its side, has no justification for carrying out indiscriminate attacks in which innocent civilians of all ages often perish."
"Having said that, there is no doubt that the peace process has received some severe blows from the oft-exchanged intransigence of Arabs and Israelis."
"And, unfortunately, we must emphasize again Europe's failure to have a strong political presence in this sector in crisis, once again left almost entirely to American diplomacy."
"This, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is the Europe we do not like, the Europe which tries or seeks to make progress in the economic and monetary sectors but remains passive or absent when it comes to political initiatives and international diplomacy: a one-armed Europe."
"In fact, we would appreciate it if the European representative would work alongside the American ally for peace and actual resolution of conflict. That representative should be a position not just to make formal statements but to have his suggestions and decisions converted into binding responsibilities for the nations of Europe."
"We also have the duty to ask ourselves what we can do in the present situation to halt this escalation of hatred and intolerance."
"We believe the European Union should both apply all its economic and commercial leverage to penalize states which protect and subsidize terrorist groups and urge the present Israeli rulers to reconsider the new settlements policy."
"To conclude, we think Shimon Peres' remark, that winning a war - Israel has already won three - is something very different from defeating terrorism. It is wise and worth thinking about."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in order to avoid any ambiguity regarding my position I would like to state immediately that I support the draft joint resolution concerning the murderous attacks in Jerusalem and the peace process in the Middle East."
"I approve of the balance and I support the appeal made, along with the proposed steps, for a resumption of the peace process."
"It is the only way to ensure the long term security of the citizens and people of Israel, as well as the self-respect, dignity and liberty of the Palestinian people."
"I want to devote the main part of my time to say that nothing, I say nothing, can justify terrorism, attacks against civilians and massacres of the innocent."
"Terrorism always has fathers, leaders, an organization, networks, financial backers. There is never any justification!"
"Many countries have recent experience of this, or continue to experience it, even in Europe - Italy, Germany, France, Great Britain and Spain."
"Today in Algeria thousands of innocent people are massacred in the name of an obscurantist Islamic ideology."
"All of the countries were, or are, different cases, but nevertheless they suffered or suffer, have fought or are fighting terrorism."
"Even in Israel, terrorism struck Jerusalem under the Pérez government, at the height of the peace discussions, as it strikes Jerusalem today under the Netanyahu government."
"Only firm and massive condemnation by world opinion, unconditional and without digression, only co-ordinated organization of all civilised countries and peoples in the fight against terrorism, will make erosion of it, if not eradication, possible."
"This is the price of peace in the Middle East."
"This is the price of world peace."
"I will conclude by saying that the victims of torture in Jerusalem, like those in Algiers, await not our tears, but this reaction."
"It is the duty of Europe and our Parliament to remind everyone of that this morning!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Commissioner, regrettably this Parliament is once again forced to discuss the deterioration in the Middle East peace process, which is really frustrating."
"As we have seen, peace and stability in the zone are still a long way from being achieved, and the recent acts of terrorism are simply a manifestation of injustice, and an obstacle in the way of pacification."
"I think it is important to stress that none of the main protagonists in this process have the absolute right to impose their own views of the problems which exist, much less do so by means of provocation or violence."
"We all realise that the Arab-Israeli conflict is complex and contains numerous factors whose solution needs a firm political will."
"But we should demand that the parties concerned play their part. The Israeli Government should end its policy of provocation by means of the settlements, while the Palestinian Legislative Council should step up its fight against terrorism by arresting the activists, controlling and restoring order, and taking repressive measures against these terrorist groups."
"As we have repeated many times, dialogue and strict compliance with the Oslo agreements represent the only way to reach a solution which will benefit the peace process."
"Therefore, we in this Parliament should welcome the proposal made by the President of the Council, to create a permanent security committee in which the European Union and the United States can work together in order to mediate in the conflict."
"To do so, the European Union needs to reinforce its identity, and respond rapidly and unanimously to events."
"I am very worried by what Mr Marín said - unless I misunderstood - about the possibility that the Commission might cut off aid to the Palestinians."
"In any case, Mr Marín, I believe the European Union also needs to make a major effort to get the Arab countries to collaborate more effectively in the peace process, by not harbouring terrorist groups, as well as making an economic contribution to assist Palestinian development in the face of economic aggression on the part of the Israeli Government, as we have already discussed."
"Lastly, Mr President, allow me to conclude by saying that what is needed is firmness and political measures to control the zone's stability, and the support of the international sector for continued dialogue between the parties involved."
"Let us hope that the announcement of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, at the end of this month, brings good results and that no provocation may be able to frustrate it."
"Mr President, I think that, after the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin and the accession to power of Benjamin Netanyahu, the scenario we now see unfolding is not something that could have been regarded as beyond the realms of possibility."
"Unfortunately its international dimensions, beyond what has already been said, are extremely important."
"Relations between Israel and all Arab countries have been blown to pieces."
"Relations between Europe and those countries whose people are of the Muslim faith are, if you like, being undermined."
"Relations between Greece and Turkey, the Cyprus problem, both fall within a wider zone of instability."
"For this reason I believe that decisive measures need to be taken."
"Such measures have never existed, they have never existed even on the part of the United Nations."
"I think that the essential thing is to salvage Oslo."
"We cannot abandon Oslo in the search for another reality."
"Pressure needs to be exerted on Israel which is unambiguous and comprehensible, and there needs to be, of course, our support for the Palestinian principle, under the conditions that many of my colleagues have set out."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is nothing new under the sun in the Middle East."
"Confronting each other, two peoples, two nations: one intolerant, colonialist, probably the only fundamentally racist state with complete impunity and the other, the Palestinian people, in search for decades for a land, their promised land, their homeland, land of their ancestors and also of their children."
"It goes without saying that we unreservedly condemn the actions taken by the Palestinian terrorists."
"Nothing can excuse murderous attacks, not the provocation of the Hebrew State, nor the benevolence of Uncle Sam towards Israel."
"Throughout the last three years in this Assembly, I have frequently heard talk of the duty to interfere."
"Has the time not come for Europe, which devotes considerable sums of money to peace in the Middle East, to make its voice heard and to impose with a firmness that would surprise the world, its will to respect the rights of peoples, of men, women and children to peace, security and liberty?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning a lot has been said to describe the situation, but let us look for a moment at a scene, a backdrop, which could threaten from the Middle East."
"Netanyahu campaigned for election and won - I should like to remind Mr Wurtz that the Israelis elected him with a majority - on a platform of three ""noes' : no to an end to the settlements, no to the withdrawal of troops, and no to a Palestinian state."
"If this is not transformed into a three-fold ""yes' , which would basically mean a return to Oslo, so that an active peace policy can be implemented, then the dangerous policy introduced by Netanyahu will not be stopped and will combine itself with another dangerous development."
"Of course Arafat must stop the terrorists."
"Of course we must continue to repeat that requirement, that is entirely right."
"But we must also be clear about another thing: the terrorists are hitting not just Israeli civilians, but also - and that in my view is a political objective - Arafat."
"If Arafat is weakened - let us even assume he is deposed - then you have the scenario of a Netanyahu operating with three noes opposing a Palestinian leadership dedicated exclusively to the use of violence, or at least a majority of the Palestinian population who want that."
"Then the outlook is, in my view, clearly one of long term conflict."
"That means we are in a very serious and dangerous position."
"Fortunately Mrs Albright has once more achieved the necessary equidistance between Israel and terrorism during her current visit."
"At first it appeared to be rather different."
"If America were to adopt a unilateral position in favour of one side or the other the peace process would come to an end."
"For this reason, Mr President of the Council, the European Union must adopt a much more active role - and thank you, Mr Commissioner, for mentioned this - because it is the only way we can play our part in the maintenance of peace."
"Mr President, I do not think there is much left to say about the situation in the Middle East, but I should like to comment on what Vice-President Marín has said."
"We should be aware, as he asks us to be, that at the moment we are sustaining the situation with funds destined not for the development but for the security of Palestinian society."
"I believe that we can and should continue to do so, but there is a limit of course."
"No doubt Parliament will respond positively to his request, because I believe it is necessary to ensure that people in that area can live a little better, for their own sakes of course, but for the sake of Palestine and also Israel, in order that this process may survive in such a delicate situation."
"This is the message which was conveyed to the Mashreq Delegation during our last trip, by everybody we met there."
"I should like to take the opportunity to say that in this respect I am very pleased with the association agreement with Jordan and that the obstacles, which were hard to justify or to understand but which still existed, have disappeared."
"None of this will solve the problem, we know."
"The key is not in our hands; it is in the hands of Israel and the Palestinian National Authority."
"We have no alternative but to keep on believing in Oslo - putting our trust in Oslo."
"Therefore, I want to express our support for the resolution being presented, and a message of congratulation from this Parliament for the political initiatives adopted by the European Union in the last few weeks, which should continue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add a few words to this debate, a debate marked by - and all the speeches have shown it - a feeling of sadness and frustration in the face of the situation in the region four years after the signing of the Oslo accords."
"But I still have hope, as I note that none of the speakers have succumbed to resignation and that all are agreed in saying that, even if the current period is tragic and extremely difficult, even if some speak of a last chance for the peace process, it is necessary to try to keep trying, in the absence, as has been said, of any other solution."
"Let us be clear. The consequences would be tragic for Israel and for the Palestinians, for their neighbours, but also for the international community."
"As a doctor by profession, I have to say that the patient is in danger of dying, perhaps in agony."
"But emergency resuscitation is still possible, and on this point I agree with the comments of my friend, Manuel Marín. I strongly doubt that the closure of borders, ports and airports, the withholding of tax receipts, the cutting off of what corresponds to vital oxygen for the patient, is the most appropriate way of saving him."
"It is the duty of the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament to support the efforts deployed at an international level, not only by the United States but also by our special envoy, and to seize this last chance."
"Success is possible, if a security committee is first of all created."
"It is essential to take into consideration the legitimate concerns of Israel with regard to the security of its citizens and to condemn and isolate terrorism."
"Mr Arafat alone will not be able to overcome terrorism."
"This seems obvious to me."
"He needs help, but to achieve this, it is equally necessary to offer prospects to the Palestinian youth who are currently experiencing an extremely difficult situation, to say the least."
"At the same time we must also try to draw up the details of how the security committee would be run, a committee which sounds like a good idea in theory but within which there will be clashes which will require neutral arbitration."
"As for the code of conduct, I am well aware that it is not a miracle cure, but it is an instrument which could be useful as long as there is the courage to maintain political pressure on both sides in the peace process at a political level within the European Union."
"This is equally the duty of other partners involved in the process."
"I will conclude by thanking all those who, in a truly exhaustive manner, have reiterated their support for this peace process in the Middle East."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"ONP and universal telecommunications service"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0263/97) on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, concerning the common position of the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on the application of open network provision (ONP) to voice telephony and on universal service for telecommunications in a competitive environment (C4-0256/97-96/0226(COD)) (rapporteur: Mrs Read)."
"Mr President, I am delighted to introduce the second reading of this proposal from the Commission, particularly as this basic voice-telephony service is the one which is the most important to consumers."
"It is for that reason that a number of my amendments concentrate on the rights of consumers, the right of blind and deaf consumers and others at the margins while, of course, reinforcing the principle of universal service and adding some extra comments on it."
"I would remind you very briefly of the definition of universal service in the Interconnection Directive, for which I was also responsible."
"I quote: ' a defined minimum set of services of specified quality which is available to all users, independent of their geographical location and, in the light of specific national conditions, at an affordable price' ."
"The Commission will notice that one of the amendments in the name of my group calls for a biannual report on the progress of universal service to be made to Parliament."
"I think that would be of value to the Commission to have some scrutiny and comment - constructive comment, I hope - from Parliament."
"I note with approval that at first reading the Commission and Council took on board a number of my own proposals on the partial inclusion of mobile telephony in the scope of this directive, even though, at the time, Parliament did not agree."
"I am quite certain, and perhaps the Commission would want to comment on this, that from the point of view of the consumer, mobile telephones and fixed-point telephones, will very soon be virtually one market."
"I have also tabled two amendments on the timetable of transposition and implementation."
"I know it is always difficult if Parliament gives any leeway on implementation - it is taken as a red light to Member States that they need not hurry."
"I do appreciate the importance of the general liberalization deadline of 1 January 1998 but it did seem, in the view of my group too, that two months for Member States to transpose really was less than adequate."
"I would like to voice my own disappointment, and that of a number of colleagues, that the Council did not even consider a number of Parliament's first reading amendments, particularly when we were asked to do our work swiftly and in fact did do so."
"I think it has set an unfortunate climate for the second reading and any possible further conciliations."
"The last point is on the question of directories, and I have been heavily lobbied about that: the question of privacy, rights of confidentiality, the right to be included in directories at no cost to the consumer and, not at this stage but eventually, an examination of how publishers of directories and others who will benefit from the profits of this sector should at some stage be asked to make a contribution to universal service."
"That is a very brief description, in view of the time, of the broad thrust."
"I hope the Commission will be able to accept these amendments, as indeed they accepted many of the first reading amendments."
"I would also thank colleagues in other political groups with whom I have worked very hard to come up with some compromises."
"We will, of course, have a major review in 1999 from the Commission about the whole thrust of telecommunications legislation and I am sure that this third attempt at liberalization of voice telephony will again be reviewed in 1999."
"I commend the second reading to this House."
"Mr President, it is a pleasure to speak for the first time when you are sitting in the Chair."
"Since the rapporteur has been conciliatory, our Group will also support the report on the whole."
"The most important thing now is for the matter to progress."
"We shall then wait and see how the regulations work and what amendments are proposed."
"In her explanatory statement, the rapporteur said she was disappointed that mobile telephony is not included in its entirety in this report."
"I would like to say that I am pleased about that because, for example, where funding is concerned, it provides development opportunities for that part of telephony."
"Development opportunities are what are needed today."
"As I said, the report is conciliatory."
"It tries to compromise between standardization at the European level and respect for national differences."
"Unfortunately, I think that certain parts of the report have gone too far in removing references to national differences."
"There are well-intentioned proposals to take special groups into account."
"It is right that the Member States should be allowed to decide in what way various special groups should be taken into consideration, either through tax policy or social services."
"However, we are concerned that what is said about free directory enquiry services will turn out to be another proposal where the best can be described as the enemy of the good."
"I have an example from my homeland."
"There we have in an excellent way been able through competition to allow a small telephone company to take over responsibility for directory enquiry services for all the country's blind people, and today they have a high level of service."
"If this proposal goes through, I do not believe that there would be the same interest in developing quality."
"We also support the data protection aspect."
"I believe it is important that this report also proposes that the subscriber should be able to ensure that all information, or certain parts of it, can be kept secret."
"This is necessary in an insecure world where people are increasingly able to combine different lists, which makes elderly people feel their situation is very insecure."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I wish to congratulate Mel Read most warmly on the excellent work she has done, sometimes under great pressure."
"I shall straight away mention the important points from the report that are of interest to my group."
"To begin with, I would state that the Council of Ministers has adopted a number of important amendments from the European Parliament and those tabled by the European People's Party at first reading in particular."
"I would remind you of our amendments with regard, for example, to tariff restructuring and number portability."
"Furthermore, the Group of the European People's Party is pleased that by means of this directive the European citizen will be guaranteed an extended range of essential telecom services at his disposal."
"After all, every citizen has the right to an affordable connection, access to emergency services, a fair contract and access to public telephone booths."
"However, improvements could be made."
"As far as the extra-universal provision of services is concerned, there are quite a few differences between the various Member States which means that the market participants' contributions requested for the universal provision of services, vary."
"We have repeatedly received complaints from the new parties in the market."
"The European People's Party takes the view that for the basket of services determined at EU level, the parties in the market may be required to make a contribution, but that contributions for extra requirements must be produced from other sources of financing."
"This variation and the high contribution create a very uncertain investment climate for the telecommunications sector, prevent the creation of the internal market and we believe that it costs jobs."
"So Amendment No 11 is vitally important for us."
"My group also wants more attention to be paid to the rights of the disabled, the blind and the hard of hearing, a tariff for telecom services determined more at EU level and, to a certain extent, more consumer protection."
"We are therefore supporting a number of amendments in that area."
"We are well-disposed to more attention being paid to the rights of the disabled, the blind and the hard of hearing."
"One can of course also ask the question of whether special arrangements for them do not belong in more general legislation or whether regulations could be established at national level through the subsidiarity principle."
"But access, for example, to telephone booths is very important for the smooth functioning of the disabled in society and their integration."
"The affordability of the universal service should be determined more at EU level."
"My group supports this."
"After all, a Member State could be inclined to set a tariff that was so low that a de facto monopoly situation would remain and sound monitoring of this from the Commission by means of guidelines is an excellent instrument."
"We have decided to support Amendment No 26 by the Group of the Party of European Socialists because the universal provision of services is not a fixed but a dynamic concept."
"Interesting new developments keep on coming."
"Through the advent of the Internet, for example, and especially through Intranets, enormous cost-savings are anticipated in the field of sending documents by post for companies."
"But we can also expect that drastic changes will take place in voice telephony."
"Microsoft, for example, is starting a service whereby consumers will have access via their televisions to entertainment services supplied via the Internet."
"So that means we must take those changes into account."
"I would therefore ask the Commissioner to respond."
"Mr President, we are very positive towards this report as far as strengthening the rights of users and consumers is concerned, and also as far as improving access to alternative services for the disabled, the blind, the partially-sighted, the deaf and the hard of hearing is concerned, in that they will get free directory enquiry services."
"We also think it is a good thing subscribers have the right at no extra cost to withhold information about themselves, and that this information will not be made available for commercial purposes."
"Nor will it be possible to use the information in such a way without the consumers and users having given their permission."
"The Member States will be ensuring the provision of telephone services."
"We therefore think it should also be the Member States who ultimately determine the charges."
"However, there can be discussion and agreement at EU level on reasonable prices."
"However, as far as guaranteeing quality and cost levels is concerned, we believe, like the Council and the Commission, that this is a matter for the Member States."
"The proposal that the Commission should check the quality twice a year is rather excessive."
"I also think it is unnecessary."
"Mr President, in view of the late hour it would be simplest if I were just to give the Commission's views on the amendments you are about to vote on."
"We have discussed the matter many times and it is surely unnecessary to go into the basic details yet again."
"We can accept Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 16, and, in principle, Nos 14, 15, 19 and 26 as well, with a few reservations."
"We are not in a position to accept Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 24 to the indexes, because they do not accord with the provisions of the data protection directive."
"We can hardly pass something which contradicts legislation we have already passed."
"We cannot accept Amendment No 25, but we will accept No16."
"We accept Amendments Nos 3, 7 and 17 on handicapped users."
"We should like to point out, however, that comprehensive treatment of all possible cases is not relevant in the legislative part and nor can it be incorporated there."
"We would do better to put this into the explanations and notes."
"We accept Amendments Nos 6 and 10, but oppose Nos 1, 8, 9 and 23."
"We can support Amendments Nos 11 and 2 in principle, and Nos 21, 22 and 20 entirely."
"What Fernand Herman said about the date was completely right: if we set the ratification date at 1 January next year, not all Member States will be able to comply."
"It has to be said, however, that we are already working on the basis for a permanent directive, whose ratification requirements would not be affected by this directive."
"This means that many Member States have already been working in the direction set down here in detail."
"So it is not entirely impossible."
"What I find particularly convincing is the argument put forward by Fernand Herman: we should not in any way cast doubt upon the date of 1 January 1998."
"We should not create any misunderstandings, so I feel we should leave well alone and not accept Amendments Nos 27 and 28."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a few moments."
"Votes"
"Mr President, I am speaking on a point of procedure motion, Rule 126, a brief point of order, Rule 127, and place of meeting, Rule 11 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Excuse my nerves, this is my maiden speech in this House."
"On the place of meeting, there are irritated nationalists in every country, but there are also reasonable Europeans, more than one would think."
"The time seems right to find a lasting and reasonable solution regarding where we meet, satisfactory for Strasbourg and Brussels, for the French and for others, in short for all the MEPs, for France and for Europe."
"Let us not allow the ultranationalists and the impatient media to prevent the reasonable and decent spirits - I emphasize these two words reasonable and decent - to try to succeed."
"Our Parliament cannot be taken seriously - and this is so important - unless lasting and consensual rules are put in place, but we, the French, must remain specifically French until it is confirmed to us that reason can triumph."
"Mr Duhamel, this is the first time that you have spoken. But you are a well-known constitutionalist."
"May I remind you that points of procedure are different from substantive debates."
"They must therefore accord with the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I am speaking on a point of procedure on Rule 122."
"The agenda for the sitting indicates that there will be no explanations of vote in this voting time because under Rule 122 explanations of vote should take place only after the final vote and in this case there will be no final vote."
"I have to say that it is not reasonable to deprive MEPs of their explanations of vote."
"They attend, they vote, they have the right to explain why they have voted in a particular way."
"If you want me to follow procedure I will, by saying, effectively, that although there is no global vote on the list of votes, there are indeed several final votes, since different weekly sessions are decided one after the other."
"Therefore, Mr President, I request that explanations of vote be allowed."
"Mr Berthu, you have a good memory, you will remember that you already expressed that interpretation last year."
"My predecessor confirmed that there would not be any explanations of vote on this point."
"You could have referred it to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure if you were not in agreement with this interpretation. You did not."
"I agree with the interpretation of my predecessor. There will be no explanations of vote."
"Mr President, briefly."
"A huge number of Members were very happy with your original draft calendar for the part-sessions, which brought the July part-session forward by one week."
"Is there an explanation for why it has now been changed, so that it is in the middle of July instead of at the beginning of July?"
"Can Mrs Green or Mr Martens explain this last minute change, which many of us are very unhappy about?"
"Mr Haarder, now is not the time to explain the reasons behind the decisions taken by the Conference of Presidents, in which each group votes and explains its vote if it thinks it appropriate to do so."
"What I can tell you, and all honourable Members, is that there will be a separate vote on that point, so the House will be able to make a separate decision on it."
"(Parliament adopted the calendar of 1998 part-sessions as amended)"
"Mr President, first I would like to express my wholehearted approval the excellent speech made by our new colleague, Mr Stéphane Buffetaut, last night when he presented our concept of an innovative employment service in Europe to this House."
"I would like to add that this question raises, more widely, the problem of the scope of the European Parliament."
"Indeed, the European Parliament is not a parliament which enjoys limitless sovereignty."
"It is a parliament with an area of work allocated to it within the framework of the treaty signed by the different peoples of Europe, a treaty which we must respect."
"Mr President, in my view that treaty has just been violated by the preceding vote, which has cut a week's sitting in October out of next year's session."
"This decision is contrary to the letter of the Edinburgh decision of 1992, which will be confirmed, if need be, by the future Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Moreover, if this House felt there were too many days of session in the calendar for next year presented by the secretariat, then the days corresponding to additional sessions are the ones that should be cut and not the days of normal sessions."
"The amendment from the Europe of Nations Group, Amendment No 19, intended to cut the November mini-session was a move in that direction."
"We note with regret that the House has taken an inconsistent decision by rejecting our amendment and cutting a normal part-session."
"Mr Berthu, I note that you are mixing the Rovsing report up with other votes."
"Nevertheless, the Chair allowed you could express your opinion by using the explanation of vote for a different vote, which is equivalent to a flagrant breach of the Rules of Procedure."
"I think you will appreciate the consideration the Chair has shown you."
"The Rovsing report is important because it concerns innovations within EU countries."
"Unfortunately, I must say that I do not agree with all of the conclusions reached."
"In many cases, liberalization, deregulation and EU harmonization appear to be the major issues, which I cannot agree with."
"Greater coordination at the EU level, also covering research, appears to be a passable recipe."
"But I am not convinced, for example, that research is best looked after at the EU level instead of at regional or national level."
"The experience so far in Sweden is that many research projects are aimed at what the EU thinks is good so that they can get EU funding rather than putting the research itself first."
"That is tragic."
"There are also, of course, good conclusions in Mr Rovsing's report, including point 3 and point 12 which concern environmental requirements and the setting up of a capital market for expanding companies to support 'risk' companies which are involved with new high-technology products."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.50 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"NGOs in environmental protection"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0264/97) on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on the common position of the Council with a view to the adoption of the Council Decision on a Community action programme promoting non-governmental organizations which are primarily active in the field of environmental protection (C4-0217/97-95/0336(SYN)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Flemming)."
"I would also like to welcome the Commissioner, Mrs Bjerregaard."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner."
"I would like first of all to thank my colleague Mr Rübig for the considerable work which he did on this report at first reading."
"I should also like to thank the Commission."
"Cooperation with the Commission was exceptionally pleasant and helpful."
"Ten out of 21 amendments were already accepted after the first reading, and I hope very much that possibly a majority of the six amendments I shall introduce today will again accord with the Commission's intentions."
"At this second reading my first main point is that a financial reference framework has no place in this action programme."
"I am also concerned that cross-frontier European cooperation with environmental organizations should be strengthened, particularly in central and eastern Europe, but also in other countries bordering on the EU."
"This was a request from an English colleague in the Committee on the Environment, and I am pleased to accept her proposal."
"She has Russia particularly in mind here, and I think that is very sensible."
"When one thinks what a catastrophic state the environment has got into in these former Communist countries, how little public environmental awareness there is, then one can hardly overstate the importance of cooperation with environmental organizations."
"Particularly in view of the highly important cooperation with NGOs in former Communist countries, I am not at all happy about the proposed sum of ECU 10.6 million over four years. Perhaps, Madam Commissioner, we could allocate this ECU 10.6 million in one year."
"Then we would all be very happy, I think."
"I am very hopeful that the Commission will agree to Amendment No 4, under which not 50 %, but 60 % of the operational and administrative costs foreseen in the budget are to be set aside for the Community."
"Organizations which have been found guilty by a court in the European Community during the last two years, should generally not be financed, according to the resolution."
"We introduced this amendment in English, and an error has occurred in translation."
"The English word ""offence' that we used was translated as ""Vergehen' ."
"I want to state here, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, that this translation does not reflect our intentions."
"We mean the word ""Verbrechen' ."
"English is not my mother tongue, so perhaps we should have introduced the amendment in German."
"Possibly we should have used the word ""crime ' in English."
"I already know that there is no harmonization of the criminal law, but when one is aware that in Austria, for example, a crime (' Verbrechen' ) occurs when a premeditated deed could incur a sentence of life or more than three years in gaol, then the correct translation for it in other languages cannot be hard to find."
"We want to exclude by this means any possible penalty within an administrative procedure: when someone parks illegally, or when a demonstration is not registered, we are not interested in the slightest."
"Libel and slander would not fall into this category either - no indictable offence which is punishable by a sentence of up to three years."
"All that does not fall within the meaning of ""Verbrechen' as far as I am concerned, but I admit that it does qualify for ""Vergehen' , which was incorrectly introduced here in translation."
"Over the next few years we must above all achieve success for western Europe in the former communist countries."
"The west has a really great task here, with its knowledge and its success in technical know-how, and this task can only be achieved if we work closely together with the local environmental organizations, and try to raise the awareness, not only of the population, but of the political authorities there at present."
"Now my last item. I really hope, Madam Commissioner, that you also include, as I do, animal welfare organizations in the term environmental protection organizations, and will allow these highly committed organizations to receive just some of the financial benefits."
"Mr President, national agencies working on ways to protect the environment are doing a serious job to change public opinion on the environment and its preservation."
"Without a national viewpoint committed to protecting the environment, politicians will turn a deaf ear to environmental demands."
"This is perfectly visible in countries where there is an active green movement, which have gone the furthest in national legislation on environmental matters."
"Community appropriation for such environmental agencies is well justified."
"It is also justified to extend aid to cover the work the agencies are doing in cooperation with central and eastern European countries."
"One of the biggest problems with countries applying for EU membership is how EU regulation levels are to be achieved, and that is particularly so with the environment."
"Thus, cooperation on environmental issues and cooperation between the agencies should form a proper part of any strategy to promote membership for the eastern European countries."
"The Member States and our citizens are affected by everything that happens on our borders."
"Cross-border cooperation among the environmental agencies might have a dramatic effect on general awareness in the nations and the possible creation of environmental projects at grass roots level."
"And Community aid should be extended to the work the agencies are doing with others besides our neighbours in eastern and central Europe."
"From north to south there are border zones where environmental problems, along with poverty, are burning issues."
"I made the suggestion that this aid should be extended beyond EU borders."
"I am delighted that it was approved by the committee, just as it was approved by the rapporteur."
"Actually, I heard from the interpretation that the person who made the suggestion was English."
"I am Finnish."
"I totally disagree that the problems, which, for example, are associated with St. Petersburg, Murmansk, the Kola Peninsula, or South Africa, are solvable merely through the actions of the agencies, but any small-scale action in these regions means more than any in our own internal market regions."
"An ECU invested there would yield more, through the environmental agencies, the EU or the various Member States, than anywhere else."
"Mrs Flemming, in her otherwise excellent report, slipped in a rather dubious amendment in the final part."
"The rapporteur suggests an amendment to article 3, section 3, which she explained; an amendment where she personally tries to define what activities in the Community may be granted funding."
"In my opinion, this is a very bureaucratic amendment."
"We cannot at this stage know which activities qualify for funding and which do not."
"Mr President. Non-governmental environmental protection organizations play a particularly important role in Europe."
"We are bound to the principle of the eco-social market economy and ecology represents an important basic constituent of life for us."
"But we also live in a democracy, and these organizations must also obey the rules of democracy."
"In this programme it is our absolute priority to support environmental organizations at European level, and not merely in the Europe of the Fifteen, but particularly in geographical Europe as well, that is, particularly in the countries surrounding the European Community."
"We want to place environmental education above all at the centre, because the environment is also a matter of attitude and one cannot begin early enough to teach young people how important a clean, healthy environment is for us all."
"For this we need research."
"We simply must find methods that allow us to demonstrate to young people where the path leads."
"We need an objective base, and we must depart from such power words as fear, from stirring up fear, from deriding things."
"I believe we have to move on towards providing a positive example."
"In accordance with the methods of new public management and best practice, we should look for ideal situations around the world, which we could adopt for our own use."
"We should utilize benchmarking, that is, we should evaluate where the environmental situation can be improved, with what means it can be improved, and we should make the necessary infrastructure available to these organizations."
"It is essential that creative forces in the market place should continuously make us aware of where there are weaknesses in the system, and it is our duty to prove that we are looking for the best path."
"For this reason we want to raise the funding."
"Not 50 %, but 60 % of the costs should be refunded."
"We maintain that the whole framework should be better financed, but we also expect from the environmental organizations that they operate according to the democratic principles usual for us in Europe."
"We also want correct accounting, that is, we want no funding which is not subject to controls, or which flows into channels where it cannot be scrutinized, and which simply give environmental organizations a bad image."
"For this reason we demand that when more than ECU 100, 000 is spent, we should have at least a qualified book-keeper, a balance sheet and a correct profit and loss account, so that the European taxpayer can see that his money is being used in a lawful and orderly manner."
"We must also say quite clearly, and I should like to stress this to the Commission, what we do not want."
"We do not want the funds to be spent on general education, on the public in general, or on work that often follows objectives which fail to place environmental issues at the forefront."
"We want specifically to illuminate the ecological situation and to achieve improvements there."
"Furthermore, we ask that criminal organizations, terrorists, those who attack our system by really criminal means, should receive no European Union money."
"That is an absolutely essential principle."
"It is intolerable, in the light of our duty towards the people of Europe, for us to be supporting criminals or terrorists."
"I should be pleased if we were to gain support for this from all other democratic parties in this Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the recommendation that is today submitted for second reading is to ensure the legal and financial security of an existing practice which consists of co-financing the activities of certain non-governmental organizations particularly active in environmental protection at a European level, by adopting a four-year Community action programme."
"The establishment of a Community action programme for the promotion of NGOs working in environmental protection seems to me, in this context, a useful way of avoiding loss of control over how Community funds destined for environmental protection associations are used."
"Mrs Flemming emphasizes the need to monitor and supervise the possibilities for co-financing NGO activities by reinforcing selection and monitoring criteria and by protecting our Parliament's power to determine the amount of the financial appropriation."
"Nevertheless, I would like to add that it seems to me irresponsible to rashly increase the grants accorded to environmental protection NGOs in respect of their information activities, of which the concrete results are difficult to evaluate."
"It must not be forgotten, indeed, that protecting our environment also means protecting man and his future."
"Antoine de Saint Exupéry considered not that we inherited the earth from our parents, but that we were borrowing it from our children."
"Children hold the key to the future."
"It is therefore important to protect their environment, be it natural, social, cultural or family."
"This is why I would like to see NGOs for the protection of children, who carry out remarkable work on the ground, recognised with the same legitimacy as environmental NGOs by the European institutions and Community support measuring up to what is at stake on a human level in their action."
"Organizations fighting child abuse obtained this year, for the first time and, as we know, due to pressure of events, no more than ECU 1.5 million, that is, half of the budget of ECU 3 million allocated for fighting violence against women."
"We are still a long way from the amounts granted to environmental NGOs."
"It therefore seems to me extremely important for Parliament to act on this issue in the near future and that we continue to fight for a solid legal basis and a multi-annual framework for the protection of the children of Europe."
"Mr President, since this is a second reading, I will pay particular attention to the proposed amendments, but before I do so I would like to thank both the rapporteurs for the work that has been done so far."
"There are only six amendments in all."
"The Group of the Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party is able to support the five amendments from the committee, and I will return to one of them, but we cannot support Amendment No 6 tabled by the rapporteur."
"In fact we think that in the general area there are some restrictions which are inappropriate considering that many different countries are going to cooperate and it is undeniable that the conditions are not the same in all countries."
"As far as the penalty terms are concerned, I am confident that we can leave that kind of thing to the Commission."
"I know nothing about whether money will be distributed to illegal and/or convicted organizations."
"I shall concentrate on Amendment No 2 where the Commission has included a contribution to a multinational approach as its final criterion."
"It is not that we have problems with the wording as such, but we believe the wording which was arrived at in committee, or at least by part of the committee, is understood more as a guide in the sense that we would very much like to see a concentration on cooperation with the central and eastern European organizations."
"The reason we put so much emphasis on this is, of course, because we are confronting the biggest task in Europe, the enlargement to include the central and eastern European countries, and this enlargement will only succeed if all forces concentrate on it."
"We believe that the NGOs could make a major contribution to this work."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I do not think there are going to be any problems with this document."
"The Commission had already accepted several of the amendments presented at first reading, and this document by Mrs Flemming was approved unanimously by the Committee on the Environment."
"Most of the Members of this House who made comments felt that this is a good report, and that perhaps it should stress the question of finance for transborder cooperation and the use of objective criteria in the choice of projects. As Mrs Flemming mentions, it is most important that the projects should involve education, and that environmental education should be included in general education."
"It is clear that the people who report attacks on the environment have usually been educated about environmental protection. The commissioner will smile because I nearly always give an example, but only yesterday a pressure group of environmental NGOs was here in Strasbourg."
"They are very worried about what is going to happen to Doñana National Park, which is part of mankind's heritage and a biosphere reserve. We had already raised questions to the Commission about Doñana because a residential development had been approved."
"These NGOs are complaining that once one development is allowed, there are another three waiting to surround the park. The nature of the reserve means that it could be endangered."
"Before we have a European network of protected zones in the year 2000, some of these zones will probably have lost their special characteristics and their prospects for the future. That is why it is so important to help the NGOs, because I know from my experience in the Committee on the Environment that they alert us to potential problems."
"We cannot cover the whole of Europe, and they are the ones who warn us about what is happening in our continent's natural spaces. They do not only help European Members of Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a high technocratic awareness of politics in the European Union, and much doubt about the capability of democracy in a complex society. Because of this it is now particularly important to remind ourselves that awareness of the threat, the danger to the environment does not emanate from politics or the established parties, but from the population, from the core of civil society, with its thousands of civic actions and community initiatives."
"To this extent we obviously welcome the European Union's attempt to support non-governmental environmental organizations."
"They are to be thanked for the greatest political revolution that has taken place in the last few decades."
"For this reason I am even more astounded by an attempt at general discrimination against these groups, which is meeting with extreme outrage throughout Europe. I refer to the amendment attempting to re-introduce a concept long thought to be extinct: a prohibition of finance for environmental groups that have been sentenced by the courts."
"The translation confusion reflects the confused, diffuse and emotional way the matter has been presented."
"Ladies and gentlemen, without civil disobedience, without the culture of civil disobedience, the environmental protection movement would never have occurred in Europe."
"From Wackersdorf to Hainburg; almost national myths are connected with them, where ordinary people tried to defend themselves against politics and the political establishment."
"The environmental groups in Europe are deeply concerned by the attempt generally to condemn them here."
"There has not been one single case in the last ten years, and yet - just imagine it, ladies and gentlemen - there is an attempt in this House to pass a resolution restricting cultural subsidies or economic support for something which has never happened!"
"On behalf of the Greens, I reject this attempt at defamation most emphatically."
"Mr President, I had prepared myself in the one minute available to me to speak about the penalty terms which the environmental organizations are so opposed to."
"Now Mrs Flemming is saying that it is only a question of sentences of at least three years. But, firstly, who can ensure that all countries interpret it in that way?"
"And, secondly, is it at all reasonable to believe that environmental organizations will commit such crimes?"
"What they were thinking of must have been, for example, that in 1995 Finnish environmental activists were convicted by a court for an action against a fish farm which had the parasite G. salaris, which kills salmon."
"They were convicted even through the action got the Finnish Agriculture Minister to close the fish farm."
"This week a date was set for the trial of Bellona employee Alexander Nikitin."
"He has now been charged with spying because he wrote a report on radioactive pollution in Murmansk."
"This is, of course, the EU, but is it really so hard to imagine that there are also sensitive areas here which environmental organizations must stay away from because they might be brought before the courts and sentenced?"
"I think we should vote against Amendment No 6, and if Parliament does not assume this responsibility, then I hope that the Commission will reject it."
"Mr President, my group's position on budget line B4-306 is a reticent one. This budget finances three activities: awareness raising, grants to non-governmental organizations and publications."
"Clearly it relates to campaigning funds."
"The way they are planned, the grants to NGOs seem to us questionable."
"Firstly, they risk overloading the European budget at a time when it would be more sensible to look for savings rather than extra expenses."
"Secondly, it is always risky to entrust public money to private organizations."
"Moreover the rapporteur agrees, by proposing a sub-section 3a to ensure financial control of the funded organizations."
"Lastly, some associations funded are, in fact, politically active organizations which should survive through money from their members' subscriptions, not the taxpayers' money."
"This is notably the case with Friends of the Earth, an organization operational in a number of European countries, which received in 1996, ECU 601, 668, or Greenpeace, which devoted itself in France throughout this summer to a veritable campaign of disinformation and panic amongst the population of Nord-Cotentin, where the nuclear reprocessing plant of the Hague is established."
"This was a truly scandalous piece of disinformation, of panicspreading, of manipulation of people."
"In any case it is clear that such actions must not be funded by public money."
"This is the reason why we wish to see the maximum control possible over grants provided to different nongovernmental associations and organizations."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Flemming for her work on this report."
"Some of the debate so far has shown, however, that we have quite different views on what an environmental organization actually is."
"This action programme to promote non-governmental organizations concerns fundamental questions about society's participation and influence with regard to EU policy."
"Social and political institutions which are shielded from civil society risk losing their legitimacy."
"The citizens' awareness and ability to participate in the debate are fundamental to democracy."
"The EU's legitimacy can never be taken care of through some kind of artificial information campaign aimed at convincing the citizens of decisions which have already been taken."
"Instead, as in this action programme, it is support and encouragement for broad co-operation on the European level which is important."
"That is why it is interesting to see that in the first reading Parliament gained a hearing for the demand to strengthen the organizations' independent role in the programme."
"The benefit should not lie in using environmental organizations to communicate the EU's policy, but in taking advantage of the experience and views which the organizations themselves possess."
"Since I am convinced that the action programme is important, I concur with Mrs Flemming's criticism of both the fact that the Council set a reference amount and also the size of this reference amount; ECU 2.65 million per year is far too small a sum to cope with these tasks."
"My principal criticism, however, concerns article 3.2 which indicates the criteria for selecting the activities in question."
"To simply indicate some kind of cost-benefit, a lasting multiplier effect at European level, and a contribution to a multinational approach suggests a certain amount of self-interested steering on the part of the Commission."
"In particular, the criterion of contributing to a multinational approach should be deleted entirely to avoid the suspicion that we are doing this for our own sake."
"On the Committee on Environment we have together formulated a number of additional criteria which strongly emphasize the action programme's aim of strengthening the influence of citizens through clearer focussing on integration in education."
"I think it is strange that these criteria did not gain a hearing at first reading."
"However, I sympathise most strongly with the point on cooperation between environmental organizations within the EU and other states, especially the countries which have now applied for membership and which will soon begin negotiations for membership of the EU."
"We know that this will be a great challenge both for the Union and for the environmental sector."
"Regarding Amendment No 6 from the Group of the European People's Party, I would like to say that we shall, of course, make demands on the organizations who apply for funding from the EU."
"They will have to be able to show that they used previous funding in a proper way. Book-keeping and auditing are two important parts of this."
"However, I do not believe in drawing up some kind of morality clause to say that only organizations without convictions will be able to get funding from the EU."
"Moreover, I am quite convinced that criminal legislation is not harmonized within the EU."
"What is carried out by an organization or perhaps by an individual or by a group of individuals is a difficult and complicated question."
"I therefore think that the wording in Amendment No 6 is wholly unnecessary."
"Finally, I would again like to stress that our Community actually needs active, critical, independent voluntary organizations."
"We need an impetus which gets us going and drives us on."
"With that I move to support the work of the Committee on Environment and to reject Amendment No 6."
"Mr President, our group welcomes Mrs Flemming's report."
"The organizations which work in the area of the environment play a decisive role in the development of environmental policy and awareness of environmental problems."
"It is therefore quite right to give them a stronger position, which this proposal entails."
"We are going to vote for the amendments which have been adopted by the Committee, that is, not to be bound by these very tight financial limits, to be able to give a higher level of cofinancing from the EU's side and that there should be thorough checks on whether the funds have been used correctly."
"We shall, of course, also vote for Amendment No 2, which clarifies the criteria for the grants."
"Just like several others here, I think it is particularly good that we are stressing international cooperation in relation to central and eastern Europe."
"However, we are not going to vote for Amendment No 6 from the Group of the European People's Party."
"I shall try to explain this a little further."
"We think the limits it creates on how these grants can be used are too restrictive."
"The amendment contains several points."
"Point a) is on not giving grants for information aimed at the general public."
"We consider this to be a much too restrictive limit to set for this kind of support."
"It is in fact a very important part of the role of environmental organizations to influence public opinion."
"Point d) of the same amendment states that an organization which has been convicted by a court shall not be able to receive a grant."
"It is obvious that you should not be able to give support to organizations that use violence or which may be regarded as criminal."
"However, we all know that many environmental movements use civil disobedience and extra-parliamentary action in various ways."
"These are very serious organizations doing extensive environmental work."
"I believe it is entirely wrong to automatically exclude all these organizations through such a formulation."
"Finally, I would like to say something about the contribution from our French colleague who attacked Greenpeace."
"I think that we should also reflect on the history of France and Greenpeace a little further back in time."
"It is not very many years since the French security service sank one of Greenpeace's vessels in a New Zealand harbour."
"We can remember that too."
"Mr President, I find I can fully support this report."
"The report covers the cofinancing of the administrative activities of NGOs operating in the environmental field, and seeks to institutionalize the cooperation planned under the fifth framework programme for environmental research."
"In particular, in my opinion, support for NGOs engaged in environmental protection needs to be strengthened."
"Amongst other things, we believe it is appropriate to include cross-border projects with the central and eastern European organizations and professional training in the priorities and, above all, to raise the ceiling for European Union financial participation in the projects to 60 %."
"None of this corresponds to the Council's determination to cap the budget for the four-year programme at ECU 10.6 million, a figure we regard as grossly inadequate."
"Non-governmental organizations fulfill an important function, particularly in the environmental and social sectors."
"Some have become a sort of political conscience - and I am thinking here particularly of Greenpeace or the WWF - and so carry out a public function."
"It is thus correct that they be supported by official means."
"It is obvious that criminal and terrorist organizations are not deserving of support."
"However, in case Mr Rübig is applauding at this point, his attempt to discredit named environmental organizations leaves a very nasty taste in the mouth."
"The danger exists - and you may have noticed from which side the applause has just come - and one has to proceed here with particular caution."
"For this reason I suggest that the proposer of the amendment, for whom I have high regard, most particularly because of her personal resistance, should perhaps withdraw Amendment No 6."
"Mr President, I would like to begin, as others here have done, by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Flemming, and also the previous rapporteur, Mr Rübig."
"A great deal of excellent work has been done."
"Most speakers have spoken of the important role of NGOs."
"I fully share that view."
"They are important for channelling the citizens' desires and misgivings, and they are also an important source for the Commission's work."
"I also share the view expressed by Mrs Dybkjær and many other speakers that the importance of the NGOs is very great in connection with the development of the new democracies in central and eastern Europe, and I shall come back to that in connection with the amendments."
"As you know, the aim of this proposal is to bring about a specific legal basis for a practice which has already worked satisfactorily for a number of years."
"Therefore the proposal is also a concrete expression of the Commission's appreciation of the contribution of these NGOs to the improvement of the environment."
"So the text should, of course, be as clear as possible, and it is also in that spirit that we have examined the proposed amendments."
"We can accept wholly, partly or in principle, five of the six amendments."
"Amendments Nos 1 and 3 are acceptable in full."
"They are in accordance with the Commission's rejection of the Council's desire to introduce a financial reference base into the text."
"Amendment No 4, whereby the Commission can finance up to 60 % of an NGO's budget, is acceptable in full."
"Part of Amendment No 2 concerning the criteria for grants is acceptable in principle, and, in any case, this is really about what Mrs Dybkjær touched on, that is, a change in the wording so that we talk about cross-border cooperation instead."
"Amendment No 5 concerning financial controls is acceptable in principle, but here too it will be necessary to achieve the greatest possible clarity."
"Like several other speakers here today, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 6 because it would be inappropriate to introduce such exclusion criteria into the draft decision."
"I would like to thank Parliament once again for the thorough debate and also for the interest it has thereby shown in the active participation of NGOs in the political work."
"Thank you, Mrs Bjerregaard."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions"
"The next item is report(A4-0253/97) by Mr Fitzsimons, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Decision amending Decision 93/389/EEC for a monitoring mechanism of Community CO2 and other Greenhouse gas emissions (COM(96)0369 - C4-0540/96-96/0192(CNS))."
"Mr President, Mr Fitzsimons is ill. The poor man has pneumonia."
"He has asked me to step in at the last minute to replace him and, of course, to present his apologies."
"I will therefore try to present his report to you."
"I know it is a document which is close to his heart."
"We know that our colleagues in the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection are well aware of the problems of climate change and the increase in the greenhouse effect."
"This is why I am happy to repeat that there is a wide consensus on the need to inform public opinion, which is greatly concerned about the effects of global warming and the concentration and accumulation of gases which increase the greenhouse effect."
"It is even clearer that human activity contributes to this phenomenon."
"In December 1995, the intergovernmental group on climate change, a panel composed of over 2, 000 eminent scientists, noted its concern regarding greenhouse gas emissions."
"According to these scientists, if the current level of emission is maintained, this could raise the temperature of the earth's surface in the year 2000 by two degrees in relation to 1990."
"The subsequent consequences, as you might expect, could be tragic: a rise in sea levels, desertification and so on."
"The European Parliament has always been very active in this area, providing endless reports and resolutions, forcing the individual states to take restrictive measures and to adopt a clear agenda."
"The Rio Summit in 1992, made this goodwill concrete."
"More than 150 countries signed the framework convention of the United Nations on climate change through which a consensus has been set in motion, the objective of which is to stabilize CO2 emissions so that they are the same in the year 2000 as they were in 1990."
"The discussions and meetings that followed should be concluded at the Kyoto Summit in December 1997 if, as we hope, an agreement can be reached with the aim of strengthening the convention on climate change and taking more restrictive measures to enable a clear reduction in all greenhouse gases."
"In March 1997, despite different approaches by certain Member States, the Environment Council, under the Dutch presidency, was able to agree on a European Union proposal for the Kyoto Summit."
"Its objective is the reduction by 15 %, as compared to 1990, of greenhouse gases from now until the year 2000."
"Furthermore, a 'basket' of gases should be considered and monitored with regard to the risk they could represent in terms of global warming."
"The Commission's proposal under examination aims to amend the Council's decision of 1993 regarding the monitoring mechanism for anthropogenic emissions, that is, those caused by human activity including CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases."
"The new proposal aims at updating the following decisions: extending the monitoring past the year 2000 to take into account community emissions, limitations and reductions after the year 2000, extending monitoring to a greater number of greenhouse gases, CO2 not being the only gas concerned."
"The proposal will thus cover methane, carbon monoxide, the nitrogenous oxides and volatile organic compounds, as well as emissions of other greenhouse gases such as the chlorofluorocarbons which are found in aerosols, fridges, etcetera and others which are already banned by the Montreal protocol."
"Our rapporteur, Mr Fitzsimons, is drawing up several requests."
"He hopes that the dates of 2005 and 2010 for a 15 % reduction, as proposed by the Council, will be taken up by the Commission."
"He is very much in favour of monitoring greenhouse gases other than CO2 ."
"Thus for some, such as methane, used notably in agriculture, and nitrous oxide, which is produced by industry, the margins of error are very important and a great deal of research is still necessary."
"Monitoring gas by gas, rather than a global 'basket' therefore seems more sound and reliable."
"He equally considers that the monitoring of carbon sinks, that is, the role the forest plays, is not justified."
"This type of monitoring is not reliable."
"I am nearly finished, Mr President."
"Information-sharing is another problem."
"Some Member States still do not have official objectives, others are incapable of providing basic data."
"This is why the rapporteur has submitted an amendment requesting the Commission to guarantee the accuracy of data."
"Finally, we are perfectly happy to accept Mrs Schleicher's amendment which requests that the methods of the intergovernmental group on climate change be taken up by individual Member States."
"I will however ask Mrs Schleicher if she will accept an oral addition clarifying that the methods must conform to the norms most recently adopted in the framework of the United Nations convention."
"Mr President, at the end of the summer and with a lovely sunny day outside, a lot of people probably think that global warming is really quite a pleasant thing."
"But we know in reality that it leads to a great deal of unstable and dangerous weather conditions and is going to have some very serious effects across the world."
"I do not intend to give a lecture here today about climate change because we have rehearsed this issue many, many times in Parliament."
"We know that the main purpose of this legislation on the monitoring of greenhouse gases is twofold."
"First, it aims to build a framework in which we can measure these emissions against the reduction targets to which we committed ourselves at Rio."
"Secondly, they are designed at a more local level to assist in alerting people to occasions and the locations when air pollution is putting health at risk."
"In 1993 what was put in place as the original monitoring device was, frankly, little better than an acknowledgement and agreement at the European level of existing practice in the Member States."
"Despite calls by Parliament for harmonization of national measurement and inventory compilation and for more transparency at that time, this was a little too much for the Council of Ministers to agree on."
"Certainly stabilization of emissions has not taken place."
"I expect that we are going to find that some fairly shocking emission levels will be found when the environment agency brings out its next Dobris report shortly."
"We have just learned, for instance, that in London, the European Union guidelines for NOx have been breached right across that city for pretty well the whole of last year."
"The Commission's attempt to revise and improve on the 1983 decision is therefore very welcome."
"Not only do we need a better and more comprehensive monitoring mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions now, but it is essential to put in place a mechanism to cover monitoring post-2000."
"It is particularly important to take greater account of the greenhouse gases other than CO2 , such as methane and nitrogen oxide."
"In December we are going to Kyoto to try and persuade the world to agree to a 15 % reduction in emissions of a ""basket' of greenhouse gases between 1990 and 2010."
"It would be helpful to think that we were making some useful progress ourselves."
"Evidence sadly shows that we may not reach our own targets."
"The Commission, in the cautious mode it adopts these days, was very vague about its timetable."
"Therefore my group supports the amendments for a report each year on cumulative emissions of greenhouse gases and projected cumulative emissions up to 2005, 2010 and 2020."
"We believe that this cumulative monitoring is essential to prevent countries from allowing excessive emissions throughout a time scale, and only lowering them right at the end to meet a target."
"This would not be a great help in the global warming stakes."
"Furthermore we believe it is better to determine whether targets are being achieved using a gas-by-gas approach rather than the all-in basket approach."
"On the substance of the amendments, we support all those from the committee but we are not in favour of Mrs Schleicher's Amendment No 13, which appears to be unnecessarily restrictive."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current great horror scenario is global warming, that is, the warming greenhouse effect harmful to the environment, an increase in ocean levels, or growth of deserts."
"It also means the opposite: destruction of the ozone layer, which would have the result of making all life on Earth impossible."
"Model calculations are only as good, however, as the assumptions on which they are based."
"This is the Achilles heel of the matter, in my view."
"We humans simply know too little."
"Why, for example, did Ice Ages arise thousands of years ago, and disappear again?"
"Why does El Niño occur in a particular cycle off the South American west coast and influence the weather?"
"What influence have ocean currents and seas in any case?"
"What is the influence of cloud formation?"
"Is it coincidental that at the moment doubts are increasing again about the effectiveness of current climate models, which are being created at enormous cost throughout the World?"
"As many serious scientists complain, the major problem lies in the fact that no, or too few, data are available from many parts of the world, often because the poor state of the detection stations makes the data unusable, or incapable of comparison."
"This scenario illuminates the importance of today's report on the proposed European Union systems for observing and recording CO2 and other greenhouse gases."
"The European Union has been making efforts to improve the area coverage of detection stations in every country of the Union even since the 1980s."
"It is important not only to reduce CFCs and stop their use, but that gradually all other poisonous materials with similar effects are detected."
"This proposal by the Commission is a further step in this direction, which our group supports without reservation."
"We do have, however, like the rapporteur, a few improvements to make."
"Firstly, the estimated values must in future, if we require them, be produced from unified criteria. Yet these are not obtainable."
"I have, though, serious doubts about the value of such estimated values a long time in advance, over and above that they give rise to considerable bureaucratic effort."
"Secondly, as a result of the Rio Agreement all relevant measures of the European Union and member states are included into the international work of UNEP, OECD and IPCC, the multilateral groups for climate changes."
"For this amendment to be put into operation at all, Member States must test for emissions according to a unified procedure to be laid down in this directive."
"This procedure should be that currently being developed by the IPCC."
"This is the reason for my amendment motion."
"To learn more we must measure more. But that costs money."
"We have a responsibility to future generations, however, not only to deal carefully with non-renewable natural resources, but also with that rare commodity, money."
"It seems to me to be more responsible to invest money worldwide in detection stations, than to put it into estimated figures which are partially politically inspired."
"I regret that my colleague, Mr Fitzsimons, cannot be here, as he was responsible for the other two reports and made important contributions to improvements which can we fully support, all except for one: Amendment No 5."
"I should like to propose, however, that an addition be made to my amendment, because that idea came from him."
"If I could learn from the Commission how the proposal is looking, it might be improved by an addition."
"I should have no objection to that."
"I would be very interested to learn, therefore, how the Commission views the matter."
"Mr President, in the Netherlands, the month of August was the hottest month since temperature measurements began in the 18th Century."
"We have been able to establish that since the 18th century the seven hottest years have occurred since 1980, that is to say, in the last 17 years."
"The figures from the IPCC again showed us last year that there is quite definitely a greenhouse effect."
"Despite this, the emissions of carbon dioxide continue to increase."
"In the Netherlands, the emissions from 1990 until this year have increased by 8 %, while they should decrease by 10 % by the year 2010."
"How difficult it will be to change this situation!"
"As our colleague, Mr Fitzsimons, who unfortunately cannot be here today, so rightly said in his report, a very good monitoring system and reporting system for the emission of greenhouse gases is really necessary, because with it we shall be able to assess the results of the policy meaningfully."
"My group also considers it to be right that in its proposal the Commission goes further than the year 2000 because in the Environment Council agreements were made for the key year 2010."
"Therefore the European Union's legislation must be adapted."
"A reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases demands drastic measures that will have very great consequences for the economy."
"Such difficult political decisions must be able to be monitored properly."
"The discussion often revolves around a few percentage points."
"If there is no adequate measuring system, the debate will be very easy to manipulate."
"We are speaking today about the monitoring systems and we are doing so at a time when Europe is prospering economically, but economic growth unfortunately means an increase in the emissions of greenhouse gases."
"Let us be sensible and use the economic recovery to pay more attention to this environmental pollution."
"Mr President, the decision that we are discussing here is none other than a means to an end and that end is the pushing back of the greenhouse effect."
"My group finds it alarming that recently throughout the world so little priority has been given to this objective."
"It is a fact that the European union plays an exemplary role in the run up to Kyoto."
"Not only in drawing up ambitious objectives, but also with regard to their implementation."
"Therefore I feel it is a good thing that the Commission has made this proposal to amend the decision."
"Monitoring is extremely important in order to check the emission of greenhouse gases."
"The data must be reliable and comparable, otherwise monitoring is impossible."
"Also, the fact that it is no longer only carbon dioxide but all greenhouse gases that must be measured, is quite right, especially because the other gases cause a considerable part of the greenhouse effect."
"Recently a small movement has emerged in the scientific world that is trying to undermine the conclusions of the IPCC, by pointing to other causes of the increase in temperature."
"The changes in the intensity of solar radiation are apparently mainly responsible for the temperature fluctuations on earth."
"I think that is a dangerous development."
"First of all, because you then ignore the precautionary principle and secondly because the existing theory does demonstrate convincingly that the greenhouse effect is manmade."
"Already the EU objective is in danger of being exceeded by 5 % before the year 2000."
"So doubt about the influence of greenhouse gases is particularly worrying."
"I therefore wholeheartedly support the Commission's proposal and the amendments by the Environment Committee."
"Mr President, everything in nature is closely linked: we all play a part in environmental equilibrium and in turn it affects our well-being."
"Today the consumption-at-all-costs society is taking a toll on that well-being through unfettered progress which is taking place at the price of increasingly intolerable environmental disequilibrium."
"This is true of emissions of greenhouse gases, responsible amongst other things for global warming, a highly dangerous phenomenon for the planet's eco-system."
"The Fitzsimons report underlines the importance of monitoring these emissions in order to assess the progress achieved on European standards."
"We are in agreement with the rapporteur when he proposes the strengthening of the Community control mechanism beyond 2000, also taking account of other greenhouse gas emissions deriving from industrial activities."
"Finally, we trust the traditional control methods will combine transparency with interchangeability."
"Mr President, I believe the Commission's text is extremely important, and its message should be conveyed to everybody - not just to Governments, but to all operators and to all of us, because we share the responsibility for this phenomenon."
"The Commission says that there is uncertainty about the chances of reaching agreement about this reduction in the year 2000, and that coherent overall strategies must be put into operation immediately."
"I think that this is the political message, and that is where this Parliament will support the Commission in this case."
"We have now heard most of the representatives of the political groups, and I think we are unanimous here."
"We have to demand that governments really do keep the international agreements."
"I was a representative of this Parliament at the Rio Conference, where all the Heads of State and of Government promised to take respectful and responsible measures."
"Nevertheless, these precautionary measures are not being adhered to."
"This call for responsibility is the most important part of the Commission's communication, followed of course by the implementation of the measures and national plans."
"I think the message has not sunk in, and many governments have not faced up to the reality. Even the ""polluter pays' principle is not being applied in the way it should be."
"It has been interpreted as meaning that he who pays has the right to pollute."
"This was not the original sense of the principle; rather, that the producer and the consumer of a product should pay all of its costs. The whole of society needs to be told that, in the case we are considering, it costs money to breathe - and so it should."
"Manufacturers must take all the necessary measures to prevent pollution as much as possible. This is the reason for continuing to demand that they use the best available technology, although this is not the time to talk about that."
"I think the amendments which have been presented are good and can be implemented. I believe we have enough scientific justification and social concern to demand that governments comply with them."
"I believe this is the essential principle. We cannot support any economic policy which uses short term economic interests to justify endangering people's health and well-being, and the natural world as a whole."
"This communication, I repeat, has our total support, as we have just seen."
"Mr President, I would like to make a few remarks on the subject of the greenhouse effect."
"It is true that we are observing a global warming, but as Mrs Schleicher has suggested in her speech, there is nothing to prove that this warming comes from the emission of greenhouse gases produced by human activity."
"I would simply like to make a few sensible remarks."
"We note that in the Alps, the glaciers have been melting since 1820."
"At that time, the Industrial Revolution could not have yet been having any significant effect."
"Similarly there are today glaciers re-covering the tips of the Alps which were free of ice and where troops passed in the 12th or 13th century."
"And as we know very well, Erik the Red, after crossing the Atlantic, found a land which he called Greenland simply because it was warm and green."
"However, I do not think that their boats produced greenhouse gases."
"There is thus undoubtedly a great deal of exaggeration in this field when human activity is accused of global warming."
"Having said that, it is also true that you cannot be too careful and that it is certainly necessary to try to limit the production of greenhouse gases."
"Carbon dioxide, CO2 , is responsible for 65 % of greenhouse gases and it is interesting to see how many tonnes of carbon dioxide per inhabitant were emitted into the atmosphere in 1995, country by country in Europe: Germany, 2.9 tonnes;"
"Belgium, 3.2 tonnes; Denmark, 3.2 tonnes;"
"Spain, 1.8 tonnes; Finland, 3.6 tonnes;"
"Ireland, 2.7 tonnes; Italy, 2 tonnes;"
"Luxembourg, 6 tonnes; Great Britain, 2.5 tonnes;"
"France, 1.7 tonnes. Why does France discharge less carbon dioxide than other countries?"
"Is it because there are less towns in France? No."
"Is it because there are less cars in France? No."
"Do we use less heating? No."
"No. The truth is, if there are less greenhouse gases produced in France than elsewhere, it is for a very simple reason, that in France there are more nuclear power stations than elsewhere."
"Ecologists have long had a slogan, ' Nuclear power, no thank you' translated into the different languages of the Community."
"But when you look at the results on the level of greenhouse gases, you should rather want to say, ' nuclear power, yes please!'."
"Mr President, I will try to concentrate on the amendments which have been proposed, but I would first like to thank the Committee on the Environment and the rapporteur, Mr Fitzsimons, although he is unable to be present today."
"I would then like to ask Mr d'Aboville to convey my best wishes for his health, and I would like to thank Mr d'Aboville for having deputized for him here today."
"Almost all the proposed amendments are an improvement on the quality and clarity of the proposal."
"As you know, the aim of the proposal is to amend the Council's Decision of 1993 which introduced the supervision mechanism referred to."
"It will generally bring the mechanism up to date by continuing it after the year 2000 and by extending it to cover all the greenhouse gases not covered by the Montreal protocol."
"There were some individual questions about that from some of the speakers."
"The Commission is able to accept all the amendments with the exception of Amendment No 5."
"Amendments Nos 7 and 13 are acceptable in principal, but they require some changes."
"The accepted amendments are, as I have already said, welcome, either because they clarify the regulations or because of the idea behind them."
"The Commission does not accept amendment 5 because it places additional burdens on the Member States without giving clear benefits."
"Amendment No 7 is acceptable in principle, because the Member States are required to submit national programmes no later than three months after the Council's adoption of the Commission's proposal, and because the Commission will carry out a follow-up assessment no more than six months after that, and so we are sure that we can find a sensible solution for those Member States who drew up plans a short while ago."
"As I said, Amendment No 13 on the compilation and reporting of data is acceptable in principle."
"We are not happy with the present wording."
"It is possible that, within the comments which came from Mr d'Aboville, there are opportunities to arrive at an improved text in the area concerned."
"In conclusion, I believe that we can look forward to this proposal helping to ensure that the Community and the Member States fulfil their current and future obligations in accordance with the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change and the goals we hope to see in the Kyoto Protocol."
"And finally, I would like to thank you for the debate here today."
"Thank you, Mrs Bjerregaard."
"I would like to join you in sending my best wishes to Mr Fitzsimons."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Europe and Japan: the next steps"
"The next item is the report (A4-0259/97) by Mr Moorhouse, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament 'Europe and Japan: the next steps' (COM(95)0073 - C4-0147/95)."
"Mr President, this is the third time that, as rapporteur, I have had the honour of presenting a report from the Committee on External Economic Relations on relations between the EU and Japan."
"As a former chairman of our delegation to Japan, Mr President, you are well aware of that."
"This particular report is wider in scope, dealing not only with trade and economic relations but also with increasingly vital political aspects, which I rather feel we have tended to neglect as the European Union."
"Some ten years ago when I presented a draft motion for a resolution in the Committee on External Economic Relations, political groups were very much at odds on what our approach to Japan should be."
"That report, indeed, was adopted by a relatively narrow majority."
"Happily, however, we are now much more at one, which no doubt says something about changing attitudes but equally may have to do with the changing nature of Japan-EU relations."
"As far as political aspects are concerned, we owe a great deal to the 1991 Japanese Government which, together with the Council of Ministers, agreed on a joint declaration which inter alia highlighted political and security issues, bringing a much better balance to the relationship."
"We believe Japan should be encouraged to be more involved in international affairs."
"In this connection, I refer the House to paragraph 4 of the resolution in which we advocate a restructuring of the United Nations system, and in particular the Security Council, which has clear implications."
"However, inevitably a report of this nature is rapidly overtaken by events."
"I refer, for instance, to the EU-Japan trade surplus, which had halved between 1992 and 1996 to just ECU 17bn - a big figure, of course, but it had halved."
"Alas, from the European point of view, it is now growing again as domestic consumption in Japan has fallen and exports remain the only buoyant part of its economy."
"Perhaps the Commissioner will want to comment on future prospects."
"Much of the report deals with the perennial chestnuts of market access and foreign direct investment."
"The former is hardly new territory but some degree of progress can, nonetheless, be discerned, however slow that may be."
"What is of great concern is the inadequate progress over the last ten years on EU direct investment in Japan and the liberalization of the market in services - maybe with some qualification."
"We welcome the recent Commission announcement that a study is to be carried out to investigate the obstacles to investment."
"I would not wish to second-guess the study, but the Commission has lots of experience in dealing with the Japanese."
"Could the Commissioner not tell us what his own concerns are and what he intends to do about them?"
"To what extent can we improve the situation bilaterally?"
"Or do we have to wait for the painfully slow process of extracting concessions within the WTO context?"
"That brings me to Euro-Japanese relations within the WTO."
"I think we can readily agree that we wish to cooperate closely with Japan, and paragraphs 20, 22 and 23 of the resolution deal with this very subject."
"However, does the Commissioner share the view that this cooperation could be jeopardized, say by the SinoJapanese negotiations on tariffs and on quotas, which may have the effect of undermining EU-Japanese attempts to reach agreements within the WTO?"
"I put the question."
"In conclusion, the preparations for the Kyoto Conference in December demonstrate for all to see how important the deepening political and diplomatic triangular relationship between the EU, the USA and Japan is for the exercise of global leadership in international fora."
"I look forward to hearing what the Commissioner has to say to reassure us that stale, old trade squabbles will not be allowed to sour the political and diplomatic atmosphere between the world's three great trading powers as a result of Japan's domestic economic difficulties."
"One last word: there is so much else one could say and time does not allow me to do so, but let me congratulate the Commission on the ongoing executive training programme for young European executives going to Japan - some 600 or so."
"This certainly deserves every support, and we in the Committee on External Economic Relations will give it that support."
"Thank you very much Mr Moorhouse."
"You are quite right that I am listening to this debate with particular interest."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Commissioner, for several decades, and especially since the last world war, European interests in Asia, and especially Japan, have been in decline, while United States interests have grown, taking their place."
"As the great victors of the war in the Pacific, the United States has been able to impose its rules on the foreign policy of this zone and increase its economic interests throughout Asia, with particular incidence on Japan."
"However, in the last few years, political and economic relations between the European Union and Japan have seen a moderate development."
"The meetings of the European institutions with their Japanese counterparts and the normal bilateral contacts between the Member States and Japan have contributed to this development."
"In continuing and deepening this policy, the Commission published a document on the next steps in relations between Europe and Japan."
"The Commission's proposal to strengthen these relations deserves our full support, both for the reciprocal advantages and mutual interests, and for the external relations equilibrium of Japan, which finds in the European Union a credible partner on the international scene."
"We think there are advantages for the European Union in active - and I do mean active - and concerted support, with Japan, for the policy of world peace and security, as well as the continued development of a multilateral and open economic policy."
"It is in the European Union's interests for Japan to be a factor for political stability in its region and in the world, to support the multilateral free trade system, to encourage democracy and greater respect for human rights in Asia."
"We believe four things are needed to achieve this: one, the European Union should support Japan's aspirations to play a major political role on the world scene, notably in the restructuring of the United Nations, which is currently under discussion."
"Two, Japan should give more support to European Union policies in Asia."
"Three, political dialogue with Japan should include human rights issues, especially in other Asian states."
"Four, there should be greater participation by Japan in international peace missions."
"To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would say that developed political relations between the European Union and Japan is a crucial factor for better equilibrium in foreign policy on the world scene."
"And I want to refer very particularly to the existing disequilibrium, in the zone which includes Japan, between the foreign policy of the European Union and the foreign policy of the United States."
"For these reasons, we support Mr Moorhouse's enlightened report and the Commission's communication, and we intend our support to be active - and for that purpose we are at the disposal of the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur for the clarifications he has provided regarding the deepening of collaboration between the European Union and Japan, and to congratulate Sir Leon Brittan, the Commissioner, as well as the Commission, for the pragmatic approach of the Commission's text."
"Within the framework of globalization of markets and commerce, as within that of political dialogue, relations between the European Union and Japan will from now on play a vital role within the World Trade Organization, both in the framework of annual summits and ministerial meetings, and in interparliamentary dialogue within the delegation on relations with Japan, which I have the honour of chairing."
"You will know, Mr President, as former chairman of this delegation, that the strengthening of political, economic and industrial links has become essential with the third millennium in sight."
"On a political level, within the framework of the new partnership between Europe and Asia, Japan can indeed play a preponderant role."
"It seems to me that our historic and cultural links even accord us a pivotal role, all the more so, given that, since the fall of the Berlin wall, the sociological similarities between the European Union and Japan are more and more striking: ageing of the population, strengthening of administrative authorities, threats to employment and, nevertheless, positioning on the international market."
"Whilst working for the achievement of common objectives aimed at preserving stability in Asia, Japan is becoming a preferred contact for Europe in terms of relations with Asiatic countries."
"On an economic level, the situation is on balance positive."
"Indeed, during the last few years, the surplus on the balance of payments on current account in relation to the world economy has shown a significant fall."
"Therefore the imbalance that exists between European Union investments in Japan and Japanese investments in Europe should rapidly even out."
"The negotiation of a compromise regarding the conclusion of a multi-lateral agreement on investment would give further guarantees to foreign investors who are looking to establish themselves on the Japanese market."
"In this context, the programme of deregulation, commenced by Japan in March 1995, represents a starting point in terms of a global agreement that could also include the details of a mutual recognition of products."
"Finally, I can only rejoice in the fact that scientific and technical cooperation between the European Union and Japan is progressing steadily."
"Glyn Ford mentioned it earlier - he is moreover the author of a report on this subject - as the meeting of high level scientific experts which will take place in two weeks time in Tokyo shows - and I am pleased to be personally participating in this - with eminent members of the international scientific community."
"It is in this particular context that I am in favour of the amendments submitted, aimed at reinforcing scientific and technological co-operation between Japan and the European Union."
"The European Union is thus establishing the details of a dialogue which will serve the mutual and reciprocal interests of both Japan and the Union, with a view to preparing the next stages of our political and economic relations."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to compliment Mr Moorhouse on behalf of the Group of the Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party on his excellent report."
"Mr President, the uneven balance of trade between Europe and Japan has greatly concerned the Parliament for many years."
"My group welcomes the recent drop in the trade surplus, but nevertheless feels that too little progress is being made in the liberalization of the Japanese market."
"Particularly in the field of the removal of administrative barriers and the mutual recognition of certificates and tests, there is still a long way to go."
"It is these very barriers that mean high costs for the individual entrepreneur and reduce his competitiveness."
"The Japanese market is not sufficiently accessible and the recent flight of capital from Japan is possibly a consequence of this."
"The number of scientific and technological cooperation projects between the European Union and Japan is fairly small."
"In view of the fact that Japan is the country with the highest research and development expenditure in the world, expressed as a percentage of the gross national product, it is regrettable that there is little cooperation in this area."
"In a global economy with increasing competition, it is no longer sufficient only to cooperate with European partners on R&D. International cooperation with countries outside the Union must be given greater priority in the fifth framework programme for research and technology policy."
"This must of course occur on the basis of reciprocity."
"The Union should make an effort at all levels to involve Japan in our Community life, both political and economic."
"My Group will wholeheartedly support this."
"Mr, President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is a very good idea for the Commission to think about how the dialogue and cooperation between the European Union and Japan should be conducted in future."
"After all, these are two of the most economically powerful units in the world, if one looks at this trio illustration."
"At any rate, and this is a negative record, the most environmental sins are produced in these two blocs together!"
"The greatest power is concentrated in these two blocs to make them precursors for the production of another form of economy, an economy that no longer continues to carry out irresponsible economic plunder of the world's resources."
"There is little point in the Japanese protecting their forests in Japan, whilst in Asia or Latin America they relentlessly clear the land of trees to make disposable chopsticks!"
"That may very well be a cultural viewpoint, but it is not enough for me."
"Yet there was not a word on it in the original wording of the resolution to the Commission awaiting our votes today."
"We actually had to include in the text such obvious ideas, as that there was a common interest in global environmental stability."
"Instead of an agreement on a common procedure for the path towards a stable future, I find in the text the suggestion that Japan and the EU should give each other mutual support, in order to secure each other's global economic spheres of influence."
"To return to the point about the environment: there still rings in our ears Japan's vehement rejection at the Kyoto World Climate Conference of any binding declaration on a reduction of emissions."
"As though nothing had occurred, our declaration now says that we should each act together on the environment within the WTO."
"We know quite well what is possible on the environment within the WTO."
"The Singapore Conference showed that perfectly clearly."
"I have a high regard for Mr Moorhouse as an excellent rapporteur and I can substantiate much of what is in his report. I think it is very important at this point that the EU and Japan should together consider as a single de facto power base in this trio how a social, ecological and cooperative economy, with cooperative world trade, could be made possible."
"For it is of no use to us - neither Japan nor ourselves - if one day we are first and Japan third, because someone will have to pay for this deficit. Our concern is to bring in all countries, so that we can escape from these deficitary, ecologically and socially damaging conditions."
"I feel it is most important to plan the future exchange of culture and points of view on this, and not to consider how best to deregulate the most. Each country should decide for itself, how it should like to construct its economy."
"One thing I can say: many deregulating procedures in this world have had just the opposite effect."
"The rich can afford them and the poor can neither visit a hospital nor make a telephone call; nor in any other way participate in the good things of this Earth."
"Madam President, I would similarly like to congratulate Mr Moorhouse for his report, and make a few comments."
"The reduction over the last few years of the commercial deficit between the European Union and Japan, often presented as a victory, is in fact no more than a mirage due to currency fluctuations."
"Indeed, the strengthening of the yen in relation to the dollar has strongly handicapped Japanese exports and has led to massive relocations of entire sections of Japanese industry."
"This is the reality!"
"At the moment, now that the yen is falling, we are noting a considerable increase in Japanese exports to the European Union."
"The mirage has thus gone but the obstacles remain."
"Of course, with the exception of certain products such as copper, footwear and some agricultural products, the Japanese customs duties are no longer restricting access to the market."
"On the other hand, the non-acceptance, by Japan, of international norms and procedures with regard to testing and approval poses a serious problem for our trade with this country."
"On this crucial question, the Japanese authorities should tolerate from Europe what they tolerate from the United States."
"The Union should clearly reject any difference in treatment."
"We are today requesting that the Japanese authorities guarantee free trade within the country, without having to go through such monopolistic groups as the 'keretsu'."
"If a real effort is not made in this area we will be forced to reconsider the complete opening of our borders to Japanese cars in 1999."
"As for direct investment, the figures are even more overwhelming."
"Indeed, according to Eurostat, the Union has reduced its investments in Japan on average by ECU 300 million per year between 1992 and 1995."
"Consequently, the imbalance of trade with this country will continue to grow over the coming years if nothing is done."
"However, positive points do exist in the area of science and technology, telecommunications, financial services and transport, where advanced cooperation has been established between the Union and Japan."
"The Commission must today, therefore, make a precise evaluation of relations between the Union and Japan, taking into account all aspects including the monetary and provide a forecast on the subject to Parliament."
"Clear and precise measures must be proposed so that European products free themselves from the 'keretsu' and so that the Japanese authorities are convinced of the procedures for testing and international agreement."
"Madam President, bilateral negotiations continue and will continue long after playing their role on an international business level."
"Yesterday's debate on bananas demonstrated to what extent the WTO was not sufficiently independent to deal with some matters of crucial importance for the European Union."
"Let us not get caught up in multilateral negotiations which often really benefit no-one but the American multinationals and let us develop a true dialogue with Japan, including on the subjects of human rights and the death penalty, which still exists in their country."
"It is in this way that a true community foreign policy will be born."
"Madam President, we have noted in this report devoted to the future of economic relations between Europe and Japan certain useful assessments and recommendations, but also some important gaps."
"The report correctly highlights the need for the Commission to be more attentive to the effects of bilateralism with regard to Japan, which is assiduously practiced by the United States, who are becoming, in addition, the eulogists of multilateralism, in order to avoid possible discrimination of our service and manufacturing industries in the Japanese market in relation to their American equivalents."
"This is clearly the case in essential sectors such as semi-conductors, mobile phones, and automobile parts."
"If the Commission really wants to defend the interests of European business - and this is what its role should be - it should follow the recommendations of Mr Moorhouse who correctly recommends a much more aggressive policy if we want to avoid the vice being tightened around our companies' necks by, on the one hand, criticism of the Europe from the WTO because of American complaints and on the other hand, the American-Japanese sectoral agreements negotiated without taking any account of our interests."
"But should this report not have considered, as a priority, a certain number of sectors strategic for Europe, in particular the car industry?"
"I noted no analysis on the effect of the steps, inspired by American protectionist measures, which the Commission has taken in terms of import quotas for Japanese vehicles, and I noted no recommendation for the future."
"Do the numbers fixed and the timetable accepted effectively protect the interests of our manufacturers and the numerous SMEs that depend on them?"
"What will be the consequences of the ending of quotas and what compensation will be requested?"
"In the same fashion, nothing is said of the way Japan clings to protecting her agricultural and livestock resources: agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish produce."
"How can it be that this net exporter of goods, services and investments can manage to protect its achievements in the area of production and agricultural prices, thus escaping the alignment of its agriculture with world prices and maintaining the uniqueness of Japanese agriculture?"
"Can Japan develop an agricultural model suited to its needs whilst we are unable to develop one suited to ours?"
"In this respect, will Japan be a model to follow?"
"Mr President, I would have liked to see, in an otherwise relevant report on many points, some substantial development of these important questions."
"Madam President, the clear message from the Moorhouse report, as many speakers have stressed, is that in the last ten years there have been significant developments in relations between the European Union and Japan."
"We are now engaged in many more areas than 10 or 50 years ago."
"At the same time I think it is clear that there is still a certain distance in cultural and political terms between Europe and Japan."
"Although the United States, Japan and Europe are often described as the three sides of the triangle, very clearly, in Japanese terms, relations between Europe and Japan are of what they would call a 'younger brother' nature compared to those between Europe and the United States and the United States and Japan."
"There are certainly no grounds for complacency."
"We cannot take it for granted that relations between Japan and Europe will develop as closely as those between Europe and the United States or between the United States and Japan."
"On top of that, we are forging ever closer relations with other parts of Asia."
"Relations with China are 'young' in the same way as the overall security relationship which Japan has with the United States."
"For that country, we remain the fundamental anchor. That element is very often overlooked in Europe."
"We are appealing for exactly the same kind of treatment."
"The question I would like to put to Sir Leon is whether the time has not come to look for a broader, more strategic objective in our relationship."
"It is strange that of all the countries in the world, the European Union has no bilateral agreements with either the United States or Japan."
"We have had an agreement with China since 1984 and this is certainly going to develop."
"In the case of the United States, our links are of a quite different nature."
"The question therefore is whether it would be wise to work toward a strategic framework agreement, enveloping the various links which we have in the scientific, economic, political, cultural and environmental fields as a way of saying that this is the development which gives us a strategic link to the future."
"Madam President, the report by Mr Moorhouse, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, has been carefully prepared."
"I was not able to participate in it myself, but I greatly appreciate it."
"In its communication to the Council, the European Commission places the emphasis on intensifying political relations with Japan."
"The rapporteur rightly corrects this approach."
"The policy of the European Union must above all be geared to the improvement of trading relations with Japan."
"European companies still experience problems in accessing the Japanese market."
"Japan's continuing high trade surplus vis-à-vis the European Union is an indication of this."
"Direct investments also are still a long way from being in balance."
"In the communication and the report the various trade barriers are described."
"We may request that Japan make clear promises about the lifting of these barriers."
"The intentions expressed by Japan at the summit in the Hague on 25 June give some hope of this."
"The World Trade Organization is, in my view, the appropriate forum in which to raise trading relations with Japan."
"The United States have chosen an aggressive unilateral approach to Japan; that is not appropriate for the European Union."
"Not only is the position of the European Union different, but the American approach has only achieved limited results."
"The strategy of the Commission and the rapporteur, of constant, broad insistence on change, is what I consider to be the correct path."
"Here, it is important that multilateral agreements on direct investments and financial services come about quickly."
"The Commission makes the strange proposal of supporting Japan in its demand to obtain a permanent seat on the Security Council."
"This seems to me to be premature and, moreover, the question arises of whether such a political stand in fact falls within the powers of the Commission."
"So it was wise of the Council not to adopt that proposal."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, may I first of all thank and congratulate Mr Moorhouse for his admirable report, with which I almost entirely agree, and to thank him and others such as Mr Ford and Mr Pompidou for the kind remarks they have made about the evolution of Commission policy and my role in it."
"It is no exaggeration to say that of all the developments in external affairs, in the years I have been involved, the evolution of policy, progress and attitudes to relations between Europe and Japan has been the most substantial if not the most dramatic."
"It has not been dramatic because it has not been achieved by any single leap or single agreement but it has been the most substantial because we have moved from a time when, as has been said, relations - largely trade relations - have been contentious to a time when trade relations have greatly improved and when relations have been considerably broadened to cover political activities as well as economic activities."
"Reference has been made in relation to political activities, for example to the question of KEDO by Mr Ford."
"That is of fundamental importance because it shows that the European Union is prepared to participate in an arrangement which costs us a bit with the United States, Japan and Korea of profound importance for the security of the region."
"It is a symbol of our much greater interest in the whole."
"The question was also raised of how have we come to make the progress we have made and what further progress is there to be made."
"This has come about through adopting an approach that is significantly different from the United States and certainly in my mind more suitable for us and at least as successful."
"It has not been a soft approach."
"It has not been an approach which simply says we will go along with whatever the Japanese do."
"We have been even-handed."
"We have insisted in our relations with Japan, that there should be no discrimination against us compared with the United States."
"Here I beg to differ from what Mr Souchet said. He mentioned semi-conductors."
"It is interesting that we were able to hold out and indeed to delay the whole of the information technology agreement, which was fundamentally in our interest, unless and until we reached a point when the exclusive features of the agreement between Japan and the United States with regard to semi-conductors were brought to an end and we were brought into the semi-conductor council as full partners."
"That is an example of the way in which, through the use of multilateral measures as well as bilateral pressures, we are able to defend ourselves against that which was objectionable whether it came from the United States, or from Japan, or both."
"But also we have been free and ready to take whatever line is appropriate."
"For example, when Japan was threatened by the United States with measures in the automobile sector, we incurred a considerable degree of hostility in the United States by saying that what the United States was threatening would be contrary to the international rules of the WTO."
"The effect was that the United States did not proceed with those threats. Our interest was not a theoretical one because any move the Japanese were forced to take would have been at the expense of European industry."
"So we were able effectively to defend ourselves."
"As far as Japan is concerned, we did not hesitate to take action in the WTO when it came to discrimination in the taxation of spirits and we were successful."
"I made it clear throughout to our Japanese friends that this was not being done in a hostile way but rather by using the international system to achieve the objectives which it was there for, namely the peaceful resolution of disputes."
"I hope when people talk about bananas they will remember that case as well."
"Nonetheless, it is indeed a fact that as a consequence of these measures, which have been non-confrontational, but not wet or weak, we have been able to develop a trading position with Japan and gain access to the Japanese market."
"Above all, we have been able to show that our own experience in deregulation is valid for Japan."
"The speaker who said that the Japanese, for their own internal reasons, are now very concerned about deregulation to modernize the economy was absolutely right."
"We have been able to show that we can teach, through our own hardwon experience, something about that."
"As to the future, progress still needs to be made."
"Mr Moorhouse referred to the upturn in the deficit once again and reference was made by Mrs Sainjon to the impact of currency changes on the trade figures."
"That is always the case and always will be."
"Therefore we need to press on and to insist on further deregulation and to give advice as to how that could be done."
"We need also to continue with the trade disputes where we have complaints about what has happened, for example in the harbour area, and in some agricultural areas as well."
"But we do so in a spirit of cooperation."
"What has been said by many speakers in the course of this debate about science and technology and the further advances that can be made has great validity."
"So, I believe that a policy of friendship and cooperation, while at the same time putting forward European interests using the bilateral and multilateral means at our disposal combined with support for Japan playing a larger role in the world, as Mr Moorhouse has suggested, and by us assisting in that process through being ready to participate ourselves, as in KEDO, and to put our money where our mouth is."
"This combination of approaches has in the past decade proved to be the right one, as is shown by the fact that the Commission and all parts of the House have come together in an unusual display of very substantial unity in support of a policy which is in the interests of Europe."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Universal telecommunications service"
"The next item is the report (A4-0270/97) by Mr van Velzen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the Commission communication on assessment criteria for national schemes for the costing and financing of universal service in telecommunications and guidelines for Member States on operation of such schemes."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the Netherlands the largest telecom operator is going to put on the market a telecom card with a smell as a marketing stunt."
"The largest newspaper in the Netherlands ran a report about it last week."
"Where will the deregulation of the European telecom market lead us next, Mr Commissioner?"
"In December a card will come onto the market that will smell of pine, freesias, strawberries or mint."
"Mr Commissioner, I promise that I shall give you one of these cards as soon as they are on the market."
"But now to more serious matters."
"The cost calculation of the universal service is a very technical but extremely important subject as it involves enormous amounts of money."
"In various telecommunications directives we have defined what the content of the universal service for the telecommunications sector is - that is in the ONP voice telephony report by Mrs Read - and how the financing must be regulated - that is in the interconnection directive and in the full competition directive."
"This communication gives points of departure for Member States to calculate the costs of universal service."
"Doubts have been expressed by the Committee on Legal Affairs of this House about the legal status of this communication."
"The provisions of a communication are after all not legally enforceable and, according to the Court of Justice, may not create new obligations."
"And there the problem begins, because operators need clear guidelines in this field whereas the legal status of a communication now prevents this."
"This is a fundamental problem because we get a great number of messages from telecom companies that universal service tariffs are too high in a number of Member States to be able to make profitable investments."
"In addition, the term ""universal service' itself creates uncertainly because it is not always defined clearly."
"I wish to speak of my extreme concern here."
"The European Institutions can make splendid EU legislation, but in the end it is up to the willingness to invest of new entrants on the market whether the liberalization will actually work."
"There must be a strict limit to what Member States can finance via a universal service mechanism."
"Indeed, a large contribution for the service falsifies the competition, creates high tariffs for the consumer and is harmful to the development of the European economy."
"I said that this morning when we were dealing with the other report by Mrs Read."
"The best thing would of course be a new directive in this field, but that would probably not be feasible at the moment, just before full liberalization, nor do we wish to open Pandora's box, but to close it."
"In the short term, a technical review of the Commission's communication would be a step in the right direction, together with Amendment No 11 to Mrs Read's report that was adopted this morning."
"That gives the operators clarity."
"A technical review is also necessary and I should like to illustrate that for you with a few examples."
"To begin with: interconnection tariffs, access deficit contributions and universal service tariffs are mixed up whereas they are completely different concepts: universal service tariffs may only reflect the actual costs of the universal service and ensure a contribution by the parties on the market for the operator that has the universal service obligation; interconnection tariffs are taken into account by a network operator for the use of his facilities."
"Access deficits arise from an unbalanced tariff structure."
"In the annex to the communication it says that the rules on access deficits are of a temporary nature and may continue until 1 January 2000."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy is in full agreement."
"After all, tariff restructuring is an essential characteristic of the liberalized market and access deficits do not belong there."
"But it should just be clarified."
"I understand from my contacts that the Commission considers ONP voice telephony to be the place where that must be regulated."
"But I cannot find anything really clear about it there."
"Clarification of all of this in a corrigendum to this communication would be very helpful."
"And then there is the essential question: who will provide the universal service and how will the costs be determined?"
"To begin with the latter, the net costs: Community legislation states that the net costs must be calculated on an objective, transparent and non-discriminatory basis."
"Everyone in the sector knows that in a liberalized environment the cost calculation must be future-orientated."
"However, the exact cost items and types of cost that may be calculated are not mentioned in the legislation and the sector really needs that now."
"Paragraphs 1 to 7 of the guidelines to this communication provide good points of departure."
"Unfortunately, though, there is no legislation here."
"And then there is the matter of supplying the universal service."
"As the Commission indicates in this communication, it may not automatically be assumed that the current provider of the universal service must continue to provide the service in a free market."
"It must also be possible to designate different suppliers for different regions of a country."
"That is an essential issue, because I also believe that the company that can supply a universal service under the best conditions and most efficiently, must also do this."
"That is appropriate in the liberalized market, but where do we find that in the EU legislation?"
"The supply of the service can, moreover, have considerable commercial and marketing advantages for the telecom company."
"In calculating the net costs, account should also be taken here of the ""pay or play' approach."
"But this is not to be found in the current legislation."
"I am therefore worried about the clarity with which the operators can work at the moment with regard to the matter of financing a universal service."
"I would ask the Commissioner urgently whether he is prepared to undertake a technical review of this communication."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr van Velzen, on a thorough piece of work, as we have come to expect of him."
"I want to highlight some of the dilemmas arising from this proposal from the Commission."
"The first is one that Mr van Velzen has already touched on: the use of a communication in this matter."
"I am sure the Commissioner and Members of this House will know that the Court has already taken a view in a very similar instance and there is, of course, the worry that this particular course might lead to further actions in the courts brought by the operators or others who are affected."
"The second dilemma is also touched on in Mr van Velzen's report - although not directly highlighted in his contribution."
"I do not want to be too critical about this, because a number of aspects of this question of the financing of universal service, and indeed of the definitions, are contained in a variety of pieces of legislation - some of which, but not all, is logical."
"We in this Parliament accept that the pressure to meet the deadline, indeed the commercial and industrial pressures of the progress of liberalization, make some cross-over almost inevitable."
"I sometimes feel when I come into this House and speak on telecommunications matters, that I could dip into a bag and pull out almost any speech and it would be appropriate to that particular proposal."
"The third dilemma is that we attach such importance to the development of a universal service in telecommunications that we want to seize on almost any progress."
"As you can see from Mr van Velzen's report, we see considerable merit in the substance of what the Commission has come up with."
"However, I and my group still feel that it would be best to have a directive that draws together the various pieces of legislation in this field into one overall legislative text."
"It was unfortunate that this morning we were unable to hear from the Commissioner as fully as we would have liked on the proposals concerning voice telephony. However, I was very pleased that the amendment asking for a biennial report to this Parliament from the Commission was adopted, and I very much hope that Parliament and Commission together can use that to consolidate some of this work."
"I was also glad to see that paragraph 10 of Mr Van Velzen's report 'stresses that universal service is an evolving concept which can eventually be expanded' ."
"He and I might disagree on the pace of that expansion but it is very important for documents like this to acknowledge that there is a case for changing our definition as developments in technology and on the market move forward."
"I hope that the Commissioner will give consideration to the points that have already been raised, because this is an example where, both in the definition and in the funding of universal service, the citizens of Europe can derive some very real value in their own personal, domestic and business lives from what is coming out of the European Union."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is part of a strategy for change working through the privatization of sectors of activity which are linked to a notion or concept of public service."
"This being the Community, not to say the universal, strategy, it is inevitably taking shape in a very different way in the various Member States and giving rise to a variety of interpretations and rates of implementation, which the rapporteur begins by emphasizing, speaking, indeed, of great divergencies in interpretation and extent, primarily relating to the uncertain climate of investment and problems of competition."
"The report also refers to the ""inequalities in the level of service for European citizens' , but it seems obvious, at least to the committee responsible for the report, that the price and cost perspective predominates."
"Besides, and this is our greater concern, the concept of universal service is an evolving concept - point 10 of the resolution - and we are fighting for a concept of public service fitted to citizens' rights, which are not to be replaced by this new evolving concept, totally dominated by the logic of prices, accessibility notwithstanding - for whom and at what point? - and costs."
"The other reservation we have in this debate relates to the possibility of universal service mechanisms being created, even if not explicitly, which correspond to opening up the possibility or pretext of subsidiarity of private interests - which would have already taken advantage of the process of privatization to appropriate what formerly belonged to the collectivity - so that the universal services can be brought into being through these private services or activities, subsidizing them so that prices are accessible without squeezing the cost ratios and profits of these private interests, or even allowing them to make greater profits."
"That is the underlying logic of this process and this dynamic."
"But it should not prevent us from denouncing it and reconsidering the logic, the process and the dynamic."
"Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr van Velzen for this report and for having done his best to analyse and bring clarity to a very complicated matter."
"We have talked about telecommunications and universal services from many aspects today in various reports."
"There are, just as the previous speaker pointed out, very many different definitions of what universal services entail."
"There are different ways of carrying out the deregulation which is now taking place."
"I believe it will have to continue to appear a little like this in future too, since there are different traditions and cultures."
"We cannot suddenly decide how it will look and what the definition will be."
"It has to take time and we have to accept what we call variety and flexibility."
"As far as this communication from the Commission is concerned, it is the case that the Member States can decide on, among other things, the financing of universal services and how this shall take place."
"It is currently carried out through taxes or by redistributing income between the various operators."
"In addition we have various directives."
"There is Community law, the competition directive, the interoperability directive and the telephony directive."
"There are a number of directives which even give the Member States guidelines on how this is to be done."
"Now we have a very comprehensive communication from the Commission on further guidelines on how costs shall be calculated and how the costs shall be divided between the operators."
"I believe this communication from the Commission, together with the directives which already exist, is quite sufficient."
"To demand another directive, as the rapporteur does, I consider to be going too far."
"I think we need the flexibility that exists today."
"I therefore support the Commission in this case."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate Mr van Velzen on his report and the relevance of his proposals."
"The area of telecommunications is going through unprecedented upheaval: optic fibres, mobile phones, Internet, deregulation, all of this is the biggest maelstrom which has ever shaken the, until now, protected universe of telecommunications."
"But the strategic alliances which are today forming between European companies must not be dictated only by the demands of the most important clients nor only by the pursuit of new value added services."
"The interests of the company employees must also be taken into account along with, of course, those of private users and citizens."
"The citizens must not be abandoned on the hard shoulder of the information superhighway."
"It is up to us to protect access for all to the new technologies and to make sure that private operators, newly arrived on the market, do not set up only in urban areas where they can obviously expect a fast profit."
"It introduces then, into the policies that we are to define, a certain obligatory mission of universal service according to social expectations and thanks to the possibilities offered by the new technologies."
"If it is necessary to develop a European concept of universal service, it is clearly understood that each State must be able to develop its own concept of public service action and to guarantee all users a connection to the network without price increases for, as you know, the vast majority of citizens do not care if the price of communication between Strasbourg and St Petersburg has fallen by half!"
"The interest of the citizen-consumer seems to me to be the indispensable element to take into account."
"It is the only one in a position to go beyond certain dogmatic conflicts."
"It is probable that free competition in the telecommunications sector is today the structure best adapted to the mission of public service, but I want to draw the Commission's attention to the fact that, without a European regional policy, without a policy on social cohesion, deregulation will only benefit interests devoid of democratic legitimacy."
"Madam President, I am of course grateful for the Commissioner's reply and as always, it was very instructive."
"I am also pleased that the Commissioner promises that he is willing to correct the unclear phrasing."
"But I also asked the Commissioner whether at the same time he would consider a number of the gaps that I mentioned, such as who will supply the universal service, the pay and play principle and how will future-orientated costs be calculated?"
"And if we could consider it in the same way, I believe that not only for the Member States, but particularly for the operators, it becomes clear what they have to stick to and what the point of departure is for the Member States."
"I think that is essential, because we have now entered a very important phase and there are problems in a number of Member States with regard to the financing of the universal service."
"Perhaps the Commissioner would respond to this?"
"Mr van Velzen, if you will allow me to say so, you are now behaving rather contradictorily."
"On one hand you are saying this communication must not in any way be mandatory, and we shall have to watch out lest we end up in the devil of a mess."
"Yet now you are saying it is not quite complete, because this and that belong in it."
"I think we should leave well alone for the time being."
"We shall correct the impression which might lead to a false interpretation, and anyway we shall have an opportunity in at most two years to have look for ourselves how matters have developed."
"I am also prepared, if a - let us say - problem case should arise, to discuss with the Member concerned how one might best remedy it."
"But as I have said, up to now we have had no such case."
"There is no problem with the universal service."
"There are problems with interconnection and with other market accesses, charges, etc."
"There we have any number of problems, but we have the regulations."
"We have not a single problem with the universal service."
"If a problem should arise I should willingly examine what else one might do in addition to solve it. but it seems to me a bit extreme to say that we should write into this in detail anything that might at some time possibly happen in some Member State. I would ask you to let the matter rest with what I have said."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.25 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m. )"
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time to the Council (B4-0520/97)."
"Question No 1 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0591/97)"
"Subject: The Maghreb during the Luxembourg Presidency"
"Within the context of Euromediterranean policy, what progress does the Luxembourg Presidency foresee in the political and security fields?"
"Is Euromediterranean policy not experiencing a major downturn?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, in reply to the first question relating to the Maghreb and the way in which the Luxembourg Presidency intends to advance the dossier between the European Union and the countries of this part of the world, I would say that the European Union attaches a unique importance to its relations with the countries in question."
"I happen to know that, this morning, a long discussion was dedicated to the situation in some of these countries or in those bordering the region, and I would like to expand on this briefly in order to emphasize the interest of the Council in the Maghreb."
"Within the CFSP, the Union follows the domestic situation of the countries of the Maghreb very closely, and these are analysed in depth at regular meetings of the Mashrek/Maghreb Working Group."
"Within the framework of Euromediterranean policy, bilateral relations have been strengthened by the Barcelona process."
"The countries of the Maghreb play an active role in the partnership and have proved their determination to contribute to the success of the said process."
"The Luxembourg Presidency has the firm intention to continue this policy of strengthening relations with Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, both through the intermediary of the Barcelona process, of which the next meeting of senior officials responsible for politics and security will take place on 23 and 24 October, and at a bilateral level."
"Concerning bilateral relations, the ratification by national parliaments of the association agreement with Tunisia is extremely advanced and the European Parliament has already given its assent."
"It is therefore possible that this agreement will come into effect before the end of the year."
"Given these conditions, it is not impossible that a meeting of the EU/Tunisia Association Council may be held under the Luxembourg Presidency. This will enable us to take a bearing on the situation of the agreement and to examine from a wider perspective the future of relations between Tunisia and the European Union."
"This meeting will also be an opportunity to commence an exchange of views on political questions of common interest within the framework for political dialogue foreseen by the agreement."
"I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his helpfulness, both in answering my question and in this morning's debate on Algeria, which he has also mentioned."
"Most of all, I should like express my appreciation of the goodwill being shown by the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have mentioned some important meetings and work in progress."
"But it is important to recognize that these meetings are not enough, and that in the phase of activity which Euromediterranean policy is now entering there are far more meetings than concrete actions."
"However, there are tragedies taking place every day, to which our European institutions must respond - the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"Today, more than 20 people were killed at sea in an accident involving a motor launch in the Straits of Gibraltar."
"Deaths are caused far too frequently in this way."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in view of the goodwill of the Luxembourg Presidency, I should like there to be a response to this problem, and some specific action found to help prevent these tragic events."
"Today's tragedy - they are retrieving the bodies at this very moment - deserves a response. We know that the effective way to prevent this emigration, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is to invest - in six industrial zones in northern Morocco."
"That is what we need to put an effective end to this carnage."
"Please, do something about it."
"It is not a question of civil servants or meetings, but of actions and urgent investments."
"Thank you, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, but allow me to remind you that the time allocated for a supplementary question is one minute, and you have taken twice as long."
"Once again, this Presidency asks you to please observe the rules because there are many questions and Mr Wohlfart will not be able to answer them all if every Member of the House who speaks takes twice the allotted time."
"Mr Wohlfart, you may now reply to Mrs Izquierdo Rojo's long question."
"I will endeavour to make my answer shorter but also a little more concrete."
"I do not want to go back to the debate of this morning which was devoted to the situation in Algeria."
"In conclusion to that debate, I underlined the fact that not only the Council, but also the Commission and Parliament, had a role to play and I have been won over to the idea put forward by your friends in the European Parliament, that is, the establishment of direct contact with your counterparts in the Algerian Parliament."
"The Algerian situation affects us all."
"You say that action is required and that meetings are not going to move things on."
"My reply to that is, whilst respecting your approach, the method of gathering the antagonists around the negotiating table has been the subject of wide consensus, as participants at this morning's debate will have noticed."
"You say that it is essential that Morocco gains investment."
"My reply is that I am in agreement with you."
"I visited to this country, and I can see that it is confronted by an enormous historic challenge, through this partnership association itself."
"It is an economy which is currently more than 40 % dependent on agriculture, a country which in twelve years time wants to see a free trade zone achieved with Europe."
"Of course they are in need of our investment, and the Community and the Presidency will do their best to make sure that the association agreement with Morocco, already signed, is ratified by all the Member States as quickly as possible."
"I would like to give you an example that struck me."
"Last week I accompanied the Prime Minister, Mr Junker, to Ukraine, within the context of a visit linked both to the European Union/Ukraine summit and to bilateral relations."
"Investment was thus one subject on the agenda."
"During the press conference, a journalist asked the two Prime Ministers if they had reached an agreement on investment."
"They had had no more than one hour to talk to each other!"
"By telling you this story what I am trying to say is that investments are vital for Morocco, of course, but let us first create - and here I am in agreement with you - the necessary conditions for political and economic stability."
"Once a favourable climate has been established, investments will be attracted to the region."
"Mr President."
"I am very grateful for what you have said."
"I should like to put just one question about that: how do you assess the situation in Morocco particularly with regard to the investments you mentioned?"
"My impression of Morocco is that it is the most stable Mahgreb country and we need it."
"Secondly, I should like to ask you how long the negotiations with Morocco will continue, in your view, and when can Morocco be brought in the negotiations to something like the position now occupied by Tunisia?"
"That is very important, because we need Morocco as the neighbour of what one can regard as the most explosive Mahgreb state, namely Algeria."
"My last question is, how do you view the chances of talking to the Parliament there?"
"This Parliament only represents a small part of the population."
"Is it not time to question also those small groups who are not represented in Parliament because they are excluded?"
"I would like to reply to the three questions from Mr von Habsburg. Firstly, by giving him my personal impression concerning Morocco."
"I visited this country at the head of a delegation of businessmen as recently as June of this year."
"I, along with many of those who accompanied me, was completely surprised by the efforts made within the context of economic and institutional reform in this country, even if it is still lagging compared to the current level of development in Tunisia."
"I believe there are solid opportunities."
"I was equally surprised to note that our delegation included around ten businesses from Luxembourg - for a small country this is a lot - who are ready to forge ahead and participate in true partnership between the two countries, a partnership that the Luxembourg government, for its part, is going to provide with the financial means to try to promote, as best it can, investment in Morocco."
"I believe the second question depends somewhat on the speed at which the parliaments of the different Member States ratify this agreement."
"It is very important for Morocco. This point was insisted upon."
"We have tried hard to get this message across, not only at the level of the Council of Ministers but equally in all the bodies of the European Union."
"This political message is that the partnership must now become effective."
"Once again, I hope that we will have done our duty within the Fifteen by the end of the year and, in my opinion, if the conditions are fulfilled, I think that in five or six years time Morocco could reach the same level as Tunisia, a country which, and this equally surprised me, has achieved an exceptional level of development for a country in this region."
"Mr von Habsburg will have to forgive me but I believe, regarding his third question, which is a completely legitimate one, that the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of this Parliament is better placed to reply to this question regarding the establishment of contact between this Parliament and members of parliamentary and other political forces in Algeria."
"Question No 2 by Felipe Camisón Asensio (H-0597/97)"
"Subject: Peripheral regions and eurotaxes"
"With regard to the 'eurotax' on road haulage within the European Union, what is the Council's view of the fact that Finland and Spain still do not enjoy the status of peripheral regions?"
"I will do my best to reply to Mr Camisón Asensio."
"First of all, the Council would not be able to foresee the results of ongoing discussions on the proposal for a directive concerning taxation of heavy goods vehicles using certain road systems. I am talking about the eurotax disc."
"The Council however would like to clarify that the dispensation regarding rights of use which figures in Directive 93/89/EEC only permits the granting of a temporary reduction in the rates of duty on usage to certain Member States disadvantaged by their weak economic development and by their particular geographical location, on occasion by political conflict in third countries."
"It is convenient at the same time to note that the idea of a peripheral region did not feature in the text of Directive 93/89/EEC - which was overruled by the Court of Justice - whose objective was, I repeat, and the honourable member knows very well, to come to the aid of certain Member States handicapped by their late development or their particular geographic location."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we had been informed in committees of this House that during the June Transport Council the Dutch Presidency was confronted by a highly confusing situation as regards this matter."
"One of the contradictions was the proposal that Ireland, Portugal and Greece should benefit temporarily from a 50 % reduction in eurotax utilization rights, because of their peripheral positions."
"Of course, we think this proposal is reasonable and fair."
"However, during the debates this benefit was denied to Finland and Spain because they were not considered to be peripheral countries. We think this is illogical."
"It seems to us unacceptable to deny the peripheral nature of a country such as Spain, when a Tarifa promontory is virtually in Africa, or Finland, which touches the North Pole."
"Let us hope the Luxembourg Presidency will find a more reasonable solution."
"I will try to give an answer that I hope will be satisfactory to the honourable gentleman."
"We have to recognize that during the session of 17 June this year, the Committee on Transport could not come to an agreement."
"The honourable Member has already recalled in part certain difficulties on which political consensus was not possible, without even considering that a unanimous vote was also required."
"I would therefore like to say the following: the Luxembourg Presidency intends to conduct bilateral relations at the highest political level in order to unblock this issue."
"It is a commitment I take on behalf of the Presidency and on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Delvaux, who is responsible for the Committee on Transport."
"But I would also add that the Presidency will not include this matter on the agenda of the Council unless the bilateral contacts have brought about a true political will to come to a solution."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 3 and 4 will be taken together."
"The Council will explain to us how two such different questions can be considered the same."
"Question No 3 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H-0599/97)"
"Subject: Right of asylum for nationals of EU Member States"
"There is a protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty containing a sole article whose purpose is to regulate and restrict the right of nationals of EU Member States to have applications for asylum considered in a Member State other than that of which they are a national."
"The practical implications of the article are disputed."
"Would it be correct to interpret paragraph (d) as allowing Member States, notwithstanding this article, to examine any application for asylum in accordance with their national practices?"
"Would it be correct to interpret the article as not in any way limiting Member States' rights individually to consider and approve applications for asylum by nationals of EU Member States?"
"Question No 4 by Ulla Sandbæk (H-0505/97)"
"Subject: The Maastricht II Treaty and the environmental guarantee"
"Implementation of the environmental guarantee (Article 100a(4)) requires the approval of the Commission."
"According to the provisional text of the new Maastricht II Treaty, the Commission will be obliged to give its views within six months."
"How far will the Member States be able to implement the environmental guarantee, and thus introduce higher environmental standards, during the six months the Commission has to confirm whether the Member State may implement the environmental guarantee?"
"It may at first seem strange, I agree, Mr President, but I will try to tell you why I hope to convince the Members of Parliament of this step."
"The Presidency proposes to reply simultaneously to the questions put by Mrs Sandbæk and Mr Sjöstedt, which both relate to the interpretation to be given to the arrangements agreed at the time of the Amsterdam Summit with regard to revision of treaties."
"In reply to these questions, I must underline that at this stage it is premature, in the opinion of the Council, to undertake an interpretation of the protocol in question."
"In this perspective, it is advisable to keep in our minds the fact that the treaty of which this protocol is a part has not only not yet come into effect, but what is more has yet to be signed, something which will take place, if I am not mistaken, on 2 October next."
"Given these conditions, the Council considers that any exegesis of texts fixed in Amsterdam would at the moment be inappropriate, all the more so given that the only institution skilled in interpreting the texts of treaties is the Court of Justice of the European Union."
"I am convinced that once the treaty has been not only signed but also ratified by the various Member States and when, in certain Member States, it will also have passed the test of a referendum, we will be able to come back to this question."
"At the moment, for the reasons I have just given, I do not wish to enter into the details and engage in a most perilous exercise."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for that reply, even though I think it is wholly unacceptable that the Council will not discuss the treaty which the European Council has just concluded."
"We are now involved in a democratic process with referendums in some Member States and parliamentary debates in others."
"It is therefore quite essential and a question of democracy to be able to know what it is that is to be decided on."
"The Council must be prepared to provide information where the treaty is unclear and ambiguous, such as with regard to the refugee question, that is, whether the right of asylum will be restricted and at the same time remain in place."
"Yesterday I discussed the same question on the right of asylum with the Commission, which was prepared to discuss this question even though it is the Council which has taken the decision."
"However, the Commission referred me to the Council and said that it was clearly the Council which should respond to this question, since it is the Council which is responsible."
"I therefore expect an answer to the question."
"At the risk of upsetting the honourable Member, I must say that if a process of ratification and referendum is underway in different countries, it would be dangerous for the Presidency, or the Council, to give interpretations that might be likely to cause misunderstandings in certain countries."
"You know very well, you have just mentioned it, that it is a democratic process in which parliaments and even, by means of referendums, populations, are called to make a political choice."
"Therefore, for the reasons I have just given, it would be completely inappropriate for the President-in-Office of the Council to engage in this exercise of interpretation at the moment."
"Consequently, I will not throw the ball back into your court, by replying that the Commission has said that you should have referred to the Council in this matter."
"Each one of the institutions has its own remit."
"Once again, it is not the intention of the Presidency-in-Office to hide anything, however, I would wish this discussion to be withheld until after ratification, which will provide the necessary elements required. But I do understand, as a former Member of Parliament, that it is sometimes very hard to receive a reply that is not satisfying."
"The reason why I have asked this question is, you see, because we are going to have a referendum in Denmark and because I shall be going out and explaining to the voters what is in the Amsterdam Treaty, and once they know, they will be able to decide how they want to vote."
"I will have to tell them that I have asked the Council, which should have an interpretation of this, since it is the Council which wrote the text, but that the Council said that it did not know what it meant by the text."
"And then I will also have to tell my constituents that they will have to buy a pig in a poke, that I cannot explain to them what the Council has written, and the Council will not explain to them what it has written; that the Council thinks they should go and vote in a referendum completely in the dark because it thinks that they should have sufficient faith in it and expect everything to be surely interpreted for the best."
"It is totally unreasonable to say that people should vote on something which you cannot even get interpreted."
"Not only do you write in a way which is incomprehensible, but you then refuse to explain it before a referendum."
"I must say that the last sentence of the honourable lady's speech pleased me much more than the first."
"She said that we were not ready to interpret the texts, whereas in the beginning she said that we were acting as if we did not know the texts."
"This is a small difference that I note in passing."
"Madam, I have complete faith in you."
"You have, of course, read the texts and are able to interpret them as well as, if not better, than I. So I am sure that, as a Member of Parliament who respects the electorate, you will interpret them appropriately."
"The electorate, I am convinced, will not be forced to buy a pig in a poke."
"Thank you very much, Mr Wohlfart."
"I think the Presidency's position has been made clear, but Mr Lindqvist would like to ask a supplementary question."
"I shall let him speak, because the rules allow me to do so, but I would remind you all that prolonging a debate which is always going to receive the same reply uses up time which is needed to answer other questions."
"Mr Lindqvist has the floor for a supplementary question."
"I have to say that I am amazed too that we cannot get any answer from the Council."
"To respond by saying that it is too early or that it is inconvenient, or that it could even be dangerous, is a very strange way to respond to questions from Members of Parliament who are going to debate these questions in their respective homelands, in some cases prior to a referendum."
"What are we to do when we get the same kinds of questions from the general public if we cannot get the smallest piece of information from the President-in-Office of the Council?"
"I am concerned to say the least."
"I believe the same can be said of many others."
"I have understood that we will not get an answer today."
"I note that that will clearly continue to be the case until the Member States have had their referendums and made their yes or no decisions in the national parliaments. That is, we will not get any information until the debates in the respective Member States are over."
"That is how I understood the answer."
"I am very concerned and unhappy about this answer from the Council."
"To go back to Mrs Sandbæk's expression concerning a cat, I see that we could spend another hour playing cat and mouse on this subject."
"But I am not going to take the place of the nationally elected Members of Parliament who, I am confident, will be able to interpret the texts as they have been agreed."
"They will also be able, as will both you and your colleague here present, to read the text and thus convince their electorate."
"Moreover, it is also out of respect for your electorate that, as President-in-Office of the Council, I do not wish to set myself up as judge and thus replace the national Members of Parliament and their different governments."
"Question No 5 by Hans Lindqvist (H-0606/97)"
"Subject: EU structural Funds"
"Agenda 2000 proposes that Objective 6 should cease to be a separate area of aid and should be incorporated within Objective 1."
"'Special arrangements' are to be made for the areas concerned."
"What are the implications for Sweden in terms of aid from the EU's structural Funds as a result of this change?"
"The work of the Council relating to the communication of the Agenda 2000 Committee, has only just begun."
"As you know, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of its meeting on 22 July this year, the Council listened to a report by the President, Mr Santer, on Agenda 2000, as well as to the Commission's opinion on countries which could be candidates for admission."
"On that occasion the Council agreed to proceed, at its next meeting, which in fact took place last Monday, to a first discussion of general orientation on the group of questions."
"It indicated in particular its agreement on the work method presented by the Presidency for the guidelines for the various dossiers."
"In accordance with the conclusions of the European Council of Amsterdam, the Council will proceed to an in-depth study of the dossiers in question and will present a detailed report to the European Council in Luxembourg next December."
"We consider that at this stage it would be premature to take any position on the question of the reform of Union structural policies, which moreover only make up one element of this package."
"Thank you for your answer."
"Sweden and Finland were given a special, new objective within the structural funds in connection with the accession negotiations, objective 6."
"It arose because the northern part of Europe where we live is very sparsely populated and had special reasons to get extra aid."
"It is now being proposed in Agenda 2000 that objective area 6 should disappear as a specific area for aid, that is, exactly what Sweden, among others, negotiated."
"It will be included in objective area 1."
"In the available documents, it is stated that special arrangements will ensure that aid is provided more or less as before, but under objective 1."
"There is now a proposal from the Swedish government, which must be connected with the EU, to turn the whole of northern Sweden into one large aid area, which would mean that what was originally the aid area for special sparsely-populated districts will find it more difficult to get money."
"There is a great deal of uncertainty and I would therefore very much like to have a somewhat clearer answer than the one I have received."
"Let me first of all say that at the first exchange of views at the General Affairs Council, the two country delegations Mr Lindqvist has just mentioned informed us in their speeches of the concerns they shared with the honourable gentleman. He has himself made allusion, in his supplementary question, to the issue of the disappearance of objective 6."
"This is the proposal of the Commission which, in its communication on Agenda 2000, in the chapter relating to economic and social cohesion, proposes, for reasons of eligibility and efficiency, to reduce the number of current objectives to three. Of these, two are regional objectives and one a horizontal objective dedicated to human resources."
"It also stated that those currently eligible under objective 6 but not under objective 1 should benefit from individual arrangements."
"For the moment the Council has not yet settled on a line of action."
"We have agreed our work method for the different aspects connected with Agenda 2000, which consists of doing the spadework on the different problems which are being raised in the different spheres, notably that of structural funds."
"It will then be proposed that, at the highest ministerial level in the different Councils which are in charge of preparing the Luxembourg Summit - Ecofin and others - the wishes of the various Member States should as far as possible be taken into account. At the same time it is understood that an orientation is emerging, which for the moment seems to me quite clear, by which a large majority of Member States would not want to go beyond the 1.27 % finance ceiling which was fixed up until 2006."
"But many other questions merit a response and the Presidency is in the process of getting down to this task."
"It is also the objective of the different informal Councils which, as you know Mr Lindqvist, often move things on substantially."
"In any case we are going to get on with the work of seeking a consensus at the level of the Fifteen."
"As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 6 and 7 fall."
"Question No 8 by Mr Imaz San Miguel has been withdrawn."
"Question No 9 by Hugh McMahon (H-0614/97)"
"Subject: Philoxenia 1997-2000 (European tourism)"
"Does the Luxembourg Presidency intend to pursue the adoption of the Philoxenia programme designed to assist European tourism during its term in office?"
"Concerning the adoption of a programme aimed at promoting European tourism, the work group of the Council which was set up for this reason, will recommence its work as from tomorrow."
"The objective sought is precisely to derive an agreement on the content of this programme before the end of December 1997, in other words this year, and the Presidency proposes to present as the basis for work a document which will take into account the discussions held up until now at the level of the Council."
"Once this agreement has been reached, the Presidency envisages calling a meeting of the Council dedicated to tourism in order to proceed to the adoption of a programme on this subject and to establish definitively the actions to be promoted in the tourism sector."
"These actions should mainly be aimed at objectives which have gained sufficient support within the Council, such as the development of information and the co-operation of the involved actors."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for a very full answer."
"Perhaps he would clarify one point for me."
"Would the conference which is to be held take place during the Luxembourg presidency or the British presidency?"
"I will try, but Mr McMahon is a specialist with regard to Question Time."
"I will say to the honourable Member that that depends not only on the Presidency but also on the will of certain Member States who, up until now, have been very respectful regarding the principle of subsidiarity."
"So, either the Luxembourg Presidency will handle it, if a political agreement is found, or it will be necessary to put your confidence in the British Presidency to resolve the problem."
"The following questions and answers are going to take even less time because Mr Sören Wibe, the author of Question No 10, is not present and nor Mr Watson, the author of Question No 11."
"I cannot see Mr Alavanos, the author of Question No 12."
"So the next question is No 13."
"But I see that Mr Wibe has just arrived."
"Mr Wohlfart, if you do not mind, I suggest you answer Mrs Jensen first, since she was already here, and then we will go back to Mr Wibe's question, since he has now arrived."
"Question No 13 by Kirsten Jensen (H-0635/97)"
"Subject: The situation in Burma"
"What political conclusions does the Council intend to draw from Burma's admittance to ASEAN?"
"."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my answer to the question raised by the honourable Member of Parliament will be a little longer than that which I have just given."
"Regarding the political consequences that the Council envisages in the admission of Burma to ASEAN, I can indicate to honourable Members that at the General Affairs Council on 26 June last, the following conclusions were drawn, which I think everyone already knows."
"The Council has examined the effect on the European Union of the membership of certain countries, notably Burma, in ASEAN."
"It has underlined that the deterioration of the situation with regard to human rights in Burma is the subject of grave concern for the European Union."
"On several occasions the European Union has expressed its concern in the face of events in Burma and recently, on 30th May, the anniversary of the 1990 elections, the European Union adopted a statement inviting the State Law and Order Restoration Council, more commonly known as SLORC, to mark this occasion by freeing those people detained and to commence a true dialogue with groups in favour of democracy."
"Furthermore, the Council requested SLORC to accept a visit from the United Nations special rapporteur in the near future."
"Furthermore, the Council underlined the importance it gave to the strengthening and deepening of EU-ASEAN relations, in accordance with the conclusions of the ministerial meeting between the European Union and ASEAN countries, held in Singapore in February 1997."
"The Council confirmed the EU's attachment to EU-ASEAN dialogue, in particular on human rights and democratic principles."
"It hopes that joining ASEAN will contribute to the promotion of these fundamental values in Burma."
"It considers that EU-ASEAN dialogue should be an occasion for examining the situation in this country."
"Given that the current circumstances, which have led the European Union to extend its common position for a new 6 month period, prevent the commencement of negotiations on the possible membership of Burma to the ECASEAN cooperation agreement, the Council considers that Burma's presence at ministerial meetings within the framework of the ASEAN post-ministerial conference and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARFPMC) does not automatically mean it will participate as an observer at the next EU-ASEAN Joint Cooperation Committee which will be held in November 1997 and other meetings within the EU-ASEAN institutional framework."
"The Council has reaffirmed that Burma's membership of ASEAN does not automatically imply that it will become a member of the Asia-Europe Meeting, that is ASEM."
"Concerning the possible adoption of new measures against Burma, the Council has agreed to return to this question shortly and to examine it according to the results of ministerial meetings, ASEAN (Regional Forum post ministerial meeting) and how the situation evolves."
"This is the position that has been communicated by Mr Poos, President of the Council of the European Union, to ASEAN on the occasion of ASEAN's post-ministerial conference which was held in Kuala Lumpur on 28 July last."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for that excellent answer, but I have just a few things I would like to ask him about."
"Are there positive signs in this critical dialogue?"
"How are our trade relations with the area developing?"
"Are we not, in fact, politically in a situation like the one in connection with South Africa when apartheid existed, when, fortunately, Europe realised, if a little late, that continuous strong pressure should be brought to bear to change the conditions in the country."
"It is human rights that are under attack."
"It is democracy that is under attack."
"And, as you know, this Parliament is very concerned about the situation of the elected representatives in Burma."
"I believe that you used terms like ""call on' , ' demand an answer' and so on."
"That is perhaps a little too diplomatic given the seriousness of the situation."
"You must excuse me, Mrs Jensen, if I have been too diplomatic."
"Normally in Luxembourg I do not have the reputation of a great diplomat because I always have a tendency to, shall we say, say what I think."
"So, I will be brief in replying to your questions."
"Unfortunately, concerning progress in the area of human rights in Burma itself, I think there has been very little."
"Moreover, I would be happy, Madam, for you to put your question to the Commission regarding trade."
"I am not able to give you the figures that you are interested in."
"It is not that I do not want to, but the truth is I cannot."
"To come to your question concerning South Africa, on the subject of increased pressure, I think I can say from a personal point of view that the policy of the carrot and the stick, as it was called in 1990/91, has born fruit."
"Even if in the beginning it was hotly disputed by our ACP friends - I remember a ministerial meeting where this policy was disputed - I believe that in the end it bore fruit."
"I hope it will be the same for a country which is close to your heart."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to interpret the Rules generously and invite the President-in-Office of the Council to reply to Question 10, although this means going back a little bit."
"This is the question by Mr Sören Wibe, who is now with us."
"I invite you to reply to his question, if that is possible."
"Question No 10 by Sören Wibe (H-0618/97)"
"Subject: Development of democracy in Europe"
"On paper all the countries in Europe are now democracies, which is totally unique in historical perspective."
"However, there are differences of degree in terms of functioning democracies, democratic freedoms and rights, rule of law etc. and, if they are scrutinized more closely, some countries reveal major shortcomings."
"The countries with the most significant shortcomings at present are Croatia and Belarus."
"Although their presidents were elected democratically, control over TV and radio was such that only one message -the incumbent president's - came across to voters."
"Voters were not even schooled in the implications of democracy."
"They have lived all their lives under authoritarian rule and do not know their rights or how to conduct themselves to question political messages."
"The question is what can be done to put pressure on those regimes in Europe which rule their countries in authoritarian fashion and through tight control of the media."
"Has the Council discussed diplomatic protests and economic isolation of countries such as Croatia and Bailers, which do not respect the fundamental democratic freedoms and rights that must prevail in a democratic Europe?"
"."
"(FR) Please be assured, ladies and gentlemen, as to the flexibility of the President-in-Office of the Council with regard to the procedure proposed by the President."
"In fact, the question is extremely important and I have a great deal of sympathy with overworked Members of Parliament."
"I was one myself a few years ago. This is why I yield willingly to this exercise."
"Concerning the problems raised by Mr Sören Wibe, I believe that a question on the development of democracy in Europe is worthy of an appropriate response from the Council."
"First of all, I would like to assure Mr Wibe concerning respect for democracy and human rights, which are always at the heart of the fundamental principles which the European Union defends and to which the Council gives special attention."
"In the two cases mentioned, Bailers and Croatia, as in other countries where values are under threat, the Council is endeavouring, with vigilance and determination, to exercise its influence with the aim of promoting democratic values as far as is possible."
"I would like to draw up an appraisal with regard to Bailers."
"The Council is following the development of the situation in the Republic of Bailers with acute concern and is actively endeavouring to put pressure on the authorities of that country so that they re-establish full respect for the democratic practices and principles that are accepted at an international level, along with freedom of the press."
"A European Union survey mission, led by a former Dutch Minister of Justice, was sent to Bailers in January of this year in order to investigate the legality of the 1996 constitutional referendums, to evaluate how far the principle of the separation of powers is respected and to establish whether the opposition or the media were the subjects of harassment."
"The mission noted serious constitutional and political dysfunctions in Bailers."
"Given the conclusions of the mission, in February of this year the Council defined the global approach within which future relations between the European Union and Bailers would be framed."
"Moreover, in April, the Council adopted a critical position and reminded Bailers that cooperation between the European Union and that country could not continue without a convincing effort on the part of Bailers to put in place a political system which is in accordance with accepted international norms."
"Furthermore, the Council urged the Bailers authorities to respect its commitment to initiate talks with the thirteenth Supreme Soviet, elected with the aim of establishing a true separation of powers and of commencing a dialogue within a tripartite work group which is made up of representatives of the Bailers government, of the thirteenth Supreme Soviet and of experts from the European Union, the Council of Europe and the CSCE."
"The Council of 15 September, that is last Monday, were forced to note that no progress had been made over the last months in the area of political and economic reforms in Bailers and that the political and constitutional situation, along with continual violations of human rights and fundamental liberties, in particular freedom of the press, was still very worrying."
"Consequently, The Council decided to take the following measures."
"Firstly, suspension of Union participation in the tripartite work group."
"Secondly, refusal to support the membership of Bailers in the Council of Europe."
"Thirdly, refusal to conclude the interim agreement and the partnership and cooperation agreement."
"Fourthly, restrictions on bilateral ministerial contact."
"Fifthly, a freeze on technical assistance programmes from the Community and Member States with the exception of humanitarian and regional projects and those which directly support the process of democratization."
"With regard to Croatia, in April of this year the Council adopted various conclusions relating to the implementation of conditionality with a view to developing a coherent strategy on the part of the European Union to be applied to relations with those south-east European countries not linked to the European Union by an association agreement, in this instance Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania."
"In order to consolidate peace and stability in the region and to contribute to its economic revival, the European Union aims to develop bilateral relations with the countries of this region, in a context which favours democracy, rule of law, the establishment of stricter standards with regard to human rights and minority rights, movement towards a market economy and the strengthening of co-operation between these countries."
"In an annexe to the conclusions the Council included a number factors by which the level of respect for the conditions relating to democratic principles, human rights, rule of law, respect and protection of minorities and movement towards a market economy could be scrutinised."
"The Council explicitly included freedom of expression, including the media, separately in the list."
"I can assure you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that the European Union is very closely following, and evaluating regularly, the progress made in the countries of this region, including Croatia, in terms of satisfying the demands of conditionality."
"As these countries were reminded by the Council at the time of the session of 16 and 17 June in Amsterdam, rigorous respect for human rights and the rights of minorities in all countries, including repatriation of displaced people and refugees, remains an essential condition in the improvement of relations between the European Union and Croatia."
"The progressive implementation of the conditions specified in the conclusions of 29 April will enable a progressive strengthening of relations, provided of course that there is a political and economic evaluation, global and permanent, through which each country, including Croatia, will be judged on an individual basis."
"Furthermore, the European Union continues to ask Croatia, and other countries in the region, to respect fundamental democratic rights and liberties which, according to us, must prevail in European democracies."
"I would firstly like to say thank you for the generosity which has been shown to me."
"Even though I arrived late, I have had both an answer and a chance to reply."
"I would also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his answer which I thought was very exhaustive."
"As far as the plans for Bailers are concerned, I am not actually acquainted with the details."
"It is clear that we have also shown our economic muscle there to put pressure on the regime."
"I believe in fact that that is the language which Bailers's leaders understand."
"However, there was one thing I could not understand from your answer, so I have a small follow-up question: have we any means of putting economic pressure on the regime in Croatia?"
"Within this global context, I think I have underlined on two or three occasions the concept of conditionality."
"I have also emphasized the fact that the countries of southern Europe which are not linked to the Union by an association agreement, notably Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, would now be submitted to this conditionality, which naturally also implies the area of economic relations."
"Mr President."
"Croatia is a young democracy that is also suffering from the aftermath of a war."
"There is certainly much there to be improved, but I think it is inadmissible to lump it in with Byelorussia, a dictatorship."
"I should like mainly to say at this point that the President of the Council has rightly drawn attention to the human and minority rights - I am myself a great supporter of minority rights - but he has done this on a day when one of the largest Member States of the European Union has declared that it would not ratify the Minorities Convention of the Council of Europe."
"We must watch out that we do not fall into an ambiguous situation here and apply double standards."
"I believe it is above all important that we soon give Croatia associate status - I was the rapporteur for the association agreement with Slovenia."
"Even the Slovenes, who had a period of tension with Croatia, have said that it would be in their own interests for Croatia to be bound to the EU."
"Briefly I will say that I entirely share the approach of the honourable Member in making a distinction, which also exists in the eyes of the Council, between Bailers and Croatia."
"I think we are agreed on this."
"Thank you, Mr Wohlfart."
"As the author is not present, Question No 11 falls."
"Mr Wohlfart, you and I between us have created a precedent, which is a dangerous thing to do."
"As it turns out, Mr Alavanos, the author of Question No 12, is now with us. Chronologically and from a strict interpretation of the Rules, this question should have fallen."
"But, given that we have made one exception, I propose that we make a second one, and I beg you to be kind enough to reply to the question."
"Question No 12 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0632/97)"
"Subject: Joint Declaration by Turkey and the 'TRNC'"
"On 19 July 1997 Turkey and the self-styled ""Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' (TRNC) signed a joint declaration which contains the following provisions:"
"""At any international conference concerning Cyprus, Turkish delegations shall include ""TRNC' representatives."
"For this purpose a framework agreement shall be concluded between these two ""states' together with a cooperation protocol of the ""foreign ministers' ."
"In order to prevent the economy of the ""TRNC' being affected by unjust embargoes, economic and financial union shall be established between Turkey and the ""TRNC' ."
"Will the Council say whether it will receive any delegation from Turkey which declares that it includes representatives of the ""TRNC' , if and when it is asked to do so?"
"What does it intend to do to ensure that the ban on imports of goods from the occupied part of Cyprus to the Community market continues?"
"Since we share responsibility for this procedure, I will do the same with regard to Mr Alavanos' question."
"Firstly, on the subject of the Cypriot question, the Union is pursuing two objectives which are both clear and distinct."
"On the one hand it is involved in the Cypriot question in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council aiming for a bi-zonal federation with community aim and, on the other hand, it is working towards the membership of Cyprus in the European Union."
"For its part, the Presidency remains determined to contribute significantly to the search for a solution to the Cypriot question."
"I would like to note to the honourable Member that the Presidency recently made a visit to Athens and Ankara at the end of August."
"The Presidency's representative for Cyprus will closely follow the daily development of the situation."
"In this context, allow me, Mr President, to strongly assert that the European Union only recognises one government, that of the Republic of Cyprus, naturally."
"With regard to exchanges with the northern part of Cyprus, let me remind you of the ruling of the European Court of Justice on 5 July 1994 confirming that certificates coming from the north of Cyprus cannot be accepted."
"In view of the realization of a customs union with Turkey, the Council and the Commission are committed to showing vigilance in order to avoid any misappropriation of trade or other violation of community benefits, including recourse to the case law of the Court to which I have just referred, which would result from the prevailing situation in the northern part of Cyprus."
"The effective implementation of the Association Council agreement, signed between the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs and the self-proclaimed authorities of northern Cyprus on 7 August last, means that the situation would need to be seriously reconsidered and would have, in any case, more general political implications as I have just explained."
"Mr President, I would like to thank you for having created a precedent and for having thus enabled my question to be debated, and for the wisdom you and the President-in-Office have shown when tackling this issue."
"I would also like to thank the President-in-Office for the full and very positive answer that he gave to my question."
"I would like to take this opportunity to bring up a wholly related issue, more specifically the fact that last week Ankara decided not to allow ships flying the Cypriot flag, flying the flag of the Republic of Cyprus, to enter its ports."
"That is to say ships, flying the flag of the Republic of Cyprus, the flag of a country associated with the European Union, of a country which is in the process of acceding to the European Union, have been prohibited from approaching Turkish ports since last week."
"Up until a few days ago they had been approaching Turkish ports. Do you think that this action is in keeping with the spirit of the customs union and with the spirit of respect for the basic principles that govern it?"
"Provided more information is obtained by the appropriate departments, if what we have just been told turns out to be correct, this would be completely unacceptable."
"Question No 14 by Christine Oddy (H-0638/97)"
"Subject: Sri Lankan assassination"
"Is the Council aware of the assassination of Mr A. Thanqathurai, Member of Parliament in Sri Lanka and a leading official of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), an organization committed to non-violence in politics?"
"What moves will the Council take to press for a peaceful solution to the escalation of violence in Sri Lanka?"
"As President-in-Office of the Council I take note of the constant interest of the honourable Member regarding the situation in Sri Lanka, especially with regard to the respect, or rather lack of respect, for human rights."
"However, the Council was not aware of the tragic and deplorable events which the honourable Member mentions in her question."
"Concerning the position of the European Union on the situation of civil war in Sri Lanka, the honourable Member could usefully refer to the replies to questions that she herself raised during the sessions of last May and July."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his kind remarks and concern."
"However, the situation is not getting any better."
"There are atrocities on both side all the time and the civilian population is being squeezed."
"Would the President-in-Office use his good offices to try to facilitate some kind of high level political peace process, perhaps using the offices of Mary Robinson who is now human rights representative for the United Nations?"
"Following the reply to Mrs Oddy's question I have just noticed that nearly all of the issues tackled today, whether at the level of statements, or through questions that are put to me for reply, deal with violence, terrorism and non-respect of human rights."
"I find this most distressing."
"Concerning Mrs Oddy's proposal to consider the possibility of putting Mary Robinson in charge of a special mission aimed at promoting a rapprochement between the two sides and to put an end to the conflict which is raging in the country, I am completely open to this proposal."
"I will, moreover, be meeting Mrs Robinson in my role as President-inOffice of the Council during the annual session of the United Nations in New York."
"This will be one of the subjects of the meeting."
"Thank you for your proposal."
"Question No 15 by Richard Howitt (H-0646/97)"
"Subject: Regional representation at meetings"
"Can the Council specify on how many occasions and on which issues regional levels of government have been represented at Council meetings rather than central government since the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty?"
"Given the current moves in the UK towards devolution for Scotland and Wales and also the proposed establishment of regional chambers in England, can the Council confirm that it welcomes participation at its official meetings by representatives from the regions instead of those from central government?"
"My reply is the following. Without prejudice to article 146, first paragraph of the EC treaty which foresees that the Council is made up of one representative at ministerial level from each Member State, if there is a minister who is skilled at advising the government of his state and the rules relating to quorum are met which, as you know, demand the minimum presence of the Council to be able to proceed to a vote, then it is for each member of the Council to make up his delegation in the way which seems most appropriate to him."
"Consequently, on a ministerial level, article 146 stipulates that a Member State can be represented by a regional minister, provided of course that he is skilled at advising the government of the Member State in question."
"I do not think I listed as much a detail in that answer as perhaps I hoped for when I first put the question."
"We know of course that both the Belgian and German members of the European Union have at the very least put forward ministers from regional government from within their own country at Council meetings."
"An exercise should perhaps be conducted in order to enumerate the number of occasions that is taking place with those Member States or with others to demonstrate that regional government can play a role in the European to bring our decisions closer to the citizen and to improve our decision-making."
"In the context of that and of my question, which I notice the President-in-Office did not refer to, would he now welcome the decision which has now taken place in Scotland through the referendum to support a Scottish Parliament?"
"There will be a referendum in Wales tomorrow when the people will have a chance to decide to set up their own Assembly."
"Will he join me in welcoming that and will he agree with me that this demonstrates that countries and regions of the UK are finally taking their places in a Europe of the regions?"
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his very full answer."
"As the only Scottish Member present and one who voted the double Yes in the referendum last week, I should like to say that we are particularly interested, in particular as it concerns one area which he did not mention, namely fishing."
"Three-quarters of the United Kingdom's catch is landed in Scotland."
"Fishing is one of the powers which will be devolved to a Scottish Parliament."
"So the situation will be that in agriculture and fishing the powers will be devolved from the national parliament to the Scottish Parliament."
"So what would the President-in-Office think about a Scottish fisheries minister - who would not necessarily be of the same party as the UK Government - going to Fisheries and Agriculture Councils?"
"Thank you very much, Mr McMahon."
"Mr Wohlfart may now reply to Mr McMahon's question, if he would like to do so."
"What an interesting question!"
"I must admit that I am not a fisherman, but I think that the question goes further than fishing for pleasure."
"If an arrangement exists between the national government and the future regional government, why not?"
"If there is a transfer of power in favour of our future Scottish colleague who will be in charge of fishing, there will not be a problem, even if he belongs to a different party from the prime minister."
"I do not know."
"Anyway, it is the rules of democracy that will apply."
"Question No 16 by Bernd Posselt (H-0648/97)"
"Subject: The Czech Republic's accession to the EU"
"Despite its Europe Agreement and efforts to accede to the EU, the Czech Republic intends to continue preventing foreigners, including EU citizens, from acquiring real estate and also to exclude EU citizens from the privatization of agricultural property."
"How does the Council Presidency view this, especially as different conditions have been imposed on Slovenia in the association agreement, and how does this attitude fit in with the pre-accession strategy?"
"The honourable Member's questions regarding the possibility of foreigners acquiring property and agricultural land in the Czech Republic have been dealt with during the negotiations aimed at concluding a European association agreement with this country."
"At the request of the Czechs, the Community had accepted the inclusion, in the chapter devoted to the right of establishment (article 45 and following), a certain number of exceptions to the general principle of treatment of nationals that the Czech Republic must grant to Community companies and nationals."
"Thus the possession, use, sale and rent of property will form part of the dispensations of annexe 16b granted to the Czech Republic until the end of the transition period and the implementation of the agreement."
"As far as the purchase and sale of agricultural land and forest is concerned, it figures amongst the dispensations of annexe 16c, which are permanent in character."
"It should be noted, moreover, that similar clauses figure in the European agreements concluded with other eastern and central European countries."
"In as far as prospects for the membership of the Czech Republic to the Union are concerned, the necessary decisions on the whole of the enlargement process will be taken, according to the conclusions of the Amsterdam Summit, by the Luxembourg European Council next December, on the basis of a detailed report by the General Affairs Council on the recommendations regarding requests for membership, as well as on the basis of Agenda 2000."
"The Council notes the honourable Member's remarks and will make sure they are taken into account during the process of negotiation of new members."
"Thank you, Mr President, for the very precise answer."
"I just want to say that in Slovenia a special regulation has been passed with the association agreement, and I believe that a regulation mentioned during the accession negotiations can hardly take second place to the association of Slovenia."
"One should not operate with two sets of laws here."
"That was the first point I wished to mention."
"The other is the specific question of whether one or more Member States had mentioned this point in the Council, or if that will happen only in Luxemburg."
"With regard to Slovenia, a different solution has been applied."
"Secondly, concerning the Czech Republic and other countries which have signed association agreements, the Council's opinion is that the problems are similar but that they appear in different contexts."
"Consequently, they call for different solutions with regard to content."
"I think this is my first element of appraisal."
"With regard to the question of whether I know if other delegations have already brought up the problem that you mention in your supplementary question within the General Affairs Council, I must admit that I do not attend all of the General Affairs Councils."
"Nevertheless, as far as I know, the problem has not yet been raised."
"As the author is not present, Question No 17 falls."
"Question No 18 by Bertel Haarder (H-0658/97)"
"Subject: Fraud in connection with the EU's financial interests"
"The Member States are required to provide information about irregularities in connection with the administration of the EU's financial interests and it is their responsibility entirely to recover unduly paid sums."
"Experience shows, however, that the Member States are not fulfilling their obligation to recover such sums."
"How does the Council explain the fact that only one third of the sums involved in fraud cases prior to 1993 have so far been returned to the EU and is this not in contempt of Article 209a of the Treaty?"
"Will the Council ensure that there are no impediments to prevent the Commission using every means available to recover the sums owed?"
"The situation we are in is quite ludicrous."
"The Council has again and again spoken of how we should combat fraud in the Union, and then it transpires that nearly all the States do not help to combat fraud and that they do not help to pay back to the Union the money which has been wrongfully paid out."
"I am asking the question because I know that Commissioner Anita Gradin feels very isolated in this matter."
"She does not feel that she gets help from the Council and so I would like to ask you, Mr Wohlfart: will you promise to take the matter up at some time or other during the Luxembourg Presidency, to speak sternly to the Ministers, and to ask them to go home and get the money paid back to the Union which they owe."
"That is the least one can ask if one wants to talk at all about combatting fraud."
"Mr Haarder somewhat overestimates my ministerial capacities for tax recovery."
"Nevertheless, I will endeavour to satisfy him as regards the Council's intentions because it is a question which I believe is of interest not only to the European Parliament and the Commission but also to our taxpayers."
"I would first of all like to refer to the conclusions passed by the Ecofin Council."
"I have the document with me, and I can assure Mr Haarder that it contains the elements which should, in part, satisfy him."
"But as time is pressing, I am not going to read it now."
"However, I can hand it over to Mr Haarder whilst reminding him that our Luxembourg Prime Minister, Mr JeanClaude Juncker, is also Minister of Finance."
"I know him and he will not hesitate to make the problem of fraud recovery one of his main themes, especially as he has just put a Luxembourg Member of Parliament in charge of drawing up an exhaustive report on tax fraud in our country."
"Question No 19 by Concepció Ferrer (H-0670/97)"
"Subject: Respect for social standards"
"The Dutch Social Affairs and Labour Minister, Ad Melkert, suggested that the EU Social Affairs and Labour Ministers might hold a meeting with their Asian counterparts in Geneva two days before the June Council meeting, with a view to discussing the question of respect for social standards and the extension of WTO control procedures in accordance with the Singapore agreements."
"Did this meeting take place? If so, what was the outcome?"
"I can inform the honourable Member that in his capacity as President of the Employment and Social Affairs Council, Minister Ad Melkert did indeed meet representatives of certain Asian countries on the fringes of the ILO conference in Geneva on 10 June 1997."
"The main theme of the exchange of views that took place on this occasion was that of respect for international work standards."
"Mr Melkert reported on these discussions to his colleagues during the Council of 27 June and underlined the usefulness of such contacts."
"It was agreed that such meetings should be pursued in the future."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your answer."
"Bearing in mind that this Parliament still considers (as it has always done) that it is important to comply with the minimal social guidelines recommended by the International Labour Organization, and insofar as these social guidelines are linked to respect for fundamental rights, the freedom to form trade unions, and the abolition of compulsory and child labour, I would beg that we should encourage this discussion. We should not be satisfied simply with information and exchanges of opinion, but a decided effort should really be made."
"We need to do this in order to adhere to one of our basic objectives, which is to encourage respect for human rights and defend the European social model. Nor should we forget to defend the jobs of many of our workers, because this is the reason - one of the reasons - for the delocalization of our companies."
"As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 20 and 21 lapse."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.00 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Green paper on commerce"
"The next item is the report (A4-0254/97) by Mr Garosci, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the Commission's Green Paper on commerce (COM(96)0530-C40646/96)"
"Mr President, I have an evening all to myself - or rather, all for commerce - and I think it deserves this special sitting devoted to the distribution system and the Commission's Green Paper."
"The Green Paper on commerce was in fact completed at the end of 1996 after almost two years of preparation."
"It is an important document, for two reasons especially: it is the first comprehensive text by the European institutions on a sector which has always been underestimated historically and poorly understood in all its forms, a sector which has given and can give much to the economy and society, and which deserved to have its substance and potential tackled and analysed earlier."
"A few figures suffice to remind us of the value of commerce."
"It is the second largest provider of jobs in the European Union, with 4.5 million commercial business, one third of all European businesses, 95 per cent of which have less than 10 employees, 22 million direct jobs, 16 per cent of the European workforce, 55 per cent of employees in the retail sector are women, 3.4 million retail businesses employ 15 million people, 1.1 million wholesale businesses with 7 million jobs, and 13 per cent of the value added of the European economy."
"The Green Paper is the result of the political and executive attention paid to commerce since 1994, with greater involvement of the Community institutions, which had previously been more concerned with other economic sectors and larger companies, certainly not concentrating on commerce and small and medium-sized firms."
"Commerce is actually more concentrated in small and medium-sized firms and it is thanks to the growing attention and commitment of DG XXIII that a document has finally been produced which both analyses and evaluates the substance and the opportunities for the second most important economic sector in the European Union."
"Precisely because of its responsibilities (commerce, tourism, small and medium-sized businesses), DG XXIII needs to be strengthened, just as the sectors it deals with are being strengthened, to maintain increasingly continuous contact with the indispensable consultative structures which represent commerce - the Economic and Social Committee, the Commerce and Distribution Committee - and also to be in a position to expand its own number of participants in order to allow every state and every commercial formula to be represented in Europe in this highly important sector for the economic and social future."
"It is an indisputable fact that few other sectors are as valuable to society as commerce."
"Historically the community has always congregated in the cafés and shops, and there is still an extraordinary vitality in historic centres and commercial centres today."
"Hence the need, recognized in the Green Paper, to monitor and devote attention and resources to all the various forms of commercial distribution"
"In the last analysis, it will be up to consumers to choose their own sales outlets from amongst the various opportunities that the market offers: small, medium-sized or large, specialist or multi-specialized, traditional or selfservice, local shops or out-of-town shopping centres."
"Their choices derive from their differing social composition: young, old, families, singles, etcetera."
"I will rapidly list the sectors commerce is involved in and for which commerce should speak up for itself."
"I am thinking of the association between commercial operators, medium-sized and small in particular, of a better relationship between wholesale and retail, of the way the branded goods industry operates, of the general role of industrial and agricultural production, of the synergy with tourism and services, of the developing technology, of the spread of electronic commerce, of the international context and the importance of trading companies, of the recovery of historic centres with more appropriate town planning, of environmental protection - also through more efficient packaging and logistics systems - of direct sales, of fair and reliable commerce, of the growth in new and modern forms of commercial, franchising, mail order sales and so on."
"With the Green Paper on commerce all the public and private institutions and the direct players in the market, large and small, were invited to take part in discussion to lead, within two years, to the completion of a final white paper."
"The governments of the Member States, in their different ways, and naturally upholding the principle of subsidiarity, must be the first to adopt the suggestions of the Green Paper to standardize, where possible, and set up a comprehensive programme for their country's commercial system."
"If the economic and social changes already in progress are not enough, tomorrow, or at the latest the day after tomorrow, they must begin to think in terms of the single European currency, an instrument which will be successful only if it is fully taken up and supported in time in the commercial universe."
"The European citizen and consumer will not discover the Euro at the bank, but rather in the shops, the supermarkets, the travel agencies, the restaurants, and wherever there is a businessman, an office worker, a cashier able to explain the way the single currency works."
"And to the extent that they can shorten the time it takes to understand the Euro, the costs of introduction will be less, because they absolutely cannot fall on the shoulders of the final consumer."
"It is for the consumer, after all, that millions of businessmen and their assistants devote every possible effort every day, bringing their products and services ever closer to a changing market."
"Mr Garosci, I respected your hard work and I allowed you to greatly exceed your time, as we have the opportunity to do that today, but I would not wish to exaggerate."
"Mr President, the scope of the sector has already been described and I am not going to repeat it."
"But there are few sectors that are as dynamic as the commercial sector and I would take as an example the development in the field of electronic trade."
"In the United States developments are occurring quicker than in Europe."
"However, the first shifts and particularly in the record and book trade have already been observed."
"In electronic trade there is also a new payment system which must obtain the confidence of both the consumer and the entrepreneur in order to be a success, and without that confidence the entrepreneur will not invest."
"Perhaps the Commission can chip in and give that confidence a basis."
"With commercial distribution we are talking about a sector full of contrasts."
"There are large chains of department stores, there are chains of retail stores, there are franchise chains and self-employed entrepreneurs who keep going through outstanding quality and specialities and which sometimes join forces, for example in purchasing cooperatives."
"But these same self-employed entrepreneurs have to deal with gigantic changes in payment systems such as the euro and the electronic purse."
"The sector must comply with the most complex legislation in the world in the areas of, among other things, food hygiene, the environment and above all competition together with our national cartel opponents."
"We are making cooperation between the last self-employed entrepreneurs as difficult as possible."
"Administrative and tax obligations, just think, for example, of VAT, have become almost unbearable."
"Everyone acknowledges that a new VAT system would be very helpful to this sector."
"Can the Commissioner say whether progress has been made with regard to the problems with the Member States in this field, that up to now have prevented the introduction of the new system?"
"There are quite a few of them."
"Up to now there has not been a European vision of what is happening in the market and of the greatly changing market position in the field, where producers and the distribution sector itself, in a reaction to each other, join forces in constantly changing ""coalitions' in order to maintain their mutual positions in the negotiations on prices, quality and shelf space in the supermarkets for their brands."
"Moreover, with regard to this position of power, and I would draw the Commissioner's attention to this, I think that, for example, in a country such as the Netherlands, some chains still remain."
"So you see that the free competition in the end again results in monopolies, which can never have been the intention."
"With the euro everyone can get involved."
"But this sector should be given a due amount of attention."
"The distribution sector will be the natural place where the Euro will be brought into circulation, where the old currency will be withdrawn and where very many adjustments will have to be made without it being a matter of a working off effect such as with import and export companies, whereby the costs to commerce are disproportionate."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commission to urge the Member States from 1999 to make possible tax reserves and extended rebates."
"Subsidies are too bureaucratic: there won't be a penny for the risk-bearing entrepreneur."
"I don't believe in subsidies."
"There is also a large social claim on the distribution sector."
"Christa Randzio-Plath has already spoken about this."
"You see vast rural areas and empty areas of town lose their quality of life through ageing and dereliction, decay and a sense of insecurity."
"The economic basis for the sector is therefore lost."
"Greatly changing consumer preferences do the rest."
"Elderly people and young families bear the consequences."
"But perhaps the new forms of distribution, such as electronic trade, will bring a solution."
"Reviewing all of this and assessing the pressure to which the self-employed entrepreneur is exposed, I feel most strongly that the Commission pays far too little attention to such an important dynamic sector."
"It took years before the Commission even wanted to talk to this sector."
"And the sector is constantly informed, in accordance with the Commission's conditions, in a consultation procedure set up by the Commission, the CCD."
"And that was fine when the sector was still in its infancy from the European point of view. But the sector has now grown up."
"I would say to the Commission, treat this sector as an adult, treat it as it is."
"And the Commission must also adjust its own house in order to be able to serve and guide this important sector, that is going to function in an increasingly European way."
"That means that changes should be made to DG XXIII."
"Mr President, firstly on behalf of my group I should like to stress the importance of our colleague Riccardo Garosci's report, which we support unreservedly."
"I should also like to say how pleased we are that the Commission has become increasingly willing to give more attention to the commercial sector, as shown by the production of this Green Paper on commerce."
"The report being considered today stresses the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the commercial sector within the European Union's economies."
"The process of intense change which our economies have undergone, and the development of all developed economies obviously mean that the service sector is increasingly important, and commerce plays a key role in this."
"We are well aware of this. In my country, Catalonia, we have a slogan that ""trade is life' because it is a motive force which drives economic activity."
"Obviously, it is the most important outlet for manufacturing activity, which is also a very important basic element of our economies."
"Furthermore, as shown in this Green Paper and emphasized in Mr Garosci's report, commerce has very important social effects in the area of employment and the promotion of private enterprise, which normally starts at SME level."
"As Mrs Peijs said, it is a factor in the regeneration of both rural and urban areas."
"I had ten points prepared to comment on, but since there is not enough time to mention them all, I shall summarize them basically in three. Firstly, commerce has positive effects within modern society and in the development of economies similar to our own European, developed models; secondly, we must help the commercial sector to adapt to a very intense and dynamic transformation (and action from the European Commission is essential on this point); and thirdly, European Union programmes, especially the application of the structural funds, must be adapted to the capabilities of the commercial sector."
"Since I do not want to take advantage of the President's patience, I have condensed my ten prepared comments into those three basic points."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I find aspects of this report very important and I am very glad to be able to underline that."
"First of all, the report draws attention to the importance of commerce as a network of social relationships which should be incorporated into a global view of economic relationships which takes account of the productive, regional, environmental and social angles."
"And in this perspective, I would like to stress the significance of the role of local commerce in economic and social cohesion, and state my agreement with the provision of point 18, especially as regards information for those concerned, however long or short their experience of the meanderings of access to Community funds which might benefit them and which are essential if the weakest links in an indispensable network are to resist the dynamic of the competitive steamroller."
"So I also applaud the restatement of the cultural function of commerce, at point 45, which I believe should be even more closely linked to the role of local commerce in economic and social cohesion, because nothing has done more damage to cultural characteristics as the out-of -town shopping centres, all trying to be the biggest in the town, the region, the country, the peninsula, Europe, the world."
"And to be so big, so huge, so vast, they are all the same on various scales, and they squeeze out local commerce and oppress the citizens with their ostentatious arrogance and insidious financial facilities."
"For the same reason, and because I think this report is so positive, I fear that it may fail to become an oasis of good sense in the encroaching desert of subjecting everything to financial laws and mechanisms, which is even present in the report itself when it puts forward the idea - which seems to me the wrong way round - that the commercial sector can, or even must, serve as an instrument in spreading awareness and use of the Euro, the single currency."
"This wrong way round approach has been reinforced by the rapporteur and other Members in their speeches."
"The question is, what is this instrument for and who is it for?"
"But later."
"On this calm night, let us accentuate the positive points, rare as they are and necessary as they are, until the contradictions become clear."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, we are very pleased that the vast sector of trade is at last being tackled by the Commission in a Green Paper, although the figures mentioned are totally out of date as they date from the beginning of the 1990s."
"This Green Paper should be particularly important because of the predominant role that trade plays in the search for new pools of jobs, since it is the second largest employer in the Community."
"But whilst the Commission asks businessmen to trade with the Euro, is there not a risk of a cost-benefit imbalance for small businesses, which constitute the majority in this sector."
"In fact, the Commission puts individual businessmen, SMEs and large companies all in the same basket, whilst it is clear that the financial repercussions and the difficulties of implementing the Euro with regard to clients, in terms of conversion, rounding up or down and information will not be felt in the same way by such different structures, even though they are all part of the trade sector."
"We regret that the Commission did not tackle the question of protection of small businesses except within the framework of relations and co-operation with hypermarkets, while it seems to have skimmed over the main problem when it mentions the equilibrium to be found between the best price for the consumer and the non-disappearance of individual traders in relation to large integrated companies."
"In this area we think that every country of the Union, and in particular France, has a role to play in terms of the defence of small traders and the promotion of labelled local produce in the face of the hypermarkets and their central buying, even if, once again, the defence of our identity clashes with supranational community regulations."
"In terms of deregulation, it is interesting to note that the Commission starts from the point of a double acknowledgement, firstly that trade must be flexible, competitive and therefore not tied up in overly strict regulations, secondly that such regulation of commercial activity falls within the remit of the Member States."
"But it hastens to justify centralised European regulations through the obligation to respect community rules concerning competition, establishment rights and free movement of goods and services."
"In view of the desired reduction in administrative charges, notably to the benefit of SMEs, the soft focus maintained by the Commission must be noted."
"It is certainly praiseworthy to speak of the role that trade can play in social cohesion, mainly the retail outlets found in overly built-up town centres or in the under-populated countryside, but the difficulty is in finding the balance between this social role and a necessary concentration as an instrument in the face of world competition."
"It therefore appears that the Commission is content to note the difficulties in the trade sector in its Green Paper without proposing solutions."
"It is paradoxical to ask contributors to the said sector to find their own solutions whilst refusing them these solutions because of non-respect of community law relating to competition."
"Mr President, colleagues, the commission has finally produced this long-awaited Green Paper on the retail trade."
"Retail companies have long been the second largest employer in the EU."
"There are four and a half million retail traders in the area, and they employ twenty-two million people."
"But how is it possible that, with unemployment the biggest nightmare in the union area, we are worsening the situation by taking away the better service of the corner shop and replacing it with pollution-making supermarkets."
"An irrational structure has been created on purpose It takes a hundred cars to pick up the equivalent of one car load, from outside the city."
"The result is unemployment, pollution, traffic jams and dying city centres."
"Besides, aren't the hypermarkets starting to remind you of those special boxes they use for rat experiments, with their one-way corridors and automatic doors?"
"The corner shop should also be a part of that famous principle of community spirit."
"My proposal is that we start humanising and reviving our cities, rather than kill them off."
"Corner shop services could diversify into postal services, computer networking facilities and meal services for the elderly and disabled."
"The Union summit conference on employment to be held in November should decide, for example, on a three percent interest subsidy for the small and medium business sector, which gives employment."
"Shops are important employers and so they should come in for this kind of subsidy."
"Thus employment and the quality of life both improve simultaneously."
"The report emphasizes aiding innovative marketing activity on the part of small and medium-sized retail businesses, and supporting regional development and local skills."
"We can all be united on this, as it is very important to give guarantees to the regional retailer at a time of accelerating competition."
"We must invest in aid to the retail trade through structural funding right away also because the sector employs more women than men, which is obviously right."
"In Mr Garosci's excellent report and in the Commission's Green Paper faith is expressed in the role of electronic shopping as a way of reviving remote rural areas."
"Rural development by electronic means can only be a good thing."
"But electronic shopping at the moment favours existing supermarkets, not small village shops."
"Mr Garosci's report also touches on how, when there is a common currency for Europe, it will be just that retail sector which will be affected in the most obvious way."
"In a shop you spend money."
"When discussing the single currency and its preparatory stage we should not forget, however, along with shop workers, bank staff who will be doing all the practical work leading up to the single currency, and this under the threat of future unemployment We would be taking it out of one pocket to put it in the next if we aided women's employment in retail and at the same time witness perfectly able women bank employees in their forties and fifties being relegated to the dole queues."
"The Commission's Green Paper on commerce is an important document, too, because it tackles the inexorable onslaught of the supermarkets."
"It appeals against the problems of pollution among other things."
"For example, the concentration of supermarkets in Finland is driven by the tyranny of big business, where local shops cannot use regional sub-suppliers, but have to order from central firms just like everyone else."
"The Commission, however, encourages regional co-operation and condemns vertical development."
"I fully support the Commission's proposal since, if we do not reverse these frightening trends in shopping, the natural demand will not be met."
"The uniform supply trends we are seeing now do not grant the customers freedom of choice, and retail as it is cannot grow."
"Mr President, the Commission's initiative on commerce is extremely well-judged, as is the position taken by the European Parliament based on the report by Mr Garosci, whom I also congratulate."
"The sector's significance is demonstrated by impressive figures. It provides 13 % of Union GDP and employs 22 thousand people (2.3 thousand more in 1992 than in 1982) in 4.5 million businesses, 95 % of which have less than 10 employees, distributed throughout the territory from the great cities to the most remote villages."
"So commerce has an irreplaceable role in the economy and in society."
"The idea that nothing new would develop is already outdated, even an intermediate stage, pushing up prices to consumers and reducing the incomes of those engaged in agricultural and industrial activities, has proved to be unnecessary."
"It is clear today that commerce adds immense value, monitoring the tastes of consumers, letting them know about products and providing them with complementary support on the one hand, while expanding the sales opportunities of those engaged in production on the other."
"The Commission's report also eloquently emphasizes the social role of commerce, saying that it is the means by which people meet, communicate, make contact and integrate, and represents, for many, the only regular source of contact and conversation with other people and the outside world."
"The wealth of opportunities and support that commerce alone can provide is impossible to express in a few words."
"Certain developments in the modern world, welcome no doubt, still give rise to apprehension - which is expressed - about the traditional role of commerce, notably as regards certain aspects of its social function."
"Modern distance selling systems, mail order services, or even large supermarkets, making small local shops lose their relevance,"
"It would be a pointless battle to try to prevent these developments, and they do offer great advantages to consumers. Besides, it seems clear to us that small scale commerce will continue to have a role, because proximity and personal service make it irreplaceable."
"Recognizing its importance - including political importance, in the best sense of the word - traders and authorities need to join forces to smooth away its limitations and realise its potential."
"The traders can develop an even more personal approach to the interests of their customers or, for example, explore wider forms of association, allowing them to buy in on better terms."
"The authorities can reduce bureaucratic burdens - in my country, for instance - as well as providing facilities for fulfilling fiscal obligations, credit support, etcetera. It is especially important to improve the town planning framework as regards suitable location, and restructure support - for example under programmes like the Urban programme, extending urban resources to all, not just the biggest."
"In the tourist areas commerce will still be a particular important factor for attracting people who appreciate its presence, for the benefit of all."
"The large traders also have great responsibilities to promote quality products linked to the crafts and other specialities of the region, and thus become valuable promoters of its culture, which will be spread to their countries of origin by tourists returning with their purchases."
"The report also gives due importance to the unique capacity of commerce to promote border areas."
"This is a capacity which has special importance for Portugal, as the border areas - in the interior, with Spain, are the most backward areas and, symptomatically, only have more favourable indicators in the towns on the traditional main connections with Spain."
"Under the circumstances, instead of continuing to concentrate on only a limited number of crossing points, it is important to multiply and improve the links between the countries as much as possible, and the benefits will far outstrip the cost of the investment."
"This is an advantage which will increase greatly when the Euro comes into circulation and eliminates the costs and limitations currently involved in changing money."
"Mr President, when the European Union was founded it was probably inconceivable for anyone to think that we would come to such a debate."
"It is only today, as we see the economic effects of the developments in our society in terms of distribution and consumption, that we recognize how important small businesses have been, particularly in the commercial sector."
"We certainly need more study of this and of the effects of the growing concentration of large businesses."
"As many speakers have said in this debate, small businesses in the commercial sector play a role which is greater than their role in economic terms."
"They play a role which is important socially and environmentally."
"They represent an opportunity for many people to go into business on their own and to develop entrepreneurial skills which would not otherwise be there."
"I should like to quote as an example the town in which I live."
"It is a small town in the southwest of England, called Langport."
"It is 17 miles from the nearest large town and 12 miles from a town that can even vaguely be described as large."
"We have a number of shops."
"We are fortunate."
"We have three newsagents, five hairdressers and two butchers."
"And yet there are proposals to open a supermarket in our town."
"Some of the traders favour it."
"They say that their businesses are dying anyway."
"Others say that the introduction of a supermarket, not limited - as has been the trend in Britain until now - to selling food, but selling many kinds of things, would kill all other trade in the town."
"We will conduct an economic impact assessment and a transport impact assessment before this goes ahead."
"Yet this is an important example, because it is happening all over Britain and sooner or later it will happen all over the Union."
"I welcome the Garosci report."
"It is a very important contribution to this debate."
"I hope that the Commission will follow the recommendations in this paper and bring forward a White Paper within two years, recognizing the importance of small business and recognizing that it needs our assistance."
"Mr President, the Commission's Green Paper on commerce gives a good analysis of the situation in which European commerce finds itself at the moment. I have criticisms on two points."
"Firstly, the Commission assumes right away that national legislation forms the greatest obstruction to cross-border trade."
"It is true that the internal market does not function perfectly."
"But uniform or harmonized legislation will not remove the cause."
"It would indicate more of a sense of reality if we respected the often deeply-rooted cultural traditions."
"I do not think that the diversity in market structures and the variety in the regions could be exchanged for a boring, one-dimensional mono-culture."
"The second comment I would make is that the Commission wants things to go well in commerce."
"I do too."
"But is more trade better?"
"It is striking that nicer shops are mentioned and are one of the instruments for increasing turnover."
"It seems that the motto of Descartes: ""I think, therefore I am' has been transformed into ""I spend, therefore I am.'"
"When buying and selling lead the way as policy objectives, you encourage consumerism and materialism."
"The interests of the environment are then pushed into the background."
"Of course I support the Commission in its efforts to achieve more environmentally-friendly products and packaging."
"But environmental interests also demand that we encourage the consumer to recycle and repair goods."
"Finally, I am of the opinion that for a balanced judgement about commerce additional statistical information must be available on the environmental pollution that this sector causes."
"I should be pleased to hear from the Commissioner whether he will be including these ideas in the future White Paper."
"Mr President, this report and debate are very important, because trade is important to European economic and employment policy, not because of its size -and the impressive figures prove that."
"Commerce also a cultural and socio-political dimension in a local area."
"The small shop on the corner or in a village is part of European quality of life."
"It is often the centre of local life and also has great importance for tourism."
"Neighbourhood shops which are forced to disappear from town centres, just like village shops which have to close, create gaps that have the greatest possible socio-political consequences."
"The recreation of a better balance between small and large shops must be, therefore, an important purpose of Member States and also the Commission"
"The shopping experience must not be allowed to disappear from villages by the closing of the last shop."
"Everything possible must be done, therefore, to persuade Member States to use the structural funds and suitable common initiatives for the maintenance of retail outlets in rural and urban areas."
"In order to understand the importance of trade for European development one must look upon it as a network., a sort of link between agriculture, commerce, industry and tourism."
"I am sorry but those in the public gallery have not yet been informed that they are not allowed to make any comments."
"They may applaud or not applaud an intervention, but without extraneous comments."
"I would be very grateful if it did not happen again."
"Mr President, commerce is a sector with many SMEs that do not always get the attention they deserve and the sector is almost the largest employer and makes an important contribution to the economic and social well-being of many Europeans."
"The Green Paper, Mr Commissioner, has therefore not come too soon and especially not as there is now quite a lot of movement in this sector."
"There is increasing competition as a result of the operation of the internal market which has resulted in an enormous trend towards concentration."
"There are also considerable urban and rural shifts in the retail trade."
"It is moving out of the centre to the edge of town and away from rural areas."
"Furthermore, there is the imminent introduction of the euro and the advent of the information society."
"Despite the internal market, we should not forget that a large part of the retail trade limits its activity to the local market and has to survive there by means of cooperation."
"As European employers we must regulate in a European way those areas that need European rules, but we must also leave room for the locally-orientated entrepreneurs who are active in the regions that differ from each other in their structural, cultural and demographic characteristics and therefore cannot all tolerate a centralized approach."
"We must ensure that there is free movement, free establishment, harmonized technical and fiscal rules and not forget rules on competition that do not ignore the specific nature of the SME but leave things such as the establishment of commercial areas, opening times and so on to the Member States themselves."
"A second matter concerns urban and rural shifts."
"In rural areas there is an exodus from the local shop and the arrival of shopping centres on the edge of towns and ugly rows of shops along major roads which has led to the decline of town centres."
"The Commission rightly states that commerce can be an efficient means against the marginalization of certain groups of the population and that an integrated policy is necessary with regard to the towns."
"In Flanders, the authorities have made funds available for commercial centres in the town centres."
"The European Commission should encourage such initiatives by at the very least organizing exchanges of best practice and especially by not blindly deregulating in matters of town and country planning and the establishment of businesses."
"Mr President, the fact that in its Green Paper the Commission gives a lot of space to the role of the retail trade on the introduction of the Euro is a good thing."
"The rapporteur and other colleagues have explained why."
"But adequate account must be taken of the concern of this sector, among other things, with regard to prices and determining the beginning and end dates of the transitional period."
"The Commission should also not forget the increased price transparency through the use of the euro, that will make the call for the harmonization of VAT rates even louder, Mrs Peijs referred to this in more detail."
"Furthermore, there is the information society which will thoroughly shake up commerce and the relationship with both the consumer and the banks will change."
"Electronic trade, new translation techniques, colleagues has it occurred to you, will only be able to be successful if there is confidence in these new things and if they can be used in an affordable way and so there is still work to be done."
"Finally, I should like to say a word about the Committee on Commerce and Distribution."
"This Committee must of course remain representative for the heterogeneous sector that it represents."
"Furthermore, consideration must be given to not only the entrepreneurs themselves but also their representative organizations to let them play a full part in the work, and especially for the SME world, Mr Commissioner, the need is a real one and I should like to hear your particular opinion on this matter."
"Mr President, I am curious to know the reaction of other parties to the Green Paper."
"In any case, I hope that the Commission will take account of the Parliament's resolution."
"I nevertheless congratulate the rapporteur on drawing it up and I await concrete proposals from the Commission that attest to a mature policy for the commercial sector."
"Mr President, it is a pleasure to rise to a full public gallery."
"I only regret that the benches of the House are not as full as the public gallery."
"If, at the end of my speech, the public gallery want to applaud or even give me a standing ovation, I shall be more than pleased."
"Although I do not usually do so, may I say I would be very glad indeed if you received this ovation at the end of the meeting."
"As to your other remark that there are not many Members in the House, you know very well that colleagues have been working, just as you and I have been, since 8.00 a.m. today."
"I really cannot oblige them to remain in the Chamber until now."
"Mr President, I understand."
"They are about to miss a great speech, but there we are."
"The subject of the report this evening by our colleague, Mr Garosci, which is an excellent report, is a matter of profound importance because commerce, retail and wholesale distribution and retail services to the public in general are great creators of jobs, as has been pointed out by a number of other speakers in the debate so far."
"I would like to concentrate attention on paragraphs 10 and 11 of Mr Garosci's report."
"Paragraph 10 states that the distributive trades, small and medium-sized enterprises, suffer disproportionately from over-regulation as a result both of European Community directives and of national regulations."
"I would like to expand a little bit on that point."
"Large companies can afford to employ all the experts that modern legislation requires: health and safety officers, fire officers, welfare officers - all those posts which large companies create to give employment to highly paid executives."
"Smaller firms, on the other hand, particularly small retail firms, cannot afford such specialists."
"The job is done by the boss and either the boss's wife or husband."
"We cannot go on adding burdens of this kind on the small enterprises which are the great creators of jobs."
"In my country the situation is even worse."
"We get European Community directives, of which I can give one example, the famous 'six-pack' of health and safety directives which we passed in 1992."
"Those six directives specifically excluded the self-employed."
"Many small retailers are self-employed."
"But those six directives, when they became law in the United Kingdom, were extended to apply to the self-employed."
"Not only were they extended to apply to the self-employed, they had added into them penalties, imprisonment, fines and other condemnations which would have made life difficult for these people."
"All this was blamed on Brussels, on those wicked people in the European Commission, or in the European Parliament."
"Again in my country - I am sorry to refer specifically to British experience - I regret to say that all too often Brussels, the European Commission, the European Community, being used as a scapegoat or, indeed, as a fig-leaf."
"I can quote an example of a public house in my constituency which served lunches."
"The publican - the manager of the public house - was told by his local environmental health officer that he could no longer serve underdone beef."
"In parenthesis I would add that this was long before the BSE crisis occurred."
"He was told that he could no longer serve underdone beef because Brussels had forbidden the serving of underdone beef."
"In another restaurant in London, of a rather higher status, I was told recently that crêpes suzettes could no longer be served because Brussels had decreed that flames were dangerous and therefore crêpes suzettes were no longer on the menu."
"The Commissioner and you, Mr President, are laughing. I can assure you that people seeking crêpes suzettes or the people who used to earn their living making them in the United Kingdom are now out of a job and that Brussels is being blamed."
"One of the important things which I would hope that the Commission will take away from our debate this evening is the way in which national administrations - I have talked about the British experience but, from comparing notes with other colleagues I understand it is just as bad in other countries - use Brussels and the European Commission as an excuse."
"If we can encourage the Commissioner to highlight this and to protest when he sees national governments act in this way, he will certainly have our wholehearted support and mine in particular."
"The Commissioner, who has been listening patiently, may now reply."
"Mr President, I would like to thank you for showing special forbearance as regards time this evening and for allowing a substantial debate to be held with substantial contributions from all those who spoke."
"The world of commerce will be very grateful to you."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed a great pleasure for me to be here with you today to inform you of the sequel to the promotion of those issues that are examined in the Green Paper on commerce."
"I have to tell you that the positive reactions from the public dialogue exceeded our expectations."
"And I will not hide from you the fact that I was especially pleased that Parliament decided on its own initiative to submit a report on the subject of the Green Paper."
"This shows that Parliament makes as much of this crucial sector of the economy as I do."
"At this point allow me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Garosci, for this wonderful report which he is presenting to us, and for the detailed analysis of the Green Paper that he makes in the report."
"The basic aim of the Green Paper is to provoke a wider dialogue on the future of the sector in Europe."
"The contribution of Parliament to this dialogue was and is of special significance, not only in addressing and understanding the problems, but also in shaping the basic policies concerning trade at a European level."
"Your opinion is indeed especially important for us, not only because, in principle, it adopts the approach of the European Commission, but mainly because it sets out new ideas and new issues for the development of the sector."
"During the consultation process we received more than 1, 000 written replies from national governments, from European bodies, from national professional bodies, from consultants or from individual companies."
"I would like to tell you that this enormous contribution with more than 1, 000 comments and recommendations is exactly what we were seeking. Our wish was to create a large debate, an open debate at a European level capable of revealing the importance of the sector in question."
"I agree with the comment that was expressed that the Green Paper does not give an exhaustive description of the situation and of the prospects for commerce."
"Nor do we doubt the usefulness of a detailed analysis at an intrasector level."
"Our basic objective, however, was to give a brief presentation of the problems that preoccupy the whole of the commercial sector and, in this way, to play our part in facing the challenges that affect its future."
"It is also important to point out the lack of statistical data for commerce and the desire of professional bodies to improve these data seemed to be very strong."
"We must emphasize the fact that there has been noticeable progress since the publication of the Green Paper."
"In October 1996 the Council adopted a regulation for the organization of businesses, in which commerce is also included."
"Moreover, Eurostat and my services on the European Commission, together with the Economic and Social Committee, will be organising a seminar on statistics in the sector before the end of the current year."
"Granted that commercial activity is linked to a series of more general economic matters, the issues that are contained in the answers are often of a horizontal nature, such as, for example, the need for the harmonization of taxation, VAT regulations and, of course, compliance with the most general rules of competition."
"These are matters to which we must give considerable care and attention throughout the coming months."
"The trend towards commercial consolidation also causes particular anxiety because of the consequences that this has in the distortion of competition, and these consequences have, quite rightly, been described in the opinions that you have put forward. But very many speakers have spoken of the dangers facing many small shops and of their survival."
"More specifically, emphasis has been given to the need to study measures to encourage independent traders to come together, especially in the context of the creation of partnerships or associations."
"It must also be said that in many countries, in many Member States of the European Union, this idea of consolidation of businesses within associations or partnerships has proved to be particularly successful, more so indeed when this idea has been reinforced by state authorities, by national legislation and by the governments of the Member States."
"The creation of more jobs is always one of the top, I would say the top priority of the Commission and of the European Parliament."
"The advice of commerce in this regard is of particular importance since there is great diversity in its structure and operation and it offers employment to many working people, from the unskilled labourer to the highly specialized worker."
"In the opinions that you have put forward you have also quite rightly stressed the importance of organization."
"It is a crucially important issue for the future of commerce in this rapidly changing technological, social and legislative environment."
"The Commission fully sympathizes with the need for the simplification of administration and the improvement of the business environment."
"Our recent decision to create a special task force after the Amsterdam Council, a decision which the European Commission put into effect only yesterday with the presentation of the composition of the task force, has exactly this purpose in mind."
"Its findings will be borne in mind in the action programme for commerce."
"We estimate that this task force, which will aim at shaping a better and more favourable business environment, will be in a position to present a preliminary report at the special Council summit on employment in Amsterdam."
"In any event it will conclude its work and will present a complete report at the meeting of the European Council in Cardiff at the end of the British Presidency."
"Electronic trade was also one of the basic challenges of the Green Paper."
"I believe that its development will be a real help to many retailers in internationalising their activities."
"It may also be a vital tool for shops in remote regions."
"The introduction of a common currency, the Euro, seems to be the overriding concern of commercial companies and, I would say, with justification."
"The majority are against the obligatory legislative regulation concerning the double recording of prices. There is also a preference for a shorter period for the parallel circulation of the national and the common currency."
"But correct information needs to be given. There needs to be appropriate organization concerning the introduction of the Euro."
"We need to improve communication between consumers and commerce."
"On this point the Commission, working together with Parliament, has set up a round table on the Euro with the participation of all interested parties."
"And, furthermore, to ensure that the decisions concerning the Euro that affect commerce are taken with the greatest possible consensus among fair-minded people on the finding of joint solutions, I have set in motion meetings between commerce and consumers with the agreement of my colleagues, Mr De Silguy and Mrs Bonino."
"Another important issue concerns the survival of small shops, in particular those shops in the sparsely populated island and mountain regions, and also in the centres of towns and cities, where small shops play a vital social, economic and cultural role, a fact that many of you have pointed out today during our debate."
"The solution to this problem can not be the protection of small shops from all forms of competition."
"However, we need to strengthen their capacity to face just these new challenges."
"And this means improved organization, better information, finding ways of correctly positioning small shops in the marketplace."
"The pilot programme that you all know about, Emborio 2000, will be oriented in just this direction."
"We will also be organizing a conference on commerce in rural areas during the first few months of 1998 and this conference will take place with the cooperation of the Committee on Regional Policy."
"I would also like to emphasize that our policies must contribute to the preservation and improvement of the quality of life in rural and urban areas and in the centres of towns and cities, bearing in mind the particular characteristics of the weaker members of society, especially, I would say, the elderly and people with special needs."
"We are now at the stage at which we draw our conclusions and your report is indeed an important contribution in this process."
"I would therefore like to once again thank the parliamentary committees that have expressed their opinions in this regard for the contribution they have made and, of course, to thank once again the rapporteur, Mr Garosci."
"The guidelines and objectives for our future actions will be set out soon in a communication of the European Commission and will be submitted to the Council, to Parliament and to the other relevant bodies."
"I hope that by the end of this year we will be in a position to present a specific programme of action with specific actions that are needed immediately by commerce."
"At the same time, however, we will seriously consider your suggestion about the drafting of a White Paper."
"And I hope that by the end of the term in office of this European Commission, that is within the next one and a half to two years, we will be in a position to present a White Paper on commerce with the basic legal guidelines that are needed to strengthen commerce, and to shape a better environment within which commerce may play its many-faceted role."
"Of course I acknowledge that when the services of the European Commission hear this, they will feel that this constitutes a large work load which has fallen on their shoulders."
"And I can see that my director, Mr McKenzie, is already feeling the burden of responsibility for the work that he is about to undertake."
"However, I know that all of us who have responsibility for this huge undertaking - the creation of jobs - and for the creation of better conditions for the development of commerce and of economic activities within the European Union, that is to say, the Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission, will agree that, in order to be equal to this great challenge, in order to be able to face up to and to formulate a White Paper on commerce, we need the support of the Directorate General XXIII in this regard."
"We do indeed need more human resources and more specialist skill in this regard."
"And for this reason I would like to thank Parliament once again for the great support it is giving Directorate General XXIII."
"I hope, however, that we will go beyond just words and that we will continue to take concrete decisions on the strengthening of the administrative function of Directorate General XXIII and that this will translate into both human resources and financial resources."
"Then our conclusions will lead to proposals for a long term programme of action within the framework of an integrated approach to the policy on commerce."
"And I would like to assure you that we will continue our efforts towards the provision of a framework within which commerce will be able to make progress and to participate in pushing forward development and in creating new jobs."
"To end, I would simply like you to allow me to mention the last comment by Mr Cassidy."
"It is true that the European Commission and the institutional bodies of the European Union are often in the gun sights of governments."
"Indeed, they are often used as an alibi for policies that are carried out at a national level or for the weaknesses of policy within the Member States."
"I would like to say, however, that we have learnt to live under these conditions and I believe that we will continue to live, so long as we always know that the contribution of each of us is positive at whichever level it is made."
"We know that Brussels is to blame for everything and that national governments are responsible for the good things, that Brussels and the institutional bodies of the European Union are responsible for the bad things, but it is mainly the European Commission that is responsible."
"We will nevertheless continue our efforts with regard to the strengthening of European unity and we will continue to contribute to better and more productive work, to a more productive promotion of our policies both at European and at national level."
"This is, moreover, the role of the European Commission: to serve Member States and to serve the common interest of the citizens of Europe."
"Mr Commissioner, I see that, like Mr Cassidy, when face to face with the large number of European citizens in the galleries, you were inspired, and you were quite exhaustive in your responses to the comments of Members."
"Mr President, as we are not up against the clock tonight, I would just like to take a few seconds, although it is not usual, to thank the Members who have spoken in this debate, those from the crossparty group on commerce and distribution, those from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, Commissioner Papoutsis for his commitment which is no overnight affair, and not just for commerce but for the whole sector of small and medium-sized firms, and the entire DG XXIII, in particular the commerce and distribution unit."
"And thanks to their work, we confidently await a fine White Paper on commerce by the end of 1998."
"Thank you, Mr President for kindly letting me speak."
"I naturally agree with our colleague Mr Garosci's words of thanks and I think that the words of the Commissioner have really put some heart into the commercial sector."
"But I should still like a reply to a specific question that I raised, and that was with regard to the composition of the Committee for Commerce and Distribution."
"At the moment this committee is made up entirely of entrepreneurs."
"In his intervention, which left nothing unexplained, Mr Cassidy outlined what the difference is between small companies and large companies."
"Large companies are themselves experts or have experts in every field in house and if they do not then they can afford to call on the best experts outside."
"With small companies, the situation is not the same."
"If now in the Committee for Commerce and Distribution the entrepreneurs wish to be present themselves and speak for themselves, that means that the small and medium-sized enterprises can articulate their interests in a far less expert way than is the case for the large entrepreneurs."
"Therefore in that sector the demand is for representation via professionals and that means experts and so my request that account be taken of this and that consideration be given to reconstituting the Committee for Commerce and Distribution."
"I should like to know the Commissioner's view on that point."
"If he is not able to give it now, then I should also be pleased to receive a written reply, but I should nevertheless like to know what he thinks about it."
") Mr President, you have given me the opportunity to come back to the podium and give a clear answer to Mrs Thyssen, whom I would like to take this opportunity to thank for her special contribution in promoting the issues on commerce."
"Addressing myself to you, Mrs Thyssen, I would like to tell you that the European Commission fully sympathizes with your views and indeed we are turning our attention even more to small businesses and to how they can take part in all the decision-making processes."
"If you are referring to the composition of the Committee on Commerce and Distribution, I would like to tell you that in this case the participation of professional bodies is not envisaged."
"What the European Commission, however, is looking to elaborate is a framework within which the representatives of small businesses will be able to express their opinions through the many processes that we are evolving, either in the Member States or at a European level."
"In any event, however, you are completely right, it is very difficult, very small businesses do not have the experts, they do not have the possibility to turn to experts to gain access to what we call European involvement in the developments that are taking shape at a European level, nor even to the programmes that we ourselves are developing."
"For this reason, therefore, we are endeavouring, by means of all the networks of information that we have either at a European level or at the level of the Member States, to diffuse the information that is required, and at the same time to ask for their views and opinions in a reciprocal relationship, which we have trying to develop over the last three years."
"I have to tell you that so far results have been especially positive and whenever we have had the opportunity to talk with representatives of small businesses, either from national bodies or from European bodies, they have defended their demands and their positions in a very successful way, and in many cases have made the representatives of larger business more sensitive to their difficulties."
"As far as the Committee on Commerce and Distribution is concerned, however, I would like to remind you that this is made up of representatives of Chambers of Commerce that have been recommended in the European Commission by the national Chambers of Commerce, or of representatives of the trade associations of the Member States."
"And in this regard we must hold to certain principles, we must maintain certain frames of reference so that we may have credibility in the eyes of the Member States."
"If the European Commission took it upon itself to select representatives of professional bodies from one Member State or another, then the European Commission and its decision, any decision, would be open to very strong criticism, intense criticism, both from Parliament and from the Member States."
"In any event, however, I would like to finish by saying to you and by assuring you that our resolution is steadfast to strengthen very small businesses in any way we can, either through long term programmes for small and medium sized companies, or through special initiatives and special programmes that we are developing in concert with the Member States."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 10.30 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr Posselt has the floor."
"Mr President, on page 15 of the German version it says that in yesterday's Question Time I asked a question on the addition of certain categories of nature to nature protection."
"My question was, however, on the eastward enlargement, the Czech Republic and the introduction of certain legal and human rights categories into the process of eastwards enlargement."
"That is a pretty big difference."
"I just wanted to draw attention to it."
"Thank you, Mr Posselt."
"We will make the appropriate correction."
"Mr President, I should like to ask you whether it is correct that the Bureau has taken a decision to turn us into administrative offices instead of representatives of the people and henceforth to keep records of our mileage, train tickets, visits to the various facilities and the trips that we make."
"In short, we are supposed to submit our whole body and soul to the administration."
"Would you just bear in mind, Mr President, that we are here to represent our constituents and not to operate as administrative offices or keepers of long lists of our movements for the benefit of the administration."
"May I point out to you that it is up to our constituents to judge us and not the body of members."
"Mr President, we are tending increasingly to become an appendix to the administration, and no longer representatives of the people."
"I really must ask you to look into it, as it is quite clear that the administration wants to take over everything, and make us into an executive."
"I recently heard that someone in the administration had said that the Members were a necessary evil."
"We have no wish to be a necessary evil!"
"Thank you very much, Mr Habsburg."
"I do not know if anybody said that, and I am not going to comment. What is clear in any case, however, is that the Bureau's decision does not mean that the administration wants to control anything."
"The Bureau's decision simply involves supplying evidence of travel. This is not the first time we have had to supply proof of travel, as honourable Members are all aware."
"Evidence is provided for all travel apart from the normal weekly journey, and nobody has ever considered that a threat to honourable Members' dignity, or an attempt by the administration to exercise control."
"This is simply an agreement, which was not made today."
"It was adopted in Luxembourg during the June meeting, and the Bureau has simply adopted the necessary measures to implement the Luxembourg agreement."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Yesterday in Oslo the international community approved an agreement to prohibit manufacture and storage of and trade in anti-personnel mines."
"Every year weapons of this type kill or maim more than 25, 000 people, mostly civilians."
"There are still more than a hundred million mines distributed throughout 70 countries."
"On several different occasions our Parliament has passed resolutions in support of the result achieved yesterday in Oslo."
"I should like to thank the Member States of our Union for the efforts they have made to achieve this result."
"I should also like to acknowledge the United States' ""constructive abstention' , in the hope that they may be able to revise their stance."
"This result will not compensate for the suffering which these weapons have already caused."
"We will have to continue to support the process of deactivating the mines."
"But every time the international community achieves this sort of agreement, the world is a slightly better place. Europe contributes to this process, and I am sure that is a source of satisfaction to us all."
"Extradition between Member States"
"The next item is the report (A4-265/97) by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the Convention drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union relating to extradition between the Member States of the European Union (C4-0640/96)."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, has the floor."
"Mr President, we have come a long way since 1957 when it was stated that one of the aims of European integration, then just beginning, was ever closer union between the people of Europe."
"Today our treaties aim to achieve an area of freedom, security and justice."
"And we have come a long way, it is true."
"But our free area relates to the freedom of movement of goods, money and services. There is still very little free movement of people."
"In this free area, Mr President, there is more freedom for criminals than there are guarantees that crime will be tracked down."
"As for the other two objectives - security and justice - we need to stress that there are still obstacles in the way of true cooperation on the issue of crime prevention."
"Mr President, the people of Europe are hampered by many frustrations in these matters."
"Their frustration is great and so is their hope that the European Union - the European institutions - will do something about this."
"Remember the recent demonstrations in Belgium provoked by the horrendous crimes which had been committed there."
"What were the people of Europe demanding?"
"For extradition to be made easier; for ways to be found to enable criminals to be handed over directly to the appropriate jurisdiction, within the European Union."
"The same is true of the demonstrations held in Spain after the murder of a town councillor in Ermua by the terrorist group ETA."
"Mr President, I have said there are many frustrations, and that is the most important thing to stress about this subject."
"Nevertheless, we must welcome this agreement as one step towards achieving that area of freedom, security and justice - a step which does not go far enough and still leaves much to be desired, but which is at least one more step in the right direction."
"We are not happy with the agreement, Mr President, firstly because it keeps us within the realm of international public law."
"It is a multilateral agreement and, although it is the result of action by the Council, it does not represent an action on the part of the European Union as such. Rather, the situation is still one in which each Member State acts as an individual entity and speaks for itself."
"Thus we are still a long way from that single internal area of freedom, security and justice."
"We are also dissatisfied that the European Parliament was not consulted during the preparation of this agreement."
"We might almost say that we are getting used to that. However, this Parliament will never become resigned to the Council failing to respect the treaty rules and listen to our opinion, as laid down by the current treaty."
"We hope that from now on, with the new provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam making consultation with Parliament obligatory, the Council will respond by mending its ways and consulting Parliament about all aspects of this matter, which is of such great interest to the European people represented by this House, Mr President."
"Parliament was not consulted."
"Furthermore, this is an international convention."
"Then why have we said that this is a step forward?"
"Because it simplifies the extradition conditions as compared with the 1957 convention, which was established under the auspices of the Council of Europe, rather than between the Member States of the European Union."
"Because of the extent of political integration which has been achieved and the degree of mutual trust between the existing legal systems, people are demanding that a solution should be found within the European Union, rather than in external fora such as the Council of Europe."
"Among the most outstanding achievements of this new agreement, Mr President, we should mention that the reasons for extradition have been extended, with the required sentence being reduced from one year to six months. Also, it establishes that prison is no longer the only place where somebody can be detained."
"And most important of all at the moment is the removal of the impediment on political crime, contained in article 5."
"That is, extradition can no longer be denied on the grounds of political crime."
"Also important is the removal, at least partially, of the requirement for double incrimination in crimes related to terrorism."
"Nevertheless, there are also many criticisms of this agreement, which need to be discussed by this House."
"Firstly, there are very few proposals to improve the handling of the extradition procedure."
"Those procedures need to be made easier, through simplification, and further measures."
"The second thing is that a maximum time limit for these procedures is not set, as was done in the 1995 agreement on voluntary extradition (which furthermore was on a European Union basis)."
"Also, we must point out that the convention allows almost all the advances we have mentioned to be qualified, which goes against the very essence of the constitutive treaties of the European Union, which the preamble to the convention acknowledges."
"If there is mutual trust between the legal systems and in the Member States' laws, then even the possibility that such reservations could exist is incomprehensible."
"Mr President, there are two alternatives. Either we are a group of states mutually acknowledged to have equivalent systems to guarantee civil liberties, or else the European Union ceases to have any meaning."
"The European Union will be an internal market, a union for customs purposes, but never a true union of free citizens defending the same interests."
"Finally, Mr President, the greatest criticism which we in this House must level at this convention is that it does not give the Court of Justice in Luxembourg any powers at all, not even the slightest, rudimentary powers granted by other agreements such as the Europol agreement."
"We are told that this question will be examined in a year's time, but that is not enough and we must condemn it."
"So, how do the pros and cons balance out? Well, on balance, despite everything, we have to support this convention and ask for it to be ratified as soon as possible."
"We have to ask that those Member States who have established reservations do not make use of them, or ratify them in a limited fashion. We also have to ask the Council to look at the possibility of bringing this agreement into force before all the Member States have ratified it, if some are particularly slow to do so, applying the same philosophy as already established in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Mr President, my group is going to ask for a vote in favour of this report, with the single condition that paragraph 13 should not be approved, asking the Member States' Parliaments not to ratify the agreement until powers are granted to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg."
"I have said that we do not agree, that we want the Court of Justice in Luxembourg to have those powers. But I have also said that Europe is being built bit by bit, one step at a time, and that this is a step which we must take, in order to build on it and continue to move forward so that, not using the instruments of international public law, but using true Community, European Union, instruments, we can turn that Treaty of Amsterdam declaration into reality, to create that true area of freedom, security and justice, which our citizens demand of us."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Institutional Affairs is unanimous in presenting three essentially points to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs."
"I am pleased to say that two of them have been taken into consideration."
"The rapporteur has now distanced herself very vehemently from one of them, much to my regret."
"The two points concern the powers of the European Court of Justice."
"Firstly, an appeal to national parliaments to make their ratification dependent upon powers for the Court of Justice, and secondly, an urgent appeal to the Council not to leave examination of the powers of the Court of Justice for a year, but to do so immediately."
"A third point concerns a defect which was not mentioned in Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi's report on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, namely the absence of the minimum constitutional requirements for the operation of such extradition requests."
"It may not be known to some, but it is an incredible fact, that the most primitive legal guarantees of civil rights provided in every criminal code - the right to a lawyer, a right to instruction on the law, trial dates - are not provided in these national extradition procedures. That means that citizens can be held for months without a trial date, and without an investigation of arrest, and there have been no attempts by the Council to reach an agreement."
"I have the utmost regret that the rapporteur has distanced herself from this."
"This Parliament has always been an advocate for two objectives: the intensification of cooperation in Europe, and the creation of a European democracy with basic and civil rights."
"The way in which Parliament conducts itself in a disagreement is important, and such a disagreement between intensified cooperation - which we welcome - and civil rights is the case here."
"The rapporteur has simply pointed out that a number of obstacles have been removed here."
"That is one view of things, and obviously we welcome it when obstacles in the way of the extradition process between EU states are removed."
"But it is important to keep a close watch lest these obstacles represent constitutional safeguards for the citizen."
"This not a matter of a few administrative obstacles. It concerns, for example, the prohibition of extradition if the crime is not punishable in one's own country, prohibition of extradition of one's own citizens, or a prohibition of extradition to third countries, without reference to the first country."
"All these so-called obstacles represent substantial civil rights."
"I think it is right to question these obstacles as part of an intensification of European cooperation, but - and this 'but' is absolute - uniquely where legal safeguards and legal competency are being created at a European level."
"We are facing a conflict which is very, very important."
"I think that if we do not stop centralization in some areas, particularly concerning internal security, and demolishing national civil rights and democratic standards in the process, without recreating them simultaneously at European level, then we cause a deep conflict in this issue of European integration."
"I appeal to you, therefore, to support this resolution - which is also supported in the main by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs - for minimum guarantees in extradition procedures."
"My parliamentary group will not vote for this report, for the reasons given."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike the Green Group, we shall vote for the report by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, even though we share some of the reservations expressed by Mr Voggenhuber on behalf of his group."
"I shall start, as so often with reports of this type, with a critique of the Council procedural methods, which have once again been completely symptomatic."
"When we argue - there is a reference to this in the Palacio Vallelersundi report - that in the European Union there must in the long term be common constitutional development, parallel to economic and financial development, but at the start of this debate we once again discover that basic rules are ignored every time, then this procedural error by the Council shows how undemocratic the Council is, particularly concerning the third pillar of Maastricht. An example of basic rules being ignored is that the European Parliament is only consulted within the consultative procedure when matters are already on the move."
"That may change with the Amsterdam Treaty, which lays down the requirement to consult the European Parliament."
"As well as this undemocratic procedure, powers for the Court of Justice are also missing, as Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has already mentioned."
"This is not for the first time either."
"We complain about it over and over again."
"The mere fact that the European Court of Justice is not granted powers is itself a missing legal safeguard for the citizens concerned."
"Not to incorporate legal guarantees still existing in national legislation, when elements of national legislation concerning internal security have been delegated to the European Union, only reinforces the permanent, unexpressed mistrust which is felt about the procedures of the European Union."
"In my view these points have all been rightly made."
"There are, however, some improvements which we, despite criticism, must also praise."
"During the debate in our committee we came to a point, however, where we had to make our positions plain."
"This concerned the question of political crime."
"Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi touched on it, and I shall not repeat it here, because it occupied our committee for weeks."
"I want to say quite clearly on behalf of my group that if we are a Community of democratic constitutional states, and if each Member State only acknowledges in another that the constitution it practises and uses accords with basic democratic principles, then there can be no protection against political crimes within the European Union."
"One of the most important contributions to this debate is that the Palacio Vallelersundi report makes that clear and records it."
"Not only the rapporteur, but all who worked on the report, deserve our thanks for that."
"Despite all doubts which we still have, we have arrived at the conclusion that we shall vote for the report, and that is a compliment to Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi for her hard work and also her readiness to accept our criticisms."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not long ago a Portuguese citizen was sentenced in Germany to life imprisonment for murder."
"Unfortunately he was able to escape from prison and make his way back to Portugal."
"The request from the Federal Republic of Germany for extradition of the legally sentenced murderer to Germany, so that he could serve the remainder of his sentence, was dismissed by the other Member State, Portugal, on the grounds that there was no life sentence in Portugal and therefore the extradition request could not be granted."
"This case precisely illustrates the problem we face here."
"Contrary to what the speaker from the Greens has said, this is not about destroying a constitutional state, but just the opposite: it is about building one in Europe for the first time!"
"It is no evidence of constitutional statehood, if murder is punished in Europe entirely differently or not at all."
"We are seeing here once more that we have a large economic area, but a corresponding constitutional area does not follow."
"Economically we can undoubtedly trade across frontiers - unfortunately, criminals, even organized crime, can do so as well - but the law has not finalized these cross-border arrangements to any satisfactory extent."
"This convention is a very cautious and, many here will feel, unsatisfactory step in this direction, which is intended to ensure that criminals within the Union can still be called to account if they avail themselves of the benefits otherwise offered by the Union, for instance, freedom of movement."
"That is only fair."
"If I were to criticise this convention, it would be not only on the grounds Mrs PalacioVallelersundi very precisely clarified and which Mr Schulz also mentioned, namely, the unsatisfactory involvement of the European Parliament, but also because movement towards a common area has been inadequate, the convention is full of dubious points, and another Member State, Greece, reserves the right not to extradite anyone accused of having fought for peace."
"I can hardly believe that there is so different an understanding of the word peace anywhere in the Union that crimes can hide behind it."
"This all shows that we have not advanced very far."
"Nevertheless, this is a step in the right direction and it is necessary for this convention to be ratified quickly, so that it can come into effect."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi on her excellent report."
"Speaking on behalf of my group, I join her in welcoming the substantial progress contained in this convention."
"In a common borderless market, improving legal cooperation in penal law is essential to step up the fight against organized crime and terrorism."
"A Member State must not be allowed to act as a refuge for a criminal who can then avoid prosecution and sanctions brought by another Member State."
"While the basic aim of the convention meets our expectations by revoking the principle of double jeopardy, by rejecting the deeming of criminal acts as political crimes, by including tax misdemeanours, and by accepting the extradition of its own nationals, I, like Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, can only regret the reservations expressed by certain states."
"These might strip the convention of its substance and more especially could suggest a lack of mutual trust between states."
"It is quite true that I do not completely share her analysis from a legal point of view, in particular when it comes to the conditions for consulting Parliament, as laid down in article 4.6. paragraph 2, although I fully concur with her on the need for such consultation."
"In any case, the new article k.11, paragraph 1 of the Treaty of Amsterdam will relegate this semantic dispute to the archives."
"I fervently hope that Member States ratify this convention as quickly as possible and that they seize the opportunity given to them to enforce it once ratified."
"Of course, the thorny issue of the role of the Court of Justice still remains."
"After the agreement signed during the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Council should be able to settle this issue quickly by drawing on the Amsterdam compromise, but the urgency of enforcing this convention for the Union must not be undermined on any grounds, not even by invoking the role of the Court of Justice."
"The approval of paragraph 13 of the report, originating from the adoption of Mrs Roth's amendment, will be the cornerstone of my group's support for this report."
"Mr President, I feel honoured by the presence of Commissioner Fischler, who knows a lot about agriculture."
"But I do discreetly wonder where Commissioner Gradin is today."
"I believe she was here this week."
"Maybe she is still coming."
"Mr President, the new extradition convention is an improvement."
"The extradition of criminals within the European Union takes too long, there is too much red tape and the procedure will now be quicker when this convention comes into force."
"The fact that one's own nationals, that is to say, Dutchmen by the Dutch government and Belgians by the Belgian government, will be able to be extradited is in a certain sense also an important step forward."
"The fact that terrorists will be extradited more easily, or rather with less difficulty, is a good thing and all in all this is a step on the way to the European legal area on which we are all working, at least the majority of this House."
"The weakness of the convention has already been set out by the rapporteur, whom I wish to compliment on her work."
"I am in agreement."
"However, I also wish it to be said on behalf of the liberal group that the fact that the Court of Justice has no authority in this very area where we are dealing with criminal law and that type of case, is a serious shortcoming."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam did do something about this, but it should still be improved afterwards."
"Mr President, the European Parliament, it has already been said here several times, was not consulted."
"In the draft resolution it states that we regret this fact."
"I must say that we shall vote for it, but I consider it to be expressed rather weakly."
"It is really not reasonable that we were not consulted."
"The conclusion of the Group of the Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party is that, having weighed everything up, we shall vote for the draft resolution."
"Mr President, the extradition convention between Member States of the European Union, with which we are concerned today, can represent a step forward in achieving that European legal and judicial area which, with the necessary transparency and democratic guarantees, should complete and extend the building of economic Europe, as has already been said here."
"Nevertheless, a few comments are needed in reference to both the content and the adoption procedure."
"Above all, we need to show our strong disapproval that the Council did not respect the stipulations of article VI of the European Union Treaty, and adopted the convention without informing the European Parliament or consulting it beforehand."
"As concerns its content, we sympathize with the objective of improving judicial cooperation in the area of extradition."
"But the fact that the Member States are permitted to express reservations about almost all the convention's innovations will mean that its worth will depend on whether the states formulate such reservations or not."
"As regards extradition procedures to deal with terrorism we, like the speaker, regret that lack of clarity in the wording of the agreement, and lack of trust between Member States could mean that collaborating with or belonging to a terrorist group may not be covered by extradition. This would make no sense at all, in an area of freedom and democracy where there is no room for political crime."
"In any case, it must be stressed that extradition must always be a matter for the legal and not the executive institutions. Handing over the responsibility for such decisions to governments would violate the individual's legal rights."
"Finally, it is important to work towards an automatic extradition procedure within the framework of an area of freedom, security and law, in order to achieve a European legal and judicial continuum, which continues to respect basic rights and democratic control, and maintains the legal nature of the proceedings, without damaging people's rights to defence."
"Mr President, I think it really is a perverse world we have to deal with here."
"I do not refer to the excellent report by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, but to the convention that is the object of the report."
"There is no basic charter of rights, no common justice policy, no Europeanization of the internal policies of the Member States of the European Union, which might be the only imaginable constitutional basis for what is happening here."
"Instead of at last taking the necessary steps, however, what does the Amsterdam Treaty do?"
"It formulates in Article 3 a series of declarations of intention whose legal content is, to put it mildly, entirely unclear."
"I admit that the convention we have before us creates some clarification, particularly that the very constitutional rights of the previous extradition agreement are to be discontinued."
"This is a further example of how in many Member States the justified battle against organized crime is being so conducted that the basic rights of citizens are being limited."
"The K3 convention goes a step further, however, in that it conducts this limitation of citizens' legal rights by means of an international agreement."
"That is a step that no parliament in the world which is committed to constitutional principles can permit."
"For this reason the Committee on Institutional Affairs is absolutely right to demand that the parliaments of the Member States do not ratify such an agreement."
"So what should the European Parliament do now?"
"It should not continuously complain about how it was not consulted."
"It has no need to be consulted if it has no opinion on civil rights!"
"Mr President, first of all we should congratulate the rapporteur for the quality of her report, although some comments are called for."
"Clearly, legal cooperation within the Union is improving but we do not have a single legal jurisdiction yet."
"We are moving in this direction but are only making slight progress for the moment."
"The key aim is to ensure that crimes do not go unpunished while at the same time protecting citizens from arbitrary application of the law."
"In this respect, the concern of all of us, the concern that we all have partly in mind is political crime, or rather what has been described as such."
"In Europe today, under existing legislation and legal institutions, only assassins, extortionists, kidnappers or those who have committed premeditated murder are really prosecuted, but here political inspiration must not be taken into account."
"These are delinquents and criminals who are prosecuted as such."
"Let us bear this in mind to improve our judiciary. At all events, let us protect ourselves against crimes committed within the countries of the Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the extradition convention between the Member States of the European Union before us, which was passed by the Council on 27 September last year, is essentially to be welcomed."
"I think the previous speakers have made that clear."
"Europe is experiencing ever closer union and increasing citizen mobility, but criminal mobility is also increasing, unfortunately."
"The conditions of the previous extradition agreement have not, however, kept pace with these developments and are thus not efficient enough."
"They must be improved."
"We want a Europe where the citizens feel secure."
"So we accept that the proposed extradition conditions are to be welcomed."
"But like Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi - whom I congratulate on her wellresearched report - I too must protest most strongly about the behaviour of the Council."
"The Council did not consider it necessary to involve Parliament at once and comprehensively in the preparation of the convention - as laid down in the treaty."
"For this reason we must consider whether we want to continue to present our demands regarding third pillar agreements only in retrospect, or whether we should not debate how we as a Parliament should conduct ourselves with regard to the Council in order to utilize still better those few rights we still have."
"On the content I would briefly like to say that the many reservations the Member States have expressed are particularly unsuitable for genuine construction of a Europe of mutual trust."
"Here too I am of one mind with Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi and many other colleagues."
"We also agree about the urgent need for a solution to the problem of the European Court of Justice's powers under this convention, which must be tested now."
"After all Union citizens must have the opportunity to turn to the European Court of Justice on legal matters with a European dimension."
"Furthermore, it is important to me that the duration of the extradition procedure should be limited and a set deadline should be introduced."
"A short duration is preferable for humanitarian reasons and because of the basic law of consideration for human rights."
"A clear procedure gives the person concerned the necessary legal security."
"Legal security is also the point when we talk about the relationships between extradition and asylum law in the European Union."
"Not without reason the Council found it necessary to add a suitable explanation to the convention."
"In the Amsterdam Treaty Member States are declared to be safe countries of origin."
"It seems to me to be to the point that the joint statements about asylum law in the annex to the convention should now be amended to meet these new conditions."
"I now come to my last point on content, which is equally important to me, and I thank you in advance for listening to me."
"As the Council recognizes in the preamble, an agreement about extradition can only be applied between states that have committed themselves to the principles of democratic constitutional states and the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Basic Freedoms."
"I am quite sure that no state can be expected to make an extradition to another Member State which has either annulled parts of this convention for itself by using article 15 of the EMRR, or where human rights violations are known to occur in police custody or in prison."
"I must unfortunately point this out, for many human rights organizations continue to draw attention to it and we regularly condemn it in our annual reports on violations of human rights within the Union."
"Mr President, the issue that we are debating today is fundamental to all who realise that, in order to consolidate its position and to be able to fulfil its historic mission in the international arena, the European Union must be a place of freedom, security and justice."
"The introduction of an effective convention on extradition will not only provide a solution for existing legal problems, it will contribute to effective procedural collaboration and lead finally to the integration of criminal law, which is one of the preconditions for real union with the obligatory, self-evident but unfortunately undebated move towards federalism."
"Since, of course, if this federal structure existed, if internal borders had really been abolished, there would be no reason to regulate the extradition of illegal immigrants between Member States."
"There would be an automatic mechanism for the handing over of illegal immigrants to the competent authority on the basis of jurisdictional rules and regulations."
"Unfortunately, with the almost exclusive emphasis given to the economic aspects of our progress toward integration, these basic objectives of unification are considered to be remote and of secondary importance."
"The detailed and dispassionate report by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi points out the efforts that must realistically be made in the mid-term."
"It is necessary to stress the need not to underestimate the role of the European Parliament, which is a guarantor of liberties, of the European Court of Justice and finally of the Member States, which must not abuse the reservations contained in the convention nor refer its implementation to the Greek Calends, that is, postpone it indefinitely."
"Mr President, I too would like to add my voice to the congratulations to Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, who has done excellent work. I also join in the chorus of vigorous protest against the fact that Parliament has been by-passed yet again, and as usual our position has been ignored and matters have gone ahead with no consideration of the opinions of the people's elected representatives."
"The extradition issue is especially interesting because it is at the centre of the whole question of the authority and sovereignty of Member States, and is thus part of the general ambiguity currently affecting the European institutions."
"There is a clear and absolute need to make progress with cooperation on justice issues - we all agree about that - in a very delicate sector which represents the very core of the criminal law in Member States."
"As organized crime gains ground, obviously now transcending national borders, cooperation in fighting it must become increasingly close."
"But I also want to urge prudence about over-simplistic abolition of guarantee procedures on the grounds that they are muddled, given that we do not yet have a real and actual European legal area."
"As everyone knows, I am in favour of the European legal area, but I also believe that, without a fundamental charter of individual rights, extradition is of course one of the guarantees for individuals."
"Because of this I also believe that the central issue of the powers of the Court of Justice cannot be undervalued."
"Without clarification of the powers of the Court of Justice it is very difficult at the moment to deny that there is a possibility of undermining guarantees of individual freedom."
"Mr President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left is not united on this question."
"Several Members and myself are going to vote against this report."
"We will do so primarily for two reasons: partly because we think that the report is far too weak with regard to legal certainty and rules concerning legal certainty on extradition, and partly because we believe that questions of criminal law are national questions and agreements about questions of criminal law should be intergovernmental."
"This report also supports the restrictions on the right of asylum which are proposed in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"We are also opposed to that."
"There was a case in Sweden a few years ago which attracted a lot of attention when France requested the extradition of an Algerian citizen to France."
"The Swedish authorities refused to do so because it could not be proven that he had committed a crime."
"It later transpired that he was innocent and had an alibi for this crime."
"I believe that it is right that a country's judicial authority should be able to decide for itself whether a person should be extradited in such a case."
"Mr President, I think we are all aware that we are involved in a difficult and innovative operation, constructing a basic element of European citizenship represented by the legal and judiciary area."
"My colleagues have already mentioned the essential reasons, which are obvious to all the citizens, 80 % of whom state security as their number one concern."
"I think it should be recorded that the Council is being very active at the moment and a step forward has also been taken in the Treaty of Amsterdam, if you like."
"But this activity, which involves not only this convention but others which we will be debating over the next few months, and that treaty, exist within the contradiction, already mentioned here, of progress towards cooperation, but slow, very slow, establishment of a guarantee system, especially the Court of Justice and the European Parliament."
"Now I think the serious position to take on the issue is to judge each measure on its merits."
"Well, in this case, I think it is important to approve Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi's report - and I must say it is excellent, even at the legal level - but that does not mean we should not argue our position against the Council. First because it deals with improving the existing procedures of a historic institution, which has too often been used to escape justice."
"Secondly, because experience tells us that the most recurrent cases are terrorism cases - at least in my country, but not just there - and I support Mr Pradier's speech on that subject and on economic crime."
"Too often those with plenty of money, and especially the perpetrators of economic crimes, very easily succeed in influencing the country of extradition."
"Thirdly, because I too am intensely concerned about the guarantee issue and I think we should all be, because it affects everyone, I want to mention an innovation in the Treaty of Amsterdam: article F calls for the sanctions against Member States which violate human rights."
"I believe we need to reconcile these points, and have the courage, not to stop an important train in its tracks, but to intervene to prevent a derailment."
"Mr President, I sincerely believe that this extradition convention is a valid instrument to achieve something which this Parliament has long called for and sought to achieve; to make an area of freedom - freedom of movement - in Europe compatible with the security and protection of its people."
"It is very difficult for people who have suffered violence at the hands of terrorists or other criminals to understand how these offenders can be allowed to take advantage of loopholes and find refuge within the European Union simply because of suspicion between states which are theoretically moving towards a high degree of political union."
"We are well aware of this in my country, which is why we have wanted this convention for a long time."
"Therefore, I am pleased that it now exists, and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, on her report."
"Now we just have to wait for the agreement to be ratified by the Member States, by means of that complex procedure for which the third pillar is designed, and hope that they obey it in letter and in spirit, and that it will improve the extradition procedure, which is what we all hope."
"It only remains for me to say, as so many colleagues have done, that I hope in the future, as well as congratulating ourselves on the content and wording of one of this Parliament's reports, we may also go away satisfied and congratulate ourselves that it is truly functional and useful."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Terrón."
"Commissioner Fischler has the floor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I too would like to congratulate Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi on her report, and thank her sincerely for her work on the committees."
"The European extradition convention signed on 26 September 1996 contains a range of clearly defined basic articles, which include conspiracy to commit a crime, political crimes and the extradition of one's own citizens."
"From these articles it is clear that the Member States are determined to proceed jointly against organized crime and terrorism."
"At the same time the convention expresses the confidence that all Member States honour and utilize human rights within their penal systems."
"As you know, human rights are laid down in the Amsterdam Treaty in a form that can be recognized as expressing their quasi-constitutional status for the Union."
"Although the extradition agreement allows of exemptions, the grounds for these are certainly not lack of mutual trust."
"Rather, the relevant decisions recognize the sensitivity of certain questions concerning the constitutional laws of individual Member States and allow them time to adapt themselves to new conditions arising from the creation of a common area of freedom and law."
"That notwithstanding, the Commission regrets as much as does Parliament that the views of Parliament were not obtained before the acceptance of this important instrument."
"It would be nice if a Council representative were to express that regret here."
"Views and intentions are formulated in the resolution on the agenda, for which I have great sympathy."
"For example, I too would like only very limited use be made of the exemptions provided."
"I would like to go into one particular point in more detail."
"I fear that the call on individual state parliaments to ratify the convention only after the role of the European Court of Law has been clarified, could have very detrimental effects."
"It would withhold from Member States a very useful additional means of combatting organized crime, without automatically demanding a rapid and satisfactory solution."
"I also see in this respect a certain contradiction in points 7 and 13 of the resolution."
"I wonder whether it would not be more sensible to examine the powers of the European Court of Justice at the time the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force, as it expressly includes the right of the Court of Justice to interpret instruments introduced within the new convention."
"Perhaps this would be the appropriate time to examine whether the current instruments, which do not provide for powers for the Court of Justice, should not be included in the future regulations."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12.00 noon."
"Fourth annual report of the SME Observatory"
"The next item is the report (A4-0245/97) by Mr Torres Couto, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the fourth annual report of the European Observatory for SMEs (1996) (C4-0292/97)."
"Mr Torres Couto, the rapporteur, now has the floor for five minutes."
"Mr President, 16.5 million small and medium-sized enterprises with 110 million workers in the European Union: these figures highlight the economic and social importance of this segment of European business."
"The fourth annual report of the European Observatory for SMEs provides an extensive and valuable overview of SMEs and the craft sector in all the Member States of the Union."
"A major objective of the report, which has been produced by the European Network for SME Research, is to provide an information basis for decision-making in relation to the SMEs, including the craft sector."
"As in the 1995 report, the main part of the 1996 report concerns the measuring of the effect of the completion of the internal market on small and medium-sized firms."
"Given the importance of SMEs as backbone of the European economy, as rapporteur, I welcome the report and appreciate the work put into it."
"The 1996 report includes two in-depth thematic studies on ""women and SMEs' and ""cooperatives, mutuals and non-profit organizations' ."
"In the European Union of the twelve, in 1993, 20 to 30 % of all the enterprises were managed by women and 25 to 30 % of all new enterprises were started by women, with assisting spouses playing an important role."
"At the present time it is estimated that 60 to 80 per cent of assisting spouses work in the small and medium-sized business sector."
"Although these figures clearly demonstrate the importance of this subject, it has been largely neglected so far."
"Businesswomen are frequently faced with great difficulties, for example, in terms of financing."
"Women are discriminated against in access to credit."
"Consequently urgent action is needed to remedy this situation."
"For assisting spouses the main problems lie in the fields of social protection, legal status and matrimonial, tax and company law."
"Adequate social security provisions must be introduced and the areas of law I have just mentioned need to be reformed."
"As far as cooperatives, mutuals, associations and foundations are concerned, they account for at least 6.5 % of the number of private enterprises, and thus represent a factor in the European economy which is not negligible."
"Unfortunately, little information exists."
"The European Cooperatives Statute needs to be urgently approved because it can provide valuable assistance in resolving this situation."
"The subject of transfer of enterprises, which is analysed in detail, merits special attention, taking into account the fact that 1.5 million small and medium-sized European firms risk closure and some 6.5 million jobs are in danger if the transfer issue continues to be neglected."
"The observatory lists the four most important obstacles to transfer: the valuation of the enterprise, financing the takeover, legal disposals and emotional aspects."
"In particular, the high level of inheritance and gift taxes is an important factor inhibiting business transfer in several European countries, so the possibility of reducing or eliminating these taxes should be taken into consideration."
"While the fourth annual report provides a thorough analysis of the matter, as rapporteur, I feel the possibilities offered by the transfer of enterprises to their employees has not been sufficiently considered."
"Other important aspects are financing and training, which are also dealt with in the fourth annual report."
"As regards financing, the positive experience of financial insurance provided by the mutual guarantee schemes and loan guarantee schemes in the United States show that these instruments can and should be used on a larger scale in Europe, to tackle the grave financing problems facing small and medium-sized firms."
"As far as training is concerned both initial training and continuous training need to be improved, one important step being the harmonization of apprenticeships within in the European Union."
"The fiscal environment also plays an important role in the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The current companies tax system in many Member States still holds back many small businesses with potential for growth by favouring the investment of profits outside rather than inside the company."
"A reduction in companies tax on retained profits of small businesses is thus recommended as an effective measure for sustaining and increasing employment."
"Mr President, the fourth report thus analyzes a large number of areas which are very important to the performance of SMEs."
"And we need to remember that, without them, the economy and employment in Europe could be profoundly and severely disturbed."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Torres Couto on his text on the fourth annual report of the European Observatory for SMEs."
"SMEs are all the more important after the Amsterdam Council and Gordon Brown's jobs initiative emphasizing the primacy of SMEs was included in the final text."
"Mr Torres Couto identifies certain problem areas such as the transfer of enterprises, where 1.5 million SMEs are at risk."
"An earlier Commission communiqué told us that some 30, 000 firms go under each year because of this problem, which translates into something like 300, 000 jobs."
"Often the problems are administrative or legal in nature on the death or retirement of an entrepreneur."
"This problem will intensify as the single market itself intensifies."
"A second problem area is financing SMEs."
"The EU's existence helps exchange of best practice."
"Reference is made, in particular, to mutual guarantee schemes."
"These are almost unknown in the UK, though prevalent on the Continent."
"But I am happy to say that there is a launch this autumn, in London, under the auspices of the small businesses minister, Barbara Roche, of the first UK mutual guarantee schemes, piloted by my colleague, Mr Nigel Bottomley."
"These schemes have a high degree of mutuality attached to them."
"It is therefore disappointing, as is pointed out by the rapporteur, that the European cooperative statutes have not been established and has the multiannual programme, which was scheduled for 1994/1996."
"Another positive move supported by the rapporteur is the reduction of corporation tax on retained profits, thereby encouraging SMEs to invest in growth."
"This is another short cut to fast and sustainable job creation."
"In this respect I welcome the fact that the British Chancellor, Gordon Brown is slashing corporation tax for small businesses in the first Labour budget for two decades."
"This is more than the decayed Tories did for small firms throughout the whole period of their sleazy tenancy."
"The fourth Observatory Report produces a highly valuable and in-depth analysis of women and small businesses."
"This, in my view, is the great pool of untapped talent."
"I speak as a son and a brother of three women in my family who have successfully run or participated in the running of small businesses."
"The truth of the matter, however, is that too many obstacles are put in the way of women taking the plunge into the pool of talent."
"Recently in my Chester office I listened to a constituent of mine recall the sexism she had encountered in both the UK and Holland in trying to expand her business of producing effective literature for SMEs trading across borders."
"A good business idea was being stymied for non-business reasons."
"Europe is the poorer for it."
"Another constituent woman entrepreneur warns me about the application of good and praiseworthy European legislation, e.g. the pregnant women workers' directive."
"My constituent runs a small business which happens to contain all women employees."
"She fears that her small business could be imperilled by a series of pregnancies and the loss of key workers."
"A large business would not suffer in the same disproportionate way under similar circumstances."
"The solution is not to tamper in any way with the rights of workers in small businesses."
"Indeed, I would argue that in these circumstances we need to differentially favour small businesses and their workers through the tax system, especially to avoid penalizing women workers."
"Beyond the Torres Couto report, we need to become more active in promoting SMEs in their biggest arena, the single European market, a market too closely made and shaped by the image of big business."
"I support the Torres Couto report."
"It has many good things to say."
"We need to look forward to helping small business to provide jobs for the future."
"Mr President, the European Observatory for SMEs has the task of providing the European Commission and other institutions each year with fundamental qualitative and quantitative data on SMEs."
"In the last four years it has managed to perform this task more than adequately."
"The annual report of the Observatory has in the meantime become a recognized reference document in scientific and economic circles."
"Furthermore, the participants in the Observatory have succeeded among themselves in forming a smoothly-functioning network of scientific institutions that possess special knowledge about SMEs."
"For the SME world, that means added value that is not to be underestimated."
"The report that we are discussing this morning was unanimously approved in the Committee on Economic Affairs and it goes without saying that we wall also support it in this House."
"I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on behalf of my group on his work."
"In addition to the general part, the Observatory has also paid specific attention to cooperatives and to women."
"These two groups are very prominent and are rightly given special attention."
"The potential of each of them is often underestimated and therefore up to now they have received too little positive attention."
"Let us hope that the information collected in the report will contribute to changing that situation."
"In many Member States a lot of work still needs to be done to give female entrepreneurs more opportunities and certainly in order to let wives work with their husbands under a proper legal status."
"The cooperatives must also have sufficient room to breathe."
"In my view, certainly in the northern part of Europe, they still have an image that is too ideologically loaded."
"That must go, as in traditional business they can also be an effective legal structure."
"Moreover, I would ask the Commission when we can expect specific progress with regard to the European Cooperatives Statute and when and whether work is being undertaken on a European private limited liability company, because these things are also needed."
"Mr President, the approach of the Observatory, with its dual structure, is greatly appreciated in our group."
"I would argue that in the future the frequency of the publications should be maintained, particularly with regard to the general part with relevant figures and basic data."
"But the studies that are included in the more specific part must also continue to be carried out on a regular basis."
"They provide more in-depth information about a certain sector or a certain aspect of the SME and there is all the more need for them because the world of the SME is not homogeneous and from the scientific point of view is still virgin territory."
"I also hope, and I will close here Mr President, that the Commission will continue to support this useful initiative and I would have liked to know from the Commission what the specific future plans for the Observatory are."
"As far as we are concerned, we would request that it be continued."
"Mr President, it is not very easy to make an appointment with my plumber."
"He is a busy man, a very busy man, he has a family firm, he works hard and makes a good living."
"But, he fails when it comes to his limited feeling of responsibility towards staff from outside his family business."
"He has tried many times and he therefore now keeps things strictly within the family circle."
"My chimney sweep - yes, they still exist - is a jolly whistling fifty year old entrepreneur, he enjoys his work and the human contacts and is absolutely not prepared to take on the administrative and social rigmarole involved in having any employees."
"Plumbers and chimney sweeps are stable undertakings but they do not create more jobs."
"I encountered the opposite entrepreneur's view of those who do wish to expand during the European election campaign in 1994, in the form of female entrepreneurs who were not able to expand because the bank considered them to be a financial risk."
"The good thing about an annual report is that it can highlight a number of bottlenecks: the financial discrimination, a number of fiscal aspects and the legal status."
"This is very worthwhile, because Europe must do things properly with regard to employment in this sector."
"The important role of women here is again confirmed by the report."
"For me that is not really surprising as women always have responsibility and want to and dare to take it."
"More harmonization with regard to apprenticeships within the EU is not a bad thing, but I do not see it as an absolute necessity, any more than the multi-annual work programme in respect of cooperatives."
"It seems a bit centralistic to me."
"That does not remove the fact that the other recommendations by Mr Torres Couto for the improvement of small and medium-sized undertakings remain and deserve attention at the forthcoming summit on employment and the continuation of the Observatory is very important."
"My group is voting in favour of this report."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate Mr Torres Couto on his report."
"We can endorse all his conclusions."
"In my speech, I should like to place the emphasis on three of them."
"First of all, the status and social protection of assisting spouses."
"I am pleased that the fourth annual report devotes a full study to women and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Just as on Tuesday with the vote on the annual report on equal opportunities, today with this report we are pressing for a reform of the legislation on marriage and taxation and the creation of adequate social security regulations in order to offer the assisting spouse better social protection."
"It is gradually becoming time for the national governments to pay this subject the attention it deserves."
"Secondly, the financing of the SMEs."
"The Elise programme was a good project in terms of providing great leverage."
"Now we know that the Austrian, Dutch and German governments are blocking a decision on this loan guarantee regulation."
"They think that this regulation does not comply with the subsidiarity principle and that their own guarantee regulations are subject to illegal competition."
"The rapporteur rightly states that we regret this blocking."
"Ladies and gentlemen, with a view to the impending summit on employment, let us put our full weight behind other new programmes for the SMEs."
"The European Commission will shortly come up with a new proposal: the joint European venture."
"From the annual report of the Observatory, it appears that the Europeanization of the SME forms a problem."
"That's why the Union should be able to help SMEs financially by forming cross-border joint ventures."
"This is a project that we as a Parliament must support."
"Finally, and this has been stressed on many occasions in the House, I wish to argue in favour of European legal formalities that simplify cooperation between SMEs at European level."
"An agreement on the European company statute is essential if we wish to see more SMEs reach their full potential in Europe."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, from all the evidence, attention is being paid to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The great question is whether this attention and interest is genuine or just circumstantial and instrumental to mitigate the real destruction working against a relatively balanced network of economic agents so that public opinion recognizes that some effort is being made to counteract a predatory dynamic."
"The report by Mr Torres Couto, whom I congratulate, is positive in its approach, and I want to mention the way it highlights cooperatives and emphasizes the role of women in the survival and revitalization of SMEs."
"However, the report skirts around certain fundamental issues like financing, access to credit and the difficulties and discrimination suffered by SMEs in this area, covered by point 15."
"It is true that it is not a report dealing with all the problems of SMEs, only with the fourth annual report of the European Observatory, but I think it could have gone much further, even given its modest objective, and dealt in greater depth with the financing question."
"Especially as, ostensibly, SMEs and their financing by the EIB is supposed to be one of the new issues being prepared for the extraordinary summit in Luxembourg, with the clear intention of talking about something apparently new."
"Which is very different from doing something new!"
"Finally, returning to the attention SMEs deserve, the Industry Round Table where the great directors of vast businesses and multinational groups get together, published a study last July on the establishment of concrete partnerships between large and small companies, setting out five rules of good conduct. This is just like a fox which has already got into the chicken coop getting a good conduct certificate based on rules it has made up itself!"
"I would like to thank the rapporteur and the speakers and identify with what they have said about the importance of this area."
"Here we have the potential for job creation."
"We know that the disgrace of the EU are the job queues where millions have no hope."
"I would like to stress the importance of the very small enterprises of under 10, which is what I am used to in my type of area - the Highlands and Islands of Scotland."
"Let us beg our governments to stop blocking ELISE."
"That was a practical measure that enabled very small enterprises to get access to finance."
"What we need here are practical measures instead of lip service, for people to be able to start enterprises."
"It is wonderful that so many women want to do that in the area of very small firms."
"I agree with what Mr Lyndon Harrison also said about the need for differential tax arrangements."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate our colleague Mr Torres Couto on his report."
"He calls for attention to be paid to problems faced by SMEs. The first problem is the lack of management capacity."
"A practical example that aims to make up for this gap is the Live Wire Project that has been set up by the Rotterdam Chamber of Commerce specially for people starting up in business, in which banks, lawyers and business experts provide a wide range of training and advice."
"Another problem is the transfer of businesses."
"The closing down of a business causes the undesirable destruction of capital, knowledge and jobs."
"Only the taxman does well out of it."
"Member States can promote the transfer of undertakings - and thereby safeguard jobs - by adapting their tax legislation."
"Finally, I have a question for the Commissioner: is it possible for the Observatory to deal in a future annual report with the subject of the environment?"
"At the informal Environment Council in Amsterdam on 18 April last, it was concluded that the SME, apart from being a driving force behind jobs, is also an important cause of environmental pollution."
"I am curious to know the answer."
"Mr President, the fourth annual report of the European Observatory for small and mediumsized enterprises is an important subject of debate, providing a snapshot of the position in crafts and small and medium-sized firms and appropriate measures for effective development which can contribute to the creation of jobs."
"It certainly has not come too soon and seems to constitute a step forward on some very important issues, for example, social security and the legal position of spouses who own the same company."
"We also agree with the rapporteur in identifying the high rates of inheritance and gift tax applied in the majority of Member States as a brake on property transfer, and deprecating the inadequate consideration of the possibility of transferring property to employees."
"We also congratulate the rapporteur on his remarks about reducing taxes on capital reinvested, a principle the Alleanza Nazionale sought to promote in government, and we are also convinced that reducing the burden of tax and encouraging partnership between SMEs and large-scale industry would surely have beneficial effects on both the level of employment and the creation of new jobs."
"Mr President, Mrs Thyssen has already illustrated the reasons why the Group of the European People's Party fully supports Mr Torres Couto's report and she has also stressed some important issues contained in the annual report of the European Observatory for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I think the importance of small and medium-sized and craft businesses in the European economy and in European society is now unanimously recognized so it is unnecessary to expand further on that issue."
"I shall confine myself to discussing a few points that I consider important."
"The first is that what small and medium-sized and craft enterprises primarily need is not so much incentives of the traditional kind, as a favourable context for their establishment and development."
"And I refer in particular to the urgent need - frequently confirmed in this House - for intervention on work-related bureaucracy, regulation and taxation, which represent a brake which threatens to suffocate much of the potential of this sector."
"To go further, I believe, as also emerged in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, that a great deal of thought should be given to the subject of training and, in particular, encouraging link-ups and cooperation between the various management colleges in the Member States in terms of the initiatives they are pursuing."
"Finally, we would like to support what other Members have already said."
"The subject of small and medium-sized and craft enterprises should be the focus of the Employment Summit on 21 and 22 November."
"Only small and medium-sized firms can realistically make a contribution to improving employment levels in Europe and it would make a mockery of the summit to concentrate on other sectors and overlook this one."
"Mr President, Mr Torres Couto has made a good analysis of the problems and challenges for small and medium-size companies in Europe, and I would like to thank him. As is evident from the report, the role of these firms as employers is vitally important, and continues to grow."
"The question is how we can improve working conditions for small and medium-size businesses."
"The report sets forth the social and economic problems connected with changes in generation with these kinds of business."
"An overblown and unnecessary taxation rate often endangers sustained business and can even end it."
"Nothing is easier than killing off a small business, and nothing is harder than creating new jobs."
"The unemployment figures for Europe show this plainly."
"The report emphasises quite rightly the importance of and opportunities for co-operatives and calls for European regulation on co-operatives."
"This is certainly in order."
"Co-operatives are perfectly suited to particularly those regions lacking capital."
"For example, in Finland many major companies have their origins in co-operative movements."
"The EU backs new enterprise in many ways."
"The most important tool is structural funding."
"This gives support mainly to training, and research and product development."
"Unfortunately, sluggish procedures and bureaucracy often prevent small and medium-sized businesses from taking advantage of the support on offer."
"The hardest question for small and medium-sized business is lack of money."
"Business urgently needs money both for investment and working capital."
"Many countries have introduced the system of interest subsidies to support business."
"The interest subsidy system is also common, for example, as a means of aiding agricultural firms."
"That is why it is worth considering whether the system could be developed to cover small and medium-sized business also."
"Torres Couto's report identifies particularly well the hindrances to small and medium-sized businesses, and makes recommendations on how they can be got rid of."
"The results will depend very much on how much Member States sit up and take notice."
"Mr President, the fourth annual report and the report by Mr Torres Couto provide a good information base and numerous pointers for the necessary political decisions and measures."
"The fact that female business people, in the financial services for example, often encounter difficulties is a great handicap for the operation of a business, especially for the whole small business structure."
"The problems of assisting spouses for social security, legal security, tax law and company law need urgent solution."
"Small businesses are often family firms."
"Legislators should have regard for their continuance and their important role in job security."
"This particularly applies to the inheritance of businesses where death duties and gift tax can endanger the competitiveness of the whole European economy."
"I think point 18 of the report is particularly important, where it indicates reduction of corporation tax on undistributed profits as an instrument for increased employment."
"Capital accumulation and innovation could be greatly increased by this measure."
"The state could motivate the entrepreneur to internal investment oriented towards growth and innovation, and thus improve Europe as an economic centre."
"Mr President, speaking as a blacksmith who himself comes from a family business I particularly welcome this report."
"It shows that new public management is operating here and that with objective processes like benchmarking and best practice opportunities are being sought to improve the situation in many small European family businesses."
"There is a trend towards the strengthening of many small businesses in Europe."
"When one sees that in 1992 there was an average of seven employees per business, and in 1995 it was six, then one can understand that the small firms are actually the main pillar of the economy and also offer employment security: they do not work a hire and fire policy during economic swings, but prefer one of partnership because they are all known to one another."
"It is important, therefore, that training and career improvement are supported, and it is quite impossible to understand how, when that is being discussed, Leonardo funds should be considered for cuts, to give just one example."
"Quite the contrary, I shall demand at the Employment Summit in Luxembourg a marked increase in Leonardo funding, because this is exactly what gives currently unemployed young people the means of getting jobs."
"I also demand that exporting partnerships should be supported, and finally that cooperation with industry should be improved, as industrial export is the basis for many small family businesses worldwide."
"Age transition is also a gigantic problem."
"One third of entrepreneurs in these small firms is over 50, which corresponds to about 6.3 million work places in Europe."
"I support the ending of inheritance and gift taxes in particular, when a business is handed on within the family. Also of course, that undistributed profits in the business should not be taxed."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, small businesses play a vital role in the creation of prosperity in Europe."
"It is only now that their full role is beginning to be recognized."
"However, it is not support in the form of more measures and programmes which is needed, but rather the removal of obstacles."
"The report and Mr Torres Couto's excellent speech highlight, among other things, the brake which high taxes on enterprise represent, not least for transfers."
"It is also apparent that it is the smallest companies which are hit hardest and are hindered by excessive regulation."
"We need a change in attitudes."
"More enterprise and initiative would give Europe the adaptability and variety we need to be able to benefit from the global economy."
"It is the small businessmen, and not more politicians in employment meetings, who are the heroes the EU needs to get to grips with unemployment."
"And so I would like to say to Mr Harrison, who was unfortunately forced to rush away from the debate, with all due respect to Gordon Brown and all his initiatives, it was under a Tory government that the UK was the only country in the EU able to show a real upturn in enterprise and new jobs."
"I think that deserves both our attention and reflection."
"Let us therefore create the conditions and demolish the obstacles for the EU to be able to become an enterprise union for freedom, prosperity and belief in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the contribution by Mr Torres Couto to the Fourth Annual Report of the European Observer Network for Small and Medium-sized Businesses."
"As with former reports, this one offers a good overview of the current situation of and outlook for small and medium-sized businesses, and examines their performance on the internal market."
"The report comes to the conclusion that completion of the internal market has so far had positive results on economic growth in Europe, whereby there has been strong growth in output in particular, and considerable increase in productivity."
"The report also emphasises that those businesses which have most profited from the internal market are mainly small and medium-sized ones, and this type of concern demonstrates the greatest potential for jobs dependent on growth."
"The Commission takes the view that the report by Mr Torres Couto raises numerous important questions, only three of which I should like to mention here."
"Firstly, the importance of women to small and medium-sized businesses, and the need for measures to encourage female entrepreneurs and assisting spouses."
"At the summits in Essen and Madrid the important role played by women in the development of small and medium-sized businesses, the creation of new jobs and the competitiveness of the European economy were confirmed."
"The success of these hung to a large extent on whether or not women were receiving optimal encouragement."
"The third multi-year programme for small and medium-sixed enterprises in 1997-2000 provides concrete political measures for the equality of female entrepreneurs and joint entrepreneurs."
"Secondly, the contribution of social economy businesses - cooperatives, mutual societies, associations and foundations - to growth and employment."
"For the first time the Observatory's network of small and medium-sized businesses has given this group priority consideration, because they contribute 5 % to employment and constitute 6 % of private businesses."
"The increasingly important role of the social economy in the European Union is clear from the most recent Commission communication, which aims at making the role of associations and foundations in Europe better known."
"The results of a detailed examination by the Commission are contained in this document, which is intended to make the sector better known."
"In addition, the document proposes a range of measures that could be implemented at Member State level."
"And thirdly, the importance of encouraging entrepreneurial spirit as an important element for the existence and growth of small and medium-sized businesses."
"The Commission realises that the construction of a dynamic business culture is of very special importance to the creation of jobs and strengthening of competitiveness in Europe."
"Concerning the question raised here on the future of reporting, may I point out that the next Observatory report is due at the end of this year and that invitations for the 1998/99 report will also fall due this year"
"Concerning the main theme for the next report - this time it was the role of women in small and medium-sized businesses - it is correct that it is to be the environment."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 12.00 noon."
"Beef and veal"
"The next item is the report (A4-0260/97) by Mrs Hardstaff, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on measures to promote and market quality beef and veal and on publicity measures on the labelling of beef and veal and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2067/92 (COM(97)0070 - C4-0193/97-97/0058(CNS))."
"Mrs Hardstaff, the rapporteur, now has the floor for five minutes."
"Mr President, I think at least one representative from each political group should speak after we have heard the Commissioner, and I would ask you to check whether there is time to comply with this request."
"The Agenda sets out the reports indicated to be debated from 10.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon and from 6.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m., with voting at 12.00 noon."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Hardstaff, has the floor."
"Mr President, the background to this report, recommending a marketing and promotion campaign for European beef and veal, is of course the steep decline in the consumption of beef and veal since BSE emerged over 10 years ago."
"This decline became catastrophic for Europe's beef farmers and all involved in the beef industry following the March 1996 announcement that a link between BSE in cattle and CJD in human beings could not be ruled out."
"This arose, as tragically, a small number of younger people had contracted CJD - normally a disease of old age."
"Many measures have been taken, both in the UK and at EU level to address this problem, not least the continuing export ban on British beef, hopefully soon to be relaxed as a result of the many measures taken and much stricter enforcement of feeding and hygiene regulations."
"Parliament agreed some months ago on measures for the identification of herds and a meat-labelling scheme, drawing on the information on the cattle database now being established, where it does not already exist."
"In addition, the new British Government has called on all EU Members to implement the regulations now in force in the UK for the removal of specified bovine offals."
"Nevertheless, the beef market remains very depressed and large sums of public money from the agriculture budget are being spent on taking good-quality beef and veal into intervention storage."
"If more beef and veal is consumed within the EU and more exported to third countries, a great deal of public money can be saved in the long term and the European beef market will again be able to achieve some kind of equilibrium between supply and demand."
"This is why the Commission brought forward proposals for a marketing campaign and requested speedy consultation with the European Parliament, so that they can be implemented as soon as possible."
"In my report I suggest that the definition of quality beef should be widened from its previous, very restricted definition of a limited number of cuts and carcase types."
"Quality should include all beef carcase types, including cheaper cuts, providing that they can fulfil the criteria of food safety using the labelling system to which I have already referred."
"I also propose that national organizations with expertise and knowledge of local market conditions should be used to carry out the promotion."
"This was widened in the Committee on Agriculture to include equivalent regional organizations also."
"Amendments from the Committee on the Environment strengthened the consumer aspects of this campaign, stressing that good consumer information should be at its core."
"I should like to thank colleagues from both committees for their helpful amendments."
"If we are to persuade Europe's consumers to eat more beef and veal and to sell more beef outside the EU, we must ensure that sales are increased, not because of clever marketing, but because purchasers have wellfounded confidence in the quality of the product."
"They must be reassured that all the necessary measures really are in place to ensure that they are buying good wholesome food."
"The proposed labelling and European logo for quality beef must be a cast-iron guarantee that this is the case and that lessons really have been learned from the recent crisis."
"This is something on which this House can unite today in passing on its opinion to the Commission and to the Council."
"Mr President, on this occasion the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has recommended that the legal basis of article 43 alone should be contested, and that there should be a proposal that the legal basis of draft b) of the first paragraph of article 129a should be added to the basis of article 43, on an equal footing."
"The reason is that draft b) of the first paragraph of article 129a establishes the measures - the concrete actions - designed for the protection of consumers to which the rapporteur has referred."
"It is absolutely true, Mr President, that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and this House are both aware that traditionally the appropriate legal basis for any regulation or action in the agriculture area is article 43, to the exclusion of all others."
"And that the jurisprudence of the Court has regularly established that the reason for this is not just that article 43 represents a lex specialis as regards any other legal basis which could be employed, but also because in article 43 - with recourse only to article 43, also in agreement with the Court's jurisprudence - all the other legal interests are taken into account, such as the protection of health or consumers."
"There was a well known sentence about the conditions concerning egg-laying hens, in 1988."
"That is one of the key questions."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights thinks that, for the second time, the traditional approach to this legal basis should be changed."
"This opinion was arrived at singlemindedly, taking into account the events of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis and the measures taken since it started, and the report which this House approved."
"It was clearly established in that report that it was possible to have recourse to article 100a, especially in matters of harmonization and that, above all, there should be consultation, participation and fuller democratic control on the part of this Assembly."
"I should remind you that that criterion has been respected by the Commission, represented at the time by its President, Mr Santer, and subsequently in concrete actions such as the two rulings recently sent to this House."
"In this case, Mr President, once again we call not for article 100a, because this is not a question of harmonization, but for article 129A."
"The reason is simply that since this crisis started, there has been a re-shuffle in the hierarchy of legal interests which require protection."
"Now it is not agriculture and agricultural interests which should have priority."
"Currently, until consumers' confidence is re-established, the interest which deserves priority is consumer protection."
"Therefore, by strictly applying the criteria established by the Court of Justice in its interpretation of the appropriate legal bases, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights believes that it should be clearly established that those are the prevailing interests, with the addition of the legal basis. I hope that Parliament agrees with us, as we believe we have the support of the Commission."
"Mr President, there is one thing I cannot understand."
"The chairman requested a detailed discussion and then we learn that Commissioner Fischler will no longer be present this evening after 6.00 p.m."
"I really do not know what this alteration to the agenda is about."
"We will be talking to the birds, our arguments will not heard and we shall receive no replies."
"For this reason I really must ask for a little more flexibility, because I have the following questions: is the Commission really prepared to undertake a tightening of the registration code regulations; and are there any new proposals, Mr Commissioner, over and above what was agreed in Council?"
"The discussion about whether we should rearrange the agenda will last longer than if we extend it."
"I will only accept points of order."
"I am not going to deal with the question, because this is not the time for questions."
"I have already said that the Agenda specifies that the debate starts at 10.00 a.m.and continues this evening, and that there will be voting at 12.00 noon, as has already been approved by this House."
"Therefore, the debate will be adjourned at noon, as is traditional."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, Union for Europe, I quote the first paragraph of Rule 130: ""A debate may be closed before the list of speakers has been exhausted on a proposal from the President or at the request of a political group - my group is requesting it - or at least twenty-nine Members' ."
"We are discussing legislation which will determine the fate of breeders, traders and consumers of meat, and which is a response to the widespread anxiety caused by BSE."
"So I think Members who have prepared speeches should regard them as explanations of vote and the vote should be taken immediately after Commissioner Fischler has spoken."
"You have moved application of Rule 130(1)."
"I shall call one speaker in favour of the motion and one against. Then we shall move to the vote, as planned."
"Mr President."
"I should like to express my opposition to this proposal."
"We really cannot adjourn the debate in Parliament just because there are organizational problems, or because of the Commissioner's personal engagements, which he may not be able to put off."
"This is an important discussion."
"In the Committee on Agriculture there was considerable amendment to the Commission's proposal."
"That simply must be discussed."
"We must also discuss if we should perhaps refer it back to the Committee, because the labelling directive, to which this proposal refers, still needs revision."
"All this must be discussed here and amongst the Members."
"It is impossible just to vote on it following the Commissioner's speech or statement."
"I am emphatically against it and I ask my colleagues to reject this motion."
"Thank you, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf."
"Does anybody wish to speak in favour of Mr Santini's motion?"
"Mrs Poisson has the floor to support Mr Santini's motion."
"Yes, I support Mr Santini's motion because even beyond the debate, as important as it is, I believe that the situation facing livestock farmers and consumers following the BSE crisis largely justifies the ending of the debate and a vote on the report today, Mr President."
"Mrs Hardstaff has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I just wish to point out, as rapporteur, that it is quite normal in this House to discuss issues on a Thursday evening and vote on them on a Friday morning, and I do not see why an exception should be made for my report."
"Thank you, Mrs Hardstaff."
"The request to close the debate will now be put to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"The debate continues then."
"Mr Fischler now has the floor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all may I point out - although I do not wish to prolong this formal debate on procedure - that I did ask for this report to be debated first just because of its very importance."
"To start with let me thank most sincerely all those who contributed to the report, particularly the Committee on Agriculture and the rapporteur, Mrs Hardstaff, but also all other committees for their positive input and for the detail and goodwill applied to dealing with the proposal."
"This proposal meets two different aims."
"Firstly, it serves to inform the consumer about the guarantees that the new identification regulations for beef, introduced in Regulation 820/97, have to offer."
"Secondly, marketing and advertising campaigns carried out by the trade and its associations for the development of consumption and the marketing of beef, not just in the Community, but also in third countries, ought to be co-financed by the Community. This would allow the beef sector, in crisis because of the sharp drop in consumption, to recover."
"Heaven forbid that it should be sunk here!"
"The most important amendment is Amendment No1, which concerns the legal basis of the proposal."
"In view of Parliament's arguments and the assurance given by President Santer, the Commission can declare itself partly in agreement with Amendment No1, and recognize article 129a as the legal basis in addition to article 43."
"As far as Amendments Nos 7 and 15 on the definition of beef quality, the object of these marketing programmes, are concerned, these definitions have already been incorporated into a Commission regulation."
"These amendments are, therefore, obsolete."
"All forms of carcass are, as recommended by the author, authorized for support."
"Because the new identification regulation is a Community regulation, I am quite sure that the information and advertising measures for the regulation must be exceptionally financed entirely by the Community."
"As a result I am able also to vote for Amendments Nos 4 and 12."
"One of the most important objectives of this whole proposal is to provide the consumer with a guaranteed ability to trace back the origins of the products."
"Concerning the aid to direct marketing, this direct marketing must obviously conform to the community quality and traceability measures or regulations, and above all the veterinary regulations as well."
"For that reason the amendment you have so carefully worked out can be only partially taken into consideration if its wording is altered accordingly."
"In addition, Amendment No 13 in its current form cannot be accepted, because of the danger that traceability would not then be possible."
"Amendments Nos 6, 10, 16 and the second sentence of No 17 on support for seals or marks of quality also cannot be accepted."
"The proposal itself already contains rules for their use under conditions laid down by the Community."
"In the view of the Commission support for such quality seals or marks should remain with the trade and/or trade associations making the request."
"Internal state authorities can also regulate this to whatever extent they think necessary."
"On Amendments Nos 5, 8, 17, third sentence, and 19 concerning the participation of national offices and the provision of technical aid, it must be stressed that it is the responsibility of the relevant internal national authorities to monitor every campaign. The trade and its associations must submit their applications to the competent internal state authority."
"This initiative rests on the subsidiarity principle."
"We for our part should make the necessary flexibility available."
"If the internal state authorities feel it is necessary, they can prescribe consultation with particular offices."
"The aforementioned amendments thus make no sense, because they breach this basic principle."
"Finally, Amendment No 2 is superfluous in the Commission's view, and Amendments Nos 13, 14 and 17, first sentence, are partly unclear or particularly incompatible with the aim of the proposal."
"For this reason the Commission cannot agree to them."
"Amendment No 18 concerns amendments that were not accepted, and so it must also be rejected."
"The Commission is prepared, however, to accept Amendment No 11."
"Amendment No 20, which concerns a Commission report on the execution of this requirement, can also be accepted."
"It will be useful in the preparation and improvement of future campaigns."
"In closing may I point out that because of the acceptance of Amendment No 1, Article 129 will also be used from now on, without involving codecision procedure."
"Mr President, Mr Fischler has explained to us on behalf of the Commission which amendments can be accepted and which cannot."
"It has rejected Amendment No 18, which was concerned with financing and the percentage rate of financing."
"That may be due to the fact that you required a clarification on direct marketing..."
"This is a continuation of the debate, not a point of order."
"We will now move to the vote."
"The debate will continue at 6.00 p.m."
"Mr President, we have here a particular situation that you have not appreciated, whereby we have interrupted a speech, but Mr Fischler is unable to be present this evening."
"It is a matter of whether we must refer the report back to the Committee, and so we need clarification from Mr Fischler as long as he is present."
"That is the particular situation."
"That is why I am bringing up this one question again, so that we can have clarity for tonight's debate that we shall be unable to obtain tonight."
"So I ask you Mr President, to allow this."
"You did not realise what was taking place just now, because you have only just taken over the Chair."
"As a result I ask once more if the financing mentioned in Amendments Nos 18 and 22, namely the acceptance of 100 % of the costs incurred by the industry for informing about the introduction of labels, will be reduced."
"This is a one-off cost, to be financed 100 %."
"It would be scandalous!"
"If you do not permit a reduction we will refer this back to Committee, I am fairly sure about that!"
"This was an important point in the Committee on Agriculture!"
"I have pointed out that, in view of the facts and the experience we have had with earlier actions in this context, we are prepared to finance this activity 100 % within the internal market."
"It is not the first time this has happened, by the way."
"A similar regulation exists for protected designations of origin."
"But that has nothing to do with direct marketing."
"If there were to be a similar alteration with respect to direct marketing, I said, then direct marketing could be partially included."
"It is important, and a prerequisite, however, that traceability is ensured and that only such direct marketers are involved as can produce clear proof that they include all veterinary regulations 100 %."
"Mr President, would you please note that I am now here, that I signed in this morning and that in the meantime I have been in my office, that I picked up some letters there and that I have now come here by bicycle, for which no facilities have been provided by the Bureau."
"Thank you, and welcome to the House!"
"Mr President, I am very sorry. After what has been said by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I wish to inform you that our group is also planning to put forward a proposal for the withdrawal of the regulation that we have been debating."
"Our position, and we will recommend this to our colleagues, will depend on the reply the Commissioner refuses to give us."
"I asked him if there is any factually correct information on whether at this moment it is possible to change the labelling system. Details were given yesterday to the Committee on Inquiry into BSE."
"I also asked him whether he will take the necessary measures to correct this situation. If he does not, the whole system will collapse and we will request a referral back."
"Will the Commissioner give us an answer or not?"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I apologize to the House but I gave notice of this point of order to the President's Office this morning."
"I have only just had a chance to look at the text of the resolution on alleged human rights abuses in Ethiopia."
"Preamble D refers to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in its fifty-third session and what it is alleged to have expressed."
"When I checked with the United Nations' sources, I did not find that had been covered in the fifty-third session."
"I therefore ask the presidency to contact the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva before the urgency debates start this afternoon, because this House would be ill-advised to start a debate on the basis of information which cannot be shown to be factually correct."
"I appeal to the presidency to contact the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva and see if the allegations in preamble D., as to what was decided in its fifty-third session, have any basis of accuracy."
"Mr Tomlinson, thank you for the notice of the question."
"In fact the President's Office has already investigated this and agrees with your interpretation."
"An announcement will be made at 3 o'clock."
"I have now sat in this Parliament for two years."
"In the parliamentary publications and in other publications it looks as if I drift back and forth between the Christian Democrats, the Conservatives, the Greens and the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"I would hereby like to tell everyone that I have no intention whatsoever of leaving the group in which I sit."
"I have sat in this group for two years - Nordic Green Left, which is part of the Confederal Group of the European United Left."
"I hope that I will no longer have to see myself waltz around in the internal press and various parliamentary publications like an unparalleled drifter."
"I can understand that causes you some disquiet and we will ensure it is corrected."
"Welcome"
"I now have pleasure in welcoming to the diplomatic gallery a delegation of six members from the Icelandic Parliament, the Althing ."
"The delegation is visiting Strasbourg to meet its counterparts in the European Parliament on the occasion of the 9th European Parliament/Iceland Interparliamentary meeting."
"It has held meetings yesterday and today."
"Among the topics discussed were the perspectives for European Monetary Union, the future perspectives and consequences of differentiated participation in the Schengen Agreement and also perspectives on the common foreign and security policy of the European Union and the future development of the European Economic Area Agreement."
"I hope the delegation have enjoyed their stay in Strasbourg and I welcome them to the public gallery."
"Votes"
"Mr President, Mr Fitzsimons is absent for reasons of ill- health and has asked me to speak on his behalf."
"I would like to add a few words to the final sentence of Amendment No 13."
"The final sentence reads: ' on the basis of the methods established by the intergovernmental group on the shift in climate' and we would like to add: ' .. these methods must comply with the most recent standards adopted under the United Nations Convention on climatic changes' ."
"(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, Mr Liese has referred to a Spanish text, but the Spanish text in front of me finishes with the sentence: ""and guarantee maintenance of European and ACP banana production' ."
"It finishes there, with nothing else."
"Therefore, I do not know whether it is possible to make that correction now."
"Mr Medina Ortega is correct in saying that these three words were also missing from the Spanish at the time of distribution, but we in our group signed the original and submitted it, and the three words were there. I shall therefore read out the Spanish text of the last two lines."
"' ...y asegure el mantenimiento de las producciones europeas y ACP de plátanos y las producciones fair-trade de plátanos' ."
"(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament rejected the amendment)"
"Mr President, I am beginning to get irritated."
"We submitted the amendment correctly."
"I would ask the staff to check that."
"Those three words were In the Spanish original."
"What is now happening is not right!"
"If there is a technical error within the services, then that is human error. But we have to vote for what the group tabled, and I ask once again for that to be done."
"We will check to see where the error developed if there was an error."
"We vote on the amendments as published."
"It is too late to tell me when we are in the midst of a voting session."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, as we tabled this resolution to the committee oral question, we want to make it clear in the title that it is the G7 proposal for the Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 nuclear power reactors in Ukraine."
"Of course the Green Group is not proposing to complete these reactors: we are against the completion of all nuclear reactors; we want all nuclear reactors in Ukraine and elsewhere closed down."
"The G7 criteria for doing so is leastcost and safety conscious and it has now been proven by official studies that this is not the least-cost or the safest option."
"I want the title to make it clear that it is the G7 proposal for the completion of the Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 nuclear reactors in Ukraine."
"(Parliament agreed to the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution) Joint motion for a resolution on the closure of Chernobyl nuclear power plant by 2000 and completion of Khmelnitsky and Rovno 4 nuclear reactors in Ukraine"
"I should like to introduce the oral amendment, after which we will vote again, even though we actually know better."
"Yesterday we had a vague discussion with the Commission on the subject."
"But we continue to support this, even if it all blows up in our faces one day."
"I should at least like to introduce the amendment to our joint resolution."
"I move that we vote separately on Amendments Nos 3 and 4, so that it is at least demonstrated that part of this House has kept a clear head and does not want to continue completion of scrap value reactors and permit the continued operation of another of the same, with the result that we shall have no money with which to pay for the frightful consequences."
"We shall be unable in any case to pay for the human consequences..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)"
"I would just like to say that this is going a little too quickly, at least for me and those of us who speak Swedish."
"There is really no point at all in trying to raise one's hand."
"I would therefore very much like to ask the President to slow down the tempo and think of us and the interpreters."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, in the text of the report reference is made to the draft Treaty of Amsterdam, which was subsequently amended at the final signing."
"Therefore, when article 236 is mentioned, we are really referring to the only relevant article of the protocol."
"These are technical matters which the linguistic lawyers themselves will be able to attend to."
"We will make sure it corresponds with the correct articles in the draft treaty."
"Paragraph 8 :"
"Mr President, the Socialist Group's amendment is an addition to the original text and for the vote I would suggest to the Socialist Group that it should be considered as 8 a), and be slightly modified as follows: ""Considers that the harmonization of the relevant legislation at European level would be the best way to eradicate the reservations' - it is not the only way to eradicate them, but it is the best way."
"In that case, my opinion as rapporteur is that it should be voted for - putting the amendment to the vote as 8 a), as I said, and with that wording."
"Mr President, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has generally proved to be very unbending, but this time she is being rather more flexible."
"We agree."
"Mr President. If Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi's happiness depends on this, then we agree, to make her happy today."
"It is nice to have a happy House on a Thursday at 1.00 p.m."
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, under Rule 22, with your permission, I would like to go and have lunch in the Members' Bar."
"After lunch I will give you the receipt so that you can control it."
"I look forward to seeing what you had."
"The Council's opinion on this question is very remarkable and also alarming."
"I therefore fully support Mrs Flemming's report."
"It is of great importance that environmental organisations are given the opportunity to participate in this environmental work which is so important to us."
"The Council should be aware of this and not obstruct it by allocating a smaller sum of money than the European Parliament is recommending."
"Since the EU in so many ways, directly or indirectly, supports those who work to promote views about the environmental work other than those developed by the environmental movement, I consider it necessary for the EU to give its support to the environmental organizations."
"It is also good that the programme is being expanded to include countries in central and eastern Europe too."
"Finally, I consider Amendment No 6 proposed by the Group of the European People's Party impossible to support."
"Setting up such a criterion is totally untenable."
"You have to be aware that laws and regulations in the EU's Member States differ with regard to what is or is not considered to be a crime."
"The result is that this proposal for a criterion cannot be fair."
"The undersigned voted against Mrs Flemming's amendment no. 6 which contained a proposal to exclude grants to, amongst others, organisations which have been found guilty of a crime by a court on the territory of the European Community during the past two years."
"I had two main reasons for voting against: Firstly, it is up to the Commission as the executive organ to adopt supplementary rules for the prioritising of applications."
"Secondly, the provision would not have distinguished the type of crime it referred to. Sadly, we have experience of organisations which were peacefully exercising their freedom of speech being convicted by courts."
"I assume, however, that Parliament will vigilantly keep track of which organisations are given grants and ensure that there is no question of organisations like the Animal Liberation Front being able to make use of grants at the European level. Particularly considering recent events in Finland, where minks were released from cages at great risk to birdlife and with large financial losses as a result, since the unknown perpetrators mentioned ALF."
"Fitzsimmons report (A4-253/97)"
"Consideration by the European Union and Parliament of CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions is not something new; the proposed amendment inspired by the Council proposes to strengthen monitoring."
"We really have no alternative but to subscribe to this."
"I would like to pay tribute to the work of our colleague and I subscribe to the amendments that he proposes to add to the initial text of the Commission."
"I also want to stress that while it is laudable to pay special attention to monitoring techniques, to continue towards greater accountability and to ensure comparability between the different Member States, we cannot overlook the essentials, namely to substantially reduce emissions of CO2 (and other greenhouse gases) as well as other pollutants."
"The situation last summer in our large towns and cities showed just how urgent this need has become."
"Political will must be matched by resources."
"Without doubt we will have to consider restrictive and repressive measures in this sensitive and complex environmental matter."
"Speeches alone will not suffice."
"As politicians we must be able to guarantee for present and future generations an improvement in their living conditions without destroying economic growth and jobs, and we must equally stop hiding behind claims that we nothing can be done."
"As everybody knows, carbon dioxide (CO2 ) is the commonest greenhouse gas and contributes 65 % of global warming."
"Therefore it is essential to measure accurately and regularly how well the Community is complying with its obligations for CO2 reduction."
"That will require the Member States to provide information each year about the cumulative emissions of each greenhouse gas, and will also guarantee comparability and transparency."
"All of this entails adequate monitoring of Member States' national programmes, and submission of the findings to Parliament and the Commission."
"The Commission's new proposal is a step in this direction, and will therefore have my vote."
"I voted yes to the proposal, but I think that the report neglects an important area."
"The EU must plan in an entirely different way for monitoring and control systems for the environment in the countries which are applying for membership."
"This should have been included in the monitoring mechanisms for the 21st Century, particularly as there are often major problems in these countries."
"As demanded in my own report on this instrument in 1993, we really must ensure that those Member States which fail to provide data are singled out."
"There continues to be a lack of political will to take action in this area on the part of some Member States."
"We have found in other areas where the Commission is supposed to supply annual reports to Parliament that these reports can be held up by the Commission if all the Member States have not supplied data."
"We have had enough of this and want annual reports even if there are gaps, so that we can get a clear picture of what is happening and where the problems lie."
"Although this may at first glance seem to be simply a technical measure, the smooth operation of monitoring measures and exchange of information on greenhouse gas emissions is an essential tool in our battle against global warming, and I urge the Commission and the Council to agree to the improvements in this proposal which Parliament has carried in its votes today."
"WTO panel on bananas"
"Mr President, the World Trade Organisation is about to declare the Community system of banana import licences incompatible with the rules of free trade, at least as they interpret them."
"However this system, which gives preference to bananas from overseas, the less favoured African countries, the Caribbean and the Pacific which we intend to support, appears vital to the economic survival of these regions."
"The European Parliament therefore finds itself once again facing the disastrous consequences of the Uruguay Round agreement which it approved, all too lightly, without first checking that the agreement took into account social, health, cultural or environmental distortions in international trade."
"I do not mention these facts merely to rake up the past again and again, but to emphasize that there are both good and bad advisers in Europe."
"Perhaps we should re-read the proceedings of the GATT talks to see who the bad advisers were and to draw conclusions from that."
"In an attempt to protect overseas markets, despite the condemnations of the WTO, the Amsterdam project provided article 227 (299 in the new numbering system) aimed at granting special subsidies to regions ultraperipheral to the Union."
"This would have succeeded in replacing a system of import licences which kept the production of overseas countries alive with a system of state subsidies which kept the people of these regions on aid."
"Of the two options, I believe that the most liberal is not the one we think."
"Moreover, it cannot be ruled out that the WTO will one day tackle the system provided under article 227."
"There is nothing to suggest it will not."
"We therefore believe, Mr President, that the only solution is to resume international trade negotiations to gain recognition once and for all for social, health, cultural and environmental concerns and we regret that in its agricultural Agenda 2000 project the Commission only seems to be guided, yet again, by the concern to align its prices to world prices."
"Mr President, with my colleagues of the Europe of Nations group I voted in support of the common resolution on the position of the WTO panel concerning the banana industry; this resolution was adopted by 286 votes in favour, 124 against with 14 abstentions."
"The adoption of this resolution give grounds for satisfaction and hope."
"Satisfaction since some three years ago we were the only group here that condemned the flaws in the Marrakesh and GATT agreements."
"When we expressed our views virtually the only group to support us was the Greens."
"At the ACP conference in Libreville and later in Dakar, together with my colleague, Dominique Souchet, I raised the problem of compatibility of the system of generalized preferences with the GATT agreement."
"We received formal assurances from the Commission that there was no incompatibility."
"What is happening today shows that we were right."
"Hope lies in the fact that our colleagues, who in this particular matter are aware of the problems with the GATT and WTO, see the difficulties in far more general terms, in the way we have always condemned, as did our late president Jimmy Goldsmith."
"We believe that the WTO's attempts to maintain free trade in the area of the banana trade should be supported rather than opposed."
"Free trade is an important instrument for ensuring that, in the long term, all the banana producing countries concerned will be able to function as equals in the global market."
"We also believe that the type of intervention taking place in the banana market obstructs the rights of consumers to choose products on the basis of price and quality, as well as on the basis of environmental considerations and a sense of social and international responsibility."
"In addition, interventions in free trade and supply controls on the European market obstruct a necessary adaptation of food production to market conditions and to necessary demands to settle the global food situation."
"We believe that the issue of the banana trade is being handled on the basis of all the important aspects involved in this issue, including, amongst others, environmental aspects, social conditions for plantation workers, the economic situation of small growers and taking into consideration the difficulties which exist for the one-sided trade dependency of several countries."
"These are aspects which cannot be dealt with through obstacles to the free trade in bananas or through supply intervention on the European market for bananas."
"Each difficulty connected with the production and trading of bananas must be dealt with through measures specially designed for each difficulty of that kind."
"I voted no to this resolution because I think there were only imperialist arguments on the part of the EU not to follow the WTO's decision on this issue."
"In my opinion there are no reasons, whether ecological or economic, why the EU should have such a narrow view regarding the import of bananas as to mean that, in principal, it only approves imports from ACP countries."
"There are other countries, apart from ACP countries, which are dependent on exports of bananas."
"We could therefore just as well buy from these countries as from ACP countries."
"I do, however, agree with the criticism that the WTO is only considering free trade and is forgetting other important values."
"There are other values which must be taken into consideration before the WTO makes decisions, including the environmental effects."
"But as I said, on this issue I think that the WTO has made the right decision."
"Our group signed the draft joint resolution on the OCM for the banana industry."
"It is surprising that both the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People's Party refused to sign that draft joint resolution, even though the PSE rallied to it in extremis ."
"This reflects the lack of enthusiasm shown by the two political groups that numerically dominate this Parliament and that share the same free trade, globalist and federalist philosophy when the aim is to defend the interests of European banana producers, especially those in our overseas French departments and the interests of banana production in the ACP countries."
"We all know that the shaping of Europe rests on the principles of Community preference (Treaty of Rome) and on the preservation of the economic interests of the ACP countries with whom the EU Member States have committed under an agreement of original, specific and close co-operation (Lomé Agreements)."
"Why then, on behalf of the GATT and the WTO, must we sacrifice the interests of our producers and those of the countries with whom we have been tied under international accords for so many years?"
"In my contribution during the debate and in my explanation on the Helms-Burton law I asked whether the WTO was not acting as the secular arm of the United States, pointing out the extent to which it effectively defended US interests during trade globalisation."
"Beyond this, it is also regrettable that the Commission, especially Sir Leon Brittan, wishes to settle the difference of opinion that arose following the Helms-Burton law separately, without even thinking of negotiating the closure of the WTO panel against European and ACP bananas."
"Since the Treaty of Rome, access for bananas into the Community market has always enjoyed special provisions given the particularity of this tropical product which is grown at the extreme periphery of the European Union (overseas departments, Madeira, the Canaries, Crete) and in the former overseas territories that later became the ACP states and with whom we are contractually bound under the terms of the Lomé Convention."
"Community and ACP bananas only represent 30 % of our consumption and cannot compete with bananas from the dollar zone which are produced in Latin America by American multinationals."
"Some speakers have suggested that the European Union should allocate financial aid in order to diversify crops."
"However, in the tropical countries where cyclones are frequent, the diversification of banana crops is very hard to achieve."
"It is important to protect the economy and stability of producers in overseas countries, where wages and social charges match those in the European Union."
"A good trade-off was found with the European common orgnization of the banana market; this system enabled banana producers, including those in the dollar zone, to benefit from access to the European market through import licences."
"It is necessary to maintain these trade-offs at all costs."
"That is why I voted in support of the joint resolution."
"Nuclear power plants in Ukraine"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Green Party voted against the joint resolution because we have not progressed a single step with this resolution as far as the decisive subject is concerned, namely the phased ending of nuclear energy."
"The European Parliament could not even bring itself to support the closure of Chernobyl and not completing reactors R4 and K2."
"Not only have the most serious doubts on safety been ignored, but also the fact that energy from nuclear sources is quite unnecessary in the Ukraine, and that these reactors represent an economic risk."
"We also regret that part of Parliament has still not understood the stupidity of the least cost argument, with regard to the risk of accidents with uninsurable costs, with regard to the unresolved risks involved in disposal of nuclear waste, and with regard to the unsolved problems of safety in routine operation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the political ultimatum of the Ukrainian Government - and this is what it seems to be about - not to shut down Chernobyl if international funding for R4 and K2 is not forthcoming, must not be allowed to succeed."
"On the contrary, falling energy demand and the potential for enormous savings will permit Ukraine to close down all nuclear power stations, and we regret that the European Parliament has not promoted this environmental measure, which is so important for Europe."
"Mr President, yesterday's debate merely skirted around the issue."
"The Commission's answers were woolly and completely unsatisfactory."
"I should just like to draw attention to one point: we have been spending Phare and Tacis funds for years."
"Now we have before us a study about how much improvement there has been in safety, and the study comes to the staggering conclusion that there has been absolutely no improvement in safety."
"The Commission has also contracted a study and up to now it has refused to put this at Parliament's disposal."
"This study comes to the same conclusion."
"We are once again about to agree the completion of two scrap reactors that are quite incapable of completion because the technology is not compatible, and still, after almost eleven years, this scrap reactor in Chernobyl is running."
"I say that we should at long last complete the sealed sacophagus and make money available for that."
"But it is scandalous how health, even that of future generations, is placed at risk."
"I have voted against it, because this was not a clear statement and it was not representative of Parliament's purpose."
"Umberto Scapagnini's question on the closure of Chernobyl and the completion of the Khmelnitsky 2 et Rovno 4 reactors deserves our full attention."
"I support this without any hesitation."
"All these issues are giving considerable cause for concern."
"There is really no time to lose."
"Without pre-empting the response of the Commission, it is essential that the loans for both these reactors be granted."
"I trust that safety criteria in the design and construction of the Khmelnitsky 2 et Rovno 4 reactors will be strictly adhered to."
"I believe that the necessary inspections will be conducted."
"More generally, Mr Scapagnini's question concerns the application of the Euratom Treaty and the undertakings given in the European Energy Charter."
"These treaties bind the states that ratify them and it is important that industrial companies enact them, particularly in the nuclear industry."
"The concern of people on environmental issues is being expressed with greater urgency - and rightly so."
"In the nuclear energy field we should exercise greater transparency, which is still not always the case today."
"For the time being nuclear power is a necessary source of energy but not at any cost and under any conditions."
"Moreover, the future also requires that we think about alternative solutions to try and safeguard our already damaged environment and our safety from all aspects."
"Today, Thursday, the Austrian Members of the Group of the European People's Party rejected the joint resolution by five groups - including the PPE and the PSE - concerning the financing and completion of the Ukrainian nuclear reactors Khmelnitsky2 and Rovno4."
"The Austrian Members' explanation of vote is that they are obviously in favour of parliamentary support for the development of a comprehensive energy strategy, as contained in the resolution."
"We are also in favour of the Commission making its position and future policy on nuclear safety clear, and of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development declaring its position."
"But in this resolution it is not even clear that the proposers are against the construction of new nuclear power stations."
"Nor can the amendments from individual groups be agreed, especially not that of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, which, whilst it was very praiseworthy in supporting efforts to develop a unified energy strategy, on the other hand quite clearly declared that the G7 states and Ukraine must maintain the December 1995 agreement promising the completion of both nuclear power stations."
"Austria has also declared to the President of the EBRD that it was ready to finance and support the modification of calorific power stations in the Ukraine, but at the same time it declared its strict opposition to the completion or further construction of nuclear power stations."
"It is well known that the juxtaposition of old Russian and new Western technologies would produce a hermaphrodite system, which would be a major safety risk for the future."
"This has been proven beyond reasonable doubt by foreign and Austrian studies."
"Nuclear power is not safe."
"Unfortunately, there have been many accidents, including Chernobyl."
"In spite of this, the work on closing the remaining reactors in Chernobyl is progressing very slowly."
"In my opinion, it is remarkable that the accidents, and the terrible effects these accidents have had, are not enough for people to bring about a closure of nuclear power."
"Instead, to a large extent the Commission is encouraging the building of new reactors, Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4, in Ukraine."
"That is something I cannot accept."
"No EU funds should go towards the construction of new reactors."
"The money should instead go to aid for developing renewable energy sources, so that the eastern European countries can have a functioning energy structure based on energy sources which are part of an ecologically sustainable society."
"Nuclear power is a non-renewable energy source which should therefore be phased out of the energy system as soon as possible."
"My homeland has finally taken the first step towards phasing out nuclear power by deciding to close the Barsebäck power station starting next year."
"Against this background, I have today voted no to the European Parliament's resolution on this issue."
"The Danish Social Democrats are voting yes to the resolution on the closure of the nuclear power station at Chernobyl."
"It is irresponsible to continue producing energy with reactors of the same type that was the cause of the major accident in 1985."
"But we would like to draw attention to the fact that the problem of the poor safety of nuclear power stations is far from being solved by closing the power station at Chernobyl."
"There are, amongst other things, major safety problems at the large Ignalina nuclear power station in Lithuania."
"The European Union has a duty to offer the Lithuanian people a helping hand in the same way as we are doing in connection with Chernobyl."
"Illegal imports of CFCs"
"Mr President, we are alarmed at the discovery of illegal imports into the European Union of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs, a product deemed to be largely responsible for the hole in the ozone layer and production of which has been banned within the European Union since 1995."
"We are especially worried in that recently discovered illegal imports from China concerned huge quantities - 1, 000 tonnes in one case, 150 in another - which are clearly only the visible tip of an enormous iceberg."
"However, the debate that has been conducted hitherto in this chamber does not raise all the issues, in our view."
"It has mainly been said that the European Union should not just ban production, but also the import and sale of CFCs within Member States."
"This is obviously sensible."
"The current situation is inconsistent and the Europe of Nations group is also urging the governments of Member States assembled within the Council to take steps to impose a total ban on imports."
"We also hope that the Montreal Protocol on the protection of the ozone layer will be tightened up to quickly ban the production of CFCs in all countries."
"However, a crucial question that has received very little attention is how will these bans be monitored?"
"While the anti-fraud unit of the Commission - the UCLAF - has had the merit of discovering several fraudulent operations, this is clearly not the full extent of fraud."
"According to the independent environment investigation agency, Europe is at the heart of the worldwide illegal trade in CFCs."
"But why Europe?"
"Because in this sector as in many others, the huge mess created by the abolition of internal border checks facilitates all kinds of illegal trading."
"Imports may enter a country by exploiting a weak link in the chain and then circulate freely anywhere!"
"This is the key problem we face currently face in the illegal trafficking of CFCs and I take this opportunity to point out that the ozone layer is also damaged by methyl bromide, a pesticide widely used in agriculture."
"To remedy the situation we must promote agriculture that is far more environmentally friendly, but this is another issue that I hope we will have the opportunity to discuss during the Agenda 2000 project."
"Helms-Burton Act"
"We voted in favour of the joint resolution on the Helms-Burton Act which has the merit of clearly and firmly stating the unacceptable face of extra-territorial legislation."
"The pyrrhic victory gained by the Commission must not suggest that Europeans complacently accept practices and principles that are so radically opposed to international law."
"So why did the Commission refrain from asking the WTO to arbitrate in this dispute?"
"Did it fear that the WTO would not give the United States the same treatment as it did the European Community in regard to hormoneinjected meat, and the developing countries in regard to bananas?"
"Was this an implicit acknowledgement that since the WTO in reality acts as the secular arm of the United States, which imposes its own concept and vision of globalism, it is preferable to negotiate and empirically accept a few concessions by refraining from invoking the exercise of the law?"
"However, if we decide to negotiate because we deem that it is the best way to defend European interests, we must negotiate well."
"Why then was no attempt made to obtain the withdrawal of the American claim against hormoneinjected meat and bananas in return for the withdrawal of the claim of the European Union against the HelmsBurton Act?"
"Situation in Algeria"
"We voted in favour of the resolution on Algeria presented after a compromise between several political groups in Parliament."
"However, we believe that the resolution could be clearer in a sharp criticism of both the Islamic fundamentalist terrorist groups' dreadful outrages and lack of respect for human dignity and the Algerian government's crimes against democracy and human rights."
"The statement should also point out one of the important reasons for the economic and social crisis in Algeria, i.e. the large debt which the International Monetary Fund, amongst others, is demanding that the country should repay."
"The Group Union for Europe regrets the fact that it was unable to join in the vote on the common resolution on the situation in Algeria."
"Indeed, while it is urgent to condemn and deplore the unspeakable massacres perpetrated against the Algerian people by groups of terrorists, it should also be mentioned that this country has recently held democratic elections which have enabled all sections of Algerian society to be represented in the country's parliament and government."
"Our assembly has always had relations with the representatives of the Algerian people through its interparliamentary delegation."
"There is therefore no need to form an ad hoc delegation as the common draft resolution proposes, and we feel it is essential to draw on existing parliamentary structures on both sides, possibly enlarging them to include a few members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"For this reason we will be abstaining."
"I believe that this Parliament has rarely made such an exhibition of itself or shown itself to be so completely powerless as yesterday during the debate on the situation in Algeria."
"The meeting between Algerian and European Parliaments that was so heatedly argued for by almost all the speakers will of course not solve anything at all and was merely non-committal ""show politics' which sensible people can only treat with contempt."
"Nobody could accuse me of having the slightest sympathy for the murderers who are carrying out the Islamic reign of terror in Algeria."
"We can, of course, ask ourselves what the difference is between a possible ISF regime in Algeria, on the one hand, and the Islamic terror regimes supported so keenly by the West in countries such as Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, on the other hand."
"However, I still remember that the misery begun in January 1992, when the first democratic elections in Algeria - still in the name of democracy - were prevented by a military coup."
"I also remember that the Socialist NLF dictatorship in Algeria after decolonization was literally swamped by French and European support and by expressions of praise from the so-called intelligentsia in Europe."
"It is these socialists who have changed Algeria in less than thirty years from a relatively rich and prosperous country into a backward developing country with great poverty, where millions of people see the only way out through Islamic fundamentalism."
"As things are at the moment, I do not believe that Europe has a big part to play in that country."
"As European politicians, we have no lessons to teach the Algerians."
"We must, on the contrary, ensure that the Islamic advance does not strike our own continent."
"I wish my fellow Members of Parliament were as motivated about that as they are about possible trips to Algeria."
"Moorhouse report (A4-259/97)"
"Faced with the problems raised by the creation of balanced economic relations between the European Union and Japan, it was desirable to evaluate these ties."
"Regarding the current state of these relations, I share the opinion of the committee's rapporteur."
"Having said that, while I approve the moves which ultimately should strengthen and balance our trade relations with Japan, I am worried about one of the points that affect deregulation."
"I fear that the latter is decidedly against our Community interests."
"I refer to the textile industry in which firms must apply existing legislation - often ignored by the competition that is slow to enforce it."
"The automotive sector would probably be one of the first to suffer the effects of deregulation applied rigorously by the European Union."
"The automotive industry - one of Europe's industrial mainstays - will have to undergo restructuring in the next ten years."
"We should be mindful of the consequences that may prove disastrous for jobs in this sector, indeed for its very future."
"I approve this communication but I will remain vigilant over the enactment of this new approach towards Japan by opposing any hasty move, any unbridled liberalism and above all any step taken to impose rules and constraints upon us which will be ignored by the competition."
"We have abstained from voting on the report on 'Europe and Japan: the next steps' by Mr Moorhouse."
"We are in favour of developing and improving relations between the EU and Japan."
"However, we believe that the report only concentrates on economics and trade without showing any interest at all in important areas such as culture and the environment."
"As far as the trade issues are concerned, we are critical of many of Japan's technical trade barriers, but we can sympathise with the existence of state monopolies."
"We do not share the report's positive view of Japan's participation in UN forces, but instead share the critical view of the Japanese peace movement."
"For these reasons we have chosen to abstain."
"A rapprochement between the EU and Japan is positive."
"Human rights, international peace, relations with China, Russia and Korea, questions of nuclear weapons, the environment, trade, deregulation and the WTO are important areas of cooperation."
"I have also voted yes to the report in the hope that the endless talk of competition between the EU, the USA and Japan can be toned down in favour of cooperation and dialogue."
"Garosci report (A4-254/97)"
"I have supported Mr Garosci's report today as I share his welcome for the Commission's long overdue recognition of the importance of commerce."
"Twenty-two million people across the EU work in commerce as part of the wider tertiary sector which is outperforming other parts of the European economy."
"This sector is not just about economics but about communities."
"Mr Garosci is right to ask for the burden of unnecessary regulations to be lifted from small retailers especially."
"Small neighbourhood shops are part of the communities they serve."
"We have all seen too many areas where the closed shop fronts are a sign of a run-down neighbourhood."
"Looking to the future, it is also important to consider the unfairness of Internet-style selling not being subject to VAT whilst traditional shops are."
"The Commission should take up the idea of looking for an international answer to this question."
"However, the technology of electronic payment systems could also allow us to reduce the opportunity for criminals to steal from vulnerable small shops, reducing the amount of cash held there."
"I hope that the potentially useful ideas in the Green Paper and this report now lead to practical policies to help our local shops enjoy a successful future."
"After two years of work, the Commission is now submitting its Green Paper on commerce to us."
"It examines the structure and development of the commerce and distribution sector, the second largest economic activity in the Union, employing 22 million people - 16 per cent of the total labour force - in about 4.5 million firms."
"So this is a key sector, both for the economy and for employment."
"I congratulate Mr Garosci on his exhaustive analysis of the current situation in this sector and the challenges it faces, and it is a pity that the statistics he had available, provided by the Commission, are no longer current."
"Competition in the commerce sector has grown with the growth in trade and the enlargement of the market, reflecting the need to adapt to the changes that are taking place and to respond to the evolution of consumer needs and desires."
"So it is essential to train staff, provide vocational courses for young people and develop a specialized labour force adapted to the way new technologies are modernizing the sector."
"Vocational training also allows even small and medium-sized firms and micro-businesses to keep up with the growth process in the sector, driving forward the creation of SMEs linked together in cross-border commerce, in line with the principle of economic and social cohesion which the Commission must support with concrete measures through the structural funds and innovative projects."
"And the role of the Member States must not be forgotten, especially as regards the regulation of access to credit."
"To make business conditions more flexible for firms, a simplification of Community legislation, taking account of the situation in individual states, is desirable, and is particularly important to this sector."
"Finally, I would mention that the sector needs to be paid special attention with a view to the introduction of the Euro and the impact, not just economic, that this will have on the market."
"Palacio Vallelersundi report (A4-265/97)- Situation in Algeria"
"Mr President, the convention on extradition between Member States of the European Union which reconciles the general definitions and principles of this procedure in the various countries was concluded within a short time frame according to a purely inter-governmental method."
"This therefore refutes the claim that is widespread in this chamber that only the community method works."
"In reality, when a given need, such as in the area of security, is strongly felt by members, the intergovernmental method works very well."
"True, it does not work when the need is not felt or when one of the parties makes exorbitant or over-constraining claims on other partners, but must we bemoan this fact?"
"No, of course, not!"
"On the contrary, the intergovernment approach in this case serves to regulate the exorbitant claims that cannot be adequately countered by the community method."
"Caution is essential in the issues we are discussing here since they directly impact the exercise of public liberties and this is why - quite rightly - the intergovernmental method has been chosen for this agreement."
"How can we improve this procedure while respecting its form?"
"It would be worthwhile to begin by securing consensus between the partners whereby the agreement can be enacted between the signatories without waiting for all the different ratifications."
"Secondly, I believe that we should seek a procedure to ensure more effective monitoring of the agreement by national parliaments, as already proposed by the Europe of Nations Group."
"On the other hand, we feel it unnecessary and even totally counter-productive to provide for the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice or the systematic involvement of the European Parliament."
"These institutions, with their exaggerated claims and obsession of always requests texts that follow their own subjective aims, would arouse negative reactions that we must avoid at all costs on subjects as sensitive as these."
"Mr President, I voted for Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi's resolution, but in the recorded vote I voted against paragraph 11 of the resolution on the reservations entered to this convention by Greece and Portugal, for different reasons."
"I voted against because the reference to Portugal is factually wrong."
"The Portuguese reservation is not based on the same grounds as the Greek reservation."
"Under its constitution, Portugal does not allow extradition when the country seeking it applies the death penalty or whole life imprisonment."
"And this is what is involved."
"The recent constitutional review carried out in Portugal maintains this prohibition, rightly in my opinion."
"I do not think we could approve the wording of paragraph 11 here, especially as it is factually wrong in its reference to Portugal."
"The protocol of the Amsterdam Treaty on this matter of extradition seems to me to resolve the matter satisfactorily in the context of progressive construction of an area of freedom and justice."
"That is the reason for my declaration of vote."
"We have chosen to abstain from voting on this report."
"This question is complicated and must be considered carefully."
"Of course society should have powerful tools to bring about freedom, security and justice, as the report states."
"However, that cannot be allowed to happen at the price of jeopardising the legal rights of individual citizens."
"We are sceptical about several points in this report:"
"Point C of the draft report talks of introducing an automatic extradition procedure in the long term."
"We consider it far too hasty to declare oneself in favour of this purely in principal.-We are also very sceptical about giving the European Court of Justice jurisdiction to interpret and decide on the extradition of citizens above the national courts.We have the greatest faith that the justice ministers of the Member States will together arrive at a solution on how intergovernmental police co-operation can be organised effectively in the battle against crime."
"However desirable closer cooperation in the area of the criminal law may be, having in mind the Europe-wide increase in organized crime, it must not be overlooked that the Agreement discards very significant basic principles of extradition law. Some of these latter also have the effect of reducing the protection provided by one's own citizenship."
"The reservations voiced by Member States, repeatedly regretted in the report before us, are from that point of view perfectly understandable."
"Criminal law is - viewed historically - a basic characteristic of the sovereignty of a state. This is why, at this stage of development, one must obviously acknowledge - as Amsterdam has shown - that neither a further unification of the criminal law nor the progressive relinquishment of sovereign authority has the support of citizens."
"Apart from that, the convention is conspicuous for the absence of discussion on procedural problems and the guarantee of constitutional minimum standards."
"For these reasons we are unable to support the resolution."
"Firstly, in the short term the report's proposal means reduced legal certainty because of a lack of clarity about the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice."
"In the longer term it means increased supranationalism."
"The report also supports the restrictions on the right of asylum found in the Amsterdam Treaty, which we find unacceptable."
"We have therefore voted no to the report."
"The vote against paragraph 11 of the Palacio Vallelersundi report is based on respect for the ""constitutional identity' of Member States, a principle for which there is a special proviso both in the Treaty on European Union and long before that in Community law and precedent."
"Moreover, it is through this identity that the Member States contribute to a common legal culture."
"Portugal was the first country to abolish the death penalty and whole life imprisonment."
"In the case of the abolition of the death penalty, this is already a common feature of European identity itself, in that it is no longer applied in any country of the Union."
"The text of paragraph 11 is also outdated in relation to Portugal since, in the case of whole life imprisonment or sentences of indeterminate length, the recent constitutional review allows extradition subject to the existence of reciprocal mechanisms guaranteeing that such sentences will not be effectively applied or carried out."
"So defending our ""constitutional identity' does not imply any lack of confidence in the legal mechanisms of the other Member States. We have full confidence in them and seek to collaborate increasingly closely with them in the fight against crime and terrorism."
"We hope we will receive the same confidence in return, as we are not and we never will be a refuge or sanctuary for criminals, but, on the contrary, a particularly safe and peaceful country, as millions of our fellow European citizens in the other Member States can already testify."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.20 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Mr President, under Rule 22 of the Rules of Procedure, I draw your attention to the fact that you want us, as Members, to give you an exact account of what we do, at what time."
"We started this meeting three minutes late."
"Secondly, after the House broke up at 1.00 p.m., I went to the Members' restaurant where I spoke with other colleagues about the business of the House."
"I have the bill from the restaurant which I will give to administration."
"I went to the intergroup on tourism affairs where I spent half an hour."
"Alas, I must tell you that I have no ticket for the toilets, where I also went quickly in between."
"Next time I will see to it that you get an account of that as well so that under Rule 22 of the Rules of Procedure the Bureau has a full account of my activities in this House as a Member."
"I do not think that I have to render account to the members of the Bureau, but rather to my electorate."
"Thank you very much, Mr Wijsenbeek."
"We would all like to have it in duplicate, and we look forward to receiving these regular reports, but perhaps you could submit a written report rather than using Parliamentary time to deliver a verbal report each time."
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Shortly before lunch Mr Tomlinson raised a question about the resolution on Ethiopia."
"Parliament's services have now looked into the matter and ascertained that Mr Tomlinson, as usual, is right."
"Point D has been corrected accordingly, so I hope Mr Tomlinson is satisfied with that."
"I thank the presidency and its services for checking this so quickly."
"But it is a matter for substantial concern that preamble D actually says that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, in its 53rd session expressed its condemnation ."
"That is what this text says."
"There was no such condemnation."
"Therefore I believe all the ensuing comments, which are highly prejudicial, should be deleted from the text - all of them."
"It then goes on to talk about continuing violation of human rights in Ethiopia."
"If there was no decision, everything else is supposition."
"This is no way for a Parliament that is supposed to be serious to conduct its foreign policy and relations with other countries in other parts of the world."
"Either the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, in its 53rd session did express condemnation, or it did not ."
"I hope that rather than change a word, we should delete the whole of preamble D because it is tendentious nonsense which holds this Parliament up to ridicule with the rest of the world."
"Mr Tomlinson, it appears to me that there are two problems here."
"One is that there was an actual error."
"That has now been corrected."
"Then you say, and I understand well what you are saying, that the following two sentences are also tendentious."
"If people agree with you, and there are perhaps many Members who do, the conclusion is that they must vote against."
"I do not think that I can sit here as President and let the whole point be deleted. So I hope you will accept that it remains, and perhaps I should read it out as it now reads:"
"Amend Recital D as follows: ' D. Noting that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, in its 53rd session, discussed the violation of human rights in Ethiopia, including extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, deaths in custody, torture, rape, arbitrary and politically motivated arrests and detentions and the oppression by the authorities of ethnic and religious minorities' ."
"This was discussed."
"This is what it says."
"If you do not like this, then you should vote against it."
"It would be helpful if you added at the end of the sentence that it discussed them without coming to a conclusion."
"I wonder whether as President I am authorized to do that."
"The solution is to vote against it if you do not like it or you could put this as an oral amendment if everybody accepts that but I am afraid some will object to it."
"I, as President, cannot do that so it will go forward as it stands."
"You have corrected the factual error; the political error can be corrected by voting it down."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yet another resolution on Cyprus."
"One more resolution full of nice words of support for Cyprus and full of advice to Turkey and to Mr Denktash."
"What is the result?"
"Absolutely nothing."
"Neither Mr Denktash nor Turkey, and I regret to have to say this, neither the Council nor the Commission attach any significance to the resolutions of the European Parliament."
"And if that was not enough we also have paragraph 5, which refers to the S300s."
"Ladies and gentlemen, are you not aware that in occupied Cyprus there has been a Turkish army of occupation for twenty three years?"
"Are you not aware that there are 40, 000 Turkish soldiers in Cyprus?"
"Are you not aware that there are heavy weapons?"
"Are you not aware that there are tanks and aeroplanes?"
"In the name of what legal authority of the European Union do you reject the right of the government of Cyprus to organize its own defence?"
"Since you know very well, ladies and gentlemen, that the S300s are weapons of defence and not weapons of aggression, unless we are expecting that one fine morning Mr Denktash will occupy the rest of Cyprus and we will continue to put forward resolutions while the whole of Cyprus falls to the army of occupation."
"Unless, ladies and gentlemen, and I regret to say this but it is the hard truth, we are annoyed that the S300s are purchased from Russia and not from the European Union, that is to say, from France, from Germany or from the United Kingdom, or even from America."
"It seems that when a missile bears a stamp saying 'made in the United States' or 'made in Europe' it is a good missile, since this is the impression that you give me, and I regret that in this resolution, which will have no significance whatsoever, there is this paragraph."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are trying to cover up a reprehensible fact."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"We entered the summer break in the hope that the talks under the auspices of the United Nations between Glafcos Clerides and Raouf Denktash would be successful."
"Once again these hopes were destroyed - hopes that the 23-year-old partition of Cyprus, and the Turkish occupation since 1974 of 37 % of Cypriot territory, might be ended in favour of a solution that would make possible the peaceful co-existence of Greek and Turkish Cypriots."
"These hopes were once more destroyed by the inflexible attitude of Raouf Denktash."
"It is quite unacceptable for Denktash to call for a cessation of the membership talks between the Union and Cyprus."
"It is equally unacceptable for the Turkish Government and the illegal regime in the occupied part of Cyprus to threaten annexation by Turkey of the occupied part, if membership of the EU by Cyprus should take place."
"We reject with disgust and outrage the declaration by Denktash that membership could result in a war in Cyprus."
"When will it be realised that it is high time for the use of reason and most certainly not of weapons?"
"The European Union's resolutions are clear."
"Membership talks with Cyprus begin six months after the government conference: at the beginning of next year, therefore."
"As has been reiterated in Agenda 2000, talks can be held only with the one constitutionally recognized authority, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus."
"I would comment here, that European Ministers should not touch that point either, in private remarks made in public."
"Membership should be to the benefit of all Cypriots, however."
"That is our declared will."
"For that reason ways must be found to include the Turkish Cypriot community in negotiations."
"For despite the current failure of the talks, and despite the escalation of words, I hope for a rapid victory for good sense in the interests of all Cypriots."
"In Agenda 2000 the Union declares its determination to play a positive role in reaching a solution."
"It would be a useful contribution to make it emphatically clear to Turkey yet again that improved relations also depend on a solution in Cyprus."
"We know that Turkey possesses the key to this."
"Mr President, even if it is a compromise, this resolution on Cyprus is worthwhile since on the one hand it condemns the blocking of negotiations, attributable to the Turkish Cypriots, and the new attempts at intimidation by Turkey, and, on the other hand, it reiterates Europe's desire to undertake from the start of 1998 negotiations on membership with the single recognized government, that of the Republic of Cyprus."
"Beyond that, it has to be said that Cyprus currently meets almost all the terms of membership needed to join the European Union."
"The negotiations, once initiated, should not drag on eternally pending a possible agreement, which would be tantamount to yielding to Turkish blackmail."
"I therefore appeal to the Commission so ensure that the negotiations with Cyprus are conducted with all desirable resolve and speed so that Cyprus becomes the sixteenth state of the European Union as soon as possible, even without the final agreement of Mr Denktash and with Turkey."
"Mr President, without a shadow of a doubt there has recently been movement on the Cypriot question and I think that the main reason for this movement is the application of Cyprus to join the European Union."
"Many hopes had indeed been invested in the talks that took place in the United States and in Switzerland between President Clerides and the leader of the Turkish Cypriots, Mr Denktash, but it must be said that those hopes have been vindicated in only a very small part."
"But there has been real progress on humanitarian issues and now there is the prospect of the beginning of talks on security on the island, and it is the wish of all of us, I imagine, in this room to see the complete demilitarisation of Cyprus."
"These positive developments, however, do not change the picture that emerged during the negotiations."
"What is this picture?"
"The picture that emerged is that the Greek Cypriots agreed with the ideas of the United Nations, there was 90 % agreement, they accepted them fully and I think that nobody can claim that the United Nations is an organ of the Greek Cypriots. On the other hand the Turkish Cypriots and Mr Denktash showed complete intransigence and at the same time there were threats of the annexation of the northern section of Cyprus by Turkey, and also threats of war if the accession of Cyprus to the European Union went ahead."
"In any case, the accession of Cyprus is a decision that has been taken. Negotiations begin in April and we all hope that the Turkish Cypriots will be an organic part of the state that will, at some point, become a member of the European Union."
"For this to happen, pressure must be exerted on Turkey to find a solution and to encourage all those forces in Turkey who want this to happen and who believe in a solution to the Cypriot question and in the accession of Cyprus to the European Union."
"Because there are forces in Turkey who realise that the European Union is a guarantor of the human rights of all the people of Cyprus, and that the Turkish Cypriots will be the first to benefit financially from accession. They realise that Turkey, through the Turkish Cypriots, will have an, albeit indirect, part to play in the European Union, and, last but not least, that it will improve its image, free from charges of intransigence and aggression."
"Let us therefore encourage the progressive forces of Turkey."
"Mr President, as has been mentioned, this is the nth resolution on Cyprus."
"I would say this resolution makes sense if the Commissioner can reassure us during this debate on what is being asked."
"That is, if he can reassure us that initiatives will immediately be taken to try to review the Turkish Cypriot community's boycott of the negotiations."
"Furthermore, it is important for the Commissioner to reassure us that the Commission intends to keep faith with its own declarations: in particular I believe the Commission should immediately confirm that the current difficulties are due solely and exclusively to the fact that Turkey remains a country in military occupation of another country."
"It is also crucial to confirm that, in the face of the boycott, the European Union will continue the negotiations with the only internationally recognized authority, that is, the government of Cyprus."
"Finally, I think it would be helpful if I responded to something Mrs Roth said in her speech."
"The position taken by an Italian minister was a personal position, and the Italian government has confirmed that it is entirely in line with the position of the European Union."
"I just wanted to make that clear on behalf of my country."
"Mr President."
"I think we should really make an effort here to discriminate between the current moment and the general development."
"At the current time it is clear that we must express ourselves unambiguously against the way Raouf Denktash's attitude sabotaged the peace talks, which had begun optimistically."
"Whilst obeying international law, however, we must not fail to remember that the Cypriot conflict is somewhat more complex, that there are two sides, and that it is of vital important for peace that Cypriots make peace amongst themselves, distancing themselves from false friends on both sides of the sea."
"That is the key to the problem, and one may get a little applause here for attacks on Turkey, where one can find much to criticise."
"Raouf Denktash has made impossible demands, yet there can be no peace in Cyprus without an agreement with the Turkish Cypriot side as well, and for this one must seek new ways."
"This is not an argument for departure from any sort of resolution, but a plea for fantasy, imagination and initiative."
"Mr President, Denktash has in fact slammed the door on the negotiations which initially seemed to have been opened with such imagination by the United Nations."
"He set unacceptable prior conditions and the reaction of the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey was as expected."
"However, every effort must still be made to find a solution to the dispute and to make clear that Cypriot entry to the European Union cannot be blocked by the fact that peace has not yet been achieved on the island."
"The reaction of the Union was the right one."
"The Commission gave the right signal."
"The accession negotiations with Cyprus must begin in 1998 - at the beginning of the year - and the Union must consequently stick to its position: the illegal occupation regime in northern Cyprus cannot be recognized and as such cannot take part in negotiations."
"The negotiations on the Cypriot dispute must be carried out independently of the accession talks."
"We must build on the successes such as the progress made in the humanitarian field."
"The announcement that security problems will also be discussed soon is an encouraging sign."
"The over-supply of arms makes the dispute on the island all the more explosive."
"Perhaps agreements on the limitation of weapon imports would be a good first step."
"Mr President, recent developments bear witness to the fact that, unfortunately, we are now facing the worst situation regarding the Cypriot problem since 1974."
"There is a serious danger that the island will finally be partitioned."
"Responsibility for this lies in the policy that is being conducted in the region by the United States and NATO."
"The move for the accession of Cyprus into the European Union, while seen by many as the catalyst for the solution of the Cyprus question, is already being transformed into an instrument of pressure and blackmail against the legally elected government of the Republic of Cyprus, and allows Turkey, with the indulgence not only of the European Union but also of the governments of certain Member States, to undermine any prospect whatsoever for a just and honourable solution to the Cypriot problem."
"The only contribution of the present resolution is that it acts to remind us of the problem and of the responsibilities that exist."
"For this reason I also endorse the resolution."
"Mr President, now that the question of Cyprus is again on the agenda, I must just remind you that in December 1995, this Parliament, with a very large majority and without setting conditions, approved a customs union with Turkey and in addition billions in financing from the European Union to Turkey."
"We nevertheless already knew then, in December 1995, that since 1974 Turkey has militarily occupied part of Cyprus and furthermore is actually carrying out a policy of cultural genocide there."
"We also knew at that time that the entry of Cyprus into the European Union would become particularly problematic owing to this Turkish occupation."
"It seems to me in all honesty a bit ridiculous, now, in this resolution, to point out in a friendly way to the Turkish government, the fact that, and I quote, constructive relations between Turkey and the European Union depend partly upon the policy concerning Cyprus."
"The Turkish policy with regard to Cyprus is after all well known and one can perhaps reproach the Turkish government for it but we can certainly not blame the Turkish government for not speaking in clear terms about it."
"Not then, in December 1995, and not now."
"The difference is that in December 1995, we could have thrashed things out around the table and now, all we can do is make a protest on paper."
"This will of course not stop me from approving the paper protest because it may after all still make a small contribution to letting Turkey, our neighbour country and NATO partner, know that the best possible neighbours can only remain so if first of all the Turkish occupation troops leave Cyprus and certainly if the Turkish threat of war, because that is what it is, ceases."
"Mr President, the solution to the Cypriot crisis lies in the rediscovery of a Cypriot identity based on values of tolerance and mutual respect, putting aside ethnic hatred and divisions based on retrospective nationalist appeals."
"If the Greek Cypriots felt more Cypriot than Greek and the same was true of the Turkish Cypriots, and both Greece and Turkey collaborated in the birth of a new nation which was neither pro-Greek nor pro-Turkish, perhaps this situation could be brought to an end."
"Europe could send a peace contingent to guarantee the birth of a federal state which would respect cultural and religious autonomy, where the different identities could be reconstructed."
"That is the Alleanza Nazionale proposal."
"To achieve this, it is obvious that the European Union must put the maximum political, commercial and economic pressure on Turkey to withdraw its troops from the island, just as the Greek Cypriot community must mute its desire for revenge."
"Otherwise it would be better to close the chapter on Cypriot membership of the Union and regard Cyprus as just like all the other crisis areas we assiduously and hopelessly concern ourselves with."
"Mr President, the Commission welcomes the motions for resolutions regarding the political situation following the UN sponsored talks on Cyprus in Troutbeck and Montreux."
"The Commission fully supports the efforts under the auspices of the UN to work towards a political settlement and regrets that at the talks in August in Montreux there was no progress."
"However, let me make it quite clear that accession negotiations with Cyprus will start six months after the conclusion of the IGC in conformity with the Council decision of 6 March 1995."
"The Commission shares the view expressed by the UN Secretary-General that the decision to open negotiations should be seen as a positive development which could promote the search for a political settlement."
"Together with the Council, the Commission looks to the leaders of the two communities to resume their direct negotiations and urges that they, and all parties concerned, should in the meantime work and act constructively and in good faith to promote the success of those negotiations."
"In this context, the Commission welcomes the recent announcement of a forthcoming meeting between President Clerides and Mr Denktash to discuss security matters and the decision to continue direct contacts on humanitarian issues."
"As requested by the Council, the Commission will continue to inform the Turkish Cypriot community about the advantages of accession to the European Union."
"Thank you very much, Mr Pinheiro."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following six motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0762/97 by Mr Dell'Alba and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina; -B4-0765/97 by Mrs Aelvoet and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina; -B4-0774/97 by Mr Swoboda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina; -B4-0782/97 by Mr Cars and Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina; -B4-0789/97 by Mr Oostlander and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina; -B4-0791/97 by Mrs Pack and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on Sandzak, former Yugoslavia."
"Mr President, the Group of the European Radical Alliance to which I belong will probably vote in support of the resolution."
"However, we cannot overlook a certain number of contradictions related to this resolution."
"The first is that in the preambles, the European institutions express their full support for the return of a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-confessional society."
"Moreover, paragraph 6 in particular mentions that we should approve the attitudes currently observed with respect to a person who today holds an official post in the Republika Srpska and who for a long time, according to his own statements, worked closely with Karadzic and Mladic."
"The fact that we must continue being favourably disposed towards this person because he now apparently defends the legitimate state is worrying or at least puzzling."
"I believe that the crucial point in this text is the one that defends the permanent presence of the SFOR, which in our view is probably the only way to avoid a replica of the programmed massacre of the kind we have seen ordered by the persons already named."
"As a member of the delegation which observed the elections in Bosnia, I have to say immediately that we must recognize with satisfaction the fact that the elections took place without incident and in a satisfactory manner from the formal point of view."
"This is a step forward both for the implementation of the Dayton agreements, and for going further than the Dayton agreements."
"But having said that, I think it is also important to say that good formal results are not enough."
"The situation needs to move forward and this will only happen if we are successful, starting from the results of the elections, in energizing the interactive relations which need to exist between the various parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"In particular, the result already risks being compromised by the way voters were registered."
"Hence, with the sole and important exception of the city of Tuzla, the result threatens to allow room only for the extremist nationalist parties."
"This situation is a consequence of the way the elections were put in place."
"I hope that we, as a Parliament, as the European Union, will be able to take forward initiatives on the basis of this result, which is important but not sufficient, so that peace can be brought to this area."
"Mr President."
"Firstly may I express the consternation and sorrow of our Party that so many very distinguished people have been killed in the tragic helicopter crash in Bosnia, including Mr Carlos Westendorp's deputy, Mr Wagner, whom I met only a few weeks ago in Sarajevo, and who had achieved a very high reputation in a very short time."
"He had also expressed considerable criticism - perhaps I can quote this as his legacy here - about some things that had prevented Europe speaking with a stronger voice, from playing a stronger role in Bosnia. I would ask the Commissioner most sincerely to do all in his power to see that we do not merely give a lot of money - there is something to be said about that, as well - but really make a more powerful impression in Bosnia for the implementation of our concepts in general."
"Today we are discussing Bosnia not just because there were elections a short time ago, but because, I think, we want to make an unequivocal statement of our view that we cannot and will not allow the peace process to be destroyed."
"This is not a matter of angels, not a case of only good on one side and evil on the other, but it is a case of those who are ready to see the Dayton Process through to a good conclusion - regardless of where they may stand on it individually - needing our complete support."
"Those who cannot refrain from continuing to disrupt this peace process must count on us taking definite measures against them, and I entirely share the view of Carlos Westendorp and the senior Delegate, that we must proceed against them with all severity and must not be afraid of doing so."
"It must not be possible following the end of the war for people still to exist - unfortunately on all sides, but certainly mainly on one side or the other - who hinder the return of refugees, or the operation of this whole programme in which a multi-ethnic Bosnia is being created."
"I should also like to say, Mr Commissioner, that there are cases where even the USA, the Commission or representatives of the Commission hinder the return of refugees to their homelands, and no new groups find entrance, because certain groups of citizens do not wish that to happen."
"I believe one must take a firm stand against that."
"The last point in the resolution is that we, the European countries, should make a lot of money available."
"This money is not always used efficiently."
"The money is also not sufficiently used, or used too late, because there are too few people to administer it as long as experts are at hand."
"I would ask you, Mr Commissioner, to ensure that the money we make available can be more efficiently used, so that we do everything possible towards the restoration and securing of peace in Bosnia."
"Mr President, the day before Karl Habsburg and I arrived as election observers in Bugojno in Bosnia, there was an explosion which destroyed a house."
"Did it have anything to do with the election?"
"The explanation was simpler than that."
"Across the road from the house there was a car park."
"Its Muslim owner could no longer make use of it because it ended up on the 'wrong side' after the war."
"He had therefore sold it to the Croat house-owner."
"That was not good."
"The car park could now be regarded as a Croat area."
"Hence the explosion."
"From car and helicopter we gained a frightening picture of the destruction in Bosnia."
"With systematic precision, tens of thousands of houses have been destroyed, most with the help of ordinary civilian tools."
"Those who lived in them were of the 'wrong kind' ."
"The people in Bosnia belong to the same ethnic group and speak the same language, but history has created a mistrust which ruthless nationalist leaders have been able to exploit for their own ends."
"I admit that I was ashamed of being a human being when I saw in Bosnia how vicious we can be towards our neighbours and work colleagues."
"It is in this Bosnia that local elections have now been held for the first time."
"A requirement for free elections is that the citizens find out what the parties stand for."
"The voters in Bosnia never got that chance. But with international effort, it was possible to carry out the election itself in an acceptable way."
"One outcome of the election is that it has strengthened the Bosnians' democratic awareness."
"They had experience of elections in which the results were decided in advance in the President's Office."
"Now they know that it can be different, that every vote is important."
"The election has also given Bosnia local leaders with authority to act and think in a new way as a result of the voters' trust."
"One may perhaps dare to imagine a light at the end of the tunnel, but the journey there will not be smooth."
"Mr President, I should firstly like to join with those people who expressed their sympathy to the next of kin of those who recently lost their lives in the tragic helicopter accident."
"I also wish to express my appreciation of the fact that Mr Swoboda now says from his group on this occasion once again how important it is to take very harsh action against those who carry out the evil deeds, from whichever side, in BosniaHerzegovina."
"This attitude is shared pretty well throughout the Parliament."
"I believe that to be an extemely important point, particularly with regard to the future."
"We have now had a successful election process."
"I am not going into that in depth now, but I do believe it is very important in particular that it has appeared that Serbs have withdrawn from the influence of their bosses and have gone to vote outside the Serb Republic in the places where they come from."
"I think that is an important achievement."
"In this way, the possibility is also created that criminals who are in power in various places may be cast out of their seats."
"That is naturally very important with regard to the necessary return of refugees and the subsequent building up of the economy."
"Because before that the return of the refugees will be essential."
"I really wish to urge the Commission to provide assistance more forcefully and on a local basis to provide assistance to all communities that really want to get involved in completing the Dayton process."
"I believe it is important to react immediately, in order to provide the conditional assistance quickly and effectively to those people, towns and regions that really want to work together towards the goals of Dayton."
"I hope that it won't all founder in procedures, as did, for example, our pledge to repair a parliament building in Sarajevo, which has sort of become a monument to the impotence of the European Union."
"I wish to insist upon the possibility that the mandate of SFOR be strengthened because of course the return of refugees and the guarantee of the results of these elections cannot be achieved without some force."
"And I also commend, in that regard, the harsher position that SFOR in particular has already taken in respect of the protection of the media and of the radio and television stations in that area of the Serb Republic."
"I would therefore ask the Commission in which way it is adapting its strategy to this successful result in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"I should like to follow what my colleague Oostlander has said, and to thank Mr Swoboda for mentioning the accident which has occurred."
"These were all people who, on behalf of the international community, wanted to help people down there to regain freedom and peace, to make co-operation possible."
"The fact that life has to be sacrificed for this is very sad."
"I hope the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina appreciate that there are people who risk their lives to help them organise the future."
"Now to return to the election which we observed."
"I think we should note that this step towards elections was a very important one towards making this country achieve of peace."
"Without communal elections there can be no multi-ethnic cooperation in this country."
"Without the achievement of these communal elections this cannot happen."
"I should like to remind you that - as my colleague Oostlander has already said - the people in this election voted where they wanted, because they came from there."
"They did not, therefore, vote for the places to which they had been expelled, but for their places of origin."
"I think that is an important sign for us, so that we, the international community, should now try to use the results of these communal elections with the local authorities in order that these people really can return. This should not be in order for us to produce a community without a population, but that the government elected there, the council, should once more have the citizens whom it represents."
"I think this is an important step towards the implementation of Daytona."
"We must obviously take other steps together with the Commission."
"Commissioner van den Broek has promised me this."
"We must be flexible in laying down conditions for aid."
"If a community behaves in such a way that it really implements the results of this election, and in the speediest possible manner, the we must give it the means towards to reconstruction."
"And so that it can be an example and noted by neighbouring communities: if one behaves properly, if one really obeys the agreement, then one will be rewarded."
"That is the only way for us to establish peace and ensure that multi-ethnic cooperation is once again possible."
"Mr President."
"I should like to stress one point, which has, thank goodness, been included in the resolution. This concerns the problems of Sandjak in Novi Pazar, about which we have previously spoken hardly at all, but which present a very serious human rights problem."
"As you know, the Sandjak of Novi Pazar has about 500, 000 Muslims who live between Montenegro and Serbia and who were, even in the past, subject to the most serious oppression."
"Once again there has been deceit, and in the elections the freely elected community council was dissolved, to be replaced by other individuals loyal to Serbia. This is proof that Serbia, and perhaps Montenegro also, - although one must not take the independence of Montenegro too seriously - is simply not prepared to play the game according to the rules we laid down at Daytona."
"I request that everything should be extended to include the Sandjak of Novi Pazar and the rights of that population."
"Mr President, as we are aware, the European Union was represented by a committee of observers with unfortunately only five members, expertly presided over by Mrs Pack."
"As in the previous year, I had the opportunity, together with my colleagues, to see the situation at close hand, and indeed in the extremely sensitive region of Britzko."
"It is clear that in these elections displaced persons expressed their desire to return to their homes, but it is also clear that the implementation of the result of the elections will be beset by many difficulties."
"It is encouraging that in a town like Tuzla the prudent and moderate mayor has been re-elected, but this is not sufficient."
"The ambassador, Mr Frowick, rushed to celebrate before the ballot boxes had been well and truly closed."
"There were problems, however."
"Regarding Britzka especially, everybody agreed that equivocation and confusion reigned for which the organisers were chiefly responsible."
"What must happen?"
"Of course every attempt to rebuild local multiethnic societies must be supported."
"Wherever it happens, the more it happens the better, without, however, actions that may lead to more violence."
"The European Union has spent enormous sums of money intermittently here without having played any substantial political role."
"The Croat entity is the most developed, the Muslim entity attempts to follow and also accepts enormous sums of money from the Organization of Muslim Countries (an American Officer there told us) while the Serbian entity is in a very difficult position."
"Of course the mega question of war crimes still hasn't been resolved."
"Such crimes, however, were committed on all sides and, in any case, those who pay are just ordinary people and the weakest among them at that."
"Bosnia needs every support and help it can get, at all levels and throughout the whole of the region."
"The international armed force, SFOR, also needs to be maintained there, and, and we in this House must emphasise this in particular, the units of unarmed ECMM must also be maintained there, that is to say, of those who have offered so much under the flag of the European Union."
"And when we talk of aid, we are not talking of philanthropy. We are talking of the need of the European Union never to see such conflagrations at its door again."
"Madam President, let me start by saying that the Commission is deeply shocked and saddened by the helicopter accident yesterday in which 10 foreign officials working in Bosnia for peace died and, among them, our very much appreciated Deputy High Representative, Dr Wagner."
"The Commission of course welcomes the successful holding of municipal elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina on 13 and 14 September."
"The high turnout underlines the fact that these elections mark an important step towards democracy."
"But let us not fool ourselves."
"The next vital step will be the enabling the officials elected to take office."
"The Commission calls on the parties to enable this to happen smoothly and rapidly."
"The elections mark a step on the road towards implementing the Dayton agreement, which remains the national communities' and the Commission's firm objective."
"As you may recall, at the ministerial meeting in Sintra last May, we agreed on the need to support those parties who are themselves supporting Dayton and to do what we can to undermine those who are opposing it."
"This explains why the Commission has so warmly welcomed Mrs Plavsic's determination to lead the Republic of Srpska towards the implementation of Dayton and, at the same time, her intention to eliminate corruption in the Republic of Srpska government."
"Unfortunately, the political confusion and the impossibility of being sure that assistance would not be exploited to the profit of Karadzic as well as some legal constraints on the memorandum of understanding governing the programme of assistance to Bosnia, meant that not all the resources at our disposal have been fully utilized."
"I refer to the utilization of ECU 15 million but the non-utilization of ECU 35 million."
"One of the Honourable Members asked the Commission what we intend to do about that."
"We have agreed with the High Representative, Mr Westendorp, that we will work very closely, and as a matter of urgency, with the economic task force in order to identify the best projects that would help the people in Bosnia and help the Dayton process."
"In that sense, support for free media and, just as importantly, support for municipalities that are working to put Dayton into practice - these are the main goals of the Commission following these recent elections in Bosnia."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"Madam President, I am pleased to introduce this motion."
"The situation in Kenya has been going from bad to worse, it seems."
"Not only is the situation bad in human rights terms, with regular violations of human rights, regular beatings by the police, detention without trial, but the situation socially is bad too."
"The schools and hospitals in Kenya do not have the resources they need nor, in some cases, do the local authorities."
"There seems to be discrimination against people according to the tribes they come from."
"Indeed tribal relations are far from good."
"The European Union is a major aid donor to Kenya."
"We know that we can exercise pressure on the Kenyan Government in collaboration with others, pressure that can be effective."
"We know this because recently the ruling party actually made some concessions to the opposition to help create free and fair elections."
"I am grateful to the Commissioner for having met me and a colleague this morning to talk about this situation."
"I would urge him to do all he can to carry out the demands of this motion and bring pressure to bear on the Kenyan Government with a view to free and fair elections and the development of a healthy democracy."
"Madam President, we are now at a rather crucial stage in Kenya, with elections coming up very fast on the horizon."
"We certainly welcome the concessions made by the government and the vote by the parliament on 11 September."
"I have a question I hope the Commissioner can answer."
"When exactly will these reforms take effect?"
"Clearly, if we go on President Moi's past record, he will delay their implementation until after the elections."
"That would not be acceptable to us in Parliament or to the Commission."
"Secondly, how far will the reforms go?"
"In particular, the requirement to have a certain proportion of the votes in a number of regions seems to be the reason why there have been oppression, beatings and intimidation in the Mombasa region."
"Will that also be part of the package?"
"I should like to end with a quotation from a letter which I have received from the Presbyterian Church of East Africa."
"It says, on behalf of the people: ' The people's participation in the affairs of their country is an inalienable right which cannot be denied' ."
"I would commend that to the House."
"Let us do everything we can to support the Kenyan people in the exercise of their democratic rights."
"Madam President, unfortunately we are again forced to concern ourselves with violence and human rights abuses in Kenya."
"Last week's serious disorder, which took many victims, was, I believe, a very clear demonstration of the way the regime is using all possible means to oppose the development of democracy in the country."
"While the interpretation of any individual act of violence is never simple, what does seem certain is that a consistent proportion of the acts of violence are organized and carried out by government forces or forces under the orders of the regime."
"On top of this there is fierce repression of representatives of the opposition forces and the widespread violation of human rights continues."
"Even more dangerous is the outbreak of violence presented as ethnic and religious in origin when it is clearly politically motivated, violence which threatens to destabilize the country permanently."
"There is still one element of hope."
"The recent constitutional reforms approved by the Kenyan Parliament, if they are actually implemented, could begin - only begin - a spiral establishing democracy in the country."
"The prospect of free elections and of putting an end to the extremely protracted authoritarian regime can begin to emerge."
"But to do this it is necessary to continue down the road to reform and above all to build a political dialogue."
"Now, more than ever, the international community can play a positive role to promote that prospect."
"So we call on the Council and the Commission to monitor the situation in Kenya and, above all, using all the available instruments, to bring strong pressure to bear on the Kenyan authorities so that all provocation and violence ceases and does not impede the reform process."
"Then it is necessary to guarantee the maximum possible assistance to the vast number of evacuees created by the violence of the past few months, and it needs to be remembered that there are hundreds of thousands of refugees from other countries in Kenya and that the stability of that country is fundamental for the whole region."
"Madam President."
"Kenya was not always the scene of disorder and brutality."
"I was myself in Nairobi for the World Conference of Women in 1990, when the city peacefully welcomed 13, 000 women."
"That is unthinkable today."
"Everything has changed."
"Today there is the rule of fear, terror and violence by the Police and by gangs."
"Kenya's tourism is under threat as an important source of foreign exchange, neighbouring countries fear that the crisis will cross their borders."
"We appeal to the parties, whether they be in Government or Opposition, not to support any kind of violence, but to turn against any form of terrorism, to enable constitutional reform with the possibility for freedom of expression, and to prepare for free elections."
"This concerns their own race, after all."
"It concerns their own people and their own families."
"Corruption must be combatted and I, too, should like to end with the proposal: the Commission and the Council should make much more use of their opportunity to use article 5 of the Lomé Convention in the ending of human rights abuses on behalf of the population."
"Kenya will be another example of how seriously we take our own human rights clauses, which we insist on having in agreements, and how effectively we are able to enforce them."
"Kenya is a great African country."
"It has played an important role in the past, a peaceful role as well, and it could play this role again, if it should be successful in restoring public order, democracy and the rule of law."
"I think we cannot do enough to try and influence these countries, because we have seen that we are in a position to do so."
"We must support, therefore, all those who are prepared to restore peace and public order."
"Madam President, once again we have to pass a resolution on Kenya - as we did last July - and we have to do so because the Nairobi military authorities continue to promote tension in that country."
"In this way President Arap Moi is putting de facto obstacles in the way of a process of democratization which Kenya has yet to experience and which it badly needs."
"I think the international community should put political and economic pressure on President Arap Moi."
"In effect, I think the Commission should apply all the instruments provided for by article 5 of the Lomé Convention to stop the regime violating human rights and democratic freedoms."
"Like other Members, I think the Commission should make a firm financial and practical commitment to assist the electoral process in every way, because the country needs democratic, transparent, multi-party elections."
"Perhaps this aim, this stage of democracy, can draw the line under the dictatorial regime which, as the resolution states, has existed for far too long."
"Madam President."
"We discussed the situation in Kenya back in June and expressed our regret at how violent the situation there was."
"This situation has not improved."
"Fear, terror and violence rule the land, violence by the state forces."
"We are currently concerned at the unrest and the wave of brutal oppression which exist, and which have already cost many people their lives."
"We are concerned by the latest attacks by armed militia who have forced many thousands of people in Mombasa to leave their homes."
"Kenya is, however, a signatory to the Lomé Convention."
"Precisely because of this convention and its article 5, we are obliged to assert ourselves on behalf of human rights in Kenya and to demand of the government or the president that the promised constitutional reform at last be implemented, and thus the basis for elections be prepared."
"We support democratic conditions in Kenya."
"That is also the demand of the local opposition, so that there may be an equal chance in the elections."
"We, as the European Union and as signatories to the Lomé Convention, can implement this by means of political and economic pressure, and it is my view, Mr Pinheiro, that it should be included in the next Lomé meeting, which is imminent."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as happens unfortunately all too often in our assembly, the know-alls have again struck by tabling in response to the situation in Kenya a motion which is almost a word for word copy of a text drafted by the International Monetary Fund dated last July, despite the fact that it is very difficulty to understand who was responsible for the violence in Kenya."
"As this is election year, the ill-informed media have hastily concluded that this was a revolt by the opposition that was quashed by the police forces."
"This explains why the motion submitted to us mentions that civilians have fled acts of intimidation and brutality perpetrated by the security forces."
"A telegram from the Agence France-Presse dated yesterday 17 September informs us that according to the leaders of the three opposition parties - Ford-Kenya, Ford-Asili and the democratic party - acts of violence are being committed by Islamic extremists in the region of Mombasa on the Indian Ocean and are spreading terror by burning homes and tourist centres because alcohol is consumed there."
"I fail to see how the government of Mr Arap Moi could gain from wrecking the economy of his country, which mainly relies on tourism, only months from elections and only weeks from the start of the tourist season."
"This is why the Group Union for Europe cannot vote in favour of a resolution which is clearly misguided and which proves, yet again, that instead off acting so self-importantly, some members of our assembly would be better advised to put aside their textbooks on ideology and carefully appraise the facts."
"Gulf States"
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the revolting news last week of the public executions of those who had been sentenced to death in the United Arab Emirates and the impending beheading of two British nurses found guilty of murder, bring back into the limelight in the most dramatic way the issue of capital punishment and the widespread abuse of basic human rights."
"The increase in the imposition of the death penalty and the frequent public executions, as mentioned by Amnesty International and the Human Rights Agency, must concern us greatly and must make our Parliament, and other institutional bodies of the European Union, sensitive to the situation, so that it will engage in campaigns on a global scale for the abolition of the death penalty."
"The European Parliament has both the authority and the power, and the necessary financial and human resources to achieve this."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is not a single scientifically reliable shred of evidence to support the fact that the death penalty acts as a deterrent. On the contrary it increases rather then reduces incidences of murder through a process of dehumanisation."
"Today, unfortunately, the increased trend towards the restoration of the death penalty is all too obvious, and the reasons for this return to a mediaeval form of punishment are:"
"firstly, the inability of governments to control crime, which is on the increase because there is no investment in a long term anti-crime social policy with prevention as its aim.-secondly, the increase in the fear of becoming a victim."
"We all fear falling victim to a criminal act."
"This fear is systematically cultivated by the mass media and plays a part in the adoption of measures of containment and not of prevention.-thirdly, the pressure that is exerted on the one hand by those who mould public opinion and on the other hand by those strata of society of a low educational and socio-economic level who tend to think that the courts are lenient towards criminals.-fourthly, mass media images present the most rare and repugnant forms of crime inciting mass hysteria and arousing the desire of the public for more severe punishments and, indirectly, for the death penalty.Capital punishment has no place in democratic societies, noone has the absolute right of life and death over another human being."
"On the contrary, capital punishment is the weapon preferred by totalitarian regimes, since it is the symbol of the deification of the state and of the humiliation of the individual in the face of state power."
"And so capital punishment is most often used for the extermination of opponents of the state. The European Union must intensify its efforts against the concluding of economic and political agreements to ensure that provisions for the respect of human rights are not violated."
"Mr President, more than 20 years ago, in 1975, the Government of Bahrain dissolved the firstever elected Bahraini parliament which had existed for only two years."
"Ever since, it has refused to restore it or call new elections."
"Protests and campaigns opposed to arbitrary rule have been subject to draconic suppression under the 1974 State Security Law and other measures."
"Very large numbers of people have been intimidated, arrested, convicted, imprisoned without trial or sent into compulsory exile."
"There have, furthermore, been very serious complaints of violence, ill-treatment and torture."
"It is, of course, true that some of the discontent generated in the tense atmosphere created has taken violent forms."
"We in the European Parliament do not support in any way acts of terrorism, bombing or attempts by Islamic fundamentalists, for example, to limit the freedom of women."
"Such acts however cannot be used to justify the refusal to provide any genuine democratic structures or the failure to guarantee human rights."
"Many true democrats and peaceful campaigners have been punished and persecuted in a way that constitutes the most flagrant abuse of their human democratic rights."
"Raids on meeting places, homes and other locations, the suspension of a professor from her job, dismissals of people for instigating a petition and the raid on 13 December on a women's organization are all unacceptable."
"The purpose of this resolution is not only to denounce the abuse of human and democratic rights but to appeal to the Bahraini authorities to restore democracy, call elections, release political prisoners and allow exiles to return."
"I acknowledge receipt of representations from the Bahraini authorities against this resolution."
"But I say to them, this is the only way for their country to end the tension and the possibility of an explosion in the long run."
"We therefore call on the European Union Member States, the USA and others, to exert real pressure on Bahrain as indicated in this resolution to introduce genuine democratic change forthwith."
"Madam President, the situation in Bahrain, about which Mr Newens spoke very eloquently, is visibly deteriorating."
"The parliament has been dissolved for 22 years and human rights are being violated."
"The recent demonstrations that call for the restoration of the constitutional order were aggressively suppressed on a grand scale."
"Political prisoners are being tortured."
"Reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch speak volumes."
"The Union must demonstrate its clear condemnation of this policy and it must also be clear that such a reaction to peaceful demonstrations is only pouring petrol on the flames."
"And they have plenty of petrol there, from what I've understood."
"This must be made clear in the bilateral contacts between the Union and Bahrain."
"Democratization is the only solution that can end the situation there."
"Political prisoners must be released and political exiles must be able to return to Bahrain without risk."
"The countries of the Union should finally refrain from supplying weapons to Bahrain and this approach must also be urged with partners in order to have as great an effect as possible."
"Madam President."
"I am truly sorry to have to contradict my good friends, the previous two speakers."
"I have been to Bahrain on more than one occasion."
"I know a bit about the history of Bahrain, back into the Forties."
"It shows that these reports on Bahrain had nothing whatever to do with realities there."
"We must not forget one thing: there is no doubt that certain excesses exist there, as in all Arab countries, which we cannot oppose sufficiently strongly."
"On the other hand, however, Bahrain is under extreme threat from Iranian forces."
"Shiite extremists, guided by the Iranian authorities, are responsible for the unrest one has seen in Bahrain generally."
"Naturally they are anti-Government."
"There is also a simple reason why they want to overthrow the Bahrain Government."
"One merely needs to look at a map."
"Bahrain has a, if not the, key position in the whole region."
"If extremist forces were able to take Bahrain they would destabilize not just the region, but effectively create great violence."
"I have to say that if we were successful in overthrowing the Government of Bahrain we would then really see what is meant by violence, oppression, repression and torture."
"It is my view that one should certainly speak gently to the Bahrainis."
"They are not our enemies."
"But one should make quite clear to them that we would defend them against this threat from Iran, that we would support them, and that we would do everything possible to ensure that greater freedom is created in Bahrain, but that, in God's name, internal order there should not now be destroyed."
"For that reason we shall vote against this resolution."
"Columbia"
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament has often spoken about the situation in Colombia - about the violence, the terrorism and the attacks on human rights."
"This debate today and the corresponding resolution are different because, finally, a glimmer of hope can be seen."
"Violence has not solved a single problem in Colombia."
"On the contrary, the situation has been getting worse throughout the last 30 years, reaching the limits of endurance."
"The State has been replaced by violent organizations or drug mafias."
"The country's disruption has been caused by a violence which we wholly condemn."
"That is why the proposal launched by the Samper Government to initiate talks between the conflicting parties should receive the support of all the Union's institutions, which in their debates on many occasions have demonstrated enormous concern for the future of that country."
"Furthermore, Colombian society is clearly demonstrating its commitment to peace through various types of initiatives, ranging from the mobilization of the population to education in tolerance, leaving aside the understandable fear of reprisals."
"This is a new situation, which deserves careful thought from the guerrillas, the paramilitaries and all those who employ weapons instead of words."
"The determination of Colombian society cannot be frustrated."
"The Colombian Government has realized this, and is offering a chance for discussions which should lead to peace."
"Finally, we ask several things: we ask the guerrillas to respond positively to this initiative; we also ask for the paramilitary groups to be dismantled; also, that a group of friendly countries should be formed to guarantee the process, as has been done on other recent occasions; and we ask the Commission to offer their cooperation, with the full support of Parliament, to help with the success of this peaceful enterprise."
"The unavoidable prerequisite for any peace process in Columbia is a basic improvement in the human rights situation in the country."
"More than a million people are displaced in their own country, not just because they are caught between the fronts of the guerillas and the army, but because they have been sacrificed to the ever-worsening social conflict."
"Large landowners like the regular army maintain paramilitary gangs that drive people away from fertile land."
"You must all remember the exemplary case of Hacienda de la Cruz, as an example."
"Human rights exponents are not safe in their homes even in Bogota, the capital, as we have recently seen from the murder of two members of CINEP."
"It is possible, however, to see a glimmer of hope in this situation, as the Government has offered peace talks to the guerillas."
"We are very ready to do everything in our power to support this process."
"And that goes for both sides."
"They must sit down at one table and at last negotiate, but it has got to be more than just a PR exercise to refresh the damaged image of this government."
"We are very ready to help here."
"Madam President, in support of this resolution, it is right that this European Parliament maintains its criticism of violence and human rights abuses on all sides in the Colombian conflict."
"We condemn guerrilla violence and whilst welcoming the release of the kidnapped 70 young conscripts earlier this year against some expectations, we express concern at reports of widespread interference in the electoral process in the run-up to local elections due on 26 October."
"Whilst welcoming peace proposals from the Colombian Government, we recognize the serious and outstanding questions of human rights abuse against state authorities, including the apparent sanctioning of paramilitary violence through Conviver."
"Let us remember too that the vast majority of the civilian population are embroiled as innocent victims in the conflict, including nearly a million internally displaced people who, as my colleague says, have been driven from their homes through fear."
"There can be no true peace without justice; an end to widespread impunity in the country and social justice for peasants and indigenous communities are an absolute prerequisite for a lasting peace."
"Finally, this Parliament passed a landmark resolution on human rights in Colombia last October."
"Let us hear from you what practical actions you have taken and what you have achieved over the past twelve months to contribute towards the aims of that resolution."
"Madam President, unfortunately in Colombia today violence is a law unto itself."
"The proof of this is that more than 900 candidates for the forthcoming municipal elections in October have withdrawn their candidature. This is not surprising when you consider that more than 120 have been kidnapped and 22 murdered, and members of the Colombian Parliament have been advised to wear bullet-proof vests."
"The economic situation is still deteriorating and relations with the United States are the worst they have been for several years."
"What can the European Union do about this situation?"
"Unfortunately, very little: we can support the Government and various sectors of civilian society in their efforts to achieve a rightful peace; and we can support the efforts of the European Commission, and Commissioner Marín in particular, in that direction."
"But let us not deceive ourselves. It will not be possible to achieve any solution unless the right conditions are created to permit a form of justice that is worthy of the name, in accordance with a system of law, and if absolutely nobody is above the law."
"Madam President, the draft resolution welcomes the Colombian government's peace initiative."
"This initiative was announced on 28 August."
"We should, however, note that on 4 September the army and paramilitary groups had already begun an offensive, including mass bombing of civilian targets."
"This state of affairs has been documented by the indigenous people's national organisation, amongst others, and also in newspapers like El País and La Nación ."
"It appears that in future Parliament and the Commission should be more on their guard against the double game the Colombian government is playing and its armed forces."
"Chile"
"Madam President."
"It is a long time since we spoke in this House about human rights violations in Chile."
"Despite that there are still open wounds which have existed since the time of President Pinochet."
"An amnesty law guaranteeing the military immunity from prosecution has so far prevented those guilty of the hideous crimes carried out by the military dictatorship in the country from being themselves brought before a court and sentenced."
"The days of immunity from punishment, however, may now be over. For just this very reason our resolution today is so important."
"An action brought in Spain by Spanish lawyers is about to lead to an investigation into crimes against humanity carried out by the dictatorship."
"If this leads to the opening of a criminal case - as is foreseeable - Pinochet would even have to be extradited to Spain under an existing extradition treaty."
"I think it is very important for other states to follow this example, so that these wounds can finally heal, because only one who also knows the facts can forgive."
"Madam President, my first point is that this is a resolution designed to combat impunity directly."
"It is not concerned with the past, but instead defends the present and the future, for impunity is the cause of continuing human rights abuses."
"But, at the same time, this resolution shows the greatest respect for Chile's democratic and civilian authorities."
"Apart from the people of Chile, hardly any other institution has fought so much for the restoration of democracy in that country as has this Parliament. The resolution is completely consistent both with this Parliament's policy, which has made constant efforts to defend human rights, and with international law, which demonstrates that crimes against humanity cannot be tolerated."
"At the same time, we are in direct agreement with the rulings of the Chilean legal authorities, who say that the actions of the political police during the dictatorship were true crimes against humanity."
"We are also in line with what has been expressed by the current Spanish Government in the Senado , which echoes popular feeling and fully supports a solution to this case."
"This resolution is also similar to those passed by the Basque Parliament and the Valencian Community, and to the support currently being given by the United States authorities to the Spanish judge, opening the archives on cases which occurred during the dictatorship."
"Therefore it makes reference to the opinions not only of Spain, but of many European people who want this impunity to be challenged."
"This Parliament cannot ignore the outcry, and we cannot employ double standards."
"That is why I am asking you to vote affirmatively, because it would be incomprehensible for this Parliament to fail to respond to this case."
"Madam President, I believe the significance of this motion for a resolution has been explained extremely well by the proposer, our colleague Mr Pons Grau."
"The position the European Parliament is voting on here today is the maintenance of constant and consistent action, well-grounded in law and justice, against impunity and neglect in relation to crimes systematically committed against human rights."
"The Chilean case is a particularly serious one."
"It is shocking that, just a few days ago, the dictator should have been able to glorify himself, in a military ceremony, offensive to the Chilean armed forces themselves, let alone offensive to the democratic authorities, as if the past had not been a past, as it was, of crimes against humanity."
"The initiative of the Unión de Fiscales Progresistas, which was received by a Spanish court, should be given our political support."
"That is what we can do; that is what we ought to do, in the name of the European Community doctrine of defence of human rights and democracy."
"And this is what we ask the Commission to do: support the action in Chile against impunity, which is helping consolidate democracy."
"Madam President, General Pinochet will cease to be Chief Head of State of Chile in March 1998."
"We all hope that the transition to democracy will culminate at that precise moment."
"Since we energetically condemn any human rights violation, our political Group has not the slightest doubts about the nature of the resolution presented by our colleagues."
"However, we should like to emphasize that the Chilean Government, headed by President Frei, is making significant efforts towards the consolidation of democracy and the State of Law."
"I should also like to remind the honourable Members that for more than ten years Chile has had a consensus Government made up of President Frei's party, the Socialist Party and the Democracy Party."
"Relations between the European Union and Chile are excellent at the moment, and a European Parliamentary delegation will soon be visiting Santiago."
"I should like to conclude by asking you, on behalf of my group, for a separate vote on section 4 of the resolution."
"Madam President, I am sorry to be out of tune with the chorus of the politically correct."
"The reasons are simple: Chile is the only country in South America which has experienced democracy for 150 years."
"Democratic elections brought President Allende to power."
"His government was tragically troubled by the violent action of the MIR and its high-minded leader, but it is also politically incorrect to talk about him."
"The persecutions and deaths that took place at that time opened the way to a violent and tragic military dictatorship, more criticized at world level than many others, equally or more violent, which exist and have existed in Africa and Asia."
"The good democratic sense of the Chilean people forced the dictator to withdraw partially and allowed democracy to return."
"I, who was born and lived under the Salazar dictatorship and who lived under and fought the communist dictatorship which followed it, have always approved of the democratic fate reserved for the soldiers guilty of unleashing blood and fire in Africa and East Timor, and the many who grew rich in the shade of the so-called ""revolution of the nails' ."
"So I appeal to this Parliament to have the good sense and the courage to see the beam in its own eye and not the mote in its neighbour's, because the fact is that we are not even able to fight corruption and fraud within our own frontiers, far less give lessons to an already established democratic government."
"Madam President."
"The point about this resolution - as we understand it - is also to show that we as Europeans always have a particular responsibility for the punishment of those guilty of crimes under a dictatorship."
"Transition from a dictatorship to a democracy is a development which many countries in Europe have made."
"This has often not been easy, nor did it take place by simply altering the form of state government at a stroke."
"This is not a matter of revenge, therefore, nor of proving that perhaps the new democracy in Chile is not sufficiently stable."
"It is essential, however, to seek out and sentence those who were responsible for crimes during the dictatorship."
"Transition from dictatorship to democracy is always a bit of family history as well."
"My generation has experienced that here in Europe."
"It concerns the fate of perpetrators and victims who were part of one's own family and whom one has to acknowledge as part of our history."
"Perhaps it is only the recognition of this development in one's own family that has made our democracies in Europe so stable."
"For this reason the prosecution those responsible is a basic requirement for the stability of a new democracy."
"An amnesty or statute of limitations is not an expression of generosity, but in the end would cause a destabilisation of Chile's democratic future."
"This is not a matter of revenge, but of a process by which one proves that a democracy is strong enough to condemn, not those who simply carried out orders, but those who were specifically responsible for crimes."
"Ethiopia"
"Madam President, my motion for a resolution today concerns the situation in Ethiopia which, despite its natural resources, is one of the poorest and least-developed countries in the world."
"It is a very complex country with some 55 million people, including no fewer than 76 ethnic groups, speaking 286 languages."
"Ethiopia, as we well know and first learned graphically ten years ago and more, has a long history of war, famine and drought."
"The last elections in 1992 gave everyone hope that the situation would eventually improve."
"Alas, only three years since the new constitution was drawn up guaranteeing basic human rights, and despite promises made by the Ethiopian authorities, there are still numerous reports of human rights abuses committed by the Ethiopian government forces, and no doubt others."
"The authorities admit that some of these have occurred, but say that they are isolated incidents committed without their approval."
"They maintain that such abuses are to be expected in a country which has been brutalized by 17 years of oppression and civil war."
"The recent killing on 11 June 1997 of Mr Assefa Maru, of the Ethiopian Teachers' Association, once again highlights the necessity for the Ethiopian authorities to respect the human rights of their citizens, whatever ethnic group they may belong to, and for the European Union to monitor closely the situation in Ethiopia."
"I ask for the support of the House in the face of this grave violation of human rights."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I am surprised that just before this debate on Ethiopia began it was not made clear by Mr Moorhouse, or by anybody else, that the President of Parliament has insisted that the printed text be changed."
"I made a complaint this morning that recital D. of the text is fundamentally inaccurate."
"I asked the President to check with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva as to whether in its fifty-third session it did in fact make the condemnation that Mr Moorhouse's text purports."
"The President checked with Geneva and he has insisted that the words 'expressed its condemnation of the continuing' (those six words) be deleted and be replaced by the more accurate phrase 'discussed' ."
"There was a discussion in Geneva: there was no expression of condemnation."
"Before the debate proceeds, Madam President, it must be made absolutely clear to everybody in this House that we are debating a different text to that submitted by Mr Moorhouse, because the President has instructed the correction to be made because of the fundamental inaccuracy of that allegation in recital D."
"Mr Tomlinson. I followed what you said when you spoke this morning."
"Recital D is no longer contained in the text."
"You can see that."
"You now say that the choice of words ""has condemned' and in article 1 ""condemned the murder' , etcetera, does not fit the facts."
"In the German text I would read this as follows: ""condemns the murder of Assefa Marin' is not necessarily meant in a legal sense, but it can be an expression of rejection."
"I have been told that that has in the meantime been checked and that the facts are correct."
"Madam President, according to my information there are different designations of the item in individual versions."
"That which appears in the German version as recital C appears in an English version as recital D. That will be amended."
"There are also some in this House who would like the recital to be omitted entirely."
"I should like to call on my colleague Moorhouse to say if he could not omit completely recital C in the German version and recital D in the English version."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I am at a slight loss to understand why Mr Tomlinson is taking such a strong line."
"To my knowledge it is the first time he has ever taken any part in any debate on human rights."
"I can only presume that he has been suborned by the Ethiopian Ambassador to the European Union because, as we shall hear shortly, the Ambassador in Brussels has been extremely slow, to put it mildly - this will be confirmed shortly - in responding to accusations of the sort which we are making here in this resolution."
"That is my first point."
"I just do not understand why he should be in the pocket, so to speak, of the Ethiopian Ambassador and of the Ethiopian authorities who are very guilty indeed in the human rights field."
"We are concerned here about human life and the fate of Mr Assefa Maru, who was murdered."
"It is not the time, therefore, to be highly critical of the semantics of the resolution, which I am more than happy to amend to the extent that is thought necessary by the House."
"Indeed, it has already been acknowledged by the presidency, and alterations have been made to the resolution which I hope will be acceptable."
"Mr Moorhouse. Are you prepared to withdraw recital C?"
"That was the compromise proposal."
"Madam President, we have had informal discussions."
"I am quite ready to do so since it would ease our situation as the matter has been highlighted so virulently by one of my colleagues."
"Mr Tomlinson. If recital C has been withdrawn there is no further need to discuss it."
"Recital C has just been withdrawn by Mr Moorhouse."
"Madam President, Mr Moorhouse has made a statement which is about the most offensive statement that can ever be made about a fellow parliamentarian."
"His exact words - and I must insist on defending myself against them - was first of all to say that I did not participate in these debates and then he went on to suggest that I was 'in the pocket of' the Ambassador of a foreign country."
"That is an offence to any parliamentarian; it is totally inaccurate; it is as inaccurate as Mr Moorhouse's draft resolution."
"Mr Moorhouse's draft resolution - and I am merely asking to get a resolution that reflects the truth - states that the United Nations Commission 'expressed its condemnation' ."
"It did no such thing!"
"That is an untruth, and you do not have to be in anybody's pocket to speak the truth in a democratic parliament."
"I hope Mr Moorhouse has something approaching the courage sufficient to stand up and withdraw that slur."
"Mr Tomlinson. I think we are now clear about the text concerning the resolution."
"As for you yourself, you feel insulted."
"I think we can discuss that again at the end of the debate. We shall have three minutes for it."
"Mr Maccartney has a point of order."
"Madam President, I have two very short and relevant points to make."
"Firstly, if there is genuine confusion about what is or is not before the House to vote on, we cannot possibly vote this afternoon; and there is confusion."
"Secondly, Mr Moorhouse should consider his position and withdraw the allegations right now, because those of us who share the concern feel equally attacked."
"Mr Macartney, as regards the text, what we shall be voting on afterwards is completely clear."
"We shall return to the other matter later."
"Mr President, this is a topical and urgent debate."
"An hour ago a bomb exploded in a tourist bus in Cairo: nine people were killed, including six German tourists."
"I wish to express my sympathy."
"On my fax machine I have received a cry for help from Guatemala."
"Felipe de Jesurín and Immelda Lopez de Sandoval were pursued by cars and threatened with death."
"Mr President, by speaking their names, I can possibly save their lives."
"We were dealing with Ethiopia."
"For two years, people have been knocking on my door about the violation of human rights."
"I believed that the government after the dictatorship should be given space. Unfortunately that did not work."
"On 11 July I wrote and asked for clarification about the murder of Assefa Maru and Wakotola."
"The ambassador promised a reply."
"I telephoned him recently."
"He was arrogant and my request fell on deaf ears."
"Mr President, if an ambassador is not even open-minded enough to listen to the real worries about imprisoned journalists and arbitrary executions, then we have at the very least the right to denounce that."
"This is a sign to Ethiopia and my group supports that sign."
"Madam President, of course terminology, concepts and accuracy of the texts we may adopt in this House are extremely important. But the actual content of the debate which has just taken place testifies to the importance of the European Union and notably this Parliament strongly urging the Ethiopian authorities to show full respect for freedom of the press, union independence, citizens' right of association, irrespective of any action taken by other bodies."
"It is also crucial to press the Ethiopian Government to release the political prisoners and prisoners of conscience and take steps to correct the procedures of an unjust legal system. I think this should be done irrespective of whether certain expressions exactly correspond to the absolute truth."
"Inner Mongolia"
"Madam President, this resolution has been obtained through considerable effort and I would like to thank colleagues from the PPE, UPE and the liberal group for having supporting it."
"The situation in Mongolia is unquestionably serious."
"It is even more serious than in Tibet."
"In 1947 Inner Mongolia was divided and separated from the rest of Mongolia following an agreement signed between China and Stalin. This is the backcloth to the situation."
"Since 1947 China invaded and colonised Mongolia just as it did in Tibet."
"Today, Inner Mongolia comprises 20 million Chinese whilst only 3.6 million Mongolians remain."
"As usual, the Chinese have conducted a policy of sweeping colonialism; they have destroyed cultural heritage, perpetrated massacres and arrested tens of thousands of people, including the president of the Democratic Front of Inner Mongolia, Mr Ada."
"Consequently, I would like to invite my colleagues in the socialist group to wake up and not issue a hostile vote for the umpteenth time."
"The west, and particularly the socialist party, aided and abetted ""sovietism' for seventy years."
"I believe it is possible to avoid doing the same thing again after forty years of imperialism, communism and the totalitarianism in China."
"It is time they woke up and demonstrated a firm stance."
"The eagerly awaited and very promising outcome of the Beijing congress demonstrates that we are moving towards a large Singapore and not towards democratization, that we are not moving towards the fifth modernization of Wei Jingsheng, towards democracy."
"It is therefore time to wake up, to take a firm position, to no longer delude ourselves and work towards democracy for the world's largest country."
"Madam President, human rights are indivisible and wherever they are violated we in this group, like many others in the House, will always condemn them."
"But just as we declined yesterday to talk again about Turkey, so we shall not always be able to give our approval to this resolution. Because, if you demand in recital G an open and continuous dialogue with China about this question, then it makes no sense to pass a resolution against China at every sitting of this House."
"In the same way it really makes no sense at all - and I would ask you to remember this in future - always to combine the subject of human rights with the question of the external integrity of the Peoples' Republic of China, in which things are demanded for Tibet which even the Dalai Lama does not ask for!"
"I do ask you to consider that."
"We are united in our opposition to violations of human rights."
"We cannot permanently connect this, however, to the question of the integrity of the Peoples' Republic of China!"
"Madam President, of course I must take issue with the previous speaker, Mr Swoboda."
"We are referring here to the last great colonial power on Earth."
"We are talking about a country with three huge colonies, Tibet, East Turkestan and Mongolia."
"If we do not make it absolutely clear what we stand for, what we accept, that we stand for the right of races to self-determination, that we stand for respect of human rights in China's various colonies, then we shall, in my view, have indeed missed our target and our purpose."
"We can certainly see that in all three parts of the area the same means are being used."
"People are deported, there is forced sterilisation, there is forced abortion. Chinese immigrants are moved in with unbelievable promises: they are told they can have more children than in China, where they are allowed only one."
"What sort of conditions are those?"
"They get up to all kinds of tricks, the population structure in the sub-areas is completely altered, and in these colonies, representing different areas, we are supposed for all practical purposes to close our eyes to it."
"That cannot be in the interests of our Parliament."
"I believe it is absolutely essential for us to express clearly what we stand for in this."
"In the European Union we have a whole group of Mongolians who live amongst us, who have spent years in gaol in Beijing and in concentration camps in other places, and have only got out because of pressure from the West."
"Many of them are my friends and I know their circumstances very well."
"The Mongolians are in a particularly difficult position, because large numbers of them have been involved in various demonstrations - particularly the demonstration in Tienanmen Square."
"Many died there, or in the aftermath to it. Many were just able to escape and are now exiles without a chance of returning to their homeland."
"I think we must also be quite clear in this case what we are talking about: that we represent the self-determination of peoples, particularly in all those places where this is being violated."
"We must not shirk this, just because we are talking about the largest country on Earth."
"We must speak of human rights, we must stand up for them; in other words, we must accept the consequences of being the European Union and the European Parliament."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner."
"Mr Moorhouse now wishes to raise a point of order."
"Please do not re-open the debate, but keep to the point of order."
"Madam President, I think I owe it to Mr Tomlinson to make an apology for my rather strong statement in relation to his views."
"I feel sure that he and I are at one in wishing to expose human rights violations, not only in Ethiopia, but in any country that we may feel obliged to do so and he, like I, will want to take action where necessary against offending governments."
"Therefore, I gladly withdraw the particular remark I made which I know he felt very deeply about."
"Thank you very much, Mr Moorhouse."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the motion for a resolution ((B4-0786/97) by delegates Mr Günther and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party on the conference in Oslo towards a total ban convention on anti-personnel mines."
"Madam President, as a Parliament we were active participants at the Ottawa Conference, called by Canada when it became clear that the official organs of the United Nations would not be in a position effectively to fight the mines situation."
"The first success came during negotiations in Brussels."
"During the Brussels meeting we were able to observe that the United Nations had indeed moved their position slightly at the standing talks in Geneva, and had appointed a coordinator for mines problems."
"I must admit, however, that since then his activities have rather escaped my notice."
"The Ottawa Conference represented a source of hope for millions of people."
"In the meantime we have learned to keep our objectives very limited and to reduce them."
"I should myself be satisfied if we could achieve a situation in which markedly more mines were cleared than were laid."
"We had hoped to come a small step nearer this objective when we learned that the United States was also to participate at the Oslo talks."
"This was a hope which has now unfortunately come to nothing."
"In my view, though, this cannot be the end of this development, because I believe that public opinion in the United States will finally cause the USA to refrain from isolationism and become active participants in the process once more."
"I think this should be a lesson to the United Nations, that there are countries that want to progress, and will not wait until the very last mine manufacturer is ready to stop production."
"I should ask you, when voting on this resolution, to ensure you adopt the oral amendment resolution that Mr Bertens and I have introduced, so that the declaration is brought up to date."
"I believe that a unanimous vote by this House on the matter would greatly hasten the subsequent conferences in Ottawa."
"Madam President."
"First of all I should like to thank all those in this House, such as Mrs Günther, Mr Bertens, Mr Cunningham and others, who have made such an important contribution to the fact that we can celebrate success today, despite all the limitations mentioned."
"My sincere thanks, anyway."
"I can also say that my Party will support the motion because of our interest in the subject, despite the reservation that the introduction of oral amendments of this size must not be made a precedent."
"As has already been said, the last day or days in Oslo have proved to be a success."
"We are very pleased that agreement has been reached."
"I may say with pride and pleasure that Austria, my homeland, was one of the first to speak out for a total legal ban."
"I am of course sorry that America is not, or not yet, participating, even though this really contradicts the principle that President Clinton himself always puts forward."
"I hope that there are forces in America strong enough to persuade the President - force him, I would almost say - to add his signature after all."
"I and my Party, however, should like to see this total ban remain undiluted."
"We simply have another task ahead of us regarding the United States of America, rather than having to accept a diluted version now."
"There is certainly still a task to be carried out in Europe."
"That can be seen from the resolution and the amendment resolutions to it."
"Even in Europe there are some who need to be convinced that it is not right, even with the problems which may arise from its long frontiers, for anti-personnel mines to be used here."
"No one who has been to Bosnia, no one who has been to any country where every day they produce casualties killed and wounded, can accept any argument for the continued use of anti-personnel mines."
"The situation in these countries, the situation of the families, the children, the people, demands that this total ban be signed by every European country and by the whole world."
"Madam president, the humanitarian aims expressed at the Oslo conference for a total ban on landmines are in themselves worthy of support."
"The infantry mine, however, when used responsibly, offers an extra dimension to security, which cannot be compared, for example, with the situation concerning mines in former Yugoslavia."
"For Finland infantry mines are a vital force in our land defences."
"Finland has just under 1300 kilometres of shared frontier with Russia."
"For around one thousand years, wars and conflicts have been common and, almost without exception, the attack has been from the east."
"Although the situation on our eastern border, which is, furthermore, the sole frontier the EU has facing Russia, now appears more peaceful than before, the permanence of this situation in the long term is unfortunately not guaranteed."
"Infantry mines are used in Finland only in crisis situations to halt an aggressor."
"Mine fields are precisely marked and are all collected when the conflict eases off."
"A ban on the use of infantry mines would mean an intolerable increase in the cost of defence for Finland."
"That is why the call in the resolution on land mines made by the EPP group to change options in border-zone security is meaningless unless it includes concrete suggestions as to how a country like Finland can, when threatened with conflict, protect her land borders efficiently and effectively."
"I believe that the previous speaker does not know the story of the Maginot Line."
"However, I do not intend to give any of my colleagues a history lesson."
"Ottawa has been a success and the fact that the Americans did not join in is a pity, but we have achieved a great victory in that the participating countries did not give in to the American pressure to react in the same cowardly way to the Canadian initiative."
"I also wish to ascribe the success that was achieved in Oslo and will soon be confirmed and signed in Ottawa, to the NGO International Campaign to ban landmines."
"Mr Cunningham and I and Mrs Günther have worked closely together on this and I must say that I salute this success."
"I hope that Greece and Finland are persuaded to sign the new treaty so that the Union as well, when it acts outside, can give credible international support to this treaty."
"The Union must next also let the support for the Ottawa treaty appear in its bilateral political dialogue with third countries, including third world countries."
"After the official ceremony in December, we shall have to build on the momentum to actually ban anti-personnel mines."
"The first battle may have been won, but there is still a lot of work to be done, also for countries that still think that they need anti-personnel mines for their own security."
"Madam President, landmines, anti-personnel mines, mines of any kind are the Devil's work and should be neither used nor manufactured."
"The conference in Oslo is a first step, a first victory, but we should beware of praising its result too highly."
"I think that would be a hypocritical policy."
"Many Third-World countries are not participating: Russia, India, China, and now even the USA, are not signatories."
"For the most part they are not signatories because western countries manufacture high-tech mines, and thus do not want anti-tank mines to be included."
"When we look at the situation in Bosnia we see that 30 to 40 % of deaths in Bosnia are caused by anti-tank mines."
"Anti-tank mines which have anti-personnel mines integrated in them."
"Of course they must also fall within such an agreement."
"In the Bundeswehr of the Federal Republic of Germany there are still 1.5 million of these anti-tank mines."
"When we are talking about anti-personnel mines it is easy for a Foreign Minister or the Minister of Defence simply to say there will be no more anti-personnel mines by the end of 1997. If we really want to ban mines, however, then these anti-tank mines must be included."
"Furthermore, we must not allow any more funds to be invested in research, with which point I should like to come to a close: companies such as Diehl and Rheinmetall are developing the next generation, in which a single mine will cover an average area of 300 m2 , which makes it impossible to search for these mines."
"We have advanced a small step, therefore, but there is a long way to go, and mines have got to be banned."
"We must not produce any more of them, and we in the European Union should put that into practice and present a good example."
"Madam President, we are again discussing one of the cruellest episodes in modern warfare and each of us who experienced one of these wars from close quarters lost a friend, or approached or treated several victims of these killing machines."
"We therefore give our unconditional support for the Ottawa process and the total, final and unconditional ban on this type of weapon."
"Our American allies, for misleading reasons, have not always joined us in this fight."
"Let us help them to share this common ground."
"A certain number of events are particularly repugnant, in particular the surreal proposal, made to the Member States who are signatories to this Treaty, to withdraw from the Treaty should they face an armed conflict."
"In other words, waive the use of anti-personal mines as long they do not need them, but pledge to use them the day the need arises."
"This defies belief!"
"I can tell you, Madam President, that over 600, 000 victims whose lower limbs have been amputated, will not be fooled by this kind of alibi."
"Madam President, this debate, like others calling for arms reduction and bans on production of certain weapons, is surreal."
"In fact it is my impression that the search for an international agreement signed at all costs by all the countries which produce anti-personnel mines hides the secret desire that opposition from some country will ruin the whole agreement."
"Let me explain myself: why do the British Labour, French Socialist, and Italian left MEPs, who claim in this European Parliament to be fiercely opposed to the production of anti-personnel mines, not act with conviction to persuade their government colleagues in England, France and Italy to pass a tiny little law in their respective parliaments, worded more or less like this: ""production of anti-personnel mines by the British, French or Italian arms industry is prohibited' ?"
"Waiting for the signature or an agreement which binds all the producer countries is, in our opinion, a hypocritical excuse for not starting to ban production in European countries immediately."
"Then we would not be worrying about the good deals others might make if we ban this production in our countries, but rather about our own consistency and sense of justice!"
"Madam President, it is a question of humanity that we are debating."
"We want to reduce human suffering caused by anti-personnel mines."
"It is important that we devote resources to this, and that we strive to achieve a lasting reduction."
"As a Finn, I cannot myself, unfortunately, support all parts of this resolution, even though my group does so."
"But the goal is right. We should strive for verifiable, international standards which are really binding."
"Today there are great differences in how we will be able to verify or live up to the agreements we are discussing."
"The ban will also have different effects in different countries."
"It affects mines which are placed in advance, but not those fired by artillery."
"Unfortunately, we must recognise that mines for defensive purposes have not outlived their role, in spite of opposite claims in the Red Cross report."
"As a colleague here has pointed out, Finland only places mines for defensive purposes, against aggression."
"By so doing we want, in any event, to reduce the suffering of the civilian population in incidents of aggression."
"We neither produce nor sell anti-personnel mines."
"Madam President, disarmament would never get off the ground if in negotiations we always returned to the idea that in certain circumstances certain weapons of defence are indispensable."
"This, I think, is something Finland should take note of also."
"Finland should endorse the agreement banning infantry mines as quickly as possible, and Finland ought to reconsider the image she has of outside threats."
"We Finns should now admit that the military threat in Europe has greatly diminished and security policy is based more on repelling threats from outside."
"This should also lead on to practical solutions for Finnish defence."
"It is not necessarily so, either, that Finland would have to replace infantry mines with technologically more advanced and more expensive equipment."
"Since the Commission fully endorses the sentiments in the motion, I would just add that we know that our work will not be completed until there is an effective global ban implemented by all states, until all mines are cleared from areas of habitation and economic use, and until all victims of mines are properly cared for."
"This is an achievable goal."
"In the ACP area, the Commission and I, in particular, will continue to make a major contribution, as we have done over the past five years."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint on the following four motions for resolutions:"
"(B4-0757/97) by Mrs Hautala and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on toxic blue-green algae in the Baltic Sea; -(B4-0772/97) by Mrs Myller, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the ecological problem in the Baltic Sea; -(B4-0781/97) by Mr Thors and Mr Olsson, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party on the environmental situation in the Baltic Sea; -(B4-0799/97) by Mr Sjöstedt and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on pollution in the Baltic Sea."
"Madam President, the protection of the Baltic Sea is certainly a timely issue."
"This Summer saw something quite unbelievable in the Baltic Sea."
"A full sixth of the surface of the Baltic was covered in flowering algae and the bluish-green algae was responsible for the eutrophication of the sea."
"This will have to be quickly addressed."
"The European Union also has a role in this."
"The Commission is a full member of the Baltic protection organisation, Helcom."
"It has come to my knowledge that the Commission's ways of working are rigid and bureaucratic to the point that the work of Helcom is even hindered."
"Apparently the Commission cannot decide something without consulting all fifteen Member States on their opinion on the protection of the Baltic Sea."
"The protection of the Baltic Sea shouldn't really have to sink in EU bureaucracy."
"The other problem with the Commission seems to be that there has been too much meddling in the question of the protection of the Baltic Sea and yet they cannot cooperate with each other."
"The commission must definitely improve on its role in this matter."
"The Green Group would also like to emphasise that it is essential to bring in an environment tax to lessen the use of fertilisers."
"The use of fertilisers is very noticeably responsible for the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea."
"Actually, there are other reasons too, for instance the community waste from the eastern part of the gulf of Finland, especially from St Petersburg, with its population of five million."
"The TACIS fund should definitely be used more efficiently for the protection of the Baltic Sea."
"It is, furthermore, absolutely essential that the protection of the Baltic sea gains prominence when the EU begins negotiating membership with Poland and the Baltic countries. These matters really cannot be delayed any longer."
"Madam President, the environmental problem in the Baltic Sea is nothing new."
"We have known about it for a long time."
"With its vulnerable shallow bays and large loading points the Baltic is in a really serious crisis at the moment."
"This is now on the agenda as an urgent matter because this Summer a huge number of people have had first-hand experience of what a polluted Baltic means, because a vast area of the sea was covered in poisonous blue-green algae."
"This pollution of the Baltic Sea, the seriousness of this kind of environmental problem, calls for some stringent measures."
"We know in principle what the sources of the pollution are, and what the biggest problems are, but no measures have been taken."
"The European Union is perfectly capable of getting involved in the Baltic clean-up operation."
"And EU regional programmes, such as Interreg II C, are a possible co-ordination tool in this region."
"Actually, it is not a question of whether there are enough organisations, enough agencies, or even enough sources of funding."
"The real question is how these can be put to better use than they are now, and how things that have to be done can be prioritised so that the Baltic Sea can become cleaner and safe."
"Generally speaking no one source of effluent can be singled out."
"All those known to be responsible for effluent must cut down the amount they release into the sea."
"Agriculture is a very big problem."
"To resolve this we need both national decisions and supra-national regulations."
"The Helsinki Commission regulations must be taken seriously."
"More effective means of treating community waste must be adopted."
"In membership negotiations with East and central European countries, it is essential to stress that environmental standards of this sort must be observed."
"The harmonisation of environmental standards for the Baltic, and generally, must be an essential part of the strategy for the enhancement of unification with these countries."
"St Petersburg, taking up an enormous area of one end of the Gulf of Finland as it does, is a very serious problem."
"The TACIS fund has not yet been used to serve concrete environmental projects."
"It is now high time we got away from the drawing board and addressed matters in a practical way, got some practical co-operation going for the environment in the Baltic Region, instead of just consultants' reports."
"Madam President, after the alarm bells which the events of the summer have been, I hope that the debate we have today leads to the Commission recognising how serious the people of Europe are about the conditions in the Baltic Sea, even though only Finns have spoken so far."
"The Commission must take a more active role in the Helsinki Commission now that it has one year left in the chair of this important organ for environmental co-operation."
"This week in a reply to my question the Commission promised that it would be guided by a desire to achieve the highest possible level of environmental protection."
"I hope that the whole Parliament is going to see that the Commission keeps its promise."
"The preceding speakers have talked of eutrophication."
"It is important to look at that, but we must take wider action to avoid ecological collapse."
"An inventory must be made of all the risk factors."
"We must know who has dumped what in the sea over the past fifty years."
"We must prevent vessels from dumping more in future."
"Finally, I would like to point out that in this debate a proposal is being made that the whole of the EU should introduce a tax on fertilisers."
"Many in our group support this proposal in principal, but many also believe that this is not the right context in which to take it up."
"Madam President, the ecology of the Baltic underlies the importance of interBaltic state co-operation."
"In the present situation the EU and its Member States are in an excellent position to get this co-operation into gear."
"That is why the Commission's input into the co-operation taking place in the Baltic region, like the implementation of the Baltic Region AGENDA 21 programme, must be increased considerably."
"Furthermore, the inclusion of the Baltic countries and Russia in the clean-up talks will add considerably to their successful outcome."
"It is vital to restrict the overloading of the waters, mainly due to agricultural fertilisers, with recourse to stringent regulations for both present and future members of the EU."
"For example, over seventy percent of Finnish waters suffer from eutrophication due to agriculture. New Member States coming into talks must be aware of this, because they are important agricultural countries."
"The Helsinki Commission has a programme for action to reduce nutrient loads."
"The EU Commission must do more to support the implementation of the measures contained in this programme."
"The algae seen in the Baltic Sea this Summer is not just a one-off."
"The heavy floods in Poland and central Europe this Summer will have a real effect on the Baltic in terms of fertiliser pollution."
"The result will be that next Summer we'll have an even worse algae problem than we did this year."
"The Baltic Sea needs help now. Fast."
"Madam President, when the new Member States got involved in EU policy, they got involved in a new sea too, one which is now an EU sea."
"That sea is the Baltic."
"Furthermore, another northern sea must be included in all co-operation actions, and that is the Barents Sea, which has an immense economic bearing on policy, from the EU standpoint also."
"We, the new nations in the EU, are net payers and we would like our money to be visible in EU activity."
"It is best seen in the development by the EU of northern projects and the start-up and co-ordination of projects in a programme which can be reported on regularly to Parliament, so that we can see how the Commission is spending our money."
"It is very important that the Tacis fund is used not just for nuclear safety but also for harmonisation on the environment."
"Nuclear safety funds go far beyond the borders between the EU and Tacis countries, but if the money is spent on environmental co-operation, for example in the Baltic Sea region and in the Finnish border zones, we'll be dealing directly with the EU border with Russia."
"For this reason, it is very important that this subject is prominent also on the budgetary agenda."
"Madam President, to begin with I would like to say that I am Swedish and am therefore breaking the Finnish domination."
"The Baltic Sea with its brackish water is one of the world's most sensitive inland seas."
"This year the bloom of toxic algae covers an area which is twice as large as the whole of Belgium."
"It is necessary for the EU to begin to work actively as the environmental organisation it claims to be, and to take the resolution of the Visby meeting seriously as well as to recognise that it is the sum of all the emissions and acts of pollution which could be the death of the Baltic Sea."
"It is therefore unacceptable for the EU to give grants to projects which further contribute to environmental damage."
"The right hand has to know what the left hand is doing."
"Examples of such projects include the high-tension cables for the distribution of electricity being planned to crisscross the Baltic Sea, and which apart from large, direct emissions of chlorine, and enormous magnetic fields, will also lead to increased lignite consumption in countries like Poland."
"A topical concern right now is a high-tension cable planned between Blekinge in southern Sweden and Poland which has met strong opposition among citizens who are concerned about their environment."
"Can they count on any help from the EU to stop this crazy, large-scale, anti-environmental project?"
"Or will short-term economic gain, in the form of Transeuropean Networks, actively contribute to the death of the Baltic Sea?"
"For two years, since July 1996, the European Commission has chaired the Helsinki Commission, the executive organ of the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea."
"In this involvement, the European Commission is always guided by the principles of the highest degree of environmental protection possible for the Baltic Sea region."
"The prospect of accession to the Union of the Central European countries has led the Commission to further intensify its cooperation, so that candidate countries can adopt and implement the acquis communitaire including the EU's environmental legislation."
"This is clearly set out in the Agenda 2000 documents."
"The PHARE programme will be fully geared towards preparing the applicant countries for accession to the Union."
"Environmental issues will also attract greater priority in the TACIS programme."
"But the responsibility for the environmental well-being of the Baltic Sea lies primarily with the countries around it."
"The Union has sought to cooperate with them in all the appropriate fora which promote the protection of the Baltic Sea."
"Our engagement in the running of the Helsinki Commission, the Council of the Baltic Sea States and the development of the Baltic Sea Agenda 21 currently under way are some examples of such actions."
"There is a need that the Baltic Sea countries also accentuate their efforts in the context of the implementation of the 1992 Baltic Sea Convention, which has not yet come into force because two countries have not yet ratified it."
"The Commission believes that the answer to the preoccupations expressed in the submitted draft resolutions lies primarily in the full implementation of the actions foreseen by the Baltic Sea Convention and the programmes of the Helsinki Commission, in particular, its up-dated Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme, the adherence to Union environmental standards and the appropriate assistance from the Union and other sources, but especially from the countries concerned."
"Thank you, Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on topical and urgen subjects will take place in a few moments."
"Beef and veal (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on beef and veal."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, high quality meat products must no longer remain just a catchword."
"In the light of the extent of the BSE crisis, and continuation of the enormous market imbalance, an investigation into the common market organisation for beef is urgently needed."
"The Agricultural Council has already agreed a package of measures designed to stabilise the beef market, influenced by the BSE crisis."
"Throughout the debate on the sales market for the beef sector it must be remembered first and foremost that European farmers and their co-operatives are confronted by ever-stricter restrictions, such as those on landscape conservation, environmental protection, veterinary regulations, health authority hygiene standards and animal protection standards. These often involve them in seriously increased costs."
"This leads partly to a loss of competitiveness by EU producers both on the internal and external markets, because in many other countries strict standards are applied."
"It is essential that appropriate measures are introduced in order to regain consumer confidence and encourage consumption."
"Measures in support of specific sales campaigns are in my view one of the most cost-effective means of rebuilding market balance in the beef sector."
"Even though Germany has more than a fifth of the European population, and German beef and veal production is about 20 % of the total EU production, only about 10 % of benefits from the EU sales promotion programme have so far flowed into our country."
"This shows quite clearly that there is an urgent need for amendment to the draft regulation prepared by the Commission."
"Principally, the planned financial means must be increased and distributed amongst Member States using objective criteria."
"By objective criteria I mean beef production and beef consumption."
"That means that Germany must have a share of at least 20 %."
"This distribution criteria must be laid down in the Council regulation."
"Furthermore, I believe it is urgently necessary to take into account different consumer preferences in the EU."
"For regional peculiarities to be taken into account in the quality criteria, Member States and those involved in the economy must be given greater influence on, and more freedom in, the establishment of their own sales promotion programmes, even regional ones, which would be encouraged by EU funding."
"We must achieve a situation whereby beef is not transported all across Europe. We must think more about regional circulation, so that the consumer can buy local meat whose production he also knows."
"It has been shown particularly in Germany that a mark of origin plays a central role in regaining consumer confidence."
"For this reason a specific authorization should be introduced, allowing the advertisement of regional origins within the framework of the proposed programmes."
"Quality meat products must no longer remain just a catchword."
"For this more attention must be paid to the fact that in the EU concepts of quality and consumer preferences are very varied."
"Bonus regulations detrimental to quality production, such as trimmings thickness regulations or second premiums for castrated male cattle, must receive urgent amendment."
"Let me say finally, that you should all support a situation in which the expectations and requirements of the European consumer and producer receive better consideration than hitherto."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking also on behalf of Mr Santini, coordinator of our group on the Committee on Agriculture."
"It is said that necessity is the mother of invention. It took bovine spongiform encephalopathy to make us understand that even in a controlled and supported production system consumption can collapse because of disasters or consumer caprice."
"The fall in consumption has been intensifying for ten years now and suggests a diversification in the eating habits of European consumers."
"This may be part of the explanation, but it is largely linked to the BSE."
"Also, while the flashpoint of the epidemic occurred between 1994 and 1996, it was already present in Great Britain in 1986."
"Many knew about it, including the consumer organizations, but few could imagine the criminal behind-the-scenes activity concealed by what appeared to be just a more serious zoonosis than the traditional ones."
"The fact is, someone in Great Britain tried to hide something - the gravity of the epidemic - to save something else - its own market - with the complicity of someone else - departments of the European Commission."
"This whole thesis of illegality, now laid bare by the Committee of Inquiry, was already known to many."
"And this was not just suspicion: there were alarming signs."
"The 1993 regulation dates from the period of the Commission's deep sleep and the veritable explosion of the epidemic."
"Bear in mind that it began to appear in 1986."
"Animal starch was identified as the proven cause only a year later, but it was not until 1990 that its seriousness was recognized in Brussels."
"But from that year until 1994 all the veterinary controls were suspended; the order went out not to talk about it so as not to damage the markets, and in 1992 this regulation, No 1318/93, was produced, with the objective of promoting consumption of meat, including English meat, which was known to be dangerous."
"The proposal for a regulation under discussion today completes that implemented in 1993 and is intended to promote not only the best cuts but also the lesser ones, putting them on the market with the same labelling."
"We think this is a weakness in the proposal, because in the present atmosphere of mistrust, the consumer may have reservations about all the legislation, reservations which we partly share."
"Madam President, I wish first to thank Mrs Hardstaff for her excellent report."
"The EU beef markets were shaken when mad cow disease made an appearance and became publicly known."
"The markets almost collapsed in 1996 when it was found there was an undisputed link between BSE and CreutzfeldtJacob disease, which affects humans."
"There has been an EU attempt to intervene in problems of the beef markets."
"From the start of 1993 a quality regulation came into force followed last February by a livestock identification scheme and provision for passports for animals, animal identification schemes and the marking of beef."
"The aim was to find a trail, through legislation, leading to the possible source of the disease."
"Now the intention is to revise the rulings of 1993 and add certain new elements to the problems of the beef market; a new common marking scheme and classification system for beef, a scheme to encourage marking in the place of origin, and an educational campaign,"
"The beef question is a typical example of a problem which gets harder to solve the further you get from the original source."
"The new schemes threaten to become mind-bogglingly complicated."
"The bureaucracy and costs of monitoring grow at a tremendous rate whilst the effect of the measures diminishes and a return to the confidence of former times becomes less likely."
"The situation shows clearly that the measures should be addressed at source, and monitoring should concentrate on the production of beef and the cattle feed industry."
"When we know how the meat comes to be contaminated, its elimination will be easy and restored confidence in the markets will be nothing less than overwhelming."
"It is therefore most desirable that the Commission concentrate more earnestly than before on discovering and eliminating the source, and monitoring the work carefully."
"The regulation in force is important not just in the eradication of BSE, but in addressing the difficult challenges of the future."
"Hormone meat might flood EU markets in the not too distant future, and problems arising from that will require sturdy weapons to deal with them."
"In this respect it is a good idea for good-quality EU beef to be stamped with a common logo, denoting the fact that you are bringing good-quality meat onto the market with the result that consumer confidence grows again."
"Madam President, the draft regulation submitted to us and Mrs Hardstaff's report considerably improve the area of information to consumers and the promotion of beef."
"Indeed, we must meet the crisis of confidence among consumers in the EU countries not only by promoting the sale of all quality beef products but also by giving consumers genuine information on the origin of meat, breeds of livestock, locations of production and methods of production."
"The efforts already deployed in this direction by regional and national professional organisations show that this is the right way."
"But first we must ask one question."
"Do the national and European authorities ensure the necessary basis for enacting this quality policy by providing controls and by sanctioning fraud?"
"What guarantees does the Commission provide us in this area?"
"What is the point of promoting quality meat if the resources for conducting controls are non-existent or insufficient, as highlighted by the work of the BSE Commission?"
"In that event we would be deceiving both the consumers and the producers."
"The question is rendered all the more important since one wonders whether the Commission and the Council wish to restore the confidence of consumers when at the same time they adopt, or allegedly adopt, contradictory provisions in other areas."
"How can quality be defended if the Commission and the Council do not follow through on their denunciation of the verdicts of the WTO on the Banana OCM and hormone-treated meat and their verdicts are dictated by the USA whose criteria on food quality lead to 9, 000 deaths by food poisoning a year compared with 5 % in France, for example?"
"How can we defend quality by proposing a reform of the CAP which, through a 30 % reduction of the price of beef, leads to productivism which has already resulted in impaired health and caused social and human harm that we are now trying to repair through this procedure."
"This raises a final question. Should we not pledge to break with the liberal and productivist logic that is a feature of the current workings of the Union, which is inspiring the Agenda 2000 project and for which producers and consumers are today paying the costs?"
"Madam President, consumer protection begins with the type of product."
"For this reason it is understandable when consumers have show caution in past years, and also in the most recent past, in the consumption of beef."
"If we had allowed cows to graze on pasture and had not fed them with meat protein - which also happened to be infected - we should not have this problem today. Then we should probably not have had to introduce a sales promotion programme, because beef is a delicacy and everyone knows that; enough meat would certainly have been sold without this measure."
"We now do have BSE, however, simply because we paid too little attention to the method of production, and also because consumers established no channel for monitoring products in the shops, as they knew where the meat came from."
"Now the state has got to intervene and put the train back on the rails."
"This regulation which we are debating today is not new."
"It became effective back in 1993."
"I quote: ""The quality of beef depends upon the breed, the method of rearing the animals concerned, and the conditions of slaughter, transport and marketing' ."
"I welcome the fact that a new version of this regulation is now pending, particularly if we are really given the opportunity to direct the method of production."
"We do not have just this sales promotion, however, but an extension has been made within the framework of this regulation. This concerns the support given to the tagging of beef, its identification."
"This tagging, required of farmers as an obligatory measure and of the industry as a voluntary one - we then altered it in Parliament, Mr Mayer was the rapporteur - was accepted by Council."
"You are aware of the decision whereby our submission according to 100a was unanimously rejected."
"According to this measure tagging is now to be financed 100 % by the industry."
"That is not contained in the Articles at all, only in the Annex."
"In the Article there is a mention only of a requirement for between 60 % and 80 %."
"That is for the sales promotion, but the 100 % is, I quote: ""for information about the new tagging and the technical support' ."
"What has occurred here is that the whole logistic effort to be made by the industry in order to introduce tagging is to receive a subvention from the Commission - this would not be controversial, if it were not 100 %!"
"I asked the Commissioner about this today, and you have heard how he insisted on a 100 % subvention."
"I approached him and, Lo and behold!, he was entirely unaware that this was a new regulation because of the introduction of logistics."
"He will consider the matter."
"For this reason I believe we must refer this report by Mrs Hardstaff, good as it is - and I congratulate her on it - back to the Committee, so that we can clarify this point and not, in a manner of speaking, force the 100 % money down the throat of the industry."
"Madam President, Mrs Hardstaff's report is particularly timely since it touches on our current major concerns, such as BSE and the transportation of beef cattle, their carcasses and by-products within the European Union, as well as the consumer's demands for quality - issues central to the reform of the CAP and to discussions on the Agenda 2000 project, both from the viewpoint of replacing quantity in order to adjust overproduction, and from the viewpoint of consumer health."
"We are all concerned, firstly because we are consumers, secondly because the Committee on Agriculture has appointed our colleague Jan Mulder to compile an initiative report on the quality and recognition of farm produce and foods."
"Two points are crucial: the method of production and consumer confidence towards products thanks to traceability from the breeding farms to the consumer's plate."
"I will emphasize three points: firstly, rigour in the method of production which must be more 'natural' : we must combat the authorisation to use hormones and to link production to the land."
"Secondly, anti-fraud controls and provisions, which must operate more effectively - especially in Great Britain - as revealed by the recent discovery of illegal shipments to Belgium."
"Finally the more active promotion of quality beef which must involve consumers and steer them to healthier products, failing which consumers will again prefer pork and poultry products whose production is highly intensive and which has a considerable impact on the environment."
"My group will support the report compiled by Mrs Hardstaff whom I congratulate in passing for her work."
"However, the lack of genuine harmonisation of wording on labels is regrettable."
"Moreover, we are only talking here about beef."
"What about other meats?"
"For full transparency we must scrutinise these questions too."
"Madam President, as the agenda has not been followed as scheduled, Mr des Places, who was to have spoken, cannot attend this sitting and has appointed me to speak on his behalf."
"This report is central to the BSE crisis which has caused consumers to largely shift their loyalty away from beef."
"I remain convinced that the loss of consumer confidence in beef has been mitigated thanks to the embargo."
"The Commission, administrations of Member States and the entire 'European beef industry' , including the livestock farmers, have done much to improve traceability to restore this confidence."
"In its proposal on promoting beef, the Commission is in no way challenging the quality of eligible products."
"This quality is defined in the applicable legislation."
"We naturally support this position."
"Conversely, Mrs Hardstaff in her report proposes to convert this promotional campaign in favour of quality products into a generic campaign in favour of indiscriminate and standardised products encompassing all products and Member States."
"In plain language, there are shortcomings in the rapporteur's proposals to develop promotional measures partly financed by the European Union to support British beef as well as beef derived from slaughter dairy cows whose organoleptic quality is widely known."
"Although the rapporteur's proposals were accepted as such by the Council, the entire quality beef industry which control its supplies under a strict set of specifications, would be penalised."
"Madam Rapporteur, as staunch defenders of quality agriculture, you will appreciate why Mr des Places and myself asked our group not to vote in favour of your amendment since we believe that the Commission's proposal must be adopted as it stands."
"Madam President, we are again addressing the meat issue in an environment in which, as the saying goes, you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink."
"Similarly, when consumers do not want to eat meat, there is not much you can do to make them."
"In a ruling dated 30 June 1992 an attempt was made to promote the consumption of beef products."
"This was not very successful since in February 1997 in this very Parliament we adopted a system of identity tags for beef cattle."
"Humans can now travel without a passport thanks to the Schengen accords but here we are introducing a passport for cows, an identity card to reassure people with the grand term ""traceability' ."
"This did not reassure people much since tagging was optional and will not apparently be compulsory until the year 2000."
"Until then, importers of British beef will be allowed not to tag."
"Moreover, even when the tag is added, the decline in consumption slows down but does not stop."
"The slowdown is so slight that we are now asked to examine a new draft ruling aimed at revising, updating and revoking the 1992 ruling since previous measures clearly did not produce the expected results."
"On the internal market consumption is falling while on the external market third-party countries are reluctant to buy European meat."
"Consumption is therefore promoted through advertising, with supermarket promotions - ""Eat meat' and participation in trade fairs."
"This shows how low we have stooped."
"We now turn our attention to supermarkets and trade fairs while meat consumption continues to fall and pork, sheep and poultry meats, which are heavy pollutants in terms of livestock farming, continue to increase."
"In other words, we are still feeling the consequences of BSE because a British company, De Mulder brothers, wanted to poison British beef cattle."
"Now the whole of Europe is paying the price."
"Within the system introduced, the aim is to obtain meat that inspires trust and confidence, meat that is derived from healthy animals, sound livestock farming and healthy animal feed."
"For this purpose a sound budget is allocated with joint financing."
"A budget line is provided, B-1.38, on aid for promotional purposes, of which up to 60 % could be co-financed."
"A grant of up to 32 million ECU's may also be provided for the Raphael programme."
"In other words, for broken cow's brains receive more financing that the brains of European intellectuals."
"That is how confused we have become!"
"This argument is all very nice and useful, but it comprises a series of contradictions."
"The first is central to the system on confidence: on the one hand the aim is to reassure the consumer through advertising policies but at the same time the consumer becomes worried through imports of hormone-injected beef following the verdict of the panel of the World Trade Organization."
"The second contradiction concerns revenues."
"The aim is to safeguard the market by protecting consumption and by increasing the income of farmers but at the same time, authorisation is given to import hormone injected meat which will be cheaper and which will lower the income of our livestock farmers."
"The third contradiction has to do with prices."
"Here, too, the aim is to safeguard the market by advertising or other measures but at the same time, the Agenda 2000 project provides for a 30 % reduction in the intervention price of beef, which is tantamount to hammering the livestock farmers hard on the head with the four tomes of the Agenda 2000 project and then administering them with an analgesic to reassure them!"
"We are still practising a baling out policy!"
"However, all is not in vain."
"Paul-Valéry said that even Sisyphus, in rolling his stone, was not working in vain since he was flexing his muscles."
"In addressing for a third time this beef issue that no one wants to handle after all the media hype we know about, we are flexing our legislative and regulatory muscles!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am deputizing for Honor Funk because he has been called away urgently."
"It is a fact that, at the moment, the pleasure of eating British beef is a somewhat limited one, although I would stress that Mrs Hardstaff of the United Kingdom has presented a good report, and I should like to congratulate her on it."
"We know, however, that beef consumption has been in recession for years."
"Last year, when it became known that there was a connection between BSE and Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, sales reached absolute rock-bottom."
"The results are well known, and I do not need to go into them here."
"Prices have collapsed, beef surpluses have had to be removed from the market by intervention."
"For these reasons we expressly welcome the fact that measures are being taken to stop the crisis in sales and improve the situation."
"It is always better to support and finance a sales promotion for quality meat, than to store it."
"It is now critical that the proposed financial means - and I emphasise this particularly - pass into the right hands."
"It must not be permitted for the money finally to end up in the hands of advertising agencies or wholesalers."
"In recent months - and I attach great importance to this - regional markets, in some areas called farmers' markets, and farmers active in selling their own produce have come to pay more attention to this market and built it up considerably."
"This is a meeting of specialist knowledge and local needs with corresponding consumer requirements."
"These institutions are now in place and in many regions do not need to be established afresh."
"We should support them."
"I was the rapporteur for the report on identification marking for beef."
"The quality of the animals, and particularly the identification and traceability, are a major concern to consumers."
"This home produce selling is obviously one of the best ways of ensuring that the consumer who has an interest can learn precisely where, and under what circumstances and conditions, the animal has been reared."
"These regional standards of origin and quality are regularly monitored and sales promotions are regularly held."
"That should become clearly recognised."
"Mrs Hardstaff, in Amendment No 8 to recital 7 we regarded the description ""meat marketing industry' as a little restrictive and we therefore rejected the phrase."
"The Commission has admittedly phrased things very generally, but this was a bit too limiting."
"I must make one comment to Mr Graefe: I believe Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf was rather casual in his phraseology when he generalised that - and I reject this also - all producers make mistakes."
"Some do, but not all."
"Mr Mayer, I would remind you that you have had two minutes, but I granted you four because you inherited the two minutes allotted to Mr Cunha who is a member of your group."
"Mrs Hardstaff, do you want to add anything in conclusion?"
"Madam President, I would just like to thank all those who have contributed to the debate."
"I would remind colleagues that this was already delayed to get the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection when we had really hoped to vote on it in July."
"The fate of our farmers and meat industry, in terms of getting the market moving, depends on getting this started as quickly as possible."
"So I hope that it will go through tomorrow and that it will be possible to put this action into place and start to sell European beef not only within Europe, but also throughout the world so that it will again be recognized as among the best in the world."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow morning at 9.00 a.m."
"As you can see, Mr Hallam, we will not waste our time tomorrow morning, in two respects!"
"The next sitting will begin at 9.00 a.m. tomorrow morning."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.55 p.m.) ."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, we are used to having the Minutes in two parts."
"This morning we have them in four."
"How will we know when we have got a full set?"
"We shall leave that to the intelligence of the Members."
"Mr President, in yesterday's Minutes, halfway down page 19, it says the following: ""Mr Wijsenbeek referred to his remarks at the start of that morning's sitting (part 1, item 1) and reported on how he had spent his time until the resumption of the sitting' ."
"This Dutch is not correct, but the fact is I have still not received a reply from the Bureau as to whether it is actually true that the Bureau is now going to record Members of Parliament entering and leaving Parliament on camera."
"Would you also state whether this is in accordance with the legislation in Europe on the protection of personal privacy and tell Members - because as the Bureau you wish to monitor how we spend our time - how many extra members of staff this will take and what that will cost the taxpayer, so that we can weigh one up against the other."
"I believe that we Members are entitled to a reply to this question from the Bureau and we have not given you carte blanche to take measures that mean we can be spied on and be monitored from dawn to dusk."
"Thank you very much Mr Wijsenbeek."
"As usual, I have no idea what you are talking about."
"Mr President, yesterday, in the debate on the banana issue, my colleague, Mr Liese, discovered a discrepancy between the resolution we were debating and one that had been handed in."
"It concerned three missing words."
"I should like to ask you if you have now clarified this matter."
"I understand it is still being investigated."
"Mr President, yesterday a very important decision was taken."
"In the absence of any Members from Wales, I should like to take it upon myself to congratulate the people of Wales on the exercise of their democratic right to self-determination."
"We look forward to Wales and Scotland going forward together."
"I would endorse your congratulations to the Welsh."
"It is probably just as well no Welsh were here, given how narrow the vote was."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Mr President, I should like to raise another matter."
"Travelling to this place each week I have to pass through Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris."
"On three occasions this year I have been refused entry into Terminal D on my laissez-passer."
"I am told that it is not an official document."
"On the last occasion, last Monday, I was actually held aside and not allowed to pass until I produced my national passport."
"Surely the French realise that we have a Union and that we have a laissez-passer which gives us the right to travel anywhere within the 15 nations."
"(Applause ) Could I ask your office, in that case, to write to the French immigration authorities, pointing out that it is a document which does allow us to pass, so that we do not have this embarrassment in the future."
"I agree with you entirely."
"As you know, I used to travel on the same flight with you."
"I stopped doing so because I was so damned annoyed at the inconvenience at Paris airport."
"Could I ask you to include Frankfurt?"
"(Laughter ) I travel through Frankfurt airport and there our European passports have been described by customs as a joke."
"(Laughter )"
"All right. I have Paris, Frankfurt and I also heard someone say Amsterdam."
"Anyone else can give it to me in writing."
"Mr President, I would also request you to instruct the German authorities to finally recognize European passports because one has, from time to time, great difficulties - including, I am sad to say, even at Munich airport - which is generally the best airport in the world."
"(Laughter ) It would be a good idea to take steps to secure universal recognition so that all these countries recognize the European passport."
"Thank you, Mr von Habsburg."
"Votes"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"On behalf of the Greens I should like to move referral back to Committee under Rule 129, on the following grounds: we have just accepted Amendment No 22 by the Green Party."
"Yesterday Mr Fischler, in anticipation of this vote, said he would not accept the 100 % withdrawal, and that he insisted on it."
"Now we come to the interesting bit, where the sales subsidies, which is what concerns the rapporteur and ourselves, will only be 60 % and 80 %."
"The 100 % subsidy is for the technical introduction, in other words, the logistics of introducing labelling into the industry."
"100 % is proposed for this category."
"Now, the Commission did not put this into the main part of the article, but included it exclusively in the financial section."
"So the 100 %, which we cannot do anything to change, is included there."
"I spoke to Mr Fischler again yesterday."
"He made it clear that there had been a lapse in the information chain within the Commission, and that they had not intended this."
"So we need to refer this report back, so that the Commission can correct its line and follow our suggestions."
"I urge Members to support referral back."
"Mr President, I want to speak against referral back."
"This has already been delayed."
"The original request was for urgency and for it to go through in July to enable this programme to go ahead."
"This is something which is going to save the Community money."
"If we spend money to try to ensure that people eat our beef, we will save a great deal of money on storage and intervention in the longer term."
"This was the whole point."
"The Commission is very anxious to set this in train to save the Community budget."
"I do not want to see it held up any further."
"Mr President, I am in favour of referral back."
"Yesterday Mr Fischler systematically and insistently refused to answer questions or to give any clarification on the disclosure at the parliamentary Committee of Inquiry that there are loopholes in the law and that it is possible to violate, legally, the legislation which we have gradually been building up over the year for identifying animals, labelling meat, and reestablishing consumer confidence."
"He gave no explanation and gave no pledge to improve the situation."
"I am therefore in support of referring back the regulation so that the Commission can consider it better and so that Parliament can do its work better on behalf of the citizens and consumers."
"(Parliament decided against referral back to committee)"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, we have lost the vote on for referral back to the Committee, but the problem remains unsolved."
"We have been successful, nevertheless, in having this report dealt with under Rule 129a, and that means that it goes into a second reading."
"Before that we shall follow with keen interest whether the Commission resolves its insecurity, which was obvious, about the withdrawal of the 100 % subsidy for the industry."
"The introduction of labelling concerns not just the industry, but also farms, although farmers do not get repaid a penny for their efforts."
"I think that is sensible, just to make my view on it clear."
"I do not want any subsidies."
"However, if one side wants to introduce something which should be taken for granted, namely the identification and traceability of beef for consumers, and must accept the financial liability, then there is no sense in paying the other side, the industry - and then a full 100 % at that!"
"Admittedly, setting up the logistics in abattoirs for this tagging is not insignificant, but 100 % subsidies are almost immoral."
"When this is contained only in the finance section, it smacks of lobbying, of cooperation between the administration and lobbyists of the meat industry, who do not wish to bring this into the parliamentary process, but would force it on us more or less behind our backs."
"We must reject that most emphatically."
"We want to deal with this here in Parliament, and I hope that will happen at second reading."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group I first want to acknowledge Mrs Hardstaff's excellent work, and that of the draftsmen of opinions, Mr Papayannakis and Mr Giansily."
"Moreover, I should like to state that my group considers it absolutely necessary to bring in measures to ensure that consumers are correctly informed, by means of correct labelling."
"Nevertheless Mrs Hardstaff's report, which as I said is excellent, needs to be considered within the context of the BSE crisis."
"Both in the Committee of Inquiry into BSE and in BSE monitoring, shortcomings have been detected which can make this legislative initiative less effective."
"It is clear that there is a shortage of legislation covering the identification of beef and veal."
"At the moment there is nothing to stop the removal from cattle carcasses of the identification marks which specify their origin, and this is creating serious problems."
"The existing shortcomings in the regulations on identification and monitoring can produce effects which are the opposite of what is being sought."
"Moreover, since there is no guarantee that the Commission will correct these shortcomings immediately, my group has voted against the legislative resolution, to put pressure on the Commission to make the necessary amendments to the regulations and monitoring."
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for a thorough report."
"However, we have abstained from voting on the proposed amendments concerning the proposal for a publicity campaign to promote the consumption of beef."
"In our opinion, consumers themselves can decide what kind of food they want to consume."
"To subsidize campaigns for a certain type of meat is inappropriate."
"Campaigns for different types of products should be paid for by the food industry and not through Community funds."
"We think it would be preferable to let the price mechanism of the market create a working balance in the beef sector with supply matching the price allowed by demand at the consumer stage."
"Given the suspicion that beef is arousing among consumers, the best and most immediate strategy was to prove the origin of beef products and develop communication."
"In France, for example, despite accusations of protectionism levelled by certain Member-States, a communication campaign was developed by deploying different advertising media at sales outlets and with the financial backing of professional groups."
"Thanks to this strategy, the worst was probably avoided although the market was severely shaken."
"Between 60 and 70 % of French consumers questioned said that they found the ""original beef' logos reassuring."
"Through this initiative the decline in consumption was limited to 15 % on average in the second half of 1996, whereas following the announcement of the outbreak of BSE, the decline exceeded 30 %."
"Clearly, the Commission's proposal is a move in the right direction but I fear that the Hardstaff report will lead to a generalization of products by supporting a generic message."
"This is likely to penalize high-quality beef products heavily as they would then be confused under a European generic label without explanation."
"I believe, however, that the identification and traceability of beef products are all-important."
"Information for the consumer's benefit is crucial in this context and is necessary to help kick-start the market which has been hit hard and which has heavily penalized producers upstream."
"We must not lose sight of the fact that the consumer holds the trump cards here."
"Let me say at the outset that all participants are agreed on the aim. It concerns re-establishing consumer confidence in the safety and the quality of beef."
"We appear not to be in agreement, however, about how this is to be achieved."
"The Commission, which proposes financial support of both sales promotion measures and an information campaign on the marking of beef, seems to possess the majority support of this House."
"I consider this move to be a mistake, however, because it does not define the main point of effort sufficiently clearly."
"The insecurity and mistrust of the consumer stem mainly from the fact that on the European internal market the origin of beef and beef products is often unstated or untraceable."
"It is for just this reason that the new regulation on identification of beef and registration of cattle has assumed such importance."
"The consumer can only obtain information on the origin of beef by means of identification and registration, and only thus will confidence be created."
"I think it is urgently necessary to establish political priorities."
"This wish was clearly expressed at the time of the debate in plenary session on the identification negotiations."
"It has become diffused in the current debate, however."
"If we declare our wish for simultaneous and equally weighted financial subsidy, both of sales promotion measures and of an information campaign, then we are failing to make the clear political statement which is so important in the struggle against BSE and its effects. Health and consumer protection have priority in European policy; security of agricultural markets is only possible when this initial priority has been ensured."
"Certainly, sales promotion measures are necessary. But we should concentrate our limited resources on what we think is of first importance, both politically and economically, and here is the creation of consumer confidence by clarification of the origin of beef."
"As my colleague Edouard des Places mentioned during the debate, our group rejects most of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur."
"Indeed, at the present time only quality meat products offering health, taste and organoleptic guarantees are eligible for European Union aid with a view to financing promotional campaigns."
"What exactly does the rapporteur propose?"
"Mrs Hardstaff, in her report and various amendments, asks that all beef products benefit from Community aid in favour of promotion."
"These proposals are contrary to the interests of the quality meat industry."
"I know personally that the United Kingdom is seeking an early lifting of the ban on beef."
"How will the lifting of this embargo impact consumer attitudes?"
"I strongly suspect that Mrs Hardstaff wants British beef to benefit from Community aid for promotional purposes."
"Of course, given the poor press that beef is getting at present, Mrs Hardstaff calls for a general promotional campaign, which is unacceptable."
"Agri-monetary system for the single market"
"The next item is the report (A4-0261/97) by Mr Hallam, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the agri-monetary system for the single market: 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996 (COM(96) 0636 - C4-0026/97)"
"Mr President, I am delighted to see the rather large turnout of Members today, which indicates the importance attached to this subject."
"I should like to explain very briefly what we mean by the agri-monetary system. Basically, it is a way of ensuring that our farmers have some stability in the way in which they plan their businesses."
"One of the problems we have at the moment is that this lifeline - if I can use that analogy - is sometimes rather long and at other times rather short, according to the fluctuations in the monetary market."
"In the past, Parliament has quite rightly asked the Commission to provide it with some information about how this system is working."
"It has produced a report - which is the one under consideration today - for the period between July 1995 and 30 June 1996."
"The report includes information on the granting of compensatory aid, an assessment of the economic and financial impact and proposals for the future of the system."
"Quite rightly, the Commissions says that it would be difficult at the moment to make vast changes to the agri-monetary system on the very eve of European Monetary Union."
"Consequently, that is something we will have to discuss at some point."
"Nevertheless, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development looked at the report."
"We agreed that we could not make any dramatic changes at this stage but there would be changes to be made in 1998 as we approach EMU - if we do approach EMU. So we have taken the opportunity of making a number of suggestions."
"Firstly, we want more simplified rules, and we want to ensure that people understand exactly how the system works."
"Secondly, we want to ensure that there is a ceiling and a floor around which the money cannot vary dramatically."
"Farmers in my constituency have lost nearly 20 % of their earnings under so-called green pounds in the last year."
"There are already too many variables in farming and it is essential that we ensure that these variables, which we can control, do not fluctuate so widely."
"Finally, I want the agri-monetary system to be self-financing: when it goes up and when it comes down it means that we can do some cross-referencing of money."
"This will ensure that the people of Europe are well served in their taxation."
"My friends, I wonder whether we will be having this discussion in ten years' time."
"It may well be that with the advent of EMU events will overtake us and we will get to a position where every farmer is able to receive the same amount of aid in the same package wherever they are in the European Union."
"I want to assure the farming community - not just in my constituency but in every corner of the European Union - that this Parliament is aware of the difficulties which it faces, and this Parliament will do its best to ensure that it can serve its consumers as effectively as possible, at a decent price and in a way that enables them to maintain a relatively good lifestyle."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, when Mrs Fontaine was in the Chair, I spoke for rather a long time."
"Today my speech will be quite brief."
"In the past it has been demonstrated many times over the years that changes in exchange rates have led to very considerable disagreements and distortions in competitiveness."
"The agriculture of Member States has had to offset this in some way or other."
"The compensatory mechanisms have been insufficient."
"In the reporting year 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996 - an agricultural accounting year, therefore - there were hardly any exchange rate movements, and where there were any, they were exactly the opposite of previous years."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Hallam, on his report."
"Even in the committee stage there was general unanimity, which I should like to record today."
"There is support for it today, as well."
"We should like to emphasize the demand for continuation of efforts towards simplification and greater transparency, and in particular the introduction in 1998 of new regulations, even though monetary union, the enlargement of the Union, the WTO round of talks, and particularly the discussion on Agenda 2000, are imminent and will be very emotive."
"Enough about that for today."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, let me immediately congratulate Mr Hallam on the enthusiasm he has put into the discussion of this very important subject for each and every farmer in Europe, north or south. Although we agree with the Commission's theses on the agri-monetary system in force, that is, no basic change in the present arrangements, simplification without comprising the system as a whole, or abolishing the agricultural conversion rate and reappraising possible future choices, we nevertheless consider it necessary to make some comments."
"In the first place, it is probable that the agri-monetary system will have to be revised retroactively - it is not the first time this has happened - and not just in view of the introduction of the Euro, which is actually becoming a European ideal."
"During the whole period up to that date there are very good grounds for apprehension about a significant increase in the EAGGF costs with dangerous instability on the exchange markets."
"Limited presence of the Euro in the early stage of implementation would significantly prejudice agricultural production, whose equilibrium depends - as we all know - on a complex and integrated common architecture, weighted as the result of a continuous, difficult and controversial political adjustment."
"There is acute sensitivity to and fear of the implications of this scenario in the agricultural world, a sector prey to the negative effects of any weakening of European structures, especially after the difficulties experienced as a result of excessively strict monetary convergence criteria."
"The agri-monetary report presented by the Commission at the end of 1996 fully confirmed suspicions of deviation of major financial flows, which will take the increase in the base level of the agricultural guideline to about 28 %."
"A situation of this magnitude for the European Union budget will, in practice, compromise the CAP reforms and make it completely impossible to make the necessary improvements in the structures and organization of markets for Mediterranean crops."
"Mr President, I should also like to begin by complimenting Mr Hallam on his report."
"If I have read the report properly, I have understood between the lines that he is already a long way ahead of his government and his party because he is already arguing in favour of all the countries of the European Union being part of the future EMU."
"I think that is a courageous point of view for a member of the Labour Party."
"In the first place, I believe we can say that since the abolition of the switch-over mechanism, the present agrimonetary system has worked extremely well."
"The costs are considerably less and at the moment the difference between the green rate and the normal rate is about 2 %."
"With a bit of luck it will become even less over the next year."
"But there will have to be a bit of luck."
"I wonder whether the Commission is making adequate preparations for the abolition of the green rate if EMU ever does come about."
"Because what will happen then?"
"Will there be compensation for the farmers or will prices be temporarily increased so that the farmers in Europe do not suffer any disadvantage?"
"As the Finance Ministers have already made clear, in May certain rates will be ""rivetted' to each other and I think that it is also appropriate for European farmers to know what will happen to the green rate system."
"Will they also be rivetted to each other?"
"Because that then automatically means that the present system will become superfluous."
"The big question will be: what will happen to those countries and those currencies that do not take part in EMU?"
"Will there be a similar system of application, etcetera?"
"The main point is also - and I am mentioning it because I am the rapporteur for the 1998 agriculture budget - that in the whole agriculture budget for 1998 not a single provision has been made for contingencies of this kind."
"And I wonder whether that is a good thing."
"It is quite probable that nothing much will happen until after 15 October 1998, but if the currencies are being rivetted together in May, then something could happen the green ECU and I think the Commission should be ready for this contingency."
"I should also like to know the Commission's position on what Mr Hallam has just set out: at the moment there is an upper limit of 5 % before action is taken and a lower limit of 2 %."
"Is it possible to even them up: for example, both at 3 % or both at 5 % or are they just mentioned because in the future, after EMU has come about, these things must be neutral in the budget?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this present report from the Commission keeps the pledge given at the Agriculture Council meeting in June 1995 to compile a report each year that analyses the impact of currency fluctuations and the current agri-monetary system on the CAP and the single market, together with suitable proposals to counter any difficulties that might result."
"Parts A and B are devoted to a description of the monetary and agri-monetary events that occurred during 1995-1996, including the granting of compensatory aid."
"The drafting of preamble A, as proposed in Amendment 1, tallies with the part described in the Commission's report."
"For these reasons we will vote in favour of this amendment."
"Part C contains an approach on how all this will economically affect agricultural markets and the income of farmers, while part D assesses the impact of the agri-monetary system on Community achievements."
"In substance, the Commission's annual report on the agri-monetary system proposes abandoning the green tariff for import duties by emphasizing the need to ease agri-monetary processes."
"Mr Hallam's initial draft report proposed this option."
"Under the current system, two tariffs co-exist to calculate customs tariffs: the customs tariffs and the green tariff or agricultural conversion rate."
"We all want to simplify this system but unlike the rapporteur's initial proposals, this simplification must not only entail the application of customs tariffs but, conversely, the systematic application of the green tariff."
"In fact, the green tariff is higher than the customs tariff."
"The conversion rate differential between these two tariffs may reach 5 %."
"Consequently, the proposals of both the Commission and the rapporteur tend to lead to a lessening of Community protection."
"We all know that in the very tough international context that we are experiencing the principle of Community preference is constantly under threat and is often challenged both by the WTO agreements and the host of agreements signed by the European Union with third countries."
"It is therefore paramount to ensure maximum possible protection and hence preserve the green tariff."
"The latter will continue to apply for repayments and domestic market prices, whatever the method of calculation chosen to calculate customs tariffs."
"In the amendment I have tabled with my colleague Edouard des Places, which was passed by the Committee on Agriculture, I proposed an effective means of simplification."
"Effective simplification entails the use of the green tariff to calculate customs tariffs, as indeed it is already used to calculate repayments and domestic market prices."
"The other amendments tabled with Mr des Places in committee, which were all adopted, enable us to support the rapporteur's resolution, apart from preamble A, to which we prefer the wording of Amendment No 1."
"In conclusion, Mr President, we all want to see an easing of the administrative formalities that European enterprises need to complete."
"Our approach diverges from that of the Commission on one specific point: we want to preserve community preference as far as possible."
"The choice of a single customs tariffs demonstrates that the Commission has systematically opted for solutions that do least to safeguard the interests of the European agricultural economy."
"No international agreement or legal stipulation obliges the Commission to propose the customs rate instead of the green rate for customs tariffs."
"So why does it do this?"
"Following these proposals and especially after the approval of the Agenda 2000 project, I, like many farmers, wonder whether the European Commission really has the will to preserve the one and only genuine integrated Community policy which broadly gives the European Union legitimacy - I refer to the Common Agricultural Policy."
"Mr President, I should like to add my congratulations to our colleague, David Hallam for the excellent report that he has produced, which actually sheds some clarity on what is a very, very complicated issue, namely the way in which the agri-monetary system works."
"I certainly feel, having read his report, that I understand it very much better."
"I would also like to assure colleagues that he did not write the text of my speech this morning, any more than I did the text of his speech yesterday on my report."
"The compliments are meant very sincerely."
"One of the reasons for welcoming this report is that farmers have to contend with so many uncertainties in their job."
"One very heavy storm or two or three weeks of very dry weather at the wrong time of the year can make all the difference as to whether they make a profit or loss on a whole year's work."
"Fluctuations in exchange rates add a further hazard in terms of forward planning."
"The agri-monetary system is supposed to give some protection against this."
"However, as the report points out, the rises and falls in exchange rates do not necessarily balance each other out and adjustments are necessary to ensure that farmers in one group of countries are not disadvantaged through such monetary movements."
"I very much welcome the proposals in Mr Hallam's resolution recommending the maintenance of maximum stability in the run-up to the introduction of the Euro."
"We want only minimum changes in the existing system, those which are required to maintain financial equilibrium in the agriculture sector during this interim period."
"I believe that farmers throughout Europe will welcome these recommendations as uncertainty is their greatest problem in an area where long term planning is absolutely essential."
"I too want to congratulate Mr Hallam on his report and thank him for his heroic efforts to shed light on a very complicated subject."
"I once heard a former member of the Council of Ministers say that he put the question informally to all of the finance ministers who were seated around the table: ' What are NCAs?' ."
"There was not a single minister able to explain that."
"They had to send for someone in the Commission."
"Mr Hallam has gone one better than that."
"I take issue with one point in the opening of the first paragraph of his report which says that there is considerable doubt about the whole question of EMU, or words to that effect."
"We, in this House, should not accept that there is any doubt about EMU."
"Parliament has to accept that EMU is going to proceed according to the timetable."
"By the middle of next year we will, in effect, have European monetary union for perhaps 80 % of the entire economy of our 15 countries and we should proceed on that basis."
"Another point I want to make is that Mr Hallam seems to suggest that we might continue with this system after monetary union has been put in place."
"Even if it does not cost the Community budget any money, it gives some farmers in strong currency areas payments at the expense of farmers in weak currency countries."
"I could not agree that there is any need for that."
"I believe that we will have monetary union by the middle of next year."
"Once the rates are fixed, this makes the whole agri-monetary system totally redundant."
"We will have something like 80 % of the economy of the European Union in the system and there will be one or two countries who want to join but whose currencies are too weak."
"It would be very wrong if we were to suggest that there should be a tax imposed on the farmers exporting from those countries if their governments are forced to submit to a devaluation of their currency."
"On the other hand I cannot accept that countries which have strong currencies and are eligible to join the European Union, but are not willing to do so, should be given the facility of subsidizing the nominal reductions in prices which occur if their currencies appreciate against the Euro."
"To do this would be to offer some sort of an incentive to those countries not to participate in monetary union if they have strong currencies and are eligible to do so."
"I believe that we should proceed on the basis that we will use the Euro from the day that the currency rates are fixed."
"From there on, the entire system is redundant and farmers within the system have absolute certainties while farmers outside the systems will deal with the problems just like any other sector in their economy - manufacturing, industry, services, importing or exporting."
"They exchange their money at the rate that the Euro gives them."
"There is no need to have any other system."
"I can understand in the past why there was political pressure in countries like Germany and Holland where currencies were appreciating very rapidly."
"There was political pressure to give some concessions."
"I recall that in 1992, in a report that I wrote, Parliament rejected the switch-over system. That system eventually incurred costs for the European budget."
"My group did not agree with me at the time."
"But that system incurred costs of something like ECU 7 billion in the European budget."
"I was against it because it provided for unplanned and unscheduled increases in farmers' incomes which they were not looking for and did not expect."
"If we had that ECU 7 billion today to devote to the rural development aspects of our agricultural policy, it could be put to use to achieve social and economic objectives which are closer to the hearts of most people in this Parliament."
"Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate Mr Hallam on his report on a very sensitive issue."
"However, I still have many worries, as do other Members, about certain proposals of the Commission."
"The Commission proposal on the agri-monetary system of a single market is, in its basic outline, correct."
"The rapporteur was quite right to emphasise that at the present stage it is not advisable to make vast changes, as the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union from January 1999 will make these changes."
"I would like to add, however, that, particularly in respect of the proposed safety net, in section (d) of paragraph 1, with a ceiling and a floor in local currency, this cannot exceed the limit of + 2-3 % at the most, and it appears that section (e) of the same paragraph causes more problems than it was meant to solve."
"In my opinion it would have been better to remove it completely."
"Such a possibility of redirecting community funds, as is proposed here, will very easily lead to countries with strong economies playing monetary games with exchange rates at the expense of economically weaker countries, which will not be able to do anything about it."
"What is more, it limits the free exercise of a policy of public economy by Member States in the run up to EMU, since this section is in fact a system of rewards and punishments."
"When a country with a weaker economy is obliged to devalue its currency in order to achieve economic recovery and a more conducive environment for exports, then the European Union comes along with this system and punishes the farmer."
"In other words, it takes money from the weakest members and gives it to the strongest, thus perpetuating a vicious circle."
"On the one hand the Commission points out that there are no great monetary fluctuations, but it also states that strong currencies have been devalued while other currencies have tended to be revalued."
"This may be a fact, but it is not sufficient to make us resort to such measures."
"In his conclusions to the report under consideration, the rapporteur supports the Commission in its stance that the Community must in some way end its present guarantees of farmers' incomes."
"""The Community role should be to even out and soften the effect of appreciable fluctuations, rather than to ensure, as the present system does, that whether a currency is devaluing or revaluing, farmers in both situations get more' , as he puts it."
"In accounting terms this position may have a basis. In practice, however, farmers do a very difficult job, with many imponderables, dependent on thousands of external dangers, not only weather conditions and natural disasters, as has been mentioned here today, but also decisions taken by technocrats at a European level."
"Mr President, Mr David Hallam's report on the function of the agri-monetary system for the years 1995-1996 describes the scheme admirably."
"I would like to thank him accordingly."
"With the green ECU scheme there is an intention to implement the two goals of article 39 of the Treaty of Rome: the guarantee of a reasonable standard of living for farmers, and the freeing-up of markets."
"In serving these basic tasks the system has done well."
"This of course has been helped by the relative inter-stability of the currencies of the EU Member States."
"There was no currency crisis during the early part of the decade."
"In the future the agri-monetary system has to face two challenges: the possible implementation of the third stage of EMU, and agriculture turning its attention to world markets."
"The switch to a single currency from the start of 1999 should bring a certain degree of stability to the common agricultural policy."
"Those Member States which belong to the EMU will no longer experience any major monetary fluctuations."
"On the other hand, there will remain the problem of those countries that possibly stay outside the EMU area."
"These important agricultural countries may, at least as far as we may gather from our open debate, include Britain, Denmark and Sweden, and perhaps others."
"There are no plans by the Commission for a new system."
"The formulation of the system, however, is becoming a burning issue, as other speakers have mentioned."
"The second question is agricultural production and its importance, even more than before, in view of world markets."
"The basic principle in agricultural policy, as contained in Agenda 2000, is the reconciliation of the level of agricultural aid with world market prices."
"World markets are, however, dominated to a large extent by the US dollar."
"Over the last year the dollar has increased in value by more than 20 % in relation to the ECU."
"This may be at least partly due to the uncertainty that prevails in the world with regard to the single currency."
"Because the new Euro exchange rate might be particularly unstable in the early stages, there may be large fluctuations in prices for agricultural products on the world market when they are converted into Euros."
"This of course would be promptly reflected in EU internal prices and agricultural aid, when there would be rapid swings in value."
"For this reason, the internal connections in Agenda 2000 to world market prices and via them to the US dollar, for example, must be considered thoroughly."
"It is worrying that, with the establishment of the Euro, prices for agricultural produce and the value of agricultural aid might not grow and, indeed, may instead fall."
"Mr President."
"May I first of all turn to my friend Mr Hallam, who started by saying with some justification that he unfortunately had to deal with this most important issue before a very empty Parliament."
"I have been here since the beginning, and so I should like to offer him some comfort by saying that in my experience those who are here on a Friday represent quality; those who are absent do not!"
"Mr Hallam's report comes at just the right time."
"He emphasized in his speech term, that today one can only work in the short term, because a very big change is imminent in the whole monetary system."
"In this very debate it has become clear once again how important it is for us to have a common European currency."
"I can only say on behalf of my own electoral constituency of Upper Bavaria that our farmers are waiting for this European money, because our main trade takes place with Italy, and of late there have really been huge fluctuations in the Lira rate, causing our farmers the most serious problems."
"As soon as we have a European currency, that can no longer happen."
"We shall then have stability, we hope, and I would say that the whole of Mr Hallam's proposal is really only a temporary solution, but a vital one."
"It is really important in all questions to do with agriculture, that we create a temporary solution."
"In my personal view the long-term outlook for agriculture is excellent."
"There is one simple reason for this: our industrial society is running at full tilt into a cul-de-sac."
"We have built up most of it on non-renewable raw materials."
"Now the time for renewable raw materials is approaching."
"We should take note of the fishing wars as a major warning, though."
"Only ten years ago we were told that the oceans were an infinitely large resource, and we should solve all our problems there."
"Today we already have problems with fishing conflicts between Europe and Canada, Europe and Africa, France and Spain."
"We must recognize that the end has come for non-renewable raw materials."
"Renewable raw materials will now come from agriculture."
"If you study the problem a little and do not allow yourself to be blinded by criticism from certain large multinational companies, you will see quite clearly that that is no futuristic dream."
"Let us take fuels, for example."
"Last time I drove to the plenary session in a car that was propelled by natural oil; not rapeseed oil, but an oil derived from grasses."
"It is wonderful to drive with it."
"It is a fact that in Germany everything possible is being done to stop the construction of a network of petrol stations where this oil can be bought. This is because it would be much cheaper than conventional products, probably because the state has not yet fully extended its highway robbery to include it."
"For us, the most important thing is to do everything in our agricultural policy for the maintenance of the agricultural structure against the day when it is really needed."
"I would say - at my age one can allow oneself prophesies by saying to oneself that one will not be here when the test comes - we must simply hope that this farming structure is maintained as the subsequent basis for our agriculture, and that we should do anything to create traditional measures for farmers."
"So my warmest thanks to Mr Hallam for what he has said, because he represented this view very well."
"I think we should welcome this report and the resolution."
"I can second Mr Habsburg's words as far as the importance of traditional farming for our European continent is concerned."
"At your age, however, Mr Habsburg, you really should consider whether you ought to join the Green Party, because with your proposals you are not in good company with the Christian Democrats."
"This Christian Democratic Party has supported a policy here, and not only here, but in the national Parliament, which is heading in precisely the opposite direction: the destruction of those farms which you warn us we shall need."
"A farm goes bankrupt every two minutes in Europe, and those are the smaller businesses."
"Every year 500, 000 jobs are lost in European agriculture."
"That is a shocking figure, and if we want to stop this, then we must either accept your concepts, or we must do what has always been Green agricultural policy, and declare support for the traditional farming as the aim of agricultural policy."
"In that case we should not have to mention this report, which we have to deal with here, because, Mr Hallam, there are two possibilities for beating the system: one is that we join in monetary union, which you already mentioned."
"The other system would be to withdraw from interventionism, state buying and export subventions."
"Because these monetary measures and the offset measures being debated here are only necessary for areas and products to which intervention is applied."
"These are, indeed, the classic market regulatory products not, for example, potatoes, not vegetables, not fruit, not the whole range of products which we in Baringdorf place on the direct-sales market, the direct path to producers and consumers, from our farm."
"These are completely unaffected by variations in the exchange rate."
"Nor do we benefit from offset payments which are affected by this monetary system, but we obtain our prices from the market; we get the prices from the quality of our products and from the awareness of our consumers that these products have a special value for them."
"We see here increasingly that the value of the product is not merely measured by the quality intrinsic to it, which can be quantitively measured, but that these products are valued increasingly for their external quality - as one might call it: that there must be an agricultural structure to ensure that our old people do not become poor, that our variety of species is maintained, that there is a landscape with farming businesses and not one, as we can see in the former GDR, with farms devoid of any aesthetic value."
"Europe's cultural achievements lie in rural areas and have their origins there."
"Without wishing to blow our own trumpet, farmers made this culture, they were the basis of this culture."
"If we attack this basis we should not be surprised if Europe's culture changes."
"For this reason these monetary matters have a great deal to do with general development; so I should like to complain here that we are using the discussion on Agenda 2000 - which comes next and in which such hesitant attempts are being made to leave an intervention system for one producing quality products - as a way of submitting in the European Parliament the brave outline of a new agricultural policy lying beyond all agro-industrial logic."
"Whoever then wishes to produce within a particular agro-industrial production for world markets - as authorized by our constitutional law and our free economic laws - may do so, but then, if you please, without state support."
"And for those who maintain the culture and the landscape, who produce quality, who are in contact with the consumer, who are actually not responsible for the billions we now have to spend on BSE, there must be support."
"The agricultural budget is not too high, agriculture is not too expensive."
"The money is simply being spent incorrectly. It is being spent against maintenance of the structure, instead of in support of it."
"If we dare to make a courageous proposal here, and you, Mr Habsburg, reconsider the matter with the Green Party, then we shall be on the right path and your memory will be honoured."
"Then it will be said that at his age he still did the right thing!"
"Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, its rapporteur, Mr David Hallam, and the honourable Members of the European Parliament for the support they are giving to the report on the agri-monetary system for the single market in the period from 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996 and for the debate in this House today."
"I am quite sure that Commissioner Fischler is looking forward to the debate on Agenda 2000 and agricultural policy, and I shall make a point of not dealing with that on this occasion."
"I would like to address one point with which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development agrees."
"The Commission believes that it is too early to put forward a proposal for a Council Regulation on the adaptation of the agri-monetary system on the basis of the Euro."
"We do not yet know which or how many currencies will participate and we have no idea what exchange rates will be set, so nor do we know anything about the monetary deviations between these exchange rates and the current agricultural conversion rates."
"As long as there is uncertainty about the size of the problem, the Commission's view is that it serves no purpose to draw up a proposal for a Council regulation."
"Even though the Commission can fully accept the guidelines in the proposed resolution, I shall allow myself to make a small observation on the first reading."
"I think the statement on the currencies' relative stability for several years is too general."
"I am therefore pleased that an amendment is being submitted for the first reading to limit it to the period covered by the report, that is, from 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996."
"Mr Mulder asked some specific questions and I have been informed that the departments are also considering the questions mentioned here, as well as the various possible scenarios, so we are aware of the problems."
"In conclusion I would like to say that the Commission agrees with the guidelines which are listed in the resolution concerning the future agri-monetary system, i.e. simplicity and transparency, a limited number of changes to the agricultural conversion rates and manageable costs. And with these observations, I thank you for the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"We will now vote on Mr Hallam's report."
"We abstained from the vote on this report."
"In our opinion it is desirable to change the agri-monetary system of the internal market as soon as possible."
"The cost of ECU 1.3 billion per year is not acceptable."
"The question is whether the system has not had its day, now that almost all farmers can gain financial benefit from it."
"There is no balance, since amounts paid out to farmers in countries which revalue their currencies are not balanced against savings on amounts which are paid out to farmers who receive more in national currencies because of devaluation."
"We welcome the rapporteur's conclusions that agri-monetary systems should play a smaller role and cost substantially less than they do now."
"A saving in this area is desirable as soon as possible."
"I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent report."
"It is reassuring to know that he also wants the rules to be simplified."
"I agree with him that this is not the time to make any dramatic changes, in view of the uncertainty about EMU."
"In the longer term a radical reform is necessary."
"For the moment, fluctuations in exchange rates are not a thing of the past."
"We must endeavour to achieve a system that is self-financing."
"The conditions in paragraph 1 (d) of the draft resolution do not remove the openended nature of the system."
"That open end could be closed up with an asymmetrical system."
"Compensation for farmers in devaluing countries can be frozen in the national currency, while the payments for the revaluing countries are established in ECU."
"From the savings, the farmers in revaluing countries can receive compensation afterwards."
"In this way the agrimonetary compensation can be neutral in the budget."
"With regard to the reform of the system, this Parliament already pointed out in 1995 the risk that the Member States would contribute to the compensation for the revaluation of the green rates."
"From the annual report of the Commission, it appears that Luxembourg, Germany and Belgium additionally compensated their farmers."
"The Netherlands, Denmark and Austria, among others, did not pay their share of the compensation."
"In this way, producers in comparable circumstances are treated differently, depending on the country in which they are established."
"A European agriculture market does not tolerate this."
"With the review of the agri-monetary system, the possibility of national compensation must therefore disappear."
"As early as 1969, the Council abandoned the unity of market and price, one of the basic principles of the common agricultural policy."
"Perhaps phase III of the EMU means the rehabilitation of this principle in an important part of the European agriculture market."
"The precondition will be that the exchange rates are stable."
"Owing to the macroeconomic differences between the Member States we cannot expect that by 1998."
"It is very much to be hoped that from the start the European Central Bank will pursue a solid monetary policy geared to price stability."
"National currencies outside the EMU area will then tend to devalue with regard to the euro and certainly when countries from Central and Eastern Europe become members."
"I wish to show by this that the budget problems will continue to exist as long as the Commission does not close up the ""open end' ."
"Therefore I would request the Commissioner to take seriously my suggestion for an improved agri-monetary system."
"The Commission wishes to wait until 1 January 1999 to review the system."
"In the meantime the Ecofin Council has decided that next May it will draw up both the list of EMU participants and the bilateral parities between the currencies of these countries."
"It is to be expected that differences will arise with the mutual parities according to the green central rate."
"What does the Commission intend to do then?"
"Will there be a sudden adjustment or a gradual one?"
"The decision of the Ecofin Council requires the Commission shortly after May 1998 to propose a review of the agrimonetary system."
"Can the Commission give an undertaking as to when it will present such a proposal?"
"(The Parliament adopts the resolution)"
"Mr rapporteur, I congratulate Mr Hallam and welcome the fact that so many colleagues have attended the presentation of your report."
"This is a major feat for a Friday morning!"
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting ended at 10.10 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 19 September 1997."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of Friday 19 September 1997 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, it will be seen from the Minutes that the Friday session finished at 10.10 a.m., and that we only had a single item on the agenda."
"However, our agenda today is totally overcrowded, so that an important agreement like the cooperation agreement with Macedonia will only be dealt with towards midnight."
"I would therefore urge that we should organize these meetings better in future."
"If we had made good use of the last Friday, we could today have dealt with this important subject during the day, in the presence of our guests!"
"You are right, Mr Posselt."
"It is a pity more topics were not prepared for the last Strasbourg session, but the committees which were supposed to have completed the relevant reports were not able to approve them in time."
"Mr President, I would like to point out that today we have two guests from the Brazilian Federal State of Bahia present."
"I myself have just taken part in a seminar on Mercosur, and I believe I speak on behalf of us all in calling for a strengthening of our relations with Brazil."
"I would like to give a warm welcome to Minister Barbosa de Deus and the Vice-Governor of Brazil, Mr Borges."
"Muchas gracias, muito obrigado!"
"I welcome the guests you mention. However, as you know, the Rules of this House are that the Chair only welcomes visitors who have been officially invited."
"Many distinguished visitors attend at the invitation of honourable Members, in which case there is not normally a public welcome. However, the Chair is glad to join in your welcome."
"Mr President, my point relates to page 13 of the Minutes of Friday's meeting in Strasbourg. Paragraph 11 it states that the President reminded everyone that the next sittings would take place on 1 and 2 October 1997."
"Given today's decision of the Court of Justice, I do not think it is possible to approve the Minutes as they stand."
"Nor is it possible, as other Members will confirm, to hold this sitting."
"Point 29, second paragraph, of the decision states that additional part-sessions cannot be held anywhere apart from Strasbourg, unless the Parliament holds twelve ordinary part-sessions in Strasbourg, the seat of the institution."
"I believe it is necessary, if we are to approve the Minutes, to express an opinion on this very important point by removing paragraph 11 from the Minutes of the sitting of Friday 19 September."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, you must not mix up different issues."
"The Minutes record what was decided, and it was decided that we would have a sitting today, which is now taking place."
"Secondly, with regard to the ruling of the Court of Justice, the Bureau has today asked the legal adviser to give an opinion regarding the consequences of this matter."
"Once that opinion has been prepared, it will be submitted to the appropriate parliamentary bodies which will draw all the necessary conclusions."
"Mr President, the Court of Justice has, in effect, just passed a ruling which concerns us directly, stating that the Edinburgh decision should be interpreted as defining the seat of Parliament as the place where twelve ordinary part-sessions must be held regularly."
"Furthermore, article 176 of the Treaty of Rome, which governs our work, stipulates that the institution or institutions from which the act appealed against emanates, or whose failure to act has been declared contrary to the current Treaty, are required to take the measures involved in the implementation of the ruling of the Court of Justice."
"Mr President, you have just announced the expected initiative, and we are very pleased about that."
"It will enable our institution to conform to the ruling of the Court."
"All things considered, Mr President, I invite you to act to enable Parliament to comply fully with the law and prevent us from having to give an opinion, year after year, on a timetable which should be permanently fixed."
"Mrs Berès, I am not going to continue this discussion."
"The Bureau, which is the appropriate authority, has requested an opinion on the consequences of this matter."
"This will be submitted to the Conference of Presidents and to the Bureau and, if necessary, to the whole House so that all the consequences may be drawn."
"I shall not prejudice that and, of course, it in no way encroaches on Parliament's right to set its own timetable."
"But this will all be in accordance with the treaties, in accordance with the ruling of the Court and in accordance with our Rules of Procedure."
"That is all we can say on the subject today. It is a serious matter and allows of no improvisation."
"There is no question of opening a debate on the matter now and I hope everyone will show understanding."
"I, too, would like to speak about Parliament's session and the part-sessions for 1998."
"You have all heard, and I regret it, the Court of Justice's decision ruling given at the request of France."
"We have..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Striby, please listen. I said this debate would not continue."
"We will draw the consequences of the situation according to our Rules of Procedure when the time comes, but we are not going to discuss it now."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, I have been trying to get the floor since I came in."
"I indicated to your services that I wanted to issue a statement on behalf of my group, the Union for Europe."
"This is the third largest group in Parliament."
"It sought to visit Angola on a peace mission..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, I wish to bring a very important matter to your attention."
"On 19 September a Member of this Parliament, while returning from the session in Strasbourg, was invited to an official function in Florence."
"At that function, Antonio di Pietro, the magistrate of Milan, one of the candidates for the Third Senatorial College in Tuscany was approached by this Member, Mrs Baldi."
"As she approached him she was attacked by one of Antonio di Pietro's bodyguards and knocked to the floor."
"She was given no assistance in spite of the fact that both Mr di Pietro and the bodyguard knew that Mrs Baldi was there as a guest of honour from this institution."
"Mr President, I would like you to take up this matter with the Italian authorities to secure an apology for Mrs Baldi from the appropriate authorities and Mr di Pietro."
"I will give you a full file on the case including photographic and medical evidence."
"I would ask you to take steps to restore the dignity of a Member of this Parliament."
"This comes at a very apt time."
"Commissioner Bonino was arrested and detained in Afghanistan recently."
"We should condemn these sort of acts outside the European Union as well as inside."
"Thank you very much, Mr Crowley."
"If you would be kind enough to send me the relevant documents I will take the appropriate measures and contact the Italian authorities."
"As for Mrs Bonino, she has not asked us for any assistance and I am sure that the President of the Commission gave her whatever help she needed."
"She does not need our help, but if she did, we would give it."
"Request for procedure without debate"
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy has just asked for procedure without debate, pursuant to Rule 99, to be applied to Mr Kittelmann's report on the procedure for adopting the Community's position at the Customs Union Joint Committee set up by Decision No 1/95 of the EC-Turkey Association Council on implementation of the final phase of the customs union."
"Therefore, this report will simply be put to the vote during tomorrow's voting time at 11 a.m."
"Mr President, this is a request for procedure without debate under Rule 99(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"I would like to request the President not to adopt Mr Kittelman's very important report without debate - I do not know if he is in the Chamber."
"The report is about strengthening the customs union."
"We cannot adopt a report of this kind during a period when - and this is my reason - we are effectively taking part in negotiations on the accession of Turkey to the European Union, and while there are problems with Cyprus."
"I would like to ask the President to proceed accordingly, as there are comments to be made, including those of Mr Kittelman."
"You have invoked the relevant Rule and, as you know, the report must be submitted to a vote without debate unless at least 29 Members ask for it to be debated."
"Are there 29 Members in support of Mr Kreissl-Dörfler's request?"
"(The President noted that more than 29 Members supported Mr Kreissl-Dörfler's petition. The report would therefore be placed on the draft agenda for a future part-session, to be taken with debate)"
"Urgent political matters"
"The next item is a Commission communication on Member States' employment policy guidelines for 1998 (in preparation for the European Council summit on employment to be held on 20 and 21 November 1997 in Luxembourg)."
"The President of the Commission, Mr Santer, now has the floor."
"Mr President, broadly speaking, the report follows the same direction as the report that we are soon to discuss in the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, although of course there are differences."
"I have two questions."
"Firstly, I cannot find in the whole story on tax credits the proposal to reduce VAT on labour-intensive services."
"I should like to know from the President of the Commission whether I am mistaken."
"And if I am not mistaken, what are the arguments for not making that important proposal, where the Commission itself has authority?"
"Secondly, I would like to know whether you have based this proposal on a survey of Member States or, to put it another way, how broad do you think support for your proposals will be at the Luxembourg Council?"
"Mr President, regarding tax proposals we have this very morning identified a global package of tax measures including a code of conduct for tax regulations and a certain number of other proposals which are aimed both at direct and indirect taxation."
"This package will, moreover, be submitted to the Ecofin Council on 13 October."
"We expect the Ecofin Council of 13 October to produce certain orientations for the European Council of 21 November because we consider that the fiscal package also has an influence on employment, that a relationship between employment and taxation exists, as in other areas, for example the environment, and we are also counting on the European Council of 21 November to give some guidance in this respect."
"Regarding your second question about whether the Council will follow our lead, my answer is that we hope so."
"In the area of taxation, unanimity is still the rule and with this in mind we consider that, at least by the end of the six months of this Presidency, that is, by the end of December, we will have reached a political agreement concerning the fiscal package and also, I hope, the fiscal package in relation to employment."
"Mr President, one way to reduce unemployment, as it appears in the statistics - and I emphasize the words ""as it appears in the statistics' - is to reduce the supply of labour through various adjustments and subsidies, that is, removing people from the labour force, reducing labour force participation."
"Do you think, Mr President, that this method, which is used in a number of countries, is a good way to solve Europe's problems, as they appear in the statistics, by actually working less?"
"Or would you rather do what Mr Blair is proposing in the United Kingdom, that is, increasing employment by introducing greater flexibility into all the rules which immobilize the labour markets of Europe?"
"We have taken this particular question on board in one of the employment guidelines where we talk about making the taxation systems more employment-friendly."
"In order to encourage enterprises to create more new jobs, Member States must exploit the current favourable macro-economic climate to reverse finally the adverse long-term trend towards higher taxes and, indeed, charges on labour, which have increased from 35 % in 1980 to over 42 % in 1995."
"So we are saying that each Member State should set a target for reducing the tax burden on labour while maintaining budget neutrality with a view to achieving substantial progress by the year 2000."
"My question is about the politics of this special Employment Summit."
"I would like to hear from President Santer his assessment of how we stand in terms of momentum as we near the special summit."
"We came out of Amsterdam with a considerable head of steam behind the employment debate."
"Does he think that the guidelines he has adopted today can be a rallying point for the Heads of State?"
"What is his assessment of the current state of momentum among the Member States and what would be his test of the success of the special summit?"
"All the players must of course must be mobilized so that the European Council is a success."
"I have mentioned the difficulties with regard to this summit."
"The exercise we carried out this morning, that is, the proposals for guidelines which are a first in the area of employment, because they anticipate the employment chapter in the Amsterdam Treaty, is definitely a new type of exercise."
"In fact, it launches a process by which Member States can review their employment position year on year and adopt guidelines for a national employment policy."
"Using a similar approach to that for economic and monetary union, we are seeking to establish methods of convergence and surveillance, with these guidelines, as the starting point, to provide Member States with a monitoring system for checking whether or not their targets have been achieved each year."
"Secondly, you asked how we can move the package of measures forward so that the European Council of 21 November is a success."
"I think we need to mobilize the other players. I mentioned the social partners."
"They have a paramount role to play."
"That is why we have organized a summit for unions and management on 13 November next."
"I think all the other Community bodies must be included, such as the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee on Regional Policy, and so on."
"A genuine process needs to be undertaken."
"We are very much aware that the European Council itself is not going to create employment, but a process must be initiated and I believe that if the political will is there in the fifteen Member States, and they have a document based on that political will through the acceptance of the employment chapter in the Amsterdam Treaty - and we will be present when it is signed tomorrow morning in Amsterdam - then I believe the follow-up from this European Council has a chance of success."
"Mr President, this employment summit must be a success and for that reason I should again like to go into the two questions that were raised by Mr van Velzen, because I do not think any reply was given to Mr van Velzen's two questions."
"The first question was: what are you actually proposing on taxation?"
"Do you, for example, actually propose shifting taxes on work to other areas such as energy?"
"And are you going to make proposals in the context of VAT where we have an authority for reducing charges on intensive services?"
"My second question is related to that one, and you have now replied to it three times: what exactly are the possibilities open to the European Commission if the Member States are not prepared to agree on convergence in their aims?"
"What sanctions can the European Union then impose?"
"Or are we going to carry on in the same old way, begun in Essen, where it was stated that we were going to do certain things, but in the end nothing was fixed and no basis laid down whereby the Member States can implement these plans."
"Finally, Mr President, what proposals are you going to put forward for reforms in the longer term?"
"Because what you now propose deals with the short term, but what are you going to do about the long term?"
"We consider that tax regulations must be more favourable to employment."
"I have not gone into detail regarding the proposals, which you must of course study within the global package and which cover several dozen pages, but in order to encourage businesses to create new jobs we consider that the Member States must exploit the favourable macro-economic climate in order to reverse the long term trend towards increasing tax and social security contributions."
"We have established the objective of reducing fiscal pressure on labour, whilst maintaining budgetary neutrality, so that substantial progress can be made by the year 2000."
"We have also made a proposal, which is on the table, concerning the taxation of energy."
"We consider that this is perhaps one of the ways in which taxation on labour can be reduced."
"It is not a new proposal, for we have repeated it endlessly since the White Paper in 1993."
"Both the previous Commission and the current Commission have made proposals on this."
"There therefore exists a group of proposals which aim to reduce taxation on labour, to reinforce the general trend."
"If you study the dossier on taxation you will find extremely precise points with regard to this."
"Secondly, you ask me what provision has been made for sanctions by the Commission."
"It is difficult to say because it is a process that we are only just initiating."
"We did not make provision for sanctions in our approach when we began the process of economic and monetary union."
"We are counting on peer review, that is, the group discipline which is evident in the Council when the national reports submitted by the various Member States, which must fall within the framework of the guidelines, are examined, year after year."
"Finally, the Commission has the right, as stated in the employment chapter, to make recommendations to the Member States."
"We have not yet reached that point."
"We are, of course, waiting for the European Council of 21 November to see how we should draw up those recommendations."
"So the process has not yet started."
"No sanctions are in place because, like economic policy, social policy and employment policy are largely national responsibilities, and that must be borne in mind."
"Mr President, my question to President Santer is also on taxation."
"If the Council is not ready to make a unanimous decision on taxation, what conclusions can the Commission draw?"
"In fact, does he agree that all these jobs will be undermined unless the very essence of taxation changes, substituting forms of energy tax and VAT so that income tax can be cut."
"If we could only cut income tax we would then be in a position to cut social security."
"Is it the philosophy of the Commission that the income tax position can be eased by reducing the social security burden?"
"I would also like to ask Commissioner Flynn what is meant by this 'flexibility' which we need to have more of in the name of adaptability."
"Does it mean the USA-style development, where new jobs actually mean jobs which pay salaries that no one can live on, or does it mean dialogue in the labour markets?"
"The first thing that should be said here is that this process will require each of the Member States to draw up an action plan."
"This plan will be interactive and deal specifically with all the matters raised in the guidelines, always remembering that it will be done within a common European framework of the objectives and guidelines set down."
"But each Member State will set it out to satisfy its own particular circumstances."
"Regarding the sanction, after the summit in December adopts these guidelines, it will then be for the Member States to draw up the action plans."
"Then we will be in a position to evaluate and monitor what the Member States do."
"As a consequence of that evaluation, it is possible that the Commission, on its own initiative, will be able to make recommendations to the individual Member States as to how they have met the challenges of the guidelines."
"We are not talking here about cuts in social security; that is not the point."
"A huge resource of finance - over ECU 200 billion per year - is spent on the social security systems."
"Two-thirds of it is used on passive income maintenance measures."
"We want to see a greater proportion of the taxation and the social security systems reserves transferred into active labour market policies."
"We should always remember that we are responding to the strategy that was agreed in Amsterdam."
"This is what the Amsterdam Summit asked us to do; to regard unemployment and job creation as a matter of common concern."
"We will not be working against the Member States so far as sanctions are concerned; we will be working with governments."
"We are building cooperation so that we can finally make a quantum leap."
"This process goes back to 1993 and has now reached a point where we can set down guidelines which will help the Member States to draw up their action plans."
"Mr President, the Commission wants to turn the ship around in five years."
"It is a challenge, it is optimistic, but I feel that without vision there can never be success."
"To achieve an enterprise culture, a new mentality must naturally be in place."
"This is a long term vision."
"In the short term, we must think about finance for businesses."
"My question is thus the following: where will this finance come from?"
"From the Community budget, from the private sector, or from national budgets?"
"What does the Commission think?"
"There is no question of suggesting that a new volume of money is required."
"What we are talking about here is taking the existing financial structures, whether at Community or national level, and converting them into more active labour market policies."
"We must remember that we are talking about increasing the employment rate to 65 % over five years."
"This is not an impossible target."
"We were at that figure before in the 1970s when our employment rate was on a par with the United States. But they have moved ahead."
"We have carried out a simulation which shows that if we can maintain macro-economic growth pattern of at least 3 % per annum over the next few years, together with the structural reforms and the policy employment guidelines we are suggesting here, we will achieve at least a 65 % employment rate which corresponds to somewhere between 7 % and 8 % of an unemployment rate after five years of operation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are holding this debate while nearly 30 million people in the Union are unemployed and at least 50 million are living in poverty."
"We should not delude ourselves into thinking that the active labour market policy needed can be financed from petty cash."
"I would like to ask the Commission if, in December, in connection with the Monti initiative, it will at least discuss reclaiming tax-raising powers, namely on financial operations, company profits and property, as in view of the stability pact this can only be done through gains on the receipts side."
"Secondly, what about industry's responsibility?"
"What does the Commission intend to do to get industry to create jobs and training places, instead of rationalizing and dispersing jobs?"
"Thirdly, I welcome the fact that it will not be a deregulation summit."
"But I am not satisfied with just that."
"It must not be a workfare and flexible working summit either, because this USA model cannot be applied to the European Communities and even over there it has led to the destruction of social cohesion and to lasting social unrest."
"We are seeking to promote and encourage adaptability."
"We are talking here about modernizing work organization and working patterns in the Union."
"We will be asking the social partners - who will play a key role in all this - to negotiate, in particular in economic sectors undergoing major structural change, agreements on work organization and flexible working arrangements."
"The Member States will also be asked to put in place a framework for more adaptable forms of contract, taking into account increasingly diverse forms of employment."
"Those in non-standard work should be given greater security, for instance an occupational status."
"Those who opt to work reduced hours should not be penalized in terms of career advancement."
"All in all, we are supporting adaptability in enterprise and we want to see greater employability and to reduce the skills gap which is the main structural deficit in the Union at the present time."
"Mr President, I should like to begin with a specific point in your report where you say that 45 % of students in higher education fail to complete their course of studies."
"To these must be added about 65 % of university students who fail to graduate."
"This has given me an idea which I am preparing as a proposal for the committee: besides the incentives for employers, besides the incentives for occupational training for these young people who otherwise would automatically become unemployed, why not provide a programme of assistance for students who are in difficulties as very often they are in this position not because they do not want to study but because they need to work?"
"Why not provide them with a programme that will help them to complete their studies?"
"There would be a number of parallel results: first of all the number of potential unemployed would decrease and secondly we would be increasing the educational level of those young people who would subsequently have a better chance of being employed at a higher level as a result."
"Why not turn this proposal into a future programme?"
"This is quite a good idea."
"We would like to suggest that it involves employability, that is, enhancing people's capacity to be employed."
"And that is the core of the guidelines we are presenting to you today."
"We are talking here about tackling the problem of the long-term unemployed; and we are talking about tackling the problem of youth unemployment."
"In particular, we are talking about those who have never had the opportunity for training."
"We should not forget that 10 % of all the unemployed in Europe have had no training whatsoever."
"These are the people who end up as the long term unemployed."
"We want to see a guideline: and it is stated here quite specifically that every unemployed person will either be in a job, a skill experience or a training situation within twelve months of being unemployed."
"And every young person under 25 will be in a similar situation of training, education, or work experience within six months."
"So the work ethic will be there from the very start and we will be able finally to reduce the level of dependency in the Union."
"That is what has to be tackled if we are going to plug the skills gap that is bedevilling the whole labour market of Europe."
"Mr President, we are currently in a transitional period until monetary union comes into effect, allowing us to become more competitive, and our economies to converge."
"But the fact of the matter is that the Member States are currently making major efforts to improve their financial situations, and to converge."
"I should like the President of the Commission to give an assessment of Member States' efforts towards the convergence of their economies, and the effects these efforts are having on the labour market and job creation."
"I should also like to hear the President of the Commission's judgement of how well the multiannual employment programmes have been adhered to since 1995, and what value the Commission places on these programmes."
"In fact, quite a lot of things have been done in the recent past."
"While today President Santer and I have been focusing on the employment guidelines, we also approved two other documents."
"One of those is the employment report for 1997 where we bring together all the data, analyse it and discuss questions of policy."
"The second document, the joint report, is of considerable importance for it is from this document that the economic guidelines were derived."
"The joint report is a collection of all the best practices submitted to us in the multiannual programmes and the submissions made to the Luxembourgish President-in-Office."
"We have drawn from specific best effort and best experience and they are in the joint report."
"From that it will be clearly seen that most of the Member States have been doing positive things as far as developing their labour markets and their educational systems and reforms of all their other systems are concerned."
"Unfortunately, it has not always been done in a coordinated way."
"With these guidelines and with the Amsterdam mandate, we are seeking a coordinated action which is set out in the action plans, so that we can address the evaluation process on an ongoing basis."
"A lot has been done; it is not suggested that Member States are not giving this top priority."
"But now finally, because of Amsterdam, we have this process which allows the strategy to have real teeth."
"And I believe we have grasped that nettle today."
"Mr President, we have here a great many issues connected with taxation."
"It is also a very important part of the Commission's employment package or at least it ought to be an important part of the Commission's proposal because the President has said we should not set our sights too high in terms of what can be done about employment at EU level."
"But we can actually achieve something in taxation. I would also like to ask to what extent capital tax and the harmonization of capital tax feature in this proposal."
"We should be wary of tax dumping or tax competition, with different Member States chasing jobs and investment, unless progress is made in this area."
"I would also like to ask a question which has already been asked several times here: what does the Commission mean by wage flexibility being a good way of remedying the employment problem?"
"Mr President, the fiscal package is not a part of this Commission communication."
"This communication relates, in particular - I have said this from the start and we must make no mistake about it - to proposals for guidelines for Member States' employment policies for 1998 pursuant to, and in anticipation of, the employment chapter of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"This is the communication that I have put to you this morning."
"However, in addition to this communication, another fiscal package was this morning identified by the Commission within a different context."
"It relates to an agreement in principle which was reached by the informal Council of Finance Ministers held some time ago in Luxembourg-Mondorf-les-Bains, and which incorporated harmonization of taxation on capital."
"It is a separate package which will be submitted to the Ecofin Council on 13 October."
"Of course, you are entirely correct in saying that competition in the area of taxation, which currently occurs between Member States, reduces the tax base, creates problems of tax receipts for Member States and leads to fiscal dumping."
"This is why I believe we need to act in the face of this unhealthy competition between Member States in the sphere of taxation and, as I said, we will put in place more precise guidelines at the European Council in order to tie up, at least in a political agreement, the global package on taxation, which is far-reaching, I can assure you."
"Thus we are at least assured of having succeeded, after two years of hard work, in unblocking the taxation package which, as you know, has been bogged down for quite a while."
"So I think the Ecofin Council on 13 October will be able to give the green light to a policy agreement which we will then ratify at the European Council."
"Mr President, Mr Santer, I have listened to what you have to say with great interest, and I think you are right."
"Employment policy has become a major political issue for the European Union. It is indeed the number one priority."
"You have spoken of an ambitious plan, but I have to tell you that we can never have enough ambition when we are talking about the future of the citizens of Europe, in particular the youth."
"So I really support the various objectives you have presented to us, notably in the area of SMEs, innovation, training, youth employment and so on."
"But Mr President, you know as well as I do that a great deal of conviction is needed for the Member States as a whole to pool their efforts in this sphere effectively."
"That cannot be taken for granted."
"Do you not believe, therefore, that it is now time to talk about moral duty, indeed civic duty, in the face of such a situation in Europe?"
"You yourself have quoted some disturbing figures for unemployment, in particular concerning people living in situations of insecurity."
"It is truly scandalous."
"That is why I ask you this question. How can we make sure, authoritatively, that the states take effective measures to combat unemployment?"
"Lastly, Mr President, we talk of the EIB."
"But what finance is there?"
"Mr President, I am perfectly happy to agree with the honourable Member, because I have always felt that it is a moral duty for each Member State to combat unemployment, which is the curse of modern times."
"I myself took the initiative, on 31 January last year, to set before you a confidence pact for employment which, it has to be said, did not find the same success with the Member States as it did with you."
"I have constantly repeated that something must be done about unemployment in Europe if Europe wishes to remain credible to its citizens. We have to consider the perception of the man in the street, the worker in Europe, if we do not succeed in curbing this scourge."
"I am very happy that at Amsterdam - it was not easy, the President knows that very well, having participated in a number of intergovernmental conferences - the employment chapter was accepted, since now, at least mutatis mutandis , a connection is established with the process of monetary union."
"Now, in the eyes of the citizens, the European Union is not only a market, not only a single currency, but it also has a social dimension."
"And I hope, indeed I am sure that, thanks to the process to be undertaken, the Member States will also shoulder their individual responsibilities."
"The process which will be undertaken will enable the employment situation to be reviewed each year, because it is necessary to ensure concrete annual follow-up."
"I believe that is where success will lie."
"Mr Flynn, since you talked about a quantum leap and a new culture, do you not think the Commission could suggest, in the area of intellectual creativity, the following new approach: since SMEs, as we know, are the main source of job creation, I propose that you regard the mother of a large family as the head of a genuine SME."
"This would revolutionize our economic thinking."
"It pains me to see these women still considered inactive when they are accomplishing work of great social value through the important training they give during childhood, which is the basis for further training."
"Would this not be a great innovation to propose to our Member States?"
"That is quite right."
"You will be particularly interested in the fourth line of action which we have styled: ' To strengthen the policies for equal opportunities' ."
"Therein we state quite clearly that following on the demographic reports as outlined, the working-age population is now growing much slower than it has done for the last twenty years."
"Over the next decade it is going to decline."
"In the longer term you are quite right that the growth of employment necessary to sustain our living standards and the European social model is critically dependent on an increase in the participation of women in the labour market."
"I believe we will succeed in what we have put our hands to today."
"When the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment was introduced, you will remember that was regarded as a breakthrough in developing European policy."
"It rejected wholesale deregulation and growth alone as being a solution to our unemployment problems."
"It advocated growth and structural reform."
"But neither have been achieved to the extent we hoped for."
"Governments have been too slow and sometimes too timid in adopting the reforms we proposed at that time."
"But things have changed and moved on."
"There is a much stronger commitment now coming through and that is evident since Amsterdam."
"And we here today have grasped what is necessary to move that on and to make the commitment really substantial, to get action plans that will deliver the goods over the next five years."
"I thank the President of the Commission and Commissioner Flynn for their replies and their readiness to answer Members' questions."
"The debate is closed."
"Implementation of 1997 budget"
"The next item is a motion for a resolution (B4-0818/97) by Mr Brinkhorst, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and Mr Tillich, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the implementation of the Community budget for 1997."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank Commissioner Liikanen and Commissioner Gradin for the way in which the implementation of the European budget has improved recently."
"It is clear that in the last year we have improved the way in which the budget proposed by the budgetary authority is voted on."
"There are of course a number of criticisms, but I just wanted to say that first of all."
"It is clear that we still have problems with regard to the milk quota."
"This year no less than six countries have exceeded the quota and the question to the Commission is whether it is now time to consider proposals for restructuring in this sector."
"With regard to the structural funds, there is also a global improvement, but to the disappointment of the Committee on Budgetary Control the situation is such that there are certain shortcomings in the implementation of certain Community initiatives."
"I would like to stress the need for Commissioner Liikanen take account of this fact."
"Thirdly, last year we rightly focussed our attention on the transeuropean networks in the field of transport, energy and telecommunications."
"The Commission promised that by the end of this year there would be full implementation and the credits would be taken up."
"Is it correct that in August this year no more than 4 % of the transeuropean network funds were being used and if so, what does the Commission intend to do to improve this situation during this year."
"We are pleased about the fact that there is far greater use made of the durability of the structural funds."
"Last year, Commissioner Liikanen's colleague, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, together with the Committee on the Environment, gave clear priority to the better use of the structural funds and particularly to encouraging this durability."
"We welcome that."
"We also hope that it will be possible to make further progress in that regard because in that way durability in the European Union will be enhanced."
"With regard to external policy there is fundamental change to the Phare programmes."
"The Commission has announced that the Phare programmes will be revised, also with a view to making pre-accession easier."
"That has led to a certain amount of underspend this year."
"The question I have for the Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, is how quickly can the reform of the Phare programme be implemented, especially as, in the near future, we need to prioritize giving the countries of eastern Europe a sign that the situation is improving."
"As far as former Yugoslavia is concerned, there are still considerable problems."
"Yesterday we had a discussion with representatives of the High Commissioner for former Yugoslavia and it seems that, regarding the spending of the money, there are serious problems, particularly with regard to the development of land for housing."
"Finally, the Meda programme."
"We are pleased that after the initial difficulties, we can now see an improvement in Meda."
"We also hope that it will be possible with regard to the establishment obligations to achieve a clear change of emphasis regarding the payment obligations."
"Welcome"
"It is my great pleasure, on behalf of the House, to welcome a delegation from the Parliament of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, led by the chairman of its delegation for relations with the European Union, Mrs Ilinka Mitreva, who have taken their seats in the official gallery."
"This visit is the second meeting between delegations of the European Parliament and the Parliament of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the first official visit by a delegation from the Macedonian Parliament to the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament, which represents the citizens of the European Union, attaches great importance to its relations with the Parliament of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and, through its members, to the country and people of Macedonia."
"I am kept informed of the frequency of your meetings and current matters under discussion and I trust that these meetings will bear fruit."
"So I welcome you on behalf of the European Parliament and I hope you have a good visit."
"Implementation of 1997 budget (continuation)"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is not our job as a Parliament to spend more money at all costs."
"Our job is rather to recognize obstacles and clear them out of the way, to make the Community capable of action."
"Those words were used by Heinrich Aigner, the first chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament, on 11 October 1977, nearly 20 years ago, to describe our purpose here today."
"The authoritative procedure that he initiated at that time for monitoring the implementation of the budget has lost none of its importance since then."
"As a Parliament we have a duty to check whether the money that we have provided in the budget is also properly spent in practice."
"We have to recognize in good time if something is amiss with the budget's implementation."
"In good enough time to change course or take counter-measures."
"Later on in this process we need to find out what needs to be changed in the budget for the coming year and what needs to be improved."
"I would like to give just a few examples of where things must definitely get better."
"Firstly, reconstruction in former Yugoslavia."
"The European Union was and is at the forefront in terms of commitments for financial support in aid of reconstruction there, in order to make people's return home easier."
"But we also know that various projects have had to be discontinued or could not even start at all, because political conditions were not met and because money was only to be given to those who fully respected the peace agreement."
"Nevertheless, the actual outflow of funds and the management and efficiency of aid from the European Union also leave a lot to be desired in many areas, so that drastic improvements are urgently needed."
"The credibility of the Commission is now at stake here."
"Now for a second example, where I also consider the situation critical."
"The money that we have made available for nuclear safety in central and eastern Europe is only being used in dribs and drabs, or not at all."
"Of course the Commission is not solely responsible for the coordination of international aid for Chernobyl, but coordination problems should not be constantly used as an excuse."
"All I can do is to urgently ask the Commission again to treat these problems with the priority that they deserve."
"I know splendid arguments can be advanced about the correct priorities in politics."
"But there can be no doubt that enhancing the safety of nuclear installations in central and eastern Europe is one of these priorities."
"However, if problems arise in implementing the budget, the blame cannot always simply be laid at the Commission's door."
"One example of this is the money provided in the budget for anti-fraud measures, particularly in agriculture."
"ECU 15 million are available for improved control programmes in that area, for example."
"Apparently, the problem is just that until now no proposals have been submitted by Member States for suitable projects."
"This does not exactly cast the Member States' efforts in this field in a good light."
"We can only hope and appeal for some proposals in the coming months."
"For years we have been greatly concerned about exceeding milk quotas, and in 1992 we even had to postpone the final discharge."
"But I would also like to say something positive."
"In the case of the structural funds, the new trend already discernible in 1996 seems to have been confirmed."
"In the first half-year, at the final count more payments were effected than new funds committed."
"Nevertheless, the backlog of commitments still to be processed is enormous."
"We now have unused commitments of over ECU 24 billion and need to be very careful they do not turn into an unmanageable inherited financial burden."
"I would particularly ask you to look after that, Mr Liikanen!"
"I would also like to draw particular attention to the Community initiatives that our rapporteur, Mr Brinkhorst, has already mentioned."
"To conclude, I would like to go back to Mr Aigner again."
"The top priority mentioned in his speech twenty years ago was to initiate actions in favour of young people."
"Thanks to pressure from the European Parliament, some projects have indeed been initiated since then."
"I have in mind in particular the Socrates programme, which has been totally exhausted, and which needs to have enough funds in the next budget so that we can also make a contribution to the issue that we have just been discussing with the President of the Commission and with the Commission."
"Lastly, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, who have put in a great deal of work and have brought everything together in questions and in evaluating answers, and I would like to thank the Commission, Commissioner Liikanen and Mrs Gradin for their willing cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to adopt an approach to today's debate which is perhaps different from that of the previous speaker."
"Maybe we could look at things somewhat more keenly from the viewpoint of a totally ordinary elected representative of the taxpayers."
"It will then be seen that to some extent we are giving the starting signal today for the debate on the Commission's final discharge."
"I see that the submission by the two rapporteurs, who have done a good job, is pretty much in line with expectations."
"We criticize the fact that milk quotas have been exceeded, regret the low take-up of Phare, and are even concerned about the use of our funds for Yugoslavia, but in contrast we welcome the high Meda utilization rate."
"That just about sums up our position."
"At the end of this process, in the interest of Europe's taxpayers, that is to say - we hope - our electorate, we will wag a warning finger and then give good discharge to the Commission for its implementation of the budget."
"We will once more have seen - and it will be touched upon in various speeches - that 80 % of the EU budget will regrettably have been spent by Member States, and only 20 % - peanuts, as we now say in Germany - will have been spent directly by the Commission."
"Perhaps it would be interesting if just once we did what we promise our fellow citizens before the elections, and quite simply and dispassionately exercised political control over the Brussels bureaucracy."
"I would suggest that to start with we concentrate on the 20 % where it is not the Member States who are the naughty boys, but the European Commission itself."
"For once, let us not concentrate exclusively on the implementation percentage rates, according to the motto 'High rate good, low rate bad!' ."
"We would soon strike rich then."
"We have already mentioned the Phare programme."
"After seven years, the Commission is still unable to spend more than half of the budget provided."
"In the same position, any national minister responsible for a department would have to resign and admit that he is not capable of properly carrying out the work entrusted to him, and the Court of Auditors says just that in its reports."
"And all this in an area where the Commission has set its own sights very high with its Agenda 2000, and says that this is practically the most important thing that we have to do in the next few years, that is, enlargement to the east."
"Given the European Commission's total inability to spend ECU 1 billion a year meaningfully in our neighbouring countries in central and eastern Europe, can we really expect that the same Commission, with the same people, will be capable of managing the far more expensive and complex process of these countries' accession to the European Union?"
"I certainly could not explain that to my voters in Austria, in view of the figures before us today."
"This assumption is supported by the ""utilization' rate - which I can only say in quotation marks - for the ECU 10 million under the Phare democracy budget heading, of which by 31 August this year, precisely 0 % had been used or committed!"
"This is at a time when the Commission is ostentatiously issuing testimonials to our eastern neighbours and explaining to them the great scope for improvement in society, and how much they can rely on the support of the European Commission."
"I do not want to labour the point about the Phare programme, and I think we could say the same about the Meda programme, where there are also reports by the Court of Auditors."
"Their verdict? Irregularities!"
"So far we have not had an opportunity, because of the somewhat limited staff resources at our disposal, to go into the details here."
"Mrs Theato, the chairman of our Committee on Budgetary Control, has already touched on nuclear power stations and the utilization of Tacis funds."
"The situation there looks disastrous as well."
"I have to say that it may be a good thing that we have not committed more than 20 % in the Ukraine."
"I do not want to quote any more examples, but I do believe that during these debates we should perhaps really investigate the quality of budget implementation."
"Surely we owe that to our electorate and to ourselves as the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I should like to begin with a general remark before making a few specific comments."
"It seems to me that the debate we are having this afternoon is sometimes relegated in importance in our budgetary debates."
"It seems to be thought of as just a means by which we look at the way in which the budget has gone."
"Then we make a switch in our minds and look to the budget debate next week in the Committee on Budgets and later this month with the vote in Strasbourg."
"But the monitoring of expenditure should be treated with equal importance by the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control and by Parliament's spending committees."
"I was pleased to see that there has been some progress in ensuring that the monitoring of expenditure is an important item."
"It should be the jumping off position for us."
"After this debate we should be able to say: we know where the weaknesses are in the budgetary process."
"And we should not be voting new credits until matters such as those Mr Bösch has raised are cleared up."
"We can use the reserve to caution the Commission in the expenditure process that something is not right."
"So this debate forms part of a developing process and is important."
"A whole range of ideas have been put forward by Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Tillich in their resolution about the underutilization of credits."
"Low utilization should be a sign for treating amendments in these areas with some considerable caution."
"There are particular areas such as ex-Yugoslavia where we have to take into account special circumstances."
"I am interested in what our rapporteur Mr Brinkhorst has said to us about the difficulties in implementation of programmes."
"It would be helpful to have the Commission's comments on what has been set out in paragraph 16."
"Secondly, as Mr Bösch said - and my group agrees with him - rapid utilization does not necessarily lead to effective utilization of the credits."
"You could have some eager bureaucrat who says: As long as I spend my money, Parliament will vote me more, because it sees that utilization has actually been carried out."
"We notice that where there has been good utilization in Category 1, the forecasts have been perhaps over-optimistic and therefore I welcome the fact that we will have an updated picture of the 1998 budget before we come to our final vote."
"In the programmes in Category 4 where we see high utilization in Meda and low utilization in Tacis, the Group of the European People's Party does not feel that we should necessarily be voting all the credits for Meda next year but put Tacis in the reserve."
"Precisely as Mr Bösch says, we have to look at the quality of the expenditure."
"Lastly the European People's Party would hope that where we have had an unexpected event like in the Jet programme in Culham this year, where there have been unexpected exchange rate movements -the pound gained vis-à-vis the ecu - there should be some consideration to make sure that cuts are not made in the effective operational budgets of an important programme like that of the fusion programme at Culham."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the joint report by Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Tillich seems to me an excellent occasion to remind everyone of an obvious principle that can be stated thus: funds approved by Parliament are intended to be spent."
"If this report notes, rightly, some progress in the tendency to spend funds activated two years ago more fully, then it underlines, and I want to insist on this, a certain number of malfunctions with regard to which certain drastic conclusions need to be drawn for the next budget."
"Firstly, concerning funds for the Phare programme, the availability of ECU 150 million which is forecast for the end of the financial year must lead us to question ourselves sincerely as to whether the tool is sufficiently adapted for the intended objective."
"The delegation which visited Romania last week within the framework of the joint committee was able to observe the difficulties which this country is having, like many others, in integrating into the accession negotiations due to lack of funds, whilst at the same time we have ECU 150 million unspent."
"When we are beginning, through the Agenda 2000 discussions, to build what must be our new border, it seems to me distressing that we cannot find a response appropriate to this type of problem, which leads to the cancellation of credits when there is a crying need voiced by the candidates for enlargement."
"Concerning former Yugoslavia, and in my position as special rapporteur for this budget, I would also like to underline here my utter dismay in the face of the virtual lack of take up of some of these credits."
"Thus, for example, the rate of use of payment appropriations allocated for reconstruction of the republics was 6.14 % by the end of August 1997, for Sarajevo the rate was 4.15 % and none of the funds allocated whatsoever had been used for rehabilitation of the republics born of the former Yugoslavia."
"I must say that, notably with regard to refugees, it seems to me incredible that funds provided by Europeans are used for objectives whose concrete effects cannot be seen, since the refugees are still here in the countries which have given them a home."
"I believe that, for the vote on the 1998 budget, a certain number of conclusions should be drawn so that the budget is not disrupted by open credits which we now know perfectly well will not be spent."
"Concerning Tacis, I must say that the problem is a little different, since we know of certain specific difficulties, in particular nuclear energy in the countries of the former Soviet Union, and in this respect it would be extremely useful if effective decisions were taken."
"On the other hand, last year we were lamenting the lack of use of funds for the Meda programme."
"I think we must from now on take pleasure in the substantial acceleration in the use of these credits."
"However on a more general note, and by way of conclusion, I would like to warn the Council against an initiative which would once again mean a reduction of payment appropriations in the 1998 budget for the financial year to come."
"Now that the stability pact has been ratified in Amsterdam, it is up to each Member State to reduce its domestic expenditure and to stop regarding the Community budget as something for a rainy day which, at the end of the financial year, enables them - thanks to the return of unused funds - to carry out last minute adjustments in which European credits are a positive variable for finance ministers in difficulties."
"I believe we must make sure that the policy of commitment appropriations and payment appropriations is used so that there is no difference, or as small a difference as possible, between the amounts committed and the amounts paid."
"It is because some governments do not wish to implement the interinstitutional agreement fully that it often seems as if the European Parliament is not doing its job."
"Here I would here like to say that exactly the opposite is the case."
"I believe the Committee on Budgets of this Parliament works meticulously on the use of credits."
"It just wishes its work was followed up in the same way by the Council and the Commission."
"Mr President, Mr Brinkhorst's and Mr Tillich's presentation of the resolution provides an excellent interim picture of the implementation of this year's budget. I would like to thank them both, accordingly."
"There are several interesting points to note in the document on the implementation of the budget for 1997."
"Of these, I would like to draw your attention to point 5 which states that the objective 6 commitment appropriation may not have been spent at all."
"This is both worrying and surprising."
"The objective 6 regions are sparsely-populated areas in northern Europe which have experienced immense structural change, and where the employment situation is bad."
"So it is worrying if monies set aside for the development of these regions goes unspent."
"Although the presentation of the resolution is very recent, it may be slightly out of date."
"According to my information, Finland has committed half the appropriation it got for this year's objective 6 programme."
"In itself, this is positive, but the situation is hardly satisfactory."
"The implementation of structural funding is hampered by bureaucracy and complicated systems."
"Getting funds means complicated administrative procedures, and good projects remain unimplemented because applicants are fed up with grappling with formalities to do with application procedure."
"These procedures should, therefore, be simplified."
"The main topic of debate at the Luxembourg Summit is employment."
"The employment situation in Europe is alarmingly fragile."
"In improving the situation one of the EU's most important tools is the structural funds, so more effective use of them should be high on the agenda."
"Mr President, Mr van den Broek."
"We included ECU 105 million in the budget for reconstruction in Yugoslavia."
"Of that, just ECU 3, 376 million had been implemented by August."
"We made ECU 15 million available for 'Europe for Sarajevo' in 1997, of which ECU 623, 000 had been implemented by August."
"How can you demonstrate to us, the Parliament, which at a future date will be required to give you final discharge, that the Commission is committed to making every effort actively to support reconstruction in former Yugoslavia?"
"Less than four weeks ago I sat in your office and we analysed together the considerable political and legal problems, and those of your own making, involved in using these funds."
"We came to the common conclusion that things could not carry on as they were."
"Some political imagination was needed and we had to come up with some proposals for getting out of this mess."
"You agreed with this, and suggested that Mr Giansily, some other colleagues and I should undertake to get together with the Commission and consider a way forward."
"We have waited in vain for this invitation, which should actually have come at the last part-session."
"So how can the Commission convince us that you are really prepared to do something?"
"This much I can tell you: during the budget process next week, we will include a reservation, and it will not be the Parliament that has to explain to the public why this money is not flowing out, it will be the Commission that will have to explain why this money had not been made available by August and why - I think I dare say this - it will not be have been made available by the end of the year!"
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my previous life I was involved with the Belgian budget, and now I am dealing with the European budget."
"In the Belgian budget for years our problem was to prevent expenditure going off the rails and to remedy it."
"In Europe the situation is somewhat different."
"Here, our main problem is to ensure that what we plan to spend is also effectively spent."
"On closer inspection both tasks are important democratic imperatives."
"A budget must be the reflection of a political will and so our task is the optimum implementation of the budget within the margins, and not outside the margins."
"It is important to seize the opportunity of this debate in order to stand still."
"I can limit myself quickly to two observations."
"Firstly, a favourable observation."
"I can endorse what Mr Brinkhorst said, that with regard to the structural funds, spending is gradually improving."
"That is a good thing."
"I can confirm much more emphatically what Mr Giansily and Mrs Müller have said with regard to assistance to former Yugoslavia."
"Here we have an immense moral obligation to fulfil in connection with the reconstruction after our failure to dam up the conflict, and we are fulfilling it in an extremely poor and non-transparent way."
"This must be remedied in the short term and for me that is the most important message that I have learned from the implementation of the 1997 Community budget."
"My group has asked me, with reference to the implementation of the 1997 budget, just to take a look at the future."
"In the future the budget will be politically dominated by two subjects: 1. employment, 2. enlargement."
"As far as employment is concerned, it must be clear from the outset. The European Parliament as budgetary authority must dare to stick its neck out in order to contribute to the offensive that Europe must make against the scourge of unemployment."
"But it must also be clear that we only form part of a global approach."
"It will not be possible without greater effort, not only in our budget, but also from the Member States and in other areas which largely cannot be included in our budget at European level today."
"I continue to go on about the non-implementation, the scandalous non-implementation, of the Delors White Paper from 1993, particularly with regard to the transeuropean networks."
"These are the things we must assess in a global framework and within that global framework we must assume our responsibility with regard to the European budget."
"The hypocrisy must stop where the budgetary authority votes on certain items that later cannot be implemented owing to a lack of legal basis."
"That is humbug."
"We cannot accept that any longer."
"The difficulty we face in the discussions about the first reading of the 1998 budget in the next few weeks is that the Luxembourg summit takes place between the first reading of the budget and the second reading of the budget."
"I think we will have to be creative in order to maximize the negotiating position of the European Parliament and pressure by the European Parliament on decision-making during the Luxembourg summit at the end of November."
"The second aspect is the implementation and preparation of the enlargement of the Union."
"Let it be clear: enlargement stands or falls for us on further institutional adjustments."
"Whatever is provided for in the budget, if institutionally we cannot go further than Amsterdam, then Europe is destined to become paralysed on enlargement."
"So in the first place for me enlargement is an institutional debate, but in addition it is a fact that we must prepare ourselves for the financing of the European Union after enlargement."
"In this connection a central feature is of course a more rational structural policy that cannot harm the underestimated, in my view, redistribution function that Europe now already has and which is a good thing."
"We must dare to say loudly that the enlargement of the Union means not less solidarity but more solidarity."
"We must also dare to say out loud that we do not accept people attacking the enlargement of the Union in order to restart a debate about the just return and once again endanger a number of commitments connected with the financing of the Union."
"An enlarged Union, whether we like it now or not, will cost the Member States more money."
"That is, however, our basic political duty."
"And lastly, we shall have to assume our responsibilities."
"Within a certain budgetary strait-jacket, we shall selectively have to cut back on certain items."
"May I now on the eve of our budget debate call on both the Council and my colleagues in Parliament to make these cuts selectively in order to avoid linear cuts at all costs."
"Linear cuts for me amount to a lack of courage and lack of political choice."
"Therefore I argue in favour of selectiveness."
"Mr President, as many speakers have already said, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, we should be pleased that developments have gone in the right direction."
"The implementation of the budget is gradually getting better and better, but we should not content ourselves with that."
"As the resolution states, there is still a great deal left to do."
"Just like my Finnish colleague from the Liberal Group, I was surprised by paragraph 5 concerning objective 6 areas, and that no money has gone to this."
"I have now checked this and found out that what is said is not entirely true."
"Money has, in fact, been earmarked, but the systems in Sweden and elsewhere mean that the money is not paid out."
"It is, nonetheless, very important to find out why full use has not been made of these accounts."
"The Commission must find out about this as soon as possible in cooperation with the Member States."
"Objective 6 is important for northern parts of Sweden and Finland in view of, amongst other things, their geographic situation."
"May I mention, in parentheses, that the first snows already fell in northern Sweden last week bringing 20 centimetres of snow."
"Compare that with Brussels, where it is 20 degrees above freezing, and you can see that it could cause certain problems in northern Sweden."
"We must therefore make sure that the objective 6 funds are used."
"The reason why they have not been used is two-fold. It may be due in part to bureaucracy, and in part to the fact that the funds might not match up with projects on which decisions have already been taken in Sweden."
"And, finally, to the eternal headache: the agricultural sector."
"I want the Commission to produce a real restructuring plan for milk quotas, so that we do at some time bring some order into this problem in future."
"I want the Commission to reply to this too."
"Mr President, the resolution discussed today concludes the procedure to inform the budgetary authority about the implementation of the current Community budget."
"This procedure which was initiated by the European Parliament has turned out to be very helpful for the control and also for us as the executor."
"It has been quite effective in permitting the Commission and Parliament a detailed discussion of the state of execution as we have been able to note today."
"Furthermore, it provides the basis for the global transfer which the Commission will propose next week."
"As far as the overall execution of the 1997 budget is concerned, the outlines, of which the Commission informed the budgetary authority in July, are confirmed by the most recent data."
"The execution of the budget as a whole at the end of September exceeds the level of previous years, in particular with regard to payment appropriations."
"Although one-third of the budget still needs to be implemented, the Commission's expectations are that execution at the end of this year will be higher than in 1996 and therefore continue the recent trend."
"There are two main factors to explain this development."
"Firstly, there were no major new spending programmes in the 1997 budget."
"In particular with regard to the structural funds, implementation now progresses smoothly."
"Secondly, the 1997 budget was intentionally conceived more tightly than previous budgets."
"Both in agriculture and with regard to payment appropriations for structural actions, the budgetary authority to some extent decided to anticipate the underspend."
"While this does not seem to create particular problems in category 1, the payment appropriations for the structural funds will very likely be fully used."
"I have a few remarks and replies regarding the individual categories."
"In category 1 the Commission has already proposed a transfer to re-balance the budget lines before the end of the budgetary year."
"Lower than expected needs in the beef and cereals sector will enable us to pay the advance on the oil seed premiums and to cover the costs of swine fever."
"The agreement of the budgetary authority to examine a late rectifying letter will permit the drawing of the appropriate conclusions also for the 1998 budget."
"As far as the matter of the milk quota is concerned, that discussion will be a part of Agenda 2000, the CAP reform, so we may come back to it in discussions in that context."
"In Category 2 the only exceptions to the high rate of implementation are a few Community initiatives."
"In these areas some re-programming towards the end of the programming period has been inevitable."
"As far as the questions from Mr Virrankoski and Mr Holm on the execution of objective 6 are concerned, it looks very likely that the funds will be fully used by the end of the year."
"Our information points in that direction."
"The particular problems of objective 6 have been widely discussed in the context of Agenda 2000."
"Concerning the internal policies, the Commission expects an overall execution close to 100 % in commitments, taking into account very limited redeployments in the framework of the global transfer."
"Mr Brinkhorst asked about the transeuropean networks."
"The emphasis put on the TENs by the European Parliament has been met by an already very high rate of execution."
"I have here the figures from yesterday which say that execution as far as commitments are concerned is at the level of 82 %."
"As far as payments are concerned the level is 40 %."
"In category 4 the picture is more mixed as has been noted by a few speakers."
"The Commission will propose some more significant redeployment in the global transfer."
"Most important, the reorientation of Phare towards a preaccession instrument will reduce the amount which can still be executed this year by ECU 150 million."
"These funds could be made available this year for Meda and recuperated in 1999 thus fully respecting the pluriannual envelopes for both programmes."
"Concerning Mr Bösch's remarks, I have two comments."
"As far as Phare is concerned, as long as the projects were very small on average, execution was extremely complicated and control was also difficult."
"That was one reason for reorientating Phare towards the two major areas of infrastructure and institutions and also increasing the critical size of the programmes."
"As far as Meda is concerned, his criticism was directed at programmes which are programmes of the past."
"For the present Meda programme, the size of the programmes is higher and execution is already this year at the level of 63 %."
"Finally, as far as the administrative budget of the Commission is concerned, the exchange rate developments have been favourable."
"The Commission will shortly transmit a proposal to the budgetary authority to use these funds to reduce future budgetary needs and I hope this proposal will receive support."
"Mr Commissioner, you must excuse me but by mistake we have not given the floor to Mr Lukas. I therefore immediately give him the floor for one minute."
"Mr President, I have the unexpected honour of speaking after the Commissioner."
"My intervention will not be so earth-shattering, but order must prevail and I am happy to accept that."
"The motion for a resolution gives a very objective overview of a serious situation."
"The rapporteurs deserve thanks for their work."
"If in many important areas funds have been scarcely used or even not at all, that begs the question whether the contributions from the Member States, or from some individual states, are not too high."
"As regards plans for enlargement to the east, the low utilization rate of Phare programme funds and of those for cross-border cooperation in the structural area are particularly to be regretted."
"The extremely low implementation rate for the heading covering measures to counter violence against children is not totally devoid of a certain cynicism."
"The consistently low implementation rate of funds for agricultural controls is worrying."
"Bearing in mind the growing incidence of fraud and the consequent anger felt by citizens of the Union, all control mechanisms need to be fully and efficiently applied."
"It is particularly hard to explain to the citizens of those countries which are net contributors why large parts of the budget which they help to finance are barely implemented."
"A reform of income and expenditure policy really is needed."
"With the social situation deteriorating in many Member States common decency alone demands a stricter and more efficient budget policy!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow."
"EU-Canada relations"
"The next item is the report (A4-0140/97) by Mr Graziani, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission on relations between the European Union and Canada (SEC(96)0331 - C4-0620/96)."
"Mr President, at the beginning of the sitting I asked to speak to make one of those digressions from the Rules of Procedure which are a fairly frequent occurrence in this Parliament."
"Allow me, Mr President, to draw the attention of the House and the Commission to the tragic event that has struck Italy in two regions, Umbria and the Marche: the toll of victims is high as is the toll of lost works of art."
"I believe it would be useful, positive and necessary for Italy, as the country directly affected, but also the European Union, to take charge of the work of restoring a heritage which - and it is not going too far to say this - belongs not just to Italy or Europe but to humanity as a whole."
"Let us now come to the report on the agenda."
"Bilateral relations between Europe and Canada have a history going back to the signing of the Treaties of Rome."
"The first agreement concerned nuclear cooperation, then, in 1976, there was the framework agreement on commercial and economic cooperation, and in successive stages we arrived at the political declaration and the relative joint action plan of December last."
"This cooperation and these links have been renewed over time and are now becoming closer in terms of strengthening transatlantic relations which, although first established with the United States, certainly cannot ignore Canada today."
"In fact, within the sphere of new international relations, an agreement between Europe and Canada may be useful in bringing the necessary equilibrium to this complex of transatlantic relationships."
"What we have to do is in fact find out what are, after the end of the cold war, the new areas of agreement between Europe, the United States and Canada, now that the cement of security which has held these relationships together for 50 years has been substantially altered."
"A period in which joint security was the prime consideration can only be succeeded by a period of the closest collaboration in all fields, where no one party can exercise excessive hegemony."
"But hegemony cannot be exorcised, it has to be contained by appropriate policies."
"Here the understanding between the European Union and Canada constitutes a balancing factor of primary importance, useful, I think, to the United States which, with its Helms-Burton and D'Amico laws, obviously thought - incorrectly - that it could make its allies accept unilateral measures."
"Maintaining the right balance is what binds together the democracies, together with the rule of law and more firmly based international relations."
"Failure to achieve the right balance also has an impact on relations and cooperation and so if we now treat our transatlantic relationship with Canada in the same way as we treat our relationship with the United States, it will follow the same logic and they will reinforce each other."
"It is therefore in the interests of the European Union to ensure that North America does not abandon its relationship with Europe in favour of its, admittedly necessary, relationship with the Pacific area."
"Certainly there are advantages in seeing this scenario as the possible, but currently objectively uncertain way forward for Europe, if it does not become an institutional and political entity with a foreign policy, the creation and development of which will be the expression of a genuine ability to govern."
"Today this is not the case, and this deficiency is the reason for the imbalance. What Amsterdam offers us is only a substitute, like using chicory to make coffee."
"However, with Canada, a young country which has the advantages but also the disadvantages of a young, multilingual nation, collaboration opens things up even more, which makes it impossible to hide current disputes such as the issue of fishing."
"The biggest problem from this point of view - I would remind you - is that the shoals off Newfoundland are no longer what they were and it is in everyone's interest, not just Canada's but Europe's as well, to take account of the fact that the fish have disappeared. The same goes for hunting."
"The culture and the needs of the indigenous population must be respected above all, but that does not rule out the need to use traps which cause as little suffering as possible."
"Canada is - I would remind you - an essential partner for ensuring Europe's stability and security."
"It is a modern country with a culture of democracy and respect for minorities. In this regard, Mr President, I have the honour of presenting this report to Parliament in the hope that it may be approved."
"Mr President, the Commission's proposal on EU-Canada relations includes a chapter on cooperation in the field of internal affairs and justice."
"That is a good thing."
"It takes account of the fact that long before the globalization of the economy there was globalization of international organized crime."
"Modern criminal organizations are now organizing their activities on a global scale."
"Thus we can see the Russian mafia committing organized social security fraud in Los Angeles, not just in Moscow."
"The Japanese Yakuza are not just active in Tokyo, but also in Düsseldorf and Toronto."
"Chinese Triads are not just active in Hong Kong, but also in Amsterdam, London and San Francisco."
"There are lessons to be learnt from this."
"The lesson is that crime has long since been organized across borders, whereas the police are still cooped up in the pen of nation states."
"We in the European Union have drawn the obvious conclusions by developing the third pillar."
"But that is not enough."
"What is taking place in the third pillar needs to be complemented by agreements with third countries."
"Internal security needs its flanks protected from the outside."
"The conditions for doing this with Canada are favourable."
"First, the Canadian government and both chambers of the Canadian Parliament are also in favour of this."
"Secondly, the authorities in Canada concerned with internal affairs and justice are deeply interested in the problems that I have just mentioned."
"And thirdly, the partner for police cooperation is highly qualified, you cannot fail to learn from the Canadian Mounted Police when you see what they actually do."
"No, the obstacle lies in Europe's disunity."
"We are not yet as able as we might wish to speak with one voice."
"That must change."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Graziani, on his report, which evaluates the various aspects of EU-Canadian relations in a balanced way and is forward-looking."
"However, at the same time I would also like to emphasize how important it is that the European Parliament should state its position on the joint action plan."
"It is precisely because cooperation between Canada and the European Union is very good in many areas, but has nevertheless been difficult on the environment, for example, that strong contacts between elected representatives are needed."
"We need many contacts and conversations in order to understand one another, and then we must be in a position to influence the action plan."
"That is why I find it almost incomprehensible that the action plan was adopted before Parliament had expressed its views on it."
"I would now like to turn to some environmental issues."
"As I see it, environmental protection is a field where the EU and Canada cooperate within international bodies in order to find common solutions to global environmental problems."
"In addition, there are also bilateral issues, such as efforts to introduce humane animal trapping standards."
"Intensive discussions and negotiations have now led to acceptance by the EU's foreign ministers of the agreement negotiated between the EU, Canada and Russia."
"In future, when it comes to implementing the agreement - which I in fact support - a key issue will be to find specific humane alternatives to the trapping methods used up to now."
"The abolition of steel jaw traps alone will not necessarily solve the problem."
"This is not just a matter for government and Commission officials."
"The contribution of people who have enormous practical experience and expert knowledge will be critical."
"I have in mind both animal protection organizations and indigenous trappers in Canada, and also in the USA or Russia."
"They have practical experience."
"You will see that I would like to extend EU-Canadian relations, especially on the environment and animal protection, to other levels as well."
"In Autumn last year, I had an opportunity to learn about the experiences and practices of Indians in Quebec at first hand."
"This experience, and also the experiences of other groups and peoples should be passed on and discussed, for example, with international animal protection organizations and with Members of this House interested in this."
"It is certainly not a question of interference."
"After all, animal protection is a matter of common worldwide interest, as are the efforts made to give indigenous peoples an appropriate role in achieving environmentally sound and sustainable development, and to allow them to participate in decision-making about the utilization of resources and development in their territories."
"As for general cooperation on the environment, the action plan shows that the environmental consultations that have taken place in the past should be continued."
"However, we realize that negotiation is not anticipated, but simply the production of a report."
"We also warmly welcome the processes or the agreements concerning health policy."
"Now we need to get on with the programme and negotiate!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy I wish to compliment Mr Graziani on his excellent report."
"The bilateral relations between the Union and Canada have a long history."
"In 1995 important agreements were signed on cooperation in the field of science and technology."
"Since 1959, there has also been cooperation in the field of energy and particularly nuclear cooperation."
"And Canada of course has a strong tradition in science and research."
"This also offers sound prospects for Canada as the site of the future thermonuclear experimental reactor, known as ETER, but only in fact if the Union decides to continue the fusion research in full."
"The strengthening of the ties with Canada is also important in the light of the recent reinforcement of transatlantic relations with the United States."
"In the new action plan, cooperation is extended to information and communications technology and biotechnology."
"Two sectors in which there will be the most job opportunities in the future."
"The Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy hopes that the planned scientific cooperation in the field of biotechnology, including regulations in the field of genetic manipulation, can quickly be put into action."
"With regard to cooperation in the field of information technology, attention should above all be paid to the formation of networks between companies in order to encourage the transfer of technology."
"Top priority must be given to joint research projects in the ICT sector."
"In view of the considerable amount of development in this sector in Canada, the European ICT sector can benefit from it."
"Mr President, like my colleagues I also wish to congratulate Mr Graziani on the presentation of an excellent report."
"Generally speaking, there has always been cooperation and mutual good will between Canada and the Union so it is difficult for most people to fully understand the often fraught relations between the EU and Canada in the fishery sector."
"The question is often asked how fisheries became the subject of such disagreement."
"It is important therefore to look at the background."
"Both the EU and Canada have very similar fishery structures."
"The EU and Canada's dependence on the fishing industry in peripheral regions is high and any threat to the resource understandably gives rise to emotion and tension."
"In 1975 Canada, Iceland and Norway declared a two hundred mile exclusive economic zone to protect their dwindling stocks and Europe followed suit in 1977."
"This led to a loss of fishing opportunities for European vessels and after the accession of Spain and Portugal in 1986, the problems which they faced then became Community problems."
"In 1992 Canada declared a moratorium on the fishing of northern cod and they estimate that this resulted in the loss of some 40, 000 jobs in Newfoundland."
"The effects of the reduced fishing opportunities for the EU fleet are well known; we had years of stalemate and deteriorating relations."
"The Union and Canada in 1992 initialled a memorandum of understanding and this was to constitute a new fisheries agreement to supersede the 1981 framework accord."
"In 1994 Canada amended its coastal fishery protection act to allow measures to be taken for the conservation of straddling stocks within the exclusive two hundred mile zone and in adjacent waters."
"This gave the authorities power to arrest vessels of designated states and in March 1995 Spain and Portugal were added to that list."
"The arrest of the Spanish vessel and the bitter battle which ensued are now history."
"Fortunately, the dispute was settled some weeks afterwards and in September of that year Spain and Portugal were removed from the list of designated states."
"Having said all that I share the optimism that it seems possible for the Union and Canada to cooperate more fully and that both sides better understand and respect each other's point of view."
"My committee hopes that increasing cooperation in the fishery sector will help develop the strong ties which exist."
"This can be achieved through confidence-building measures, both at bilateral level and multilaterally through NAFO."
"My committee calls on the Union and Canada to ensure compliance with their bilateral commitment."
"We support the NAFO initiative to maintain the current objection mechanism."
"We reject the extra-territorial provisions of current Canadian fishery legislation and in conclusion can I say...."
"(The President cut off the speaker )"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Graziani on his report and say that I am glad he is better and can be with us."
"I should like to raise two important points."
"This report on our relations with Canada is particularly important now, with all the talk of modernizing transatlantic relations. Right from the outset, and even during the most difficult moments, Canada has always supported the causes of Europe and freedom."
"This must be recognized and brought up to date. It is not just a question of discussions with the United States."
"There are two aspects I want to mention."
"Firstly, transatlantic relations are entering a new dimension now that Canada is also becoming involved in the creation of a free trade area with the United States - the NAFTA Treaty - which has also been extended to Mexico. At the moment there are even suggestions for a continental free trade area for the whole of America."
"Similarly, I think it is important to consider how our relations with Canada are affected by international law and relations within the framework of the WTO. In particular, I am thinking about extra-territorial laws, such as the Helms-Burton Act, which are as damaging to Canada as they are to the European Union."
"Finally, Mr President, I should like to mention fishing, which I think is an important aspect of the report. Mr Graziani has incorporated amendments in this area, some of them at my suggestion."
"As the previous speaker said, it is best if long-standing relations, such as concern fishing, can respect international law."
"We are well aware that fishing is a contentious matter, as shown by the current ""salmon war' between the United States and Canada."
"As a former Community leader said, Jesus chose fishermen for his disciples because fishing can easily become contentious."
"In any case, I believe it is important to look to the future positively, by developing our relations in a climate of solidarity, cooperation and respect for international law."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to congratulate Mr Graziani warmly on his magnificent report."
"Canada is a great country with which we have strong historical, political and economic ties."
"We share common principles and values, and our relations should be governed by cooperation."
"However, as a Spaniard and a Galician in particular, I must mention a matter which has cast a shadow over our relations - namely, fishing."
"The Galician people whom I represent here still cannot understand why Canada behaved so aggressively in the fishing conflict which it started, in violation of international law."
"I do not want to reopen old wounds, but rather to help to heal them once and for all. Therefore, I would like to draw attention to sections 20 and 21 of the Graziani report, and the eight conclusions which the Committee on Fisheries has added to it."
"These reject Canadian extraterritorial legislation, calling for it to be repealed, and for guarantees to be given to Community vessels. They also call for true cooperation within NAFO, maintaining the existing objection mechanism and avoiding discrimination with other fleets, and also call for the 1992 Fisheries Agreement to come into force, albeit in a modified form, but including the main European requests as already granted, such as access for the Community fleet to Canada's surplus fisheries resources."
"As the Graziani report says, for the joint action plan to be useful it must not just be a declaration of good intentions, but an effective commitment to improve cooperation."
"As a member of this Parliament's delegation to Canada and of the Committee on Fisheries, I sincerely hope that this cooperation may be strengthened."
"Fishing, Mr President, can be the test of these new relations between Canada and the European Union."
"Mr Chairman, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our common interest in maintaining and developing relations between the European Union and Canada is not derived - or at least should not be exclusively derived - from the extensive major commercial interests represented here."
"On the contrary, cooperation and agreement on matters such as those relating to our opposition to the extraterritorial effect of certain national legislation, such as the American Helms-Burton Act and laws of some NATO countries, or, similarly, cooperation and agreement in the case of certain humanitarian actions, or indeed that of resolving the question of how to finance the United Nations, are political fields of joint cooperation which certainly ought to be maintained and strengthened."
"In the strictly commercial sector, it is important that a small number of extremely powerful economic interests, such as those connected with steel, wheat, beef and the audio-visual industry, should not predominate, nor cause us to overlook - or even cause us to consider as less important or marginal - the need to achieve by consensus mutually acceptable solutions to problems which are socially and economically relevant for certain regions and countries of the European Union which, by coincidence, belong to less developed areas, and where, furthermore, solidarity is far from being a reality."
"I refer, of course, to the problems associated with the controversy over fishing in the NAFO zone, which is still going on and, we believe, cannot be resolved at the expense of unilateral measures with extraterritorial effect. Such measures have been rightly repudiated by both Canadians and Europeans in another context."
"It is thus important that Canada should not adopt different weights and measures as regards fishing but that, on the contrary, negotiations to safeguard the interests of all the countries represented here should be pursued, including our common interest in preserving fishing resources."
"Mr President, relations between the European Union and Canada have existed for just fifty years and we must congratulate ourselves on seeing them take on a new dimension."
"In fact, as we know, transatlantic solidarity has been an indispensable element in maintaining peace, liberty and stability."
"It is therefore pleasing that this communication, whilst maintaining the scope of the previous framework agreement, emphasizes its political, social and cultural dimension by opening up cooperation in new sectors such as scientific research, technological development and education."
"What is more, after the period of the Cold War, the international situation which placed the United States in a dominant position required a revision of transatlantic relations."
"In this context, relations between the European Union and Canada are the guarantee of readjustment."
"We both find ourselves standing up to unilateralism, and the Helms-Burton and D'Amato laws are an interesting and significant example of this convergence of interests."
"This is why I fully share the point of view of Mr Graziani, author of this excellent report."
"Let us not allow sectoral controversies to cast doubts over bilateral relations which have always existed."
"The reciprocal interest which is represented by the strengthening of political and commercial links is too important."
"There are however two problems: fishing is the first stumbling block and the problem of catch quotas has literally poisoned relations between the European Union and Canada over the last few years."
"Another bone of contention is the question of leghold traps and imports of furs."
"In both cases solutions need to be found so that our relations remain tranquil."
"In fact, Canada is a partner indispensable to the stability and security of Europe."
"And the breadth of the areas of cooperation reflects the challenges with which the western world is confronted."
"It is therefore desirable that Canada and the European Union join efforts in the search for new stability for the international community."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Canada is particularly close to us, in spite of its geography, since it shares a part of its history with two members of the Union, Great Britain and France."
"Our heritage of common values must be maintained and must serve as a basis for active cooperation between government and business and above all between people who, today, have ever more solid links across the Atlantic."
"Canada also offers the example, a very interesting one for all those concerned with the European institutions, of a federal country which, in spite of its age, has not found its equilibrium."
"Its troubled institutional history is marked by an absence of approval from the province of Quebec of the current constitutional law of Canada and by the impossibility of finding, at least up until now, an original formula to unite the sovereignty of francophone Quebec with its association with the rest of the country."
"Consequently, in its first referendum on sovereignty held in 1980, the 'yes' vote was 40 %."
"In the second, held in 1995, the 'yes' vote was 49.5 % and a third referendum has been announced."
"This evolution should also set Europeans thinking."
"For whilst federalism works well in relation to one people, as in Germany, it becomes blocked, or goes through endless convulsions when it relates to several peoples desirous of conserving their identity and the mastery of their destiny."
"In fact, since the coordination required subordinates member nations, it lays itself endlessly open to suspicions that it may not be respected by one of the partners."
"This remark is all the more true, of course, when the basic constitutional charter has not even been approved by one of the member nations."
"This is why I am happy to see that most responsible Europeans do not now have federalism as an explicit target."
"And in the same perspective, I would also like to say to our friends overseas, that we follow with sympathy the efforts of Quebec and Canada to find an institutional formula that will clarify their relationship."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in his report on relations between Canada and Europe, Mr Graziani has tackled many extremely diverse subjects, from leghold traps to reflections on the interest in a trilateral dimension between the Union, the United States and Canada, via the problem of coastal fishing."
"There is therefore a lot that could be said, some criticisms expressed too, in particular with regard to the position taken in favour of the World Trade Organisation, that is, a world without frontiers abandoned to the appetites of the multinationals."
"But two minutes would not be enough, all the more so as the text which has been submitted to us does not tackle the key points."
"What Canada has become represents what Europe could become, a federal group which is a satellite of the United States."
"Ottawa is a model for Brussels, the capital of an artificial entity binding together in a federal straitjacket two nations, the French Canadians and the Anglo-Saxons."
"Both are victims of the system."
"The French Canadians of course, but also the Anglo-Saxons who, as Ottawa cuts the links with London, lose all uniqueness."
"Today, the two peoples are dissolving in the American melting pot."
"The natives of Quebec are putting up a good fight in defence of French, but the collapse of their birthrate, since the onset of what is known as the silent revolution, makes this battle in vain."
"Within a few decades the six million French Canadians risk disappearing, wiped off the map just like the Acadians, the French of Louisiana."
"There is however one way out for these two peoples: getting rid of the federal strait-jacket, just as the peoples of central Europe did, and as our countries - progressively being suffocated by Brussels - want to do."
"This is the reason why we French patriots support the cause of an independent Quebec."
"In 1995, the Ottawa federalists won by a narrow margin, benefitting from the same advantages as the Maastricht Euro-federalists in France in 1992 - ethnic minority vote, financial and media related pressures."
"And, just as in 1763, Paris was uninterested in the fate of the new France."
"Our intellectuals are truly the inheritors of Voltaire, who said he wished Canada was at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean."
"Next time they will win."
"The natives of Quebec should know they are not alone."
"Once we French have freed ourselves from Brussels' authority, we will be able to tie once again the links broken with our Quebec brothers two centuries ago."
"Mr President, Mr Graziani's report is excellent, and I am grateful to him for conveying such a positive spirit in it, as I believe that we depend on having good transatlantic relations not only with Canada, but also with the United States."
"It provides an important foundation for western values, for which I am very grateful to him."
"By the way, I am also delighted that he is in good health and back with us again."
"The joint action plan of 17 December 1996 consolidates the 1976 framework agreement and thus opens up a new form of cooperation between the European Union and Canada."
"I am pleased that this agreement is before us, and I am glad that we have also found new types of cooperation as a basis for this."
"I will return to that point in a moment."
"The main focus of the agreement is the area of bilateral trade and investment relations, but also closer cooperation in multilateral trade matters, and closer and more stable political cooperation."
"This is a wide-ranging package, and the Commission has put in very solid work."
"So what is this new type and new style of cooperation?"
"I would like to mention just a few areas."
"The first point is that there is a direct form of cooperation, which involves the Commission working with its Canadian administrative counterparts."
"There is a much more direct form of political cooperation, that is, in future there will simply be direct means of cooperation for each case and for each topic to be dealt with."
"The second point is that it will be possible to resolve trade disputes directly, avoiding the complicated conventions which used to apply."
"We should not underestimate the value of this."
"We know that trade disputes make life difficult for us, and so this is important."
"We have totally new types of agreement before us, and I am glad the Commission has done this."
"Nevertheless, you are quite right, Mr President, in saying that the Parliament needs to be involved in this more closely."
"I would ask the Commission to keep us informed of what they are doing at all times."
"Mr President, may I also begin by warmly congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Graziani, on this comprehensive report and perhaps firstly just add to the introductory remarks that he made on the disaster that has befallen his country."
"I should just like to tell him that the matter was discussed this morning in the Commission and I should like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Commission, once again to express our feelings of sympathy for the victims of the earthquake in Italy."
"It was also said very spontaneously this morning that it is really a pity that owing to a lack of funds and exhausted budget headings we are not able to translate a firm sign of sympathy into one of some support, even if it were just a symbolic amount, because we do not have any resources for natural disasters."
"We have nevertheless looked into this possibility and I know that Commissioner Oreja is investigating to what extent a contribution could perhaps be provided for the restoration of damaged art treasures - we all know that the great cathedral in Assisi has also been damaged."
"I cannot provide a solution at the moment, but it did seem appropriate to me at least to mention this matter here."
"As far as the report is concerned, I am pleased to report to Parliament on the recent positive developments in relations between the European Union and Canada."
"Further to the communication from the Commission to the Council on 28 February last year, on 17 December last a joint political declaration and a joint action plan were adopted."
"The action plan has already had a positive effect on bilateral relations which are now more balanced than a year ago."
"This was confirmed on 20 June last by both parties during the summit between the EU and Canada in Denver."
"At a meeting a few weeks later within the context of the political dialogue, Foreign Minister Axworthy said that the progress made so far with the action plan had exceeded Canadian expectations."
"In my view, we can be reassured that our own expectations have also been exceeded."
"There are nevertheless still some problems in the bilateral sphere, particularly with regard to the various opinions - this has also been on the agenda this afternoon - on the extraterritorial application of legislation in the field of fisheries and I could also mention certain trade and investment matters."
"In general, Canada is, however, an important transatlantic partner for us with whom we share common values and aims. I am completely behind Mr Graziani's comments on the importance of our relations with Canada."
"With regard to the action plan, I would also draw your attention to four agreements with Canada that have almost been completed."
"Firstly, there is the mutual recognition of standards and certification."
"The negotiations have been completed and the agreement was initialled on 30 May."
"Further information on the institutions for conformity assessment must be exchanged."
"Secondly, an agreement on cooperation and mutual assistance in customs matters."
"The agreement is ready to be signed."
"Thirdly, the veterinary and phytosanitary standards."
"The negotiations have been completed."
"But certain matters relating to the BSE situation still remain to be sorted out."
"Fourthly, in the field of competition, the negotiations have also been completed and the agreement will be sent to the Council in the next few weeks."
"We feel we can say that these four agreements together will certainly encourage trade with Canada."
"A start has also been made on the preparatory work for a joint trade study on the promotion of trade in goods and services and the reduction or removal of tariff and non-tariff obstructions."
"On 30 September, lists of the trade restrictions were exchanged within the context of this study."
"Also worthy of mention is the fact that Canada is an important ally in our resistance to the Helms-Burton and d'Amato Acts."
"This is a matter we have discussed with our Canadian friends."
"In the field of foreign and security policy, the Union and Canada have for years worked closely together in multilateral forums such as the UN and the OSCE."
"As a direct result of the action plan, during the Luxembourg presidency, the EU at expert level will conduct discussions on the following areas: reform of the UN, disarmament, non-proliferation, human rights, Eastern Europe and Central Asia."
"As Mr Graziani rightly remarks in his report, Canada is an important player in the Pacific Ocean region."
"As such, it currently holds the chair of the APEC and next November is organizing the APEC summit in Vancouver."
"As far as the last chapter of the action programme is concerned, the title of which is ""fostering links' , I am of the opinion that the agreements with Canada in the field of higher education and vocational training and also in the field of science and technology have already led to some very good results."
"With regard to the links, that is to say from one people to another, I would like to say how pleased I am about the Canadian decision in April that for Portuguese nationals there is no longer a visa requirement."
"This was a matter the Commission had discussed within the action plan with Canada."
"Not least I should point out that the European Parliament delegation for relations with Canada will visit the capital later this year and in my view that visit comes at an extremely convenient time in EU-Canadian relations and I hope and expect that it will be a success."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 am."
"Economic and monetary union"
"The next item is the report (A4-0255/97) by Mr Willockx, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union and the funding of the social security systems in the Member States of the European Union."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by making it clear that my report on social security is really part of a single whole."
"A single whole with three components: work, social security and income."
"These three components are inextricably linked to each other."
"In this sense the targets the Commission wishes to propose to the Member States also contain important elements of social security and income guarantees."
"It is important that during the Luxembourg Summit on employment the coherence of these three components is not lost from view."
"I would just say as an aside that, on the one hand, it is a mistake to say, regarding compliance with the convergence criteria in the budgetary field that non-compliance could solve the employment problem."
"On the other hand, it is also a mistake to use compliance with the convergence criteria as an excuse to cut back social security and in that way also indirectly mortgage the employment policy."
"I think we should guard against artificial comparisons with the United States of America."
"We have our own Rhineland model."
"We must also remain true to our own Rhineland model here in Europe."
"For me these criteria do not constitute a risk to the financing of social security."
"On the contrary, in a country such as Belgium, compliance with and pursuance of the convergence criteria has certainly become the best way to guarantee the financing of social protection in the long term."
"So I refuse, and I would stress this, to recognize a contradiction between the two objectives."
"In this debate we have repeatedly discussed pensions."
"Here again, we must guard against using slogans."
"Capitalization is not a panacea to secure the future of pensions."
"Support of the distribution systems by additional capitalization on the other hand, certainly as far as I am concerned, is not a mortal sin."
"But one thing is clear, caution is required, and here I would echo the position the European Commission expressed in its latest communication on the modernization of social security, in the transition from one system to the other."
"The key question that we face in the future is: how can we keep social security affordable without weakening the social safety net."
"I shall give you three factors."
"The first is a repetition: healthy government finances."
"The best guarantee for the future of social security because it will in future allow more funds to be made available for social security."
"Secondly: employment."
"A system of social security cannot function without a high degree of employment."
"Thirdly, the necessary modernization of the systems to face the new challenges."
"What can Europe do?"
"Our task here is not so great."
"We can only try to create the framework to bring this task that I have just described to a satisfactory conclusion."
"There are three important instruments."
"First of all, fiscal coordination between the Member States in the field of mobile bases of taxation."
"I am pleased with what President Santer said this afternoon on this point."
"Secondly, the search for coordinated fiscal responses to the need for alternative financing of the social security system, for example, energy tax to finance the reduction in the paternal contribution."
"Thirdly, the establishment of social convergence criteria in order to direct social protection and wage policy and to prevent social dumping in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am firmly convinced that the more democratic Europe becomes, the greater the strength will be of an adapted, modernized social security system."
"Some theorists also say that the population who elect us do not wish for and will never accept the dismantling of such a social security system."
"The more democracy there is in Europe, the more efficient our social security system will be."
"That is my firm conviction."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to say as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment that I am pleased that both the rapporteur and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy have largely taken up the conclusions of our advisory committee."
"There is no doubt that economic and monetary union has an important influence on social security in the Member States."
"However, this does not provide well-founded reasons to reject EMU."
"On the contrary, the objectives, criteria and timetable should be retained in full."
"Not because they form part of some economic dogma, but because they contribute to the success of EMU and thus to monetary stability, economic growth, more competitiveness and consequently to promoting employment."
"The temporary drawbacks do spur us on to prepare social security for EMU."
"This should nevertheless happen without running the risk of jeopardizing social security."
"On the one hand, there is the insurance aspect, that is to say, being collectively covered against the main social risks and on the other hand the assistance aspect that expresses solidarity."
"Social security is, after all, one of the cornerstones of the European social model."
"We all agree that the financing of social security nevertheless forms the major problem facing every Member State."
"The budgetary stranglehold inevitably leads to the question of whether all parts of social security can be maintained and whether judicious intervention should not be chosen rather than finally giving up rights and entitlements out of necessity."
"It is too often forgotten that social security is not of course only influenced by EMU, but also by demographic developments and technological factors. Just think of ageing and the fact that there are not enough younger people in work to provide funds for social security."
"Think of the changes in the composition of families, the entry of women on to the labour market and the constantly high unemployment."
"Think, on the other hand, too of the progress in medical science and medicines, the developments in information technology, robotics, telematics and multimedia."
"Such demographic and technological upheavals lead in the main to a shrinking of earnings and expansion of social security expenditure."
"The resulting imbalance cannot be sustained."
"The Committee on Social Affairs and Employment sets out four spheres where we could intervene."
"Firstly, the completion of the internal market in order to counteract distortions in competition and social dumping."
"Secondly, the support of economic growth, among other things, through additional investments and the improvement of competitiveness."
"Thirdly, the promotion of employment, for example, by using unemployment benefit as a wage allowance."
"Fourthly the reform of tax law in order to reduce both the charges on work and to help to bring the national budget more into balance."
"In the draft Treaty of Amsterdam it states that the European Union is aiming for a high level of employment and a high level of social protection."
"This is explicitly mentioned."
"Although at the moment there is no European social contract, the employment chapter is in the Treaty of Amsterdam and in the employment summit to be held in November."
"Hopefully they are both a start on intervention that in itself will not be sufficient to secure the financing of social security, but in combination with the various national policy measures could ensure that the way is opened to an economic, monetary and at the same time social union and that is ultimately what we have to do."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Willockx for his report and Mr Chanterie for his opinion."
"This is a very timely debate because we heard President Santer earlier this afternoon discussing the issue of the jobs summit meeting to be held in Luxembourg and there is an intimate link between our social security systems, the levels of unemployment and the whole future of growth and employment within the European Union."
"While this report asks the question, what will happen to social security systems as a result of economic and monetary union, we on all sides of this House have to face up to one simple truth: our social security system, regardless of economic and monetary union, needs serious reforming."
"Mr Willockx's report points that out very clearly indeed."
"The Socialist Group wants to see a review of social security but as Mr Willockx's report points out, we want to do it on the basis of ensuring that we keep a social safety net."
"We must reform the system but maintain the safety net we have within the European Union."
"The system set up at the end of the second World War is no longer appropriate for the types of employment and unemployment we have today."
"Therefore, we would like three things to be addressed in the review that will take place."
"I would like the Commission, perhaps, in their further studies and the Council to consider these in the future."
"The first is to establish a new system of social security systems which offer flexible help, tailored to the needs of the individual citizen and focused on assisting people through periods of unemployment rather than excluding them permanently from work."
"It is a fact that in some of our countries the social security systems permanently exclude our people from work."
"That is why 50 % of the people out of work in Europe today are long-term unemployed."
"We need to recognize that the social security bill for the taxpayer is increasing."
"That is why we need job creation in the European Union."
"If we create jobs then we can reduce the debt and the borrowing to pay for social security."
"That is why, Commissioner, this summit meeting in Luxembourg is crucial not only for the social cohesion of the European Union but also to bring down the budget deficit and ensure that the pact for stability and growth can actually operate."
"Particularly for our young people we have to break down the barriers which make the move from benefit to work almost impossible for hundreds of thousands of young people."
"In the European Union today it is virtually impossible for some of our young people to make that move from benefit to work."
"I say to you as a social democrat, let us for heaven's sake have an honest debate on this issue and let us design a social security system that will be sensitive to the individual and will help to maximise the opportunities for employment in the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I so obviously applauded Mr Willockx and Mr Donnelly, it is because what they said was exactly what I wanted to hear."
"But it was not exactly what was written in their text."
"This is why we have some small differences of opinion, although on the whole I am happy with the combination of ideas and consensus between us."
"In fact, as Mr Donnelly has clearly said, we need to keep our social security systems, and we are very happy to do so, if they are adapted."
"This is not exactly the same as saying we must maintain social security systems and strengthen them, if necessary."
"If you had said we must reform them in order to adapt them, I would immediately have been in agreement."
"Similarly when you say that neither the observation of convergence criteria nor the date of implementation of the third phase can undermine the indispensable efforts made by the Union to create jobs, I am sorry but that sentence is ambiguous."
"If it could be read as you said it in your speech I would vote for it, but that is not what you wrote."
"Similarly, in paragraph 14 you speak again about social security and you introduce a notion of rigidity which was not in what either you or Mr Donnelly have said."
"With you, there are nuances."
"But I find that Mr Donnelly has become extraordinarily realistic and I can only applaud him."
"It is probably the experience of power that makes things more comprehensible and makes people more responsible."
"Having said that, Mr President, the report is otherwise excellent."
"We all have an interest in maintaining a system of social security and solidarity, for this is essential for the smooth running of the economic system."
"We do not believe in the law of the jungle."
"We do not think that the market can rule everything."
"We believe that the State has a role to play and that the social partners have an important role to play."
"They must therefore be in agreement, and the government too, but that implies an awareness of reality on their part."
"In fact, as Mr Donnelly has clearly said, and I repeat, the current system as it works in most of our States, is no longer fundable, it is no longer sustainable in the face of globalization."
"There must be efforts to adapt it therefore, and I am happy that, in these discussions, unhappily less so in the texts, we may arrive at an agreement on this point."
"Mr President, our group has not difficulty voting for this report and we would like to thank and congratulate Mr Willockx again."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party has mixed feelings about the report by Mr Willockx."
"We applaud the fact that the rapporteur has had the courage over a period of several months to seek something of a consensus. But nevertheless it is a fact that nobody can really recognize their views in the report."
"It is difficult to ignore the fact that the resolution is disjointed and ambiguous. Disjointed, for example, because it is difficult to maintain that Maastricht affects the criteria for budgetary leeway on social measures and at the same time that it does not really do so because a small shortfall leads to lower interest costs, more investment, growth, jobs and therefore a broader tax basis."
"I must admit, Mr Willockx, that you have expressed a clearer position today, which I cannot find so easily in the report."
"On behalf of the Liberal Group, I should like to make a few things clear."
"I should first like to stress that it is the countries that persevere and systematically make their government finances healthy that score highest in terms of jobs and therefore lay the bases for affordable social security."
"Secondly, as far as pensions are concerned, we are of the opinion that the system of capitalization can exist next to the system of distribution."
"It is not a matter of replacing one system by the other, both can function side by side."
"My group does support paragraph 6 of the resolution in which the Commission is called upon to undertake a study into the effect of the ageing of the population on the pension system."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, we shall soon obtain the report on the modernization and improvement of social security in the European Union to debate in the House."
"The same material will come up again in Parliament."
"It would enhance the credibility of this House if we devoted one report to the subject instead of a whole series."
"It would not only reduce the paper mountain but ensure greater consistency in our positions."
"Mr President, it is an indisputable fact that the entire social security system in Europe is in danger of total collapse."
"Social security systems are on the edge of bankruptcy."
"The question to which there should be a very clear answer, at least from the European Parliament, which is the only elected body of the Community and is considered, for that reason, to be closer to the people of the European Union, is: who is responsible for this unacceptable situation?"
"The answer is clear to all: mass unemployment and the policies that cause it."
"But then another question automatically arises: who is responsible for unemployment?"
"In this respect the answers that are given not only defy the intelligence of the citizens of Europe, but, by attempting to turn reality upside down, call for the continuation and intensification of just those policies that are responsible for the dramatic increase in unemployment and poverty."
"Unfortunately the present report does exactly the same, as it insists on leaving it up to economic and monetary union to address unemployment."
"Whereas it should be discussing the consequences of EMU on the social security system, it calls for enforcing to the letter the criteria and the starting date of the third phase for the creation - it says - of a more effective framework for higher levels of employment."
"Delusion or conscious distortion?"
"Let those involved choose which of the two they prefer. The result is the same."
"Totally ignorant of the consequences that the EMU criteria and the programmes of convergence are having on the ability of the social security system to fulfill its obligations to its citizens and to the unemployed, they are proposing transfer of the sources of social security financing and transfer of resources are available for unemployment benefits and professional training, to employment initiatives, that is to say, to the advantage of commercial profit."
"Mr President, at a time when statistics show that the contribution of employers to social security is on the decrease, making it easier for businesses to plunder the financial resources of social policy and to profit at the expense of working people and their social rights, is nothing short of provocation."
"If the new integrated employment strategy, as the leaders of the European Union call it, and the appeal to the social services for adaptability, flexibility and the shouldering of their responsibilities means stripping working people and European Union citizens of the rights they have fought so hard for, if the success of the policy that is being mapped out means the complete dismantling of the European social model, then you can be sure that their response will be further conflict which, sooner or later, will sweep away not only this unpopular policy but also the implementors of this policy."
"Mr President, EMU compels us to debate the subject of social security structures, because there has been great pressure on us to reduce state expenditure."
"And it is with equal zeal that we should consider where states will get their funding from in the future to deal, for example, with the organization of social security."
"In this respect, I do not believe that EU policy is uniform."
"We have been properly concerned when there have been so many shortages, but the European Union has not, by any stretch of the imagination, been able to do everything to guarantee social security funding, or, in other words, state income."
"In this regard, I believe the most essential single reform would be to end the process of tax erosion, that is to say, guarantee that producers cease to wander from one country to another in search of lower taxation systems."
"There is really a lot that needs doing in the harmonization of indirect taxation especially."
"Obviously, as EMU draws near, we are starting to speak more and more of the European model."
"We do not want to tread on people sleeping in the street."
"We even want to pay taxes, to some extent, so that people can have a minimum of state support."
"The dialogue already begun on the different social security models prevailing in the various countries must be pressed on with."
"Each European country has something to offer the European model."
"I certainly believe there is no cause for concern, in this respect, with the Nordic countries, and, indeed, that social security thinking in Europe generally runs along the same track as the Scandinavian philosophy."
"Just one example is the German health insurance system, which is clearly a step in this direction."
"Mr President, Mr Willockx' report is of an extremely high quality and I in turn would like to congratulate the author and underline that it concerns probably one of the most difficult subjects that we will have to face up to in the coming years."
"Mr Herman's speech a few moments ago gave us a glimpse of this."
"If the implementation of economic and monetary union and the Euro is accompanied by an overly rapid deregulation this could in fact provoke an overall increase in unemployment and a worsening of the standards of living for a growing, and already too large, number of people in Europe."
"This is all the more true because extremely divergent policies are pursued by the Member States in the area of social security and this causes considerable and additional distortions of competition."
"It is, therefore, now necessary to tackle the establishment of true convergence in our social security systems."
"On this point I want to underline the interest that the Commission will find in the wider and more vigorous exploitation of the conclusions in the White Paper on growth and employment."
"Concerning the fight for jobs, we must emphasize the budgets which are destined, on a regional level, to facilitate insertion and return to work, notably by supporting the fabric of the community which is now trying to respond to this, but with insufficient resources."
"It is also necessary to make a start on the convergence of health insurance policies of Member States, taking good care not to reduce the area currently covered by national health services, so that the health of Europeans is not abandoned solely to the private insurance business."
"This implies many new decisions, of which one of the most urgent is certainly the establishment of a directive on the mutual insurance system."
"Finally, I would like to give the backing of the Group of the European Radical Alliance to the decisions to be taken to move towards a progressive transfer of the resources necessary for the social security system so that they come from the taxation of capital and non-renewable energy sources, in order to lighten the costs which now weigh too heavily on those in work, to the detriment of employment."
"Mr President, the report by Mr Willockx is a problematic one."
"Perhaps this is the only conclusion we can agree on today."
"Naturally we admire the courage of the rapporteur, who is as it were sticking his hand into a hornets' nest."
"But the preceding question asks whether all this is necessary."
"Anyone who reads the opinion of the Committee on Social Affairs, knows the answer: no."
"Because the report in no way deals with the consequences of EMU for the financing of social security systems in the European Union."
"This report is also a contradictory report."
"Take the first part of the preamble, which states that the current social model must continue to exist."
"If you are looking for the solution to a problem you must not switch off the light, but let your light shine on all creative possibilities."
"The challenge of increasing international competition requires an appropriate response."
"According to the World Economic Outlook published this month by the IMF, drastic reforms are necessary in the European Union in the fields of social security and labour market policy in order to be able to push down unemployment."
"EMU demands greater mobility of labour."
"Anyone who considers that to be socially unacceptable must be consistent and remove the EMU from their list of priorities."
"But the rapporteur does not do that."
"Finally, this report is out of date."
"It is turning its back on the future."
"Using subsidies to create jobs and to neutralize inter-regional differences are actions that are dead and gone."
"They kill off any innovative initiative."
"Nobody is actively encouraged to support himself."
"Of course governments must put into action measures to discourage fiscal, social and environmental dumping."
"And they should also encourage education and training."
"But this can go hand in hand with the dismantling of the social welfare state."
"Is it really so honest to saddle our children with enormous repayment obligations because we refuse to assume this responsibility?"
"Mr President, this report demonstrates very clearly the extent of the measures that still need to be taken precisely in the field of social and employment policy in the context of preparing for monetary union."
"Every one of the suggestions and demands made by the rapporteur is valid, and I personally would support them."
"However, I believe that all these points contradict paragraph 1."
"The very fact that there are still no coordinated tax systems and that it has not yet been possible to reform national budgets in a socially acceptable way; the fact that in trying to meet the convergence criteria Member States are damaging the basis of social security systems - these are an indication that the deadline for introducing the Euro needs to be reconsidered."
"In this context a petition for referendum is to take place in Austria at the beginning of December on the holding of a plebiscite on this subject."
"This step, which is important in democratic terms, is intended to give citizens an opportunity to become involved in a critical way in an issue that affects them personally."
"We believe that it is wrong to use controlled advertising and propaganda campaigns to persuade our citizens that all the social and employment policy problems that need to be solved in connection with the introduction of monetary union simply do not exist."
"European monetary union should be treated as a final and important aspect of the internal market at a point in time when at least the most serious problems, including social policy problems, have already been solved and the most important conditions have been achieved."
"Mr President, the report which we are debating today has had a long passage and extensive debate in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"It is now over twenty-two months since we had our first exchange of views on the subject."
"Given the importance and sensitivity of the subject, our rapporteur has guided the committee skilfully throughout this period until we were able to reach a conclusion which we were able to adopt with no votes against."
"This is of great credit to the rapporteur and he deserves our congratulations."
"Nevertheless, fundamental questions still remain, I am afraid."
"We have not all been able to agree on the effects of the convergence criteria and the stability pact, in particular, on the European economy."
"I am among those who believe that they have and will continue to have deflationary effects."
"Moreover the single currency exposes Member States to the danger of asymmetric shocks on the demand side which it will no longer be able to possible to offset by a readjustment of the exchange rate."
"Of course, I am not arguing for abandoning the single currency with the great benefits and the historic change that it is bringing to European affairs, but we need antidotes."
"The important antidote in this particular case is a pan-European coordinated employment and social policy."
"By some new taxes, if necessary, like the windfall tax which was so successfully applied in Britain recently and which financed an important campaign against unemployment."
"There is a fundamental last question."
"After all the skilful surgery that Mr Donnelly has so justifiably spoken about has been applied, will the standard of living of the European worker remain the same or will it go down, and will it even plunge towards the level of the third world worker to which reference has been made in the reference to globalization?"
"Mr President, this report makes an honest attempt to tackle the issues, but in very traditional areas, and it raises a few questions of principle that I would like to deal with."
"Firstly, the report says that there should be no adverse social consequences."
"Of course, no-one wants that!"
"But we have to be honest and admit that a reorganization of our social structures and of our social security systems is unavoidable, and there is a danger that this will involve some cuts."
"My second point is that in the context of pension provision, the report says that there is little chance of a change from the adjustable contribution system to the formation of capital coverage system."
"If it happened at all, it would take a very long time, I know that much."
"However, it has to be said quite unambiguously that private provision will play a very central role in pension provision in the future."
"My third point is about the employment summit in Luxembourg."
"The President of the Council, Mr Juncker, always stresses that this will not be a deregulation summit."
"Fine, it would really be too little to have just that."
"But I do hope at least that one subject dealt with by this employment summit will be the need to change our economic and labour law structures and make them more flexible."
"In two areas the report includes hints about the future, one case being where it touches upon environmental tax reform, implying a shift of taxation away from employment and towards energy, consumption, etcetera."
"However, it only suggests investigating this."
"That is absolutely not enough as far as I am concerned!"
"We know that this is one of the forward-looking instruments."
"We need to summon up the political will actually to get on with it."
"The report quotes the Commission's 1995 report on the future of social welfare, which questions the direct link between the payments made by social security contributors and the covering of risk."
"I think that is important."
"I believe that we should seriously contemplate a basic level of provision, as there is ever less work, and the gap between those who have work and those who do not is getting greater."
"However, social solidarity should also extend to people who have not made sufficient contributions to the social security system through paid work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is yet another debate which clearly illustrates that we are trying to square the circle or round off the square."
"In the short time I have at my disposal to deal with such a demanding topic, I congratulate the rapporteur on his effort, which puts forward a number of extremely relevant points, but which reaches opposite conclusions to those which would seem to follow logically from those premises."
"But we must not forget that this is a report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, which is more concerned with EMU and the effects social security financing will have on it than with social security and the effects EMU will have on the social situation and security of citizens."
"At this point I would like to make what seems to me to be an urgent observation of central relevance on a view which is gaining general acceptance, namely that social security protects citizens against risks of a social nature. The expression of this view is found both in Community documents and in those of member States, such as the Portuguese Green Paper on the subject."
"I consider that this view has the capacity to be extremely damaging if it were to replace another according to which social security enshrines the rights of anyone born or living, who works or has worked, as social rights corresponding to society's obligations to individuals."
"This is not a question of individual insurance and actuarial calculations, but of human rights appropriate to the times in which we live."
"Furthermore, there is nothing innocent about the way in which, when considering the serious problem of social security financing, the responsibility of those who do not comply with their social obligation to contribute to that financing is being removed from them - an obligation which still exists, so long as the systems are not altered, and is not being complied with - and no attempt is made to emphasize it, nor is any responsibility being placed on those who are failing in their duty."
"Mr President, please forgive me if, having asked to speak since the beginning of this sitting and having been regularly passed over, I follow the example of my colleague, Mr Graziani, and begin my speech on the Willockx report with a slight digression."
"In fact, I should like to stress the gravity of the situation which has been created in Italy, particularly in Umbria and the Marche, following the recent catastrophic earthquake, and I should like to impress on the President, the Committee on Budgets and all my colleagues the urgent need to reallocate funds for natural disasters, also in advance of the next vote on the European Union's budget for 1998."
"Because of the current state of affairs the Italian government has not yet submitted an official request for aid, but Europe cannot stand idly by when confronted with such extremely serious events which have resulted in deaths, damage costing hundreds of billions of lire and thousands of people losing their homes and jobs, and damaged a substantial number of works of art which are not the heritage of Italy or Europe but the world."
"Returning to Mr Willockx's report, the convergence criteria are the torment and delight of the Member States."
"On the one hand, it is true that convergence limits room for manoeuvre in the budgets of individual Member States and necessitates a restructuring of welfare institutions but, on the other hand, complying with the convergence criteria increases the overall efficiency of the European economy and reinforces its position in the world economy, promoting growth and employment."
"Perhaps the problem is slightly different and has to do with the fact that to date no body of Community laws and regulations, even of a minimal nature, has been introduced to govern fiscal and financial policy."
"Tax dumping reduces government revenue and shifts the tax burden from capital to labour, thereby impeding the welfare policies of Member States."
"In this connection, however, the meeting of the Ecofin Council held on 13 September last finally seemed to produce encouraging results."
"The Fifteen seem to be prepared to go down the road of a coordinated tax policy and indeed the first decisions are expected to be taken by the end of the year during the meeting of the European Council which are likely to include the approval of a code of conduct relating to fiscal matters."
"We must fight against competitive defiscalization - President Santer was talking about this earlier this afternoon in relation to employment - and unfair competition without increasing the tax burden."
"The level of taxation has to be adjusted downwards, particularly in relation to direct and indirect taxes on workers in employment, the growing burden of which is having a disastrous effect on employment."
"As the report rightly pointed out, it would be desirable to create a fund from which aid would be granted to help needier Member States to combat unemployment."
"It should be borne in mind that the absence of a European agreement on worker protection will enable industries to relocate to regions where the workforce is less expensive and has less protection, running the risk that national systems will be harmonized at the lowest level of social security because national governments will be able to cut their expenditure on social protection in order to be competitive."
"If we wish to avoid this dangerous scenario we shall have to endeavour to ensure that the Union has sufficient room to manoeuvre in the field of social protection."
"Policies must be harmonized at European level: if we are to be an efficient economic union I believe that this is all the more reason why Europe-wide social standards are an important prerequisite if we really want to maintain the economic and social cohesion of the European Union."
"Thank you very much, Mr Cellai, and thank you for your sympathetic words about those who have been affected by the earthquake."
"I am very pleased that you were able to say those words during your speech."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to Mr Willockx for having clearly shown in his report the extent to which social and economic policy are interdependent rather than being mutually exclusive or opposites, whereas for that very reason it has already virtually become commonplace within the 15 Member States of the European Union to attribute the growing pressure for reform which exists at many levels in politics solely to the EU."
"There is already a discernible tendency for the convergence criteria to be taken as an excuse for not reforming social security systems, but deregulating them."
"It must be obvious to all of us that this is scarcely a suitable basis for maintaining wealth and well-being, and that a more comprehensive examination of the problems is needed."
"Our objective is a genuine European Union, underpinned by social harmony, and not just a superior free trade zone that ignores social policy."
"Of course we should not underestimate demographic change."
"Over the last decade alone, life expectancy has increased by two to three years."
"That alone should be sufficient incentive to treat the question of living standards more fully."
"It is certainly necessary to shift the tax burden from employment not only to capital, energy consumption and environmental impact, but also to value added."
"But it is certain that the greatest distortions in competition that we see are due to differences between taxation systems."
"That is where have to start."
"It is more likely to lead us to our objective than indiscriminate pressure on social systems or on social support mechanisms."
"Thus the key conditions for putting the financing of social security systems on a stable footing again are a European taxation policy in accordance with the Commission's Monti memorandum, combined with a European social pact to solve the problem of unemployment, and continuity in economic growth."
"A debate on the future of social security in the EU is long overdue, and we - the European Parliament - could make a positive contribution to it with all our initiatives."
"The reports contain very strong proposals to this effect."
"Mr President, the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy recognizes that the convergence criteria limit the budgetary margin for manoeuvre of the Member States in the fulfilment of their social mission."
"This pressure on the budgets of Member States could lead to difficulties in the financing of social security."
"Instead of expanding on this point, the report shrugs off all contradictions and contents itself with reaffirming that the measures relating to economic and monetary union must be implemented without exception."
"Of course, the report takes into account the problems but it is fully a part of the current logic which leads inevitably to the single currency."
"One could usefully have drawn on the study undertaken by the European Social Observatory concerning the social stakes involved in economic and monetary union."
"This study said that economic and monetary union intrinsically brings with it social deregulation."
"To be competitive and to be able to respond to external shocks, the Member States will no longer be able to adjust price levels and salaries through taxation and social security systems."
"This study also noted that economic and monetary union will enable pressure to be exerted on the unions so that they accept lower salary levels and allowances, in the name of maintaining competitivity."
"The report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy goes in this direction by coming down in favour of a lowering of labour costs through a reduction in employers' social security contributions."
"Its analysis and proposals are a long way from reality for European citizens."
"The submission to financial markets, which the single currency and its criteria require, brings an acceleration of deregulation in all sectors, challenges public services and causes the dismantling of social security systems."
"The workers and their unions are becoming more and more aware of this reality - you can see it in Italy at the moment - and are taking action."
"The revival of purchasing power, the development of public services, the reduction of the working day without reducing salaries, the taxation of speculative movements of capital to dissuade speculation, these are the many trails that are deliberately ignored by the report."
"Trails which could, however, open up of a path towards the building of a different Europe, the engine of which would be employment and social progress."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the comments made today by the rapporteur, Mr Willockx, make the specific point of reminding us of the finality of economic and monetary union, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, and all those who have spoken in this House this morning."
"The Euro is not an end in itself."
"The Euro must be an instrument of growth and employment."
"It must also be a guarantee of our social security system."
"As your rapporteur noted, article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union gives the Community the objective of promoting a high level of social security and a high level of employment."
"Your Parliament also legitimately raises the question of the financing of social security systems in Member States, within the context of economic and monetary union."
"This is a subject which also concerns the Commission, who last March adopted a communication entitled: ' Modernizing and improving social security in the European Union' , which largely answers the questions put by Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens just now."
"Following your discussions, I would like to make two brief comments."
"The first concerns demographic evolution in Europe and its potential consequences for the financing of social security systems of Member States in the future."
"The second is related to the management of public finances in order to guarantee the smooth running of social security systems."
"Firstly, the difficulties in financing social security systems that may be encountered in the future - I am here replying to Mr de Lassus - will be demographic ones. The ageing of the population will mean growing costs for an ever shrinking active population."
"In fact, the employment rate in Europe, that is, the ratio between the total number of employed and the number of people of working age has dropped from 67 % in 1960 to 59 % currently."
"As a reference point may I remind you that in the United States, as in Japan, it is over 73 %."
"If policies are not changed, the drain on public finances will be ever growing with the following consequences."
"First consequence: the weight of retirement and health costs linked to the ageing population will increase."
"The ratio of retirement costs in relation to GDP will increase 3 or 4 points from 1995 to 2030; that is a great deal."
"Second consequence: the changing age structure of the population will lead to an increase in the demand for services and welfare transfers will probably weigh heavily on public expenditure."
"What will be the effects of this demographic evolution?"
"There will be budgetary effects, but there will also be implications for the labour market."
"In fact, firstly, national savings will decrease significantly due to the worsening of the financial accounts."
"Similarly, according to a recent study by the OECD, the development of private savings will be negatively affected by the aging of the population."
"Secondly, labour market mobility will be less."
"The 20-30 age group will decrease by 9.4 million people, whilst the 50-60 age group will increase by 5.5 million."
"The decrease in professional and geographic mobility which will follow could, what is more, negatively affect growth and productivity."
"These perspectives could be worrying for future generations."
"They must therefore encourage us, in order to preserve social and economic cohesion and ensure the proper funding of social security systems in Europe, to take and safeguard for good the European social model, beyond a simple safety net, Mr Donnelly. In this respect, the establishment of economic and monetary union - on 1 January 1999, Mr Lukas - may bring some elements of a solution."
"As your rapporteur notes, the improvement in public finances, linked to the achievement of economic and monetary union, is not dangerous."
"It is even the best guarantee for the preservation of social security systems in Europe, and I would say it is the same for employment."
"But this budgetary readjustment must also be accompanied by true structural reform, and Mr Chanterie underlined that just now."
"To face up to this demographic challenge and to be in a position to take the necessary political decisions - the arbitration will have to be political - the Member States must first of all once more find sufficient budgetary margin for manoeuvre."
"The budgetary framework introduced by economic and monetary union provides a way."
"We must aim, first of all, to respect the rule regarding virtual balancing of the budgets, which moreover figures in the pact for stability and growth."
"If the actual rate of improvement of public finances continues, and that should be possible with the return to growth, this objective of a virtual balancing should be reached by 2002, that is, several years before the effects of the demographic change are felt."
"In fact, the demographic deficit will be the strongest in the European Union in the year 2010."
"Until that date the impact of population ageing will be less."
"Member States therefore have a sufficient time lapse in which to prepare for the necessary changes."
"This preparation must, however, begin immediately and these efforts must include true structural reform."
"From your speeches, ladies and gentlemen, I have understood that everyone is agreed on this point, even if the recommended solutions differ according to the speaker."
"The structural reforms to be undertaken - many of you noted this - concern both fiscal systems and social security systems or, properly speaking, pension schemes."
"The reform of the welfare state is at the heart of the necessary adjustments."
"It is essential in order to ensure the lasting character of budgetary consolidation, for the objectives of solidarity and social security must be made compatible with those of mastering public expenditure."
"As your rapporteur rightly noted, suitable fiscal reforms will be essential, which does not mean, Mr Katiforis, that taxes will necessarily have to be increased, but without such reforms, social harmonization would be much more difficult."
"That is why the Commission has revived the idea of fiscal harmony, and work is progressing within the framework of the Monti group."
"Moreover this has been highlighted by many of you and notably by the rapporteur for the Committee on Social Affairs."
"This is why the Commission insists that social harmonization be achieved through social dialogue."
"I am not going to talk about the employment aspect as, earlier, President Santer and Padraig Flynn had the opportunity of presenting to you the guidelines to be adopted by the Commission in view of the jobs summit, but it seems to me that they signal an extremely innovative element in the context of this desire to recreate jobs in Europe, which of course will be a step towards improving our social accounts."
"Finally, reform of pension schemes is also a priority."
"A pension scheme based on accumulation is being developed in most of the countries."
"This is a positive evolution, in so far as a balanced system must be based both on assessment and accumulation."
"Therefore, such an evolution can only be a progressive one as, again rightly, your rapporteur reminded us."
"And the creation of a pension fund must not brutally challenge existing systems of assessment."
"It must complement these systems."
"I believe, moreover, that Mr Frischenschlager noted this just now."
"In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to underline that the Commission congratulates the European Parliament on its contribution to this particularly sensitive and delicate subject."
"Your report very usefully contributes to the public awareness which is currently coming to light in Europe."
"Many states are applying themselves with courage and determination to the establishment of the necessary fiscal and social reforms."
"The culture of stability which accompanies the introduction of the Euro strengthens the conditions of success for this necessary adjustment, and it is thus that economic and monetary union appears the best safeguard of the European social model for the future."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Silguy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Convention on the Law of the Sea"
"The next item is the recommendation (A4-0283/97) for second reading by Mr Cot, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion by the European Community of the United Nations Convention of 10 December 1982 on the Law of the Sea and the Agreement of 28 July 1994 on the application of part XI thereof (COM(97)0037 - COM(97)0037/2-9032/97 - C4-0477/97-97/0038(AVC))."
"Mr President, I must report back, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion by the European Community of the United Nations Convention of 10 December 1982 on the Law of the Sea and the agreement of 28 July 1994 on part XI thereof."
"This Convention, the so-called Montego Bay or Jamaica Convention on the Law of the Sea, is a basic text, which was signed by the European Community on 7 December 1984, as is the supplementary agreement which was signed by the Commission on 16 November 1994."
"A first question clearly comes to mind: why are these texts coming to us now, almost fifteen years after the Montego Bay Conference?"
"The answer: it is because as an international organization we cannot deposit our instrument of ratification regarding a convention until a majority of Member States, that is Member States of the Community, have first gone through this procedure."
"Being a party to the Convention on the Law of the Sea seems to us essential, firstly because of the Community's own jurisdiction in the area of the Law of the Sea, jurisdiction in the area of commercial policy, fisheries, and the environment."
"The delay with which we are proceeding to this ratification, I hasten to note immediately for my colleagues, will cause no harm to the European Community, since our Community is already a member, albeit provisionally, of the International Seabed Authority, the instrument which implements the measures in this chapter of the convention."
"We will lose this privilege if we do not authorize our adherence before the 16 November 1998, that is, in one year's time."
"The main problem that arises in my eyes is that of the settlement of disputes."
"Article 287 of the convention offers the choice between four procedures: the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, which is in Hamburg, the International Court of Justice at the Hague, an arbitral tribunal constituted in accordance with Annex 7 of the convention, and a special arbitral tribunal constituted in accordance with Annex 8."
"In this matter, our Community chose not to choose."
"The decision under consideration by us specifies only that the Council undertakes to re-examine, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission and within a reasonable period, once the dispute-settlement procedures provided for have been in operation long enough, whether it is in the Community's interest to opt for a dispute-settlement procedure other than arbitration."
"This tortuous formula raises three problems."
"Firstly, a basic problem."
"The decision seems to me unfortunate."
"I would have preferred, personally, that the Community support the setting up of a new tribunal in Hamburg, or at least show its confidence in the International Court of Justice."
"The second problem, I would say, is one of ""ping pong' ."
"At the time of the ratification of the agreement on the United Nations convention relating to the conservation and management of fishery resources found both within and outside exclusive economic zones - look at the species that are thus targeted - the Commission stated that it would use, for the settlement of disputes, the model to be chosen at such time as the Community ratified the Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"Thus, in this instance, the cost of playing ""ping pong' is such that we score neither of the two points that were foreseen, which means that the two conventions are hanging in mid-air with regard to dispute-settlements."
"Finally, the last problem is one of procedure."
"By giving our compliance to the whole of the convention, we will no longer be able to participate at a later date in the decision on this particular and important point."
"I am also asking Mr Van den Broek, on behalf of the Commission, to agree to consult Parliament on the content and modalities of the solution to be adopted regarding this point of the procedure for settling disputes, when the time comes."
"With the benefit of these observations, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, having considered the opinions of Mrs van Bladel, Mrs Langenhagen and Mr Collins, unanimously proposes that you approve the decision."
"Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Cot, a Vice-President of our Parliament and also a university professor, on his magnificent report. I agree with all the details he has set out in the report."
"Furthermore, as somebody who is familiar with this area, I want to say how important this convention is."
"I have followed its ups and downs from the Conference on the Sea to its conclusion in Montego Bay (Jamaica) in 1982."
"Some very significant things happened at that conference. For example, the contribution of the small countries was extremely important, and for that reason representatives at the conference wanted the convention to be wideranging."
"They demanded at least 60 ratifications before it came into force, and that is why it has taken 12 years."
"The agreement on the application of part 11 of the convention encountered fewer difficulties."
"This extremely important convention satisfactorily defines the Law of the Sea, with respect to its economic aspects."
"It is so important that even before it came into force following the sixtieth ratification, international guidelines which had been created by it were already in use."
"Therefore, it would still have been very important even if it had never come into force, because it had already given rise to international usages (for example concerning the exclusive economic area), and therefore to extremely important competencies which are currently the responsibility of the Community, as Mr Cot has said."
"By means of this report, Parliament must give its opinion on the Council decision which examines whether it is advisable for the Community to be part of the convention and the agreement on its application."
"I agree with Professor Cot when he says that the proposal for a Council decision hinges on two major questions. Firstly, on the allocation of competences, because many of the aspects assigned by the convention and the agreement are the responsibility of the Community, because of the Treaties, and therefore powers must be granted to the countries which make up the European Union, and by establishing a ratification instrument the Community's participation will finally be strengthened and the problem resolved."
"Secondly, another important problem is the settlement of the disputes which the convention will bring."
"Unfortunately we cannot avoid this."
"That is why Mr Cot is turning to the Commissioner, quite rightly in my opinion, to ask him whether it is possible to resolve that lack of clarity in this respect."
"Article 287 establishes several methods, but neither the Council nor the Commission has been willing to be specific on this point."
"The only choice remaining to this House is to trust in the other institutions' good intentions and to ask the Commission (which will propose the method) and the Council (which will decide on the proposal) that when they come to examine it, they should consult Parliament again and bear our views in mind."
"Like Mr Cot, I beg the Commissioner to make sure that this is done."
"Mr President, the formal adhesion of the European Community to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea concludes a long and difficult process in which Europeans have not always been able to identify their real interests. That process began in 1982 when the Convention was signed and went on to its coming into force in 1994, with the initial ratification by 60 member States."
"For Portugal, a country which has historic links with the sea, and which in recent years has been in the vanguard, together with a few other small States, of the fight to establish specific international rules protecting the irreplaceable heritage of the oceans, this act of adhesion by the European Community is of great symbolic importance."
"It is indeed through a Portuguese initiative that 1998 has been declared World Year of the Ocean, and this has been due to intense efforts on the part of Cavaco Silva's government, which, at the same time, has won the 1998 International Exhibition for Lisbon with the title 'The Ocean: a heritage for the future' ."
"The Independent World Commission for the Ocean, created by UNESCO in 1995 under the presidency of Portuguese former president Mário Soares, will present its final report in Lisbon in 1998."
"I am certain that the Committee's reflections on the enormous potential of the oceans will point to solutions which will contribute to the genuine implementation of this Convention on the Law of the Sea, also taking into account the Rio conclusions, in chapter 17, on seas and coastal areas."
"For that reason, however, we must now go beyond the apparent conflicts which are dragging on interminably between the defenders of traditional concepts based on acquired practices and those who uphold inter-sectorial and integrated interests."
"The interests of both parties must be - and are - compatible."
"There is no doubt that the oceans are a three-dimensional area which requires the integrated management of resources."
"Europe can only gain by taking the lead, following its formal adhesion to the convention, in introducing a new concept making specific proposals to transpose it into Community law, thus opening the doors to the 21st Century."
"This would be achieved by means of the creation of a European Oceans Agency and by a resources management concept which balances not only the rights of maritime states and those states which traditionally fish in the high seas, but also the collective right to those resources."
"But in concluding, Mr President, I must express my regrets concerning the blatant contradiction which is currently in evidence in Portugal."
"After our leading role over the last few years, with the results I have described, it appears that my country is not among the 120 which - to date - have signed the convention."
"Is this forgetfulness, lack of vision or what?"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Van den Broek."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow."
"International law, Community law, national constitutional law"
"The next item is the report (A4-278/97) by Mr Alber, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on relationships between international law, Community law and the constitutional law of the Member States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I was appointed rapporteur for this report on the relationship between international law, Community law, and national constitutional law, I had no idea that this would be my last report after more than twenty years in this House."
"I could have even less idea that the subject, the content of this report would fit so seamlessly with my move to the European Court of Justice."
"If anyone thinks that I have only cast the role of the European Court of Justice in such a positive light in my report because I shall be at the Court of Justice as Advocate-General as from next week, then they are mistaken!"
"Because of the situation on European law, it is impossible to reach any other verdict than to affirm the primacy of Community law and of course to stress the role of the ECJ in this context."
"The primacy of Community law is not in fact laid down either in the Treaty or anywhere else."
"It is based on general acceptance, which is of course very much supported by the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice, which rightly indicates that if its primacy is questioned, then the basis of the whole Community is put in doubt."
"But this mere notion of effectiveness is certainly not an adequate and definitive basis for this primacy."
"There were also concerns in the very early days of the Community."
"I would like to remind you of the German ruling, which in the case of the Solange 1 judgement held that as long as the Community did not necessarily take account of constitutional and human rights, its compatibility with national constitutional law might well have to be reconsidered."
"The Solange 2 judgement then followed, which said exactly the opposite, namely that as long as the Community observed constitutional and human rights, there was no need for a national review."
"Only now, because of the Maastricht judgement by Germany's Federal Constitutional Court, are there doubts about national jurisdiction, and other countries are now following this trend and reserving the right to review primacy should the occasion arise."
"I am very grateful to my colleague Mr Rothley for inducing the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights to hold a hearing on this matter, and the outcome of this hearing is naturally also incorporated into this report."
"It is certainly true to say that because of the extent of European Community law, it is now difficult to make decisions using an approach based solely on international law."
"A new approach based on European law is required."
"I also believe that we should not limit ourselves to considering the question of transfers of powers by national parliaments."
"We must also legally recognize that the Treaty is drawn up in such a way that it is directed towards an ever closer union of the nations of Europe."
"This process of the nations of Europe growing ever closer together is of course also bound to have legal consequences."
"The German court has not yet been able to describe the present Community as a federal state and does not intend to, but rather described it as a union of states, without defining precisely what legal characteristics flow from this."
"However, it is not of course possible to describe something in purely semantic terms, the legal consequences also have to be accepted."
"I personally would go so far as to say that this growing together of nations has reached a point where European law has primacy eo ipso , without any amendment of or insertion into the Treaty being necessary."
"Nevertheless, it is of course a good thing - and we are demanding it - that primacy should be written into the Treaty."
"I welcome the fact that the Council, in the Treaty of Amsterdam protocol, also says, in affirming the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, that this primacy should be practically undisputed today."
"So if the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified, it could be said that through this ratification and, as I have already said, by the inclusion of this protocol, it will have been established by treaty that primacy exists."
"It must, however, be admitted that not all ratification laws have constitutional status."
"To that extent this issue will not be settled in this way alone."
"I agree with the German Federal Constitutional Court when it addresses the issue of the democratic deficit."
"We see it in exactly the same way."
"Only that we would of course reject the conclusions of that Court when it says that national parliaments should absorb this deficit, and not the European Parliament, suggesting that the EP cannot not have any true rights because there is as yet no European nation or people."
"I find that sentence very amusing!"
"It would be an amusing subject for an ethnological congress."
"We do not want a European people, it is the very concept of retaining the nations of Europe that is the attractive thing about this structure!"
"Let us be honest, where is there a Belgian people?"
"There was never a Soviet people when the Soviet Union existed, and when Yugoslavia existed there was also no Yugoslavian people, and despite that no-one questioned the status as a state or the legal personality of these organizations and these states!"
"It is also not the case, as is sometimes taught, that the people create the state by contract."
"We may cite Rousseau and the contrat social , but no-one has ever yet seen even a certified copy of this contract."
"It is pure fiction."
"The only document that ever led to the founding of a state was that of the church state, the Donation of Constantine, and it is well known that it was a forgery and so at least constitutionally honest."
"So we should not hold on to this concept of 'nation state' , as most states have grown, starting with Switzerland and including others, so that this was just a case of legitimization after the event."
"To sum up then: in this report we approve of the judgement of the European Court of Justice in the Foto-Frost case, in accordance with which national jurisdiction does not have the competence to declare the actions of Community institutions invalid."
"From which it follows, of course, that we also hold and support the opinion that jurisdiction over the binding force of Community law lies exclusively with the European Court of Justice."
"As a consequence of this, in case of dispute the highest national courts must also apply the duty of referral contained in article 177."
"We demand, however, that the primacy of Community law - despite my observations - should in future be written into the treaty."
"We also want a clear solution to the relationship between international law and Community law to be incorporated into the treaty, and in this connection require that the Community should be put on a par with the nation states, which means that international law does not apply eo ipso , but rather that it has to be transformed within the EC by means of a legal instrument."
"We also demand that in the long term the relationship with international law should also amount to the second and third supporting pillars of the Union."
"In the same context, we also demand, of course, that the whole European Union should eventually be given legal personality by treaty."
"I believe that this report takes account of real developments in the European Community."
"If we say yes to this Europe and welcome the growing together of nations into a union, the only solution - regardless of whether one prefers a federal state or a union of states - is to accept the primacy of European law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice which flows from that, and accept it in this context."
"Mr President, that was the last report by my colleague, Mr Alber."
"I would like to thank him for his helpful and considerate cooperation and to wish him all the best for his new post."
"My group will vote for the motion for a resolution and reject all the amendments."
"I would like to say a word, Mr Alber, about the specific function of the term 'union of states'."
"In the terminology used by Germany's Federal Constitutional Court it is evidently an attempt to reduce the law of the European Union, of the European Communities, to international law."
"We are not talking about a theoretical problem."
"We talking about a full-blooded political conflict, which could develop into a crisis for the European Union."
"It is not a general question about whether there are limits to European integration in national constitutions. No, the question is whether constitutional courts can review the validity of the actions of the Community."
"That is what is at stake."
"This is not just about Germany's Federal Constitutional Court, there are also comparable trends in other Member States, such as Austria or Sweden, to name just two."
"Ten years ago, as you pointed out, Mr Alber, the European Court of Justice said that the need for uniformity, that is, the uniform application of Community law through the national courts, was particularly important when the legal force of some Community action - such as the adoption of a directive - was in doubt."
"Differences of opinion between the courts of the Member States about the validity of Community actions could jeopardize the unity of the Community's legal system itself and threaten the fundamental need for legal certainty."
"That is the reason for the primacy of Community law."
"It is not presumptuousness, it is not arrogance, it is an absolute necessity!"
"That is why it is no wonder that the President of the European Court of Justice, Mr Rodriguez Iglesias, is talking about an attack on the basic elements of the Community's constitution in this context."
"I very much hope that the national constitutional courts will recognise that in accordance with article 164 it is the task of the European Court of Justice to ensure the law in interpreting and applying this treaty."
"To ensure, that is the wording, to ensure!"
"No national constitutional court can set itself up as ruling over Community law."
"No constitutional court can be the tutor."
"Incidentally, there is an element of control by national parliaments in all this, because they decide which additional powers can be transferred."
"I very much hope that we will be spared one situation, namely treaty infringement proceedings against a Member State because of a judgement by a constitutional court."
"We can do without that!"
"Mr President, the report by our dear colleague, Siegbert Alber, which we are debating this evening, is worthy of our special attention for two principle reasons."
"Firstly, because it examines an issue which is not only very delicate, but is also extremely important for the European Union."
"This is the position held by community law in the legal system which governs our society, either within each Member State of the European Union, through its relationship with the constitutional or fundamental law of that Member State, or in its international relationships with pubic international law."
"Secondly, because it is the final contribution of a colleague who is greatly valued by all of us and who has contributed much to the European Union, before he devotes himself the day after tomorrow to defending Community law from another, very different and even more distinguished bastion."
"I had the pleasure and the honour of working closely with Siegbert Alber, initially in the presidency of the European Parliament, when we sat side by side as Vice-Presidents, then, in more recent years, on the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, which he set up, and I consider it my duty to express with deep emotion the more general appreciation of the people in this room of his entire contribution over so many years as elected representative of one of the great European nations."
"Two years have not gone by, Mr President, since I felt the need to point out, in the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights on the twelfth annual report of the European Commission on the Monitoring of the Implementation of Community Law, after the special hearing organized by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, the following details which I regarded as revealing: one, that the Community Treaties had established a new law and order in support of which the Member States had curtailed their sovereign rights in everexpanding areas; two, that the control that the constitutional courts were beginning to exercise in recent years as to the validity of Community regulatory actions in relation to the respective constitutions of the Member States was pregnant with dangers for the uniform implementation and harmony of Community law."
"It took three whole years for the principle of the supremacy of Community law over domestic law to be accepted by the French State Council, which was the last, chronologically, to put it in place. Nor did we manage to breathe a sigh of relief before the German Supreme Federal Constitutional Court made the decision, concerning the Treaty of Maastricht, to call this principle once again into even greater question throughout the nineties, this time from a different standpoint."
"A principle which was shaped basically by jurisprudence and which was indirectly strengthened by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is being signed tomorrow, as Siegbert Alber also observes in his report."
"Nevertheless, we would naturally prefer this recognition to be more direct and more explicit."
"The ideas that I put forward in my report of 1995 are strengthened and systematized in our German colleague's text, which supports the supremacy of Community law in the innovatory and unique character of the European Union, and also in its inclination towards further development."
"A development which creates new conditions and facts in the field of law, which establish opportunely the observation of the Ancient Greek philosopher, Theophrastos: not the things for the laws, but the laws for the things."
"This new reality is represented today by the European Union, which embodies all the hopes and aspirations that its inspirers and founders invested in it. Mr Alber's report has appeared at a very timely moment, because the building of a united Europe, albeit with many hurdles in its way, is making progress, but there is no lack of shock waves and indeed shock waves which assume the dangerous form of decisions of venerable supreme legislative bodies of the Member States."
"The value of the report that we are now debating lies in exactly this point, that in its content, with the very valid argumentation that we have heard this evening by the rapporteur, it rejects any tendency for the substitution of supreme national legislative bodies in a task that belongs exclusively to the Court of the European Communities."
"Because only the latter guarantees the independence and unity of Community law and order."
"And from tomorrow, today's rapporteur, Mr Alber, will be called upon to defend this independence and unity, in his new capacity as Advocate-General to the Court."
"We are delighted and proud of his new position."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, defining the relationships between Community law, constitutional law and international law is an issue of great importance which affects every citizen, even though they are often unaware of it."
"The application of an apparently abstract principle, such as the principle of the direct applicability of Community legislation places obligations on judges dealing with national law which dictates their jurisdictional activities."
"The most fervent supporters of the supremacy of Community law consider that it has precedence over any other legislation, whether national or international."
"This theory maintains that the relationship between Community law and national law is substantially a federal type of relationship."
"A different interpretation is maintained by those whose aim is to safeguard the fundamental principles of national constitutional law against the encroachment of Community law."
"According to these people, national constitutional arrangements are the ultimate expression of popular sovereignty, whereas Community law, encumbered as it is by a democratic deficit, cannot be considered as a higher source on principle."
"The rapporteur, Mr Alber, who was recently appointed Advocate-General at the Court of Justice - and we congratulate him on this appointment - maintains the federalist position."
"He was critical of the judgement of the German Federal Constitutional Court of October 1993 concerning the draft Maastricht Treaty: the author did not share the basis of his assertion that the passing of power to the European Community would potentially constitute a deprivation of the democratic principle."
"Our group appreciates the views expressed by Mr Alber and lays particular emphasis on how important it is that the preeminence of community law, as requested by the rapporteur, was sanctioned by the Treaty of Rome and that this treaty clearly defined the relationship between international law and European law."
"However, in this respect we believe we have to point out the urgency of overcoming the present democratic deficit which, if it continues, will end up by perpetuating anomalies in European decision-making processes which can only be tolerated in the short term."
"Mr President, I have never seen a report in which so many judgments have been quoted as the report by Mr Alber that we are now discussing."
"It must have been a preliminary exercise for his appointment as Advocate-General and I must say that now that he is going to join the ranks of the Court of Justice together with our former colleague Mr La Pergola, we do not need to waste too many more words on the right of appointment of the European Parliament of members and prosecutors at the Court of Justice, because soon the government judges will also become this Parliament's judges."
"Does this mean, and I cannot refrain from mentioning it, that a decision such as today's where the Court has already dropped us like a hot potato will perhaps be more difficult in the future."
"However, let us learn a sound lesson from this, because for years in the reports on the application of Community law in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights we have warned that we should not involve the Court of Justice too much in our political battle with the other institutions."
"Now that has been done in this case by France, but it is a fact that from time to time the Court must distance itself from the Parliament."
"I believe that the primordiality of Community law stands very clearly in the hierarchy of standards that are mentioned in Mr Alber's report and also very clearly in the political battle and the political role of the Court of Justice, as Mr Rothley has so rightly said."
"Nevertheless, it is a fact that the Member States must not only adapt to this but there must also be a unity of jurisdiction and this is caused above all by the preliminary rulings under article 177."
"I hope that Mr Alber in his role of Advocate-General will have to deal with a preliminary ruling that will be sought tomorrow morning by myself and my counsel Mr Janssen van Raay before the Court of Rotterdam where I must appear in a criminal case that I have provoked because I believe that Community law must be applied equally in all the Member States and that the treaty must be applied above national law."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is still a long way from being a political union."
"On the other hand, as a European Community it is most certainly a legal community, and one which has developed an astonishing dynamic over the decades it has existed."
"The Alber report is a kind of summary of this dynamic."
"Mr Alber, it is a matter of some personal satisfaction for me that this outcome has been possible because of an initiative by the European Parliament, or rather of its Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, which in June 1995 held a symposium on the relationship of Community law to international law and to the constitutional law of the Member States respectively."
"This initiative and the discussions which followed it resulted in the clarification presented in this report, although this clarification is far from being common knowledge or a commonly accepted feature of jurisdiction in the Member States."
"The first point of clarification, which defines all the others, is the primacy of Community law as opposed to national law."
"This primacy is not some theory propounded by extravagant Eurocrats, but is a guaranteed matter of legal fact, for the simple reason that in an area without internal borders, the area of the four freedoms, there is no competing law nor can there be as long as observance of the principle of subsidiarity guarantees national powers, which are at a totally different level."
"Connected with this is the fact that the freedom of movement of persons has for a long time not just been seen as a commercial activity, but rather, as in the Bosman Judgement, as a personal right and as an expression of the liberty of the citizens of the Union."
"This should be sufficient cause for this Parliament to support the rapporteur in his demands for high-level and extensive protection of fundamental rights and accordingly for a legal personality for the European Union, which is in a position to support this protection of fundamental rights at international level and to defend it."
"Whilst expressing my thanks for this handsome and encouraging report, I would like to offer my very best wishes for the responsible position which its draftsman will in future hold as Advocate-General of the European Court of Justice."
"Mr President, I too have a great deal of respect for the rapporteur and I wish him the best of luck in his future post, but I must admit, on behalf of my group, that I am in total disagreement with his report."
"We were in fact expecting a legal study, a reflection on the problems posed by the hierarchy of laws, relationships, for example, between the European Council and the European Parliament, or the Council of Ministers."
"We were expecting a better way of reconciling Community law with national law to be defined."
"Instead of that, we find a political, I would say almost ideological, report in front of us."
"His starting point is the observation that the Supreme Courts show a tendency to resistance, claiming the right to examine Community law for its compatibility with national constitutional law."
"It is clearly the German Federal Constitutional Court, with its decision of 12 October 1995, and the Danish Supreme Court, which my colleague will talk about in a moment, and its ruling of 12 October 1996, which are being targeted, I was going to say reviled."
"But you could also add the French Constitutional Court or the Italian Court, or plenty of others."
"You cannot state, as does the report, that the European Union's purpose is to create primary international law to be imposed on all the States and their national law."
"Nor can you say, as the resolution proposes, that every national judge, including the supreme national authorities, have the duty to apply the primacy of Community law."
"One cannot claim, moreover, that the European Community takes the place of national states in the enforcement of public international law."
"National law has to be respected, in particular national constitutional law for, by asserting that national constitutional law must be subordinated to Community law when national constitutional law is often the result of referenda, it is people's right to self-determination that you are challenging and that is a curious thing for a supposedly democratic institution to do."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome Mr Zurab Zhvania, President of the Parliament of the Republic of Georgia, and Mr Georgy Kobakhidze, Vice-President and President of the Permanent Parliamentary Delegation for Relations with the European Union, whom we had the pleasure of welcoming to the European Parliament in May 1997."
"Our two distinguished Parliamentary colleagues from Georgia..."
"... and their accompanying delegation will take part in the European Conference entitled 'Initiative for Democracy' tomorrow and on Friday."
"These Members of Parliament will also have conversations in the European Parliament, particularly with the Delegation for Relations with the Transcaucasian Republics and the President of the European Parliament."
"I hope our meetings and debates over the next few days will be profitable and will contribute to the achievement of closer relations between your country and the European Parliament."
"International law, Community law, national constitutional law (continuation)"
"Mr President, allow me to say first of all that it is my custom to refrain from complimenting the rapporteur not out of a lack of politeness or because of the content of his report, but rather because of the need to be concise."
"I would like to comment on another point in addition to what we have already heard."
"As Mrs Spaak, in the Committee on Institutional Affairs, originally put it with truly commendable frankness in her capacity as rapporteur, our citizens feel overwhelmed by the accelerated pace of institutional integration in Europe and cannot identify with it."
"We are of the opinion that it would be logical to look for another approach, an approach that would give the Member States more room for manoeuvre. In fact, the opposite is happening."
"People are looking for a new way to render an approach that our citizens do not want to accept more palatable them."
"You are probably asking what all this has to do with the report before us."
"We believe, as Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has already emphasized, that this report follows exactly the same political line, in that an attempt is being made to put the highest courts, such as Germany's Federal Constitutional Court and Denmark's Supreme Court, in their place, because they have drawn attention to the limits to integration."
"It is for this reason alone that we cannot support the approach adopted in this report, despite the high regard in which we of course hold the rapporteur."
"Mr President, I have three good reasons for whole-heartedly supporting Mr Alber's report."
"As a university lecturer in both constitutional law and European law, I am delighted that a serious text is now available for my students, in which the nuances of the not so simple and not so easy to understand Solange judgement of the German Federal Constitutional Court is set out very precisely and above all in the correct perspective."
"The Alber Report will therefore provide material for numerous, nay countless, seminar papers and dissertations, which cannot be sand of many other academic texts of this type."
"As one who has long been committed to the idea of Europe, I welcome the fact that this report represents a clear rejection of the many ""yes, but' Europeans."
"A rejection of those who always speak out for a greater role for Europe on every appropriate or inappropriate occasion, but who then, when things get serious, fall back on their country's special interests and legal situation; a rejection of those, for example, who not only in Germany but also in my own country say that they want the Euro, but not just yet, and not quite like this, and not quite as laid down in the treaty."
"It is also a rejection of those who, in many Member States, want one kind of subsidiarity one day and another the next, depending on what they are after or on how it suits their interests at that particular time."
"The Alber report very clearly tells these people that there can only be a common Europe when Member States share sovereignty and partly transfer it to the Community, and then continue to respect this surrender of sovereignty."
"Yet the Alber report also says - and I consider this to be very important - that there can only be a common Europe, now and in the future, if this Europe uses all the means at its disposal to protect fundamental rights, exactly as this report formally requests."
"As a university lecturer and as one who is committed to the European ideal, I have good grounds for saying 'yes' to this Alber report a third time."
"This report, and this has already been said several times, provides an excellent starting point for Siegbert Alber in his important new post as Advocate-General to the European Court of Justice."
"In that post Siegbert Alber will, I am quite sure, contribute to ensuring that Europe not only becomes a reality through the decisions of the European Court of Justice, but also that it is brought closer to its citizens."
"He will make this contribution in his usual friendly and knowledgeable manner, and because during the short time that I have worked alongside him I have got to know him a little and have come to appreciate his fine sense of humour, I hope that in future the European Court of Justice will make judgements that one cannot just acknowledge with a nod, not only respect and accept, but I also hope that a quiet smile to oneself will sometimes be in order."
"Mr President, Mr Alber, dear Siegbert, that sounds rather more normal in the German translation than in the Dutch, but I must honestly say that after Mrs Ewing you are the most long-standing member of this Parliament."
"You beat me by two years."
"We have worked together for years."
"Your swan song is stylish and as the accused Mr Wijsenbeek has already said, tomorrow we hope, I as his counsel and he as the accused, to ensure that the important matter of the refusal by Mr Wijsenbeek to show his passport at Rotterdam Airport is submitted to you under principles 8A and 7A of the treaty for a preliminary ruling."
"It is only at that moment that we will no longer say dear Siegbert, but will be able to use the correct Dutch terminology: ""Your Honour' ."
"We thank you, your honour, for everything that you have done in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights for your colleagues and Europe as a constitutional state."
"We wish you the best of luck in your new position."
"It will be a Freudian slip of mine if we appear with our lawsuit before you at the Court of Justice in Luxembourg."
"I have no doubts that Mr Alber is an excellent lawyer, and I would also like to join in congratulating him both on this report and on his future job."
"It is a clear and unambiguous rendition of one of the fundamental principles of EU integration, the principle of supremacy, which even Mr Rack's students will be able to enjoy reading."
"There are certainly others who would also enjoy reading it, including the judges in the Danish Supreme Court, before whom I shall be presenting a case next month."
"This principle, which is expressed very accurately and in detail, has the support both of the rapporteur and of the great majority of Members, and more than that: it will be extended and strengthened, as a number of the paragraphs in the report indicate, and tendencies in the opposite direction, and here I am thinking in particular of some statements and rulings by the German Constitutional Court, which were followed, although on a somewhat different level, by the Danish Supreme Court in a ruling in August last year in a case which I myself conducted."
"But, and here come the problems, as integration and the principle of supremacy are extended, the national decision-making processes are weakened."
"If I may say so, the colossus, if one can be so irreverent as to describe the system in that way, is growing bigger, but its feet of clay are growing weaker and weaker."
"The national democracies are being undermined, and hopefully, in the course of the next six months, the Danish Supreme Court will deliver a ruling which will send shockwaves through this selfsatisfied system."
"Mr President, I must confess that I have been very much looking forward to taking part in this debate, knowing that it concerns my colleague Siegbert Alber's last report."
"I sincerely believe that this House is losing one of its best Members and, speaking from a personal point of view, I am losing a close colleague."
"We have always sat next to each other, because of our surnames, and I feel very sorry to be losing the advice and help which he has given me on so many occasions."
"At the same time, however, I am also very pleased for him because I believe the post he is going to take up - that of Advocate-General in the European Union Court of Justice - is one of law's most prestigious positions."
"The European Community is a Community of law, which honours the rule of law."
"This in its turn is closely related to the principle of the separation of powers."
"In legitimately yielding certain aspects of their national sovereignty to the Union, the Member States should not weaken the democratic control which is able to bring about this transfer."
"This potential deficit should be offset by a greater political control on the part of the legislative power."
"Thus we can say that fundamental rights will only enjoy true legal protection when there is a parallel process between the transfer of national powers to Community competence on the one hand, and on the other hand, when the European Parliament and the national parliaments together gradually acquire greater control over the executive's activities."
"We must not forget that although the European Union is based on the rule of law, it has not yet completely assimilated the principle of the separation of powers, since the treaties only grant powers and do not completely design a system of political control."
"Another of the important consequences, to which Mr Rothley and Mr Florio have referred, is the principle of a legal hierarchy."
"This axiom has been repeatedly defined by the Court of Justice and could be summed up in the idea that any national decision which is contrary to Community law is inapplicable."
"Among the measures to guarantee this, there is for example article 177, concerning the question of prejudice."
"As Mr Alber, the rapporteur, has specifically mentioned, during discussions of this report in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Industrial Policy reference was made to the Foto-Frost judgement of the Court of Justice, which emphatically and exclusively stated that the national courts are not competent to declare invalid the acts of the Community institutions, and that the Court of Justice is the only body competent to evaluate the binding nature of Community law."
"It must not be forgotten that Community law is a unitary legal order in which various types of rulings can be found, including derived law, which is that which results from the acts of the Community institutions and is an integral part of Community law."
"If I may say so, I think it is more than that - it is the most visible part of Community law."
"This derived law is only controlled by the Court of Justice and not by national jurisdiction."
"A national judge should not and cannot pass judgement on the validity of derived law."
"This point brings us, Mr President, to the tricky and dangerous question of the principle of subsidiarity, which has also been alluded to during this debate."
"Although I do not propose to do so, I could quote the protocol on the application of the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity which is included in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and which is to be annexed to the treaty."
"I conclude by saying that I agree with what Mr Rack has said about the firm, constant and decisive defence of Community law, and the request, also made by Mr Alber, that the primacy of Community law be respected in the treaty."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Van den Broek."
"May I also address my personal congratulations to Mr Alber."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.55 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"EU-Asean Relations"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0221/97 by Mr Pettinari, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Cambodia (COM(97)78-6828/97 - C4-0250/97-97/0060(CNS)), -A4-0216/97 by Mr Castagnède, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the Lao People's Democratic Republic (COM(97)79-6829/97 - C4-0251/97-97/0062(CNS)), -A4-0195/97 by Mr Hindley, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion of the protocol on the extension of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and Brunei-Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, to Vietnam (COM(97)0002 - C4-0152/97-97/0017(CNS)), -A4-0262/97 by Mr Hindley, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee ""creating a new dynamic in EU-ASEAN relations' (COM(96)0314 - C4-0467/96)."
"Mr President, the political situation in Cambodia has altered radically since the Committee on Development and Cooperation approved the cooperation agreement last July."
"This is a situation which will prompt me to recommend to the Chamber tomorrow, when the vote is taken on my report, that this report be referred back to committee to allow me to update it as necessary and to give us time to contribute towards a peaceful resolution of the crisis in Cambodia."
"Two months ago we witnessed a political upheaval in Phnom Penh where military action enabled the leader, Hun Sen, to take virtual control of all of Cambodia and force Prince Ranariddh to flee abroad."
"The spectre of the Khmer Rouge was and continues to be behind this fighting, particularly since Pol Pot's movement broke away and has been trying to get back into civilian life in Cambodia."
"The prospect of the Khmer Rouge being able to change the political framework in Cambodia, mostly thanks to alliances with the main national parties, has produced an unstable situation and brought forth the least democratic elements in Cambodian politics."
"I believe it is necessary to renew our appeal to the parties to accept an immediate cease-fire in the provinces still affected by the fighting and I would ask the Cambodian government to respect the people's basic rights as a precondition for finding a solution to the crisis."
"The European Union can and should play a peacemaker's role in Cambodia, as should the European Parliament by using the instrument of the framework cooperation agreement which, I repeat, it is premature to ratify at this stage."
"I believe that the approval of the agreement, which will be necessary at a later date, should be subject to three basic conditions, already discussed in the Committee on Development and Cooperation: first and foremost, full adherence to the Paris agreements of 1991 and the national institutional apparatus determined by these agreements; secondly, adherence to the timetable for elections, or a guarantee that legislative elections will be held in March 1998."
"The elections I am talking about must be free, multi-party, democratic elections which guarantee full right of expression to all parties in Cambodia."
"Moreover, these elections should be monitored by international observers, obviously including envoys from the European Parliament."
"The third condition is the strict observance of human rights, a point on which we cannot give way."
"I therefore believe that a committee of inquiry should be set up as soon as possible to investigate accusations of massacres perpetrated during the recent fighting shortly before summer."
"In the meantime, the European Union should also make a contribution to stabilizing the situation now that former Foreign Minister Um Guot has succeeded Prince Ranariddh as Head of Government."
"In this connection it is necessary to support the mediation work done by King Sihanouk who has preferred to remain impartial with regard to the main players in the crisis and try to resolve the conflict on behalf of the Cambodian people who have already been severely tested by decades of dramatic history."
"I also note the decision by ASEAN foreign ministers to delay further the admission of Cambodia to their organisation."
"This is a real novelty as for the first time in its history ASEAN has decided that a country's internal political situation could have an adverse effect on that country's relations with the organisation."
"At any rate, it is a positive approach which I hope can also be used in future with Burma, a military dictatorship which was nevertheless recently admitted to ASEAN."
"Mr President, the European Parliament has an opportunity to make an active contribution to the search for a negotiated political settlement of the crisis in Cambodia and it can do so if we can by a large majority in this House use the ratification process for the framework economic and commercial cooperation agreement."
"At this point we know we can count on the collaboration and cooperation of the Commission."
"For these reasons I would therefore ask Parliament to grant my motion tomorrow for the report on Cambodia to be referred back to committee."
"In this way I shall be attempting to convey to the Cambodian authorities the extent of Europe's concern about a political crisis which must be resolved as soon as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Laos is one of the most modest of countries - I am talking in terms of its population, which is only 5 million - in South East Asia."
"It is also one of the poorest, since 46 % of the population live below the poverty line."
"It is perhaps also one of the most charming due to its ethnic and cultural diversity - more than sixty different ethnic groups living together - due to its authenticity, largely preserved, its nature, its cultural heritage and its traditional ways of life."
"It is also a country which has had to suffer long and painful ordeals since independence, gained in 1953."
"First of all internal ordeals between the right wing, the 'neutralists' and the communist Pathet Lao."
"Then, above all, the ordeal of the Vietnam War in which Laos, in spite of itself, found itself drawn in and above all the victim."
"Since the supply lines of North Vietnam passed along its frontier, Laos became the object of bombing, by the American air force, on a staggering scale."
"It is claimed that almost the equivalent of half a tonne of bombs per person were dropped on Laos."
"We know, however, that after the fall of Saigon and the departure of the Americans from the region in 1975, Laos fell under the control of the Pathet Lao communist movement."
"They imposed a Soviet-style economic model for around ten years, with no truly convincing success."
"Finally, from 1986 onwards, Laos launched a programme of economic reforms which moved towards a market economy, a direction that was clearly confirmed in its 1991 constitution."
"An agreement was concluded with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund."
"The first elements of co-operation were put in place with the European Union."
"These concerns to open up to the outside world are being more widely concretised with Laos' adhesion to ASEAN, although they are at the same time involved in negotiations with a view to reaching commercial agreements with the United States and the European Community."
"The agreement reached between the Community and Laos is a trade and cooperation agreement."
"With regard to trade, the two parties agree to most favoured nation status for the exchange of goods."
"With regard to cooperation, the Community has showed its willingness to contribute to a lasting development in Laos and an improvement in the living conditions of the people of Laos."
"In this sense, certain priorities have already been defined in the fight against poverty, the favouring of rural development, the role of women in development, and also the development of human resources."
"We would like to briefly draw Parliament's attention to the four particular features of this cooperation agreement."
"It mentions first of all the serious problem of unexploded devices, the anti-personnel mines that were widespread during the Vietnam War."
"Their proliferation is today a major handicap for agricultural development."
"The Community will have to continue its efforts to contribute to the eradication of this blight."
"The particular importance of environmental considerations in this co-operation agreement should also be highlighted."
"I will not go into details, but this is an extremely interesting feature of the agreement."
"The agreement contains measures with a view to combatting the production of opium, which remains a major problem in Laos."
"The solution here is obviously the establishment of substitution crops."
"Encouraging experiences have already been undertaken."
"The agreement will enable these to be extended."
"It is necessary to mention, finally, the particular importance of concerns in the areas of human rights and democratic principles in the agreement which is submitted for our study."
"Now established as a free market economy, it is true that Laos is still ruled by a regime which, if not one-party, is certainly one-party dominant."
"It is a regime which has favourably evolved as the after effects of civil and international war have faded, but respect for human rights and democratic principles needs more in-depth treatment, which both parties to the cooperation agreement were clearly concerned about."
"In fact the agreement sets out, in its first article, that respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights is an essential element of the agreement, and violation of this article would constitute a case of special urgency under which measures may be taken for the non-execution of the agreement."
"Because it enables the development of human rights and freedoms in this part of South East Asia by making it a determining factor in our support to development and economic liberalization in Laos, this agreement on trade and cooperation between Laos and the Community is worthy of approval."
"This is in any case the unanimous position of your Committee on Development and Cooperation, an opinion also held, of course, by your rapporteur."
"Mr President, before turning to my report on Vietnam and the report on ASEAN, may I first make a procedural point."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy submitted an opinion to my report on ASEAN."
"Due to an unfortunate lack of coordination between committees, this resolution was not included into today's resolution."
"It will be presented as an oral amendment tomorrow and I should be grateful if whoever is in the Chair tomorrow gives me a few moments of time before the vote to explain that."
"If I may turn to the substance, I would like to spend a few moments discussing the agreement with Vietnam, or that part relating to Vietnam, and then move on to the wider issue of ASEAN."
"The question of Vietnam is simply a technicality to take into account that Vietnam is now a member of ASEAN and to amend our existing cooperation agreement with ASEAN to include Vietnam."
"Vietnam is a poor country; it is a country which is recovering; it is a country which has tremendous potential; and is a country which really in essence has never been part of the wider world because since gaining independence at the end of the Second World War it has been submerged in its internal and external wars."
"So it cannot be simply said that joining ASEAN and our agreements with ASEAN and our bilateral agreements with Vietnam are rehabilitating Vietnam."
"In a very real sense Vietnam has never been allowed the privilege of joining the wider world and these agreements give that country that right at long last."
"The question has been raised of human rights in Vietnam and I am sure other Members will wish to make reference to that in the succeeding debate."
"For my own part could I remind the House that our bilateral agreement with Vietnam includes a human rights conditionality and this will be carried with Vietnam, as it were, into ASEAN."
"That question of extending our already existing agreements with ASEAN to a new entry into ASEAN and the question of human rights, gives me the opportunity of reaching to the wider question of ASEAN itself."
"ASEAN, this summer, admitted Burma at last and there is, as has just been indicated, still the possibility of Cambodia joining."
"This raises the question of how we handle human rights because Members will clearly have grave reservations when it comes to the admission to our treaty with ASEAN of Burma and, to a lesser extent or perhaps equally now, Cambodia."
"Let me make it clear that I myself and my Committee categorically consider membership of ASEAN to be an ASEAN issue."
"Who ASEAN admits is ASEAN's business."
"No one can recall ASEAN having an opinion on the enlargement of the European Union."
"However, when ASEAN has been enlarged, clearly our relations with the old ASEAN will have to significantly change to take into account that new composition."
"In that respect, let me say that the committee thought the most prudent and wise course is to insist that when the Treaty needs to be amended for Cambodia, Laos and Burma - we will certainly soon be presented with that in the case of Laos and Burma - we should follow the procedure adopted for Vietnam and have a separate mandate."
"I would not like the issue of enlargement of ASEAN, including Burma and Laos, to be finessed by putting them together."
"We would like a separate mandate so that each can be considered on its merits."
"We understand that the composition and constitution of ASEAN has a concept of concentric and overlapping circles, so that membership of ASEAN does not necessarily imply that a new entrant has the right to participate fully in all the dialogues which ASEAN has with third parties."
"From that we could conclude that with some skill and some wit and good judgment, we can continue our wider relations between the EU and ASEAN, taking into account the moral disapproval we may have with some of the new entrants and yet manage to continue a dialogue."
"I do not think that is far beyond the wit of the Commission, the Council and other people involved to arrange."
"However, the Committee is not happy with the anomalous situation that we will now have countries inside ASEAN who have bilateral human rights conditionality in their agreements with us when the overall EU ASEAN agreement does not contain such conditionality."
"We would like to insist as much as we can on drawing up a new agreement between the EU and ASEAN which contains specifically human rights conditionality, not simply in the form of freedom of conscience and freedom of expression but also human rights at work."
"We all accept the idea of social conditionality being important within the European Union; we accept a social chapter."
"It is perfectly reasonable therefore to demand a social chapter and a social dimension to our relations with any other block, and that would include ASEAN."
"If I can move on to more a positive aspect, I would stress that our relations economically and in trade terms with ASEAN seem to be a great success story."
"However, it has been remarked by no less a person than the Prime Minister of Singapore himself that in the triangular world which is emerging of Europe, America and Asia, it is certain that the US-Europe link is strong."
"It is also clear that the US-Asia link is emerging strong but as yet the Asia-Europe link remains weak and that would eventually have, we feel, disproportionate and disorientating effects on the general world economic welfare."
"In that respect, when we talk about strengthening dialogue, the Parliament welcomes the ASEM dialogue process."
"That seems to have been a successful way of moving items onto the agenda and making sure there is progress which obviates the difficulties caused by the blockage in EU ASEAN relations themselves."
"We congratulate sincerely those who participate in that dialogue."
"When we read the presentations to that dialogue, we welcome the mention of ministers meeting each other, we welcome the mention of academics meeting each other, we welcome youth exchanges, we welcome business exchanges, we welcome the Commission exchanging visits."
"What we are looking for, however, and what is certainly not in any of the documents that we have seen is mention of parliamentarians having an exchange."
"Clearly if we are to develop a genuine dialogue between Europe and ASEAN, we must involve directly elected members who have a mandate and we must facilitate contacts as part of the ASEM process and wider EU-ASEAN relations."
"Finally, I should like to say a word of genuine welcome and appreciation of the document which talks of creating a new dynamic in EU ASEAN relations."
"We recognise the need for more dialogue and strengthening our agreements and our cooperation."
"However, that must not be at the expense of Parliament's rights to issue opinions and eventually vote on such matters."
"We can accept, as a temporary expedient, the production of a document to bring on the dialogue but there really is, I must say to the Commission, no substitute for an actual agreement."
"If an actual agreement is to be avoided because we fear that the ASEAN side will not accept human rights conditionality, then I am afraid Parliament will not accept that."
"That must be pointed out; we can accept as a temporary measure you using a communication for a new dynamic but that is no substitute for a permanent relationship."
"We do not wish to see the responsibilities of Parliament undermined in this way, so we would urge the conclusion, difficult as it may be, sticky as some issues are, of a genuine new agreement."
"In that regard, President, I commend to the House approval of both the Vietnam report and the wider ASEAN report as well."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, obviously the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy considers the relationship between the European Union and ASEAN to be an extremely important and delicate matter, for a variety of reasons."
"I need not repeat how strategically important the South-East Asian region has become;"
"I would also remind you that Europe is now the second-largest investor in this region and a need is clearly felt for an ongoing political dialogue between the European Union and ASEAN."
"However, with regard to the technical question of how to go forward in this political dialogue, we believe that the best solution would be to negotiate a new, third-generation, agreement."
"For this reason we believe it necessary to ask Portugal to withdraw its refusal to give the Committee a mandate to negotiate this third-generation agreement."
"The various pieces of sleight of hand looked at by the Committee to get round the problem - for example, the addition of protocols to the 1980 agreement or a package of economic and social cooperation measures - cannot in our opinion be regarded as an alternative to a new, third-generation agreement with ASEAN, for one simple reason: this would weaken the agreement between Europe and ASEAN at a political level, particularly with regard to the issue of human rights, which is a key issue."
"Burma, which recently joined ASEAN, flagrantly and brutally violates human and democratic rights while other ASEAN countries routinely exercise the death penalty, in breach of all internationally agreed conventions. East Timor is in a situation which up to now has been in a state of suspended animation."
"We therefore consider it necessary not to negotiate on principles, principles of self-determination, liberty and human rights."
"We believe it is vital for the ASEAN countries to sign the two international conventions on human rights and against torture."
"I conclude, Mr President, merely by saying that for technical and bureaucratic reasons the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security was not included in the general report of the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"I hope that this intervention can be included tomorrow by means of oral amendments."
"Mr President, before we go any further, I should like to congratulate my colleague Mr Hindley on his work."
"The conclusions he has presented are clearly the result of a detailed study of the complex problems involved in the European Union's relations with ASEAN."
"It notes the growing importance of the ASEAN countries in the international economy, their strategic relevance in safeguarding peace, stability and security in a region which is having a very significant influence on world events."
"It correctly evaluates the positioning of the European Union, which, from the economic point of view, is the second largest investor in the region, and will have to opt for a positive approach of strengthening its participation in actions which further the economic and social development of those countries."
"Thus it is absolutely necessary to enter into closer dialogue and raise levels of cooperation, a desideratum not clearly secured by Agenda 2000, be it said, in the fields of either commerce, investment policy or market access."
"It is, nevertheless, essential to make a permanent evaluation of levels of cooperation, bearing in mind the requirements of reciprocity and the limits imposed by ASEAN internal legislation."
"Just as it is also imperative to ensure that conditionality on human rights applies to all European Union-ASEAN agreements, and that this is not only agreed on paper but effectively secures the social rights of workers and the individual freedom of citizens."
"We all consider the restrictions the European Union has been placing on Burma as a result of her disregard of human rights to be perfectly proper."
"But all of us are also aware of the intransigent position of Indonesia, especially as regards East Timor, representing a clearly offensive attitude to which the European Union must give an effective and determined response."
"It would therefore be more appropriate and politically justifiable to require that country to comply with the international rules recognised by the UNO than to ask Portugal for leave to negotiate thirdgeneration agreements, although it is recognized that these have intrinsic importance and value as the best option for a new dynamic in European Union-ASEAN relations."
"All this must be achieved within a democratic framework of justice and respect for human dignity."
"Mr President, if there is any country in the world which the European Union should help then it is Cambodia, for at least two reasons."
"Firstly, because Cambodia is one of the poorest countries on the planet and since its trading relations are largely in deficit, only vigorous support on the part of the international community can curb and reverse the process of pauperization which this country is going through."
"But this effort is required also for moral reasons."
"The passivity, the cowardice which the international community, in particular the countries of Europe, showed at a time when the Cambodian people were truly the objects of genocide at the hands of the Khmer Rouge, makes it our duty to today help these people to develop their economy, improve their living conditions and move down the path to democracy."
"We welcomed with satisfaction the cooperation agreement between the European Union and Cambodia, signed last 29 April, in Luxembourg."
"This is a good agreement and the priorities that it establishes respond very well to the situation in the country and to the needs of its inhabitants."
"The fight against poverty, the search for lasting development, defence of the environment, notably the fight against deforestation, mine clearance, education, encouragement of private investment, and also the promotion of democracy and respect for human rights are amongst the main objectives of this agreement."
"Last June, for various reasons and in spite of reservations on the situation in the country regarding political stability and respect for human rights, the Group of the European People's Party approved the implementation of this agreement."
"Today, unfortunately, the situation is completely different."
"The coup d'etat on 5 July, by which the second Prime Minister, Mr Hun Sen, deposed the first Prime Minister, Mr Norodom Ranariddh, has plunged Cambodia once more into chaos."
"Fighting has recommenced, violence is appearing in different forms - looting, assassinations - those in power challenge political pluralism and human rights are scorned."
"To ratify this agreement now under these tragic circumstances would be to give our approval to the coup and all the acts of violence that it has given rise to, which are still multiplying throughout the Cambodian territory."
"The PPE Group supports Luciano Pettinari's recommendation at the beginning of the sitting, to refer the report aimed at ratifying the agreement with Cambodia back to committee."
"It is certainly not a question, for Europe, for the European Union, for the European Parliament, of ignoring for a second time the fate of the unhappy Cambodian people."
"On the contrary, by resorting to what the rapporteur called 'active referral', it is a way of putting pressure on those who keep hold of power in order that their reign of illegality and violence may cease, so that the Paris agreements, notably those concerning the holding of elections in March 1998, may be applied, elections which we must demand take place under international supervision."
"The Cambodian people have suffered far too much in their recent history and our responsibility in this is too large for our Parliament, at the time of this vote, to fail to show its clear and vigorous desire to help Cambodia to finally find the path to development and democracy."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to compliment the rapporteur, Mr Hindley, on both his detailed reports."
"The Group of the Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party is pleased about the extension of our cooperation with ASEAN to Vietnam."
"This will stimulate economic growth in that land and benefit social stability in that poor country."
"Commercial ties within ASEAN stabilize regional relationships so that the region becomes more attractive to European investors."
"Electronic trade in particular offers very interesting prospects for large and small European entrepreneurs provided that the ASEAN countries do not put up any thresholds in that area."
"I am thinking particularly here of the strict rules in Singapore regarding censorship on the Internet."
"International consultation is very important in order to guarantee electronic free trade."
"The Liberal Group is also glad that cooperation with Vietnam is placed under the condition of respect for human rights."
"This clause is one of the few instruments that the Union possesses to enforce the protection of human rights."
"My group hopes that there will also be a quick result in the discussions about human rights with the other ASEAN countries."
"With regard to cooperation with these other ASEAN member countries, the forest fires in Indonesia again clearly show the importance of cooperation with regard to the environment and development."
"We hope that cooperation in these areas will also help to prevent such ecological disasters in the future."
"Finally, my group wishes to stress that it is very important to give the euro, our common currency, a good reputation among the business world in Asia."
"This can bring about an improvement in our position as the third trading partner in this region."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that South-East Asia is a booming region, as Mr Hindley has just said."
"From which it follows that the 1980 agreement between the European Union and the ASEAN states should continue."
"But just what is booming at present?"
"Crashes and anxiety - so that it is starting to look like Mexico a couple of years ago."
"In Thailand the baht is plunging, and in Kalimantan, Sumatra and Celebes the forests have been burning for weeks."
"In Burma, Cambodia, East Timor and many other regions there are human rights violations going back years in some cases."
"What can we conclude from this?"
"Our relations cannot just carry on as they are."
"We cannot simply liberalize trade or pursue the liberalization of investment according in line with the WTO model."
"I believe that instead we need to consider whether it would not be sensible, as a means of stabilizing financial markets, to introduce something like the Tobin Tax."
"Malaysia's premier was right when he told the IMF-World Bank Conference in Hong Kong a few days ago that currency speculation is immoral and demanded that it should be prohibited."
"My second point is that if we conclude a treaty, it must of course cover human rights."
"The EU cannot just fiddle around with protocols on a matter like this."
"A basic requirement for new treaties, given our own democratic standpoint, has to be the participation of the European Parliament."
"So we do not need any protocols, but a new third generation agreement."
"That is why we - and many other colleagues - are asking Portugal to give up their veto on East Timor."
"This does not mean that we condone the human rights violations there, no, it signals the fact that this is a European Union problem and not just one for Portugal."
"The other European countries are just as involved, and it is a legacy from the colonial era."
"Maybe we will even decide to apply something like a European Union protection order to the East Timor region, out of a sense of historical responsibility; maybe it can even be taken out of the treaties."
"My third point is that the sustainable economy must have the utmost priority."
"The economy must not be further liberalised, it needs to be restructured."
"It is not a question of removing constraints, but about banning products manufactured in conditions that involve squandering resources or infringing human rights."
"To do this we need commitments to protection, and I believe that if we had had these, the forest fires would not have happened."
"I have a question for the Commissioner: the European Union or its Commission has supported early warning systems in Sumatra."
"Why did they not work?"
"What happened to the natives in these fires?"
"Were they burnt to death?"
"Are these fires possibly a form of liberalisation, to allow rice to be planted there in the near future, to complete the Transmigrasi project and perhaps to replace virgin jungle with plantations soon?"
"What are we doing to preserve the environment?"
"What are we doing to conserve resources and to preserve the knowledge, the richness of the peoples in this region and in the forests?"
"Lastly, a word about the treaties. If we conclude new treaties and Burma is included, at present we can only, as many others have said before, support the position of Great Britain, who are pursuing a policy of not granting Burma a visa in relation to ASEAN 1998."
"I believe that we should not include a state like this in the expansion process."
"Of course, expansion is a matter for ASEAN, but we need to have our own ideas about it."
"Are we to accept what ASEAN presents to us or not? If we cannot accept this on human rights or economic grounds, then we should not do that either, but instead make our position clear."
"Mr President, Vice-President Marín, ladies and gentlemen, today in a certain number of European newspapers a group of MPs have said, notably, that Europe is not doing well, not doing well because, under the terms of the Treaty of Amsterdam, it has not made democracy a sufficiently high priority within its institutions, its procedures, or its rules of operation."
"If Europe is doing badly, then ASEAN is doing very badly."
"It is not by chance that fires ravage the region, that their currency is in free fall."
"It is not liberalism at any cost which reigns there, Mr Telkämper, it is just liberalism, an economic system which is causing deadlock in human rights, in democracy, and which claims, in the name of the market and growth, to forget that human rights are a universal value, to forget about political democracy, and to think that the model of the state can function without these values."
"We members of the Union, we have other values and I believe that in this case it is important to emphasize, as all our colleagues have rightly done, that we cannot accept, in the name of the laws of trade and profit, to close our eyes to the fact that, in spite of its generals - a little dictatorial it is true - ASEAN has accepted Burma as a member, and whilst Aung San Sun Kyi, winner of the Nobel prize and the Sakharov prize is under house arrest."
"No, I believe that our Parliament and our Union have the right and the duty to say no and thus do everything possible in order that human rights clauses, and the rules which we set out in our relations with the countries with which we co-operate should be accepted."
"If this is not the case, we can quite simply say to our friends in ASEAN that they can look elsewhere because we are not interested."
"I know that it is a difficult position and that, very often, with China, with other countries, we fob ourselves off with fine words and then go and do the opposite."
"I believe that a firm attitude towards the ASEAN countries would be a way of testing whether our values really exist or not, or of seeing if we can review them when it suits us."
"Malaysia and other countries are heading a movement which will try to oppose the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"Well, if our values are real, it is through them that we will put in place the co-operation that we want."
"From this point of view, the comments of the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy are very important."
"The challenging of the death penalty which is practised there, and all the other violations denounced in the report must serve as test cases, for the Commission, for us all, to demonstrate our priorities in the way in which we treat these countries."
"The English Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, has just turned down a very interesting arms deal with Indonesia."
"I think he did the right thing."
"Such signs are important to enable us to break this agreement, if ASEAN want to accept Burma as a member."
"Why not conclude bilateral agreements on the basis of our values?"
"Such is the challenge that in my opinion we have to take up, the challenge for which, for example, at the level of the European Union budget, our group proposed to put to one side a certain number of credits allocated to the ASEAN countries, just to show that we are not happy that they have accepted Burma as one of their members."
"Mr President, regarding the report that Mr Hindley has provided on the relations between the European Union and Vietnam, and their extension through the agreements signed with the Association of South East Asian Nations."
"The text presents indicative figures for economic progress achieved by Vietnam and also reminds us of the possibility of suspending our agreement in the case of human rights violations."
"This 'in the case of' is truly astounding, for simple good sense should prompt the observation that no accord should have been signed from the moment when it was subjected to respect for human rights."
"But perhaps the opponents of the communist regime, the believers, Christians, Buddhists, and others, persecuted, would not here be considered as humans."
"Vietnam has not been liberated from the communist strait-jacket, no more than has Laos, or Cambodia."
"There is also a lot than can be said regarding what the figures of improved economic well-being really reflect, the country having been reduced to generalised misery by the most ferocious form of collectivism."
"The slightest relaxation evidently brings improvement, but how relative that is."
"What is unfortunately certain is the phenomenal corruption that is running through the country like gangrene, in accordance with the process current in all socialist regimes where, after the eradication of men and the natural structures of the market economy, they are left swarming with mafia, like bad undergrowth in a field long ago laid to waste."
"But as in 'lao gai' China, as in Cambodia, as in Laos, Vietnam remains a country of oppression, where the great martyrdom of a people subjugated by communism continues."
"Let us repeat it as many times as it needs, communism was killing before Nazism killed."
"It was killing while Nazism killed."
"In 1997, it is still killing."
"The news which comes from Vietnam - I have three little Vietnamese godchildren - is frequent and always concerns the violent repression of all freedoms and the bloody repression of all demonstrations, but then two-thirds of this Assembly fought for so-called peace in Vietnam."
"In its two wars of conquest, Vietnamese communism has killed millions of people in mass executions, death camps, and also through the flight of the boat people."
"Unfortunately, firstly the Vietminh then the Vietcong were not lacking in support from the countries of the West, from the communist party of course, that of Boudarel the traitor, not yet come to trial, the sinister torturer of camp 113, author of crimes against humanity, who was this morning taking a coffee on the Boulevard Saint-Germain."
"But it also gained massive support from the Catholic hierarchy and clergy, by admission of Cardinal de Courtray himself, on 5 January 1990."
"We French are now waiting for the French bishops to ask forgiveness for their inexcusable compromise of principle, over tens of years, with the butchers of 200 million victims of these subjugated peoples."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"Today's debate is concerned with ASEAN in general, with its relatively new member Vietnam, and with Laos which has recently been included in the membership process, as well as with Cambodia, whose ASEAN membership had to be deferred for the time being because of the violent change of government last July."
"Another new ASEAN member, Burma, is not the subject of discussion today, but cannot be totally ignored."
"ASEAN is an inter-Asian association which, as Mr Hindley accurately writes in his report, was designed as a bulwark against communism."
"However, with Laos and Vietnam, the 'tiger club' now includes two countries which despite all their economic liberalization, politically speaking still have communist governments."
"The political situation has changed since the dissolution of the old blocs."
"This alliance now has a geographically strategic significance in the face of the Chinese giant to the north."
"Until recently, most of ASEAN's members - especially Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and to some extent Indonesia - were regarded as a never ending success story."
"With two-figure growth rates, high-rise buildings were shooting up like mushrooms, output and exports were booming like never before, and Europe was starting to feel the aggressive competition in trade and had to - and is still having to - contend with job relocation."
"At the same time, the ASEAN countries were recognised as an important market that had to be strategically addressed, so that the European Union became the second largest investor in this region."
"The cooperation agreement with ASEAN is based on relations as they were in 1980."
"So it can rightly be said that modernization is long overdue."
"But that is easier said than done."
"Extending the existing agreement to the new members is really just a matter of getting in training for that."
"There was no problem with Brunei, a wealthy oil sultanate."
"With Vietnam as well it is almost a formality, even if it is a bit tricky."
"We have already mentioned the human rights issue."
"Anyone who has ever set eyes on an ASEAN country knows that child labour, the sexual exploitation of women and children, the absence of workers' rights, and the oppression of ethnic and religious minorities are the order of the day in many places."
"Working conditions in Malaysia and Indonesia and elsewhere constantly give rise to calls for the observance of the standards set by international labour organisations and for agreement on a social clause in the context of the WTO, but this scarcely bothers the ASEAN countries."
"They refer to Asian values, which they say should be respected."
"Malaysia has even called for an amendment of the definition of human rights in the 1950 UN convention."
"However, more recently the tigers have suffered some severe setbacks."
"Turbulence on the currency markets, economic collapse, and environmental disasters, especially in recent weeks, have made it clear that there is a penalty to pay for over-exploitation of people and of the environment, and economic development 'on tick' without a solid foundation."
"This gives the call for a new dynamic in relations with ASEAN a new dimension."
"For the European Union, this means a balancing act between political and economic systems, and between cooperation, toleration and rejection, if tolerance levels are exceeded."
"So at present there can be no question of an agreement with the new ruler of Cambodia, Hun Sen, who literally walked over dead bodies to achieve power, nor can there be any question of supporting the military regime in Burma, which shows contempt for humanity, finances itself from the drug trade and from smuggling, and which accordingly has an unhealthy influence on its neighbouring countries, which out of poverty are driven to grow opium."
"However, I believe that it is important, particularly in the case of Vietnam and Laos, to stress the development policy side, and to emphasise the need for sustainable development."
"It is the job of the European Union to take care of this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to restrict my intervention to Laos, and would first like to thank Mr Castagnède for his report and for his contribution to the debate just now."
"As far as development goes, we are primarily concerned with the ACP States."
"But here we are dealing with Laos, one of the poorest countries in the world, which, however, has no access to the resources of the European development fund."
"In that respect this agreement brings expectations of partnership and cooperation."
"Poverty in a country like Laos does not just mean a shortage of food, but also inadequate health care, education and general prospects in life."
"The per capita income of this country is 290 dollars a year, and when you allow for the development aid which we have given so far, in the final count 15 % of this income is actually in the form of financial support or contributions from the European Union."
"If we are to work towards cooperation in the framework of this agreement, then we certainly need to be clear that we are looking at trade and cooperation spanning half the globe."
"On the other hand, the entry of this country into ASEAN means that there is a market on its doorstep covering 400 million consumers."
"I also have a few more questions for the Commission, much as I am pleased with this treaty."
"The first question is this: what are the real prospects now for the democratisation of a single party government, given that some 75 % of the leading figures in this country are high-ranking and other military officers?"
"The second question is this: will the market prospects for this country improve significantly inside the community of Asian countries, resulting in what we always particularly strive towards in development, that is, a regional market involving deliveries over relatively short distances?"
"The third question is about anti-personnel mines."
"The treaty says that the Commission will examine this problem."
"I would like to know what 'examining this problem' means."
"The fact is that up to now we have not managed to clear more mines each year than are laid."
"There is an enormous discrepancy here, and would be very pleased if this issue could be treated as a priority, rather than just taking small steps here and there."
"The last question that I would like to ask is this: what about the strength of the currency?"
"Are efforts being made and plans drawn up to gradually give the country a stable and less vulnerable currency, a convertible currency?"
"With an inflation rate of 20 %, even growth rates of 7 % look somewhat modest."
"Mr President, ASEAN is growing up fast and fraternal Europe has just started to notice this precocious, younger brother whose family ties to Europe, whether political, economic or cultural, are strengthening daily."
"Like good brothers, we need a sensible and constructive way of talking to each other and so I warmly welcome the Commission's communications and Parliament's rapporteurs for the fine reports that they have written."
"Take Europe's biggest project, EMU; a recent conference in Singapore highlighted the enormous trade, commercial and financial opportunities which will deepen between the two economic blocks once the Euro partners the dollar and the yen as a world reserve currency."
"Commissioner De Silguy's recent ASEAN visit highlights these exciting developments."
"Unfortunately, ASEAN's own recent financial wobbles may have obscured Mr De Silguy's message."
"As one Thai official put it, 'I am more worried about today's mark than tomorrow's Euro.' Doctor Mahathir's spat with George Soros about the threat to the Malaysian ringgit only serves to emphasize the interdependence of the world's financial markets, as if Baring Brothers of Singapore had not already thrown up warning signals enough."
"Political ties are also strengthening inside and outside ASEAN."
"The ASEAN ten must now deal with internal tensions, especially when such tensions spill over to contaminate relations with the EU."
"We have to find a voice, neither rasping nor sotto voce to raise concerns about the abuse of human and political rights throughout the region and especially in Burma."
"The British Government has made it clear that Burma would not be deemed a full participating Member of next year's ASEM meeting in London under the British Presidency."
"At the same time, we must acknowledge ASEAN's decision to incorporate Burma, as well as Laos, and eventually Cambodia into the full block."
"Cambodia's decline into political instability must surely prompt us into supporting any impetus towards democracy that rises in that troubled country."
"Let us hope that free and fair elections can be held with EU encouragement next May or November."
"For Vietnam, the EU cooperation agreement offers potent opportunities for lively but constructive dialogue."
"Just how will the first ever human rights call for an ASEAN country be interpreted in the case of Vietnam."
"It must surely be remiss of us to pass over the importance of countries like Malaysia and Indonesia in today's world."
"The world's fourth largest nation, Indonesia, still has to resolve its difficulties with Europe, including Portugal, over the question of East Timor."
"I hope that they can be sympathetic to Parliament's request to visit East Timor in an official EP delegation."
"We in turn, if visas are granted, should be prepared to report fairly and honestly all that we see and hear several years on now from the dreadful deaths of Deli."
"Finally, smog."
"El Niño and the slash-and-burn forestry clearance policies of Indonesia are a devastating cocktail."
"ASEAN countries cannot insulate themselves from the outside world, just as we in Europe and Britain cannot."
"When our friends and colleagues come next year to London, now miraculously free from its all-enveloping 19th century smog, let us hope that only the mist and mizzle of the 21st century stand between us and ASEAN in the development of our fraternal futures together."
"Thank you President."
"Mr President, I asked the Commissioner four questions, of which he answered two in his speech."
"I would also very much like to know if there are any definite plans regarding antipersonnel mines."
"What is the meaning of 'we will examine the problem' ?"
"My second question was whether measures are envisaged to stabilize the currency in Laos."
"I also asked the Commissioner a couple of questions;"
"I mentioned that the European Union had supported or set up an early warning system in Sumatra."
"This early warning system did not alert us quickly enough to the forest fires."
"Why did it not work?"
"I would be grateful for an answer to this question."
"I just think that this is important in the light of the current debate."
"Mr President, I also asked a question, albeit not at all explicit, which I should now like to repeat. If, as I have heard, a meeting of the ASEAN countries is to be held next year during the British Presidency and we could ask about Burma, if it would be acceptable to ASEAN to proceed by means of bilateral agreements where we had something to say about Burma."
"What did the Committee think of the other idea, namely not to accept ASEAN as a block but to negotiate separate cooperation agreements with the different countries? What is your position in this specific case, which could of course happen?"
"Mr President, my reply to the first question from Mrs Günther about anti-personnel mines, is that this is an urgent and fundamental matter in Cambodia, but not one of the aims of the cooperation agreement as such."
"It is a problem which exists in the area, but it is not part of the agreement."
"What are we doing about this problem?"
"Well, for some time now the European Union has had some very intensive programmes to rid Cambodia of mines, and we have been working very hard to try to resolve the problem."
"My opinion on anti-personnel mines is that their manufacture should be halted world-wide."
"In other words, there is no problem in this respect."
"Furthermore, I believe that the whole of the European Union thinks the same way."
"As for monetary stabilization, as you well know the Commission does not have financial powers, and unfortunately the euro still does not exist."
"Will the European Union be able to intervene the day the euro comes into existence?"
"You are asking me a question which I cannot answer."
"You know better than I that as yet the European Union has no external responsibility in financial matters."
"Perhaps from January 1, 1999, when the euro has responsibilities internally and externally, the European Union may perhaps be able to intervene by means of normal participation in the international financial institutions, for example the Asian Development Bank which is a World Bank regional bank."
"However, as things stand we do not have the means or the ability, not even internally."
"This is a debate for the future."
"If you want my opinion, I am in reasonable agreement with the views expressed by the Director General of the Fund, Mr Camdessus, in Hong Kong."
"Globalization is fine and so is free movement of capital, but there are of course certain objective limits which must be adjusted to make sure that the positive aspects of globalization do not turn into a powerful element of destabilization, particularly in those countries with the weakest economies."
"As for the fires in Sumatra, it was said that the early warning system did not work."
"I do not understand your question, Mr Telkämper."
"Mr President, another quick point of clarification."
"I had mentioned that it was worthwhile to support environmentally sustainable projects and, regarding human rights, to protect the peoples living in these forests."
"As far as I know, funding from the European Union was used to set up and support an early warning system for the Sumatra Kalimantan region, to prevent such fires, such disasters."
"In this case the Commission was very progressive and did something with a lasting effect."
"My question is why this European Union project did not work."
"If the question is too specific, Mr Commissioner, you can also let me have a written reply if necessary."
"Mr Telkämper, why do you say that it did not work?"
"Because there are now major forest fires, and in my intervention I asked if this was perhaps the result of liberalisation, with forests simply being burnt to clear land for the migration project, for rice cultivation, for new plantations."
"That was the question at the root of it."
"But, as I said, if that is too specific to answer now, you can also let me have a written reply."
"That is simple, Mr President."
"You say the system did not work, and I am asking you to explain why you think it did not work."
"If I want to prove to you that there is no light in this semicircle, I have to show you that we are sitting in the dark."
"Perhaps we are misunderstanding each other, but if the European Union supports a project, I assume that it is put into effect well technically and administratively speaking, and that it is intended to have a preventive function..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"I cannot remember Mr Dell'Alba's question."
"My friend Mr Telkämper always unsettles me politically, Mr President."
"Now I do not remember where I had got to."
"Mr Commissioner, you may answer in writing."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"EU-former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia cooperation agreement"
"The next item is the report (A4-0273/97) by Mr Pons Grau, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the proposal for a Council Decision concluding a Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (COM(96)533-8204/97 - C4-0305/97-96/305-96/0259 (AVC))."
"Mr President, I am speaking in support of this agreement on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, whose members supported it unanimously."
"The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is the only republic to emerge from the former Yugoslavia without bloodshed."
"This small country of two million inhabitants in the heart of the Balkans between Albania, SerbiaMontenegro, Bulgaria and Greece has had to face inter-ethnic tensions and difficult relations with its closest neighbours, the direct repercussions of which on its economy and its insertion into the international economy and international community have been negative in the extreme."
"However, more than six years on from the declaration of sovereignty, it is gradually beginning to emerge from the economic and international isolation in which it found itself thanks to a double embargo: the direct embargo imposed by Greece, and the indirect repercussions of the international community's embargo on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"Mr President, I am not going to spend much time on the problems which this Republic and the Greek people have both suffered - you know these much better than I do. But at the present time, the only major problem remaining is that of the Republic's name."
"Everything appears to indicate that this point will also be resolved shortly in the United Nations Security Council."
"Considering the country's economic and political circumstances, one success achieved by its government's current policies is inflation control, which has been carried out very decisively."
"At the same time however, on the minus side, it must be said that unemployment has reached a record level of 37 % in a short time, which shows that the economic measures have been very harsh."
"The key problem of the country's economy is how to raise levels of investment to modernize production structures, transport infrastructure and social infrastructure in an economic context characterized by very low levels of domestic saving, high interest rates and a heavy burden of public spending."
"Despite the positive changes seen in the Republic's economic situation, its economic future would appear to be completely conditional on the political uncertainties which characterize both the country's own domestic politics and those of its neighbours."
"The complexity of the situation is clearly revealed by the country's ethnic makeup: 65 % of the two million inhabitants are Macedonians, 22 % are Albanians, 4 % Turks, 2 % Serbs, and 4 % belong to other minorities."
"In fact, the principle threat to the country's stability lies in the treatment of the problem of the Albanian minority."
"As regards the content of the cooperation agreement, it is similar to the one signed with Slovenia in 1993."
"It is a framework trade and cooperation agreement, preferential and susceptible of further development."
"The democratic basis of cooperation constitutes an essential part of the agreement."
"There is also a joint declaration which will permit: the establishment of a regular political dialogue; the reinforcement of democratic principles and institutions as well as respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities; and the Republic's full integration into the community of democratic nations."
"Meetings and contacts are provided for at ministerial, technical and parliamentary level, and the joint declaration also envisages the possibility of organizing political dialogue as regional dialogue."
"The trade arrangements are the usual ones in such cases: provisions concerning rules of origin; intellectual, industrial and commercial property; anti-dumping procedures and subsidies; safeguard measures required for infant industries and for difficulties with regard to trade and balance of payment; and provisions for consultation within the Cooperation Council."
"We think this cooperation agreement is of enormous value, for reasons of politics more than of economics."
"Therefore, the Committee on External Economic Relations thinks that in this region troubled by continuous political, economic and even military problems, which have gone so far as to affect the development of the European Union, it is politically important that we should support this cooperation agreement."
"Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy has voted in favour of signing the cooperation agreement between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"To the economic reasons stated by Mr Pons Grau, I should like to add the considerations of a more strictly political nature advanced by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"Over the past few years Macedonia has managed to achieve independence without the terrible tragedies that accompanied the independence of the other regions of former Yugoslavia and the European Union will have to do everything in its power to sustain the continuing economic transformation of Macedonia and consolidate its democratic life."
"In our judgement it would be very useful for the European Union to have its own delegation in Skopje to monitor carefully and from close at hand the development of this democratic experience."
"In commending to the House approval of this agreement, which we consider to be of great political importance, we consider it incumbent upon us to call on the Macedonian government to monitor carefully the situation with regard to its minorities and the situation with regard to civil rights in general. Macedonia has a population which is complex in its ethnic origins and this government must show a high degree of respect for the complexity of the situation over which it governs."
"With this opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, we move that this House should vote in favour."
"Mr President, first of all please allow me to take a few moments to say that having seen Mr Telkämper and Vice-President Marín confer I hope to have, at least in writing, the reply I was expecting to my previous question."
"As the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets I should like to say that our committee also voted in favour of enabling us to go ahead with this agreement."
"This effort is very important."
"This issue has three essential elements: Parliament has already accepted macroeconomic aid to ease the country's balance of payments situation."
"Now, with this agreement, and therefore with all the elements of technical, financial and commercial cooperation, we are doing something important and significant for the Republic of Macedonia."
"From this point of view, the aspect of the financial protocol is significant: 150 million ECU from the BEI, guaranteed by the community budget."
"We have asked, and duly received from the Commission, estimates as to the financial implications. The Committee on Budgets now confirms the favourable assessment given to this agreement."
"I take the liberty of making a small point with regard to financial cooperation: the rapporteur believes that recycling is in conflict with other methods, with a different policy in relation to drugs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the concluding of a cooperation agreement between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, together with the finance protocol and the agreement on transport, is indeed of great political value since it will make a vital contribution to the economic development of this small Balkan state, to the restructuring of its industry, the rekindling of its commercial dealings, and the promotion of more stable and balanced relations with neighbouring countries."
"It must be emphasized, however, that the agreement comprises a special provision and gives particular importance to social development and social rights, which is an innovative aspect of this agreement."
"It is a fact that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as demonstrated in the debates that took place in the Interparliamentary Assembly yesterday and the day before yesterday, has made great efforts to modernize and to strengthen the competitiveness of its economy, and also to gradually adapt its infrastructures to the European models and indeed, as is well known, under particularly difficult conditions and at a difficult historical juncture."
"Following its interim agreement with Greece, the economic activities across its southern borders take on even greater significance."
"Greece is the Community state with the greatest amount of exports to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the third as regards the totality of its commercial dealings."
"The development of road networks that is provided for by the agreement is expected to further facilitate the development of economic relations and an increase in the volume of reciprocal trade."
"The cooperation agreement is expected, among other things, to facilitate political dialogue on the consolidation of democratic institutions, respect for human rights, including the rights of minorities, and the promotion of security, peace and stability throughout the whole of Europe, and, more especially, in this sensitive region of the Balkans."
"Closer ties between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the European Union must be given support."
"The country has a pro-European parliament and a government which recognises the importance of good regional cooperation."
"Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, if you would allow me, as someone from a country which is of course a signatory to this agreement, Greece, to express my desire and my wish to break down the final barrier to relations between the two countries by finding a viable and dignified solution, which is acceptable to both sides, to the problem of the international name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a solution that will respect the sensitivities of both countries."
"In addition, I also would like to support the request of this country for the creation of a European Union office in Skopje."
"Mr President, as a Czech Bishop from Northern Bohemia used to say, to love one's neighbour would be a wonderful thing, if only the neighbour did not live so terribly close! That is exactly the problem with Macedonia."
"Macedonia is a small country with various neighbours and a very complicated history, and it has repeatedly been in danger of being overwhelmed by this history."
"So we will be all the happier both now and in the future if our Parliament says yes to this agreement, which will represent a breakthrough in accepting this country into the community of Europeans, a country which has contributed a great deal to our history and culture, and will also make a great contribution to the future of Europe."
"Nevertheless, the problems remain acute."
"We only have to think, as my colleague Mr Pons Grau has mentioned, about the problems of the ethnic Albanians in Macedonia, but who mentions the fact that this is directly connected with the Kosovo problem, the fact that the oppression of Kosovo led to the extremely difficult situation at the Albanian University in Tetovo in Macedonia? This is just one example that demonstrates how various different issues are closely interwoven in this region."
"Therefore we owe it to this country to offer it unambiguous support on the path to Europe, and above all we must make sure that the freedom and independence of this country are safeguarded."
"We have talked about Asia today, and quite rightly so, but it would be a pity if we talked about Asia without being able to solve elementary European problems."
"The country of Macedonia would not even exist today if the United States of America had not begun to defend that country's independence in the face of possible Serbian aggression."
"When one considers the forces currently involved in taking over power in Serbia, it is a question of out of the frying pan, into the fire, and there is a risk of renewed massive conflict."
"It is therefore high time that we concluded this trade and cooperation agreement after years of blockade."
"We must support the forces of democracy in this country."
"We should not reproach this country for failings in the reform process, because logic dictates that when there is external pressure it is incredibly difficult to carry out internal reforms at the same time."
"For that reason it is impressive that reform has taken place to such an amazing extent at all, but we need to intensify the process."
"Above all, we need to agree that the next stage, that is an association agreement and Europe agreement, should follow as quickly as possible."
"Slovenia needed three years to take this step, and I believe that Macedonia should not have to wait any longer."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, my colleague Mr Posselt has already suggested that this agreement will be just one step into the future for Macedonia. I would like to add how pleased I am that this cooperation agreement with Macedonia has fallen on such fertile soil in this Parliament."
"First of all, I would of course like to thank Mr Pons Grau very warmly for his report."
"Macedonia is a country that has gone through a lot in recent years, a country that has managed to free itself from a very difficult hold, which many other countries in a similar situation did not succeed in doing - we only have to think of the fate of Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example."
"I believe that this country therefore deserves our support."
"So I would also like to stress how delighted I am that a few weeks ago, when we were discussing macro-economic aid for Macedonia, this Parliament changed its spots and agreed to this aid, although there had not been a corresponding debate either in committee or in this House, and displayed enormous confidence, quite rightly in my opinion."
"I believe that we in the European Union occupy a significant position, when one considers who Macedonia's traditional trading partners are today."
"These are first Bulgaria, followed by the remains of Yugoslavia and then by Russia."
"But if we take a look at the map now, and I often have the feeling we do not do that often enough, we can see that Macedonia really is a key country in the Balkans."
"For that reason, we must promote overall transport links."
"Macedonia is situated almost in the European Union, if you can envisage the route from Greece to Austria or Germany."
"This infrastructure needs to be built up both for the sake of this country and also to provide adequate links for the European Union."
"I honestly believe that we have a great obligation towards this country."
"It is almost a moral obligation, if you consider the geography, if you consider what this country has been through."
"Once again, I am pleased that this report has been received so positively by this Parliament, and I hope that it will continue on the path determined for it."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pons Grau for his excellent report and tell him that the Commission shares his opinion that the cooperation agreement is of supreme importance for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the development of its relations with the Community. This is because it includes a system of trade preferences, a financial protocol and political dialogue (based on a separate declaration) which sets in motion relations which are unquestionably important for the future of this country, not just within its own region but also of course in its relations with the European Union."
"Furthermore, together with the separate transport agreement, the cooperation agreement will greatly promote stability and cooperation in the region."
"The Commission also goes along with the general opinion expressed by the speakers, that this cooperation agreement is a first step of great political significance which, in the final analysis, is far more important than its economic value."
"Because of this importance, the Commission hopes that the Council will approve without delay the decision to bring in the cooperation agreement and the transport agreement, so that it can come into force on 1 December 1997 at the latest."
"The Macedonian Government is still applying its policy of economic and political reforms, but we all know that it is faced with difficult economic and social problems such as low economic growth and, of course, high unemployment as a result."
"As well as the normal financial aid under the Phare programme - ECU 15 million directly from the Phare programme and ECU 10 million for transfrontier cooperation with Greece - a further ECU 8 million has recently been made available to the country."
"There will be no difficulty in absorbing these funds, which will be used to promote projects which have priority under the existing multiannual indicative programme for 1996-1999 - namely, those involving SMEs, public investment aid, and the Tempus education programme."
"Similarly, the Commission is studying how the Phare programme can help to improve inter-ethnic relations, which constitute one of the most complex aspects of the domestic political situation."
"Finally, the Commission would like to express its appreciation of the European Parliament's initiatives to develop contacts with the Macedonian Parliament."
"Such contacts are an important focus for increasingly close relations also between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"Therefore, the Commission would be very pleased if this political dialogue between the European Parliament and the Macedonian Parliament could be developed and strengthened even further."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"The Union for Europe Group, of which I am a member, initiated a peace mission last week to Angola."
"We received visas to visit Angola and the purpose of the visit was purely peaceful to try to ensure that both sides were fully involved in implementation of the Lusaka Accords."
"Unfortunately, when we arrived in Lisbon, our visas were cancelled by the Angolan Ambassador to Portugal."
"It seems to me that if a vice-president of the ACP Joint Assembly and Mrs van Bladel, a vice-chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights and five members of the Portuguese Parliament are prevented from visiting Angola, there is something radically wrong in that region."
"I would ask you, Mr President, on behalf of the third largest group in this Parliament to protest at the treatment meted out to Members of the European Parliament by the Angolan Government."
"There has to be two sides, Unita and MPLA, implementing the Lusaka Accords to have a solution in Angola and the tension in the region."
"We all felt it was a challenge to the legitimacy of the Angolan Government that we were treated in this manner."
"I would ask you to write to the Angolan Ambassador to the European Union in Brussels for an explanation of why we were prevented from visiting Angola at the very last moment."
"Thank you very much, Mr Andrews."
"Not only will your comment be recorded in the Minutes as the Rules stipulate, but I have also made a note of it, as President of this sitting, and I will ensure that it is brought to the attention of Parliament's President ."
"EU-ACP relations for the 21st Century"
"The next item is the report (A4-0274/97) by Mr Martens, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Commission's Green Paper on relations between the European Union and the ACP countries on the eve of the 21st Century - Challenges and options for a new partnership (COM(96)0570 - C4-0639/96)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot go into the detail of this complicated subject here, but I shall attempt to give you the gist of my report on the Commission's Green Paper on relations between the European Union and the ACP countries on the eve of the 21st Century - challenges and options for a new partnership."
"I should first of all like to say that I have endeavoured to make the draft resolution a real consensus from the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"I should like to thank the chairman of the committee, Michel Rocard, and all my colleagues."
"If I oppose certain amendments then it is only because they risk damaging the coherence of the resolution."
"First of all I wish to say that together with my colleagues on the committee, I have tried to draw up a political balance sheet for the Lomé Convention."
"Therefore in the first place I have asked the question of whether there is any sense in continuing the cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries."
"This agreement is over 20 years old."
"It expires on 29 February in the year 2000."
"It has not been spared criticism and many are unsatisfied when they draw up the balance."
"Therefore we must think about the existence of the ties that the European Union has with the ACP countries, that is to say, the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific with which we have this agreement."
"My reply and that of the committee to this first fundamental question is clear and unambiguous."
"We must continue the cooperation with the ACP countries, not only out of solidarity with our ACP partners or because of our own interests, but also because as the resolution states, the spirit and the policy of Lomé are essential elements of the political identity of the European Union."
"We came to the decision that the development policy and, more specifically, the Lomé Convention are vital in the organization and regulation of the world economy."
"We also wish to continue the cooperation without damaging the coherence and solidarity of the ACP group."
"Therefore we are convinced that in principle the composition of the ACP group can only be expanded or changed with the approval of the ACP countries."
"Continue the cooperation but also adapt it, renew the agreement and give it a new basis."
"We must fully integrate the political dimension into the new agreement."
"For a long time cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries was mainly economic."
"Europe itself was still limited to the common market and there was the conviction that you could separate the economic from the political."
"Experience has shown the opposite."
"In order to achieve the objectives of the Lomé Convention, we must take account of all the elements of development policy and we must fully accept the political dimension."
"In this regard your Committee is drawing up a series of impressive proposals."
"The second great idea that you can find in our proposals and which runs like a thread through them is that we must get closer to the people, the men and women who are active in the field."
"This means development cooperation must be undertaken by large groups of our fellow citizens."
"For a very long time on both sides cooperation remained the priority of a few."
"Therefore new players must be attracted both to the decision-making and to the implementation."
"An important task has been set aside for the many organizations in civil society: local authorities, the private sector, universities, trade unions, non-governmental organizations, young people."
"The role of women is discussed in great detail in this report."
"The third thrust that we recommend is that of a drastic simplification of a cooperation which has become extremely complex over the years through additions and enrichment and is getting more difficult to implement all the time."
"Here too, we make concrete proposals which accord with the ideas in the Green Paper to a great extent."
"The fourth idea is that the new partnership be characterized through the appropriation of the cooperation by the people which requires transparency and accessibility."
"But this new partnership must also be aware of the people's needs."
"The priority objective is combatting poverty."
"By the year 2015 the resolution states that we wish to reduce poverty by one half in the ACP countries."
"The protection of the environment must also form an integral part of all policy measures."
"The originality of the Lomé Convention is in fact this concept of partnership that saw the light of day 20 years ago and today is recognized by everyone and also accepted by the OECD and the G8."
"We must maintain and renew in this partnership the fundamental achievement of cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries and the Joint Assembly also plays an important part here."
"Finally, I should like to express a word of thanks."
"I thank the European Commission and in particular Commissioner Pinheiro."
"The Green Paper has stimulated a broad debate in the European Union."
"We can state today that the future of cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries has already been amended and renewed."
"I should also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Mr Rocard and all my colleagues."
"I would also mention the members of the Committee on Development and Cooperation here in this Parliament who have assisted with great skill and efficiency in drawing up this report."
"Mr President, the subject of future relations between the European Union and the ACP countries is an essential part of the Union's future external relations and a fundamental part of cooperation policies aimed at development. It is also an important element in defining the internal aspect of the process of European integration."
"The European Commission has done well to launch a thorough debate over the past few months which has already involved thousands of participants, both from the institutions and society in general."
"Now it is up to the European Parliament to state its views before the Commission's negotiating mandate to discuss the future of the agreement with the ACP countries is worked out."
"In my opinion, over twenty years' experience of the Lomé Convention has essentially shown two things: the first is that the principles of a global, even-handed, contractual agreement based on partnership are still valid today and that in the new reality of a world which is even more globalized and interdependent they must therefore be put into practice more vigorously and coherently; the second is that many of the practical mechanisms and the priorities of our cooperation on development must be changed to make them more efficient and appropriate to the current needs of countries in which a headlong rush towards modernity and underdevelopment live together in an increasingly conflicting manner."
"We must therefore speak our mind very forcefully to make sure that there is a 5th Lomé Convention, even before the year 2000, based on the same geographical limits and the same essential principles as the convention currently in force, but with a far-reaching reorientation of its content."
"Based on this, however, there must be a new awareness on the part of the European Union that the development of relations with the ACP countries represents a strategic option, which is to the benefit of all the contracting parties, of facing the challenges of globalization together."
"European cooperation on development must therefore cease to be on the political sidelines and must become an essential part of our foreign policy and contribute to a reorientation of our strategic options."
"The ACP countries in general, and the African countries in particular, have undergone an intense process of marginalization which has forced them, with one or two exceptions, towards a more severe state of underdevelopment."
"Fighting poverty and helping the poorest countries to become part of the international system must therefore become two sides of the same coin."
"To do this it is necessary to give top priority to the objectives of sustainable human development based on the appropriation by the poorest countries of the means of development through the exploitation of their human resources."
"Together with the ACP countries the Union must therefore contribute to a redefinition of the mechanisms governing international relations."
"On this not only depends the future of hundreds of millions of people in the ACP countries but also the possibility of the European Union becoming an effective and efficient player on the international scene, capable of furthering the cause of equality, justice and prosperity in all parts of the world."
"Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Martens on his excellent report."
"It is excellent because it provides a broad vision of the relationship between the European Union and the third world and also excellent because the report above all also shows an understanding of the difficult position in which many developing countries find themselves."
"The rapporteur did not let himself be drawn into the fashionable criticism of our relationship with the third world."
"A number of constructive proposals have been placed on the table here in order to improve and streamline the relationship and to adjust to the modern period of globalization, renewed trading relations and development of civil society."
"In this connection I wish to make a few remarks in order to underline our vision once more."
"My first comment concerns regionalization."
"Many third-world countries with which we cooperate, as far as their trade is concerned, are very dependent upon Europe and the large trading blocks."
"Their infrastructure with regard to exports is mainly geared towards the coast and the links between the countries themselves, even neighbouring countries, are often much worse."
"I would stress here that the building up of a successful economy is often primarily geared to the domestic market, then to the market of the neighbouring country and only then to distant overseas markets."
"It is therefore very important to encourage the building up of cross-border regional cooperation."
"In my view that is an important point in the new Lomé V."
"A second remark concerns democratization and the protection of human rights and the rights of minorities."
"Several times progress that has been made with great effort, has been lost because small groups sought power, internal wars have broken out and corruption has occurred on a grand scale."
"I feel it is especially important to stipulate better terms and to monitor them more closely."
"It is also important in this context that preventive diplomacy be given more of a chance, as Mr Rocard already said earlier in a report."
"My third comment concerns civil society."
"I cannot stress strongly enough that countries cannot only develop on the basis of governments and business; social organizations also play a key part in building up a society."
"That is of especially great importance and I am pleased that Mr Martens has stressed that and that it will also be given an important place in the new structure of Lomé V."
"Finally, I would make a comment on the OCTs, the overseas countries and territories."
"Many of them are among the ACP countries, but the relationship with the European Union and the ACP countries is particularly complicated."
"I would call upon Commissioner Pinheiro to submit the OCT decisions as quickly as possible and to ensure that the relationship between the OCTs, the ACP countries and the European Union also improves and does not lead to havoc as was the case, amongst others, with the rice dispute."
"That is a painful matter that must also be placed on the table within the context of this discussion."
"Mr President, Mr Martens has undertaken some excellent work."
"Enough leads have been given for renewal up to Lomé V. We want a Lomé V, let that be understood, but it must be a good Lomé V that follows the lines that have been brought out so clearly in Mr Martens' excellent report."
"Mr President, the Lomé Convention is a first-rate model of cooperation which, despite its imperfections, is now preparing to enter the third millennium."
"The various problems raised, studied and dealt with in the Commission's Green Paper, along with the worthy contribution of the Committee on Development and Cooperation - here I would like to pay tribute to our rapporteur - have led to the drafting of this motion for a resolution, in which Parliament's desire to see the birth of a Lomé V, whose main objective would be the plugging of gaps in our cooperation, is clearly highlighted."
"We all know that globalization of the economy leads to social disparities and thus development aid, which is the premise on which the Lomé Convention is based, should be an instrument of economic regularization for a better distribution of the wealth of this planet."
"This new alliance which is emerging between the ACP countries and the European Union must be approached in a global and coordinated way, taking into consideration the disparate interventions of Member States in development cooperation policy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, only cooperation between the European Union and its Member States around an efficient development aid policy can enable the ACP countries to integrate progressively into the world economy."
"While the wider principles which governed the drafting of the Lomé Convention in 1975, its contractual character, partnership, security, forward planning must be maintained, it is also desirable that more appropriate and substantial means be made available by the European Union in order to satisfy the real needs that are appearing in the negotiations."
"Thus, for example, the incorporation of the EDF into the European Union's budget becomes a legal obligation, designed to ensure a permanent and reasonable level of resources, and a greater involvement of our Parliament in their management."
"Furthermore, the reconciliation of the European Union's duty of solidarity towards countries once subject to European colonization, and the safeguarding of our commercial interests through partnership with the ACP countries, which is also a legal obligation, are above all moral duties that we all share."
"Quite clearly, no progress is possible, no advances will be made, if free trade remains the only vehicle of international commerce."
"Quite clearly, the question mark over the banana COM actually serves to confirm and consolidate our convictions in this area."
"Finally, I would like to stress the need to take into consideration the dimension of regional integration and decentralized cooperation, through the implementation of legal mechanisms and adequate means enabling the development of concrete relations between, above all, the ACP countries and certain ultraperipheral regions of the European Union."
"Mr President, I too would like to join those who have been praising the good work done by the honourable Member, Mr Martens, and it precisely for this reason that I shall be dwelling on two criticisms of the report he has presented to this House."
"The first point concerns paragraph 9, third indent, where Mr Martens wants contracts to replace the unmanageable accumulation of multiple conditionalities."
"I and my group agree with the need to reduce the number of conditionalities but at the same time it must be stressed, forcefully, at the same time that the instrument of conditionality is the best way to make sure that the country sets out on the road to democracy and respect for human rights."
"This is why I and my group believe that this replacement of the accumulation of conditionalities by contracts cannot fail to be conditional on the fact that the affected countries have to respect human rights and the principles of democracy."
"The same criticism applies to paragraph 83, where it is stated that the principles established by the World Trade Organization could be waived for developing countries."
"If we believe in the principles of a liberal, free-market economy on which the European Union is based, the only way we can state this is solely and exclusively on condition of achieving the predetermined objectives."
"Once a developing country is able to stand on its own two feet, we do not see why the principles established by that organization should be waived."
"That is the significance of two amendments we have proposed and we seek to uphold them before this House."
"Mr President, within the framework of economic globalization and at a time when unfortunately there is decreased development cooperation in many countries, it is more important than ever for the European Union to confirm its political, economic and financial commitment to the 70 ACP countries. This is the very least it is obliged to do for the sake of international solidarity."
"From our point of view, it is essential to use the Lomé V debate to consider some vital questions."
"Firstly, we must promote greater consistency in provisions for development cooperation and in other policy sectors, especially trade."
"In this respect, we must bear in mind the regrettable and negative example of the cocoa directive."
"Secondly, the European Union's message must be that the ACP countries cannot be strictly bound by WTO rulings, because these countries are not able to compete on equal terms with countries which are more developed economically and industrially."
"In this respect, it is essential that ACP policy should retain those provisions which guarantee the ACP countries a presence in exports to European countries, by means of preference systems."
"Doubtless this point brings to mind the example of the banana, which was also negative."
"There can be no doubt that political dialogue with the ACP countries must be strengthened, and that we should move from a system of aid and cooperation to one based principally on political partnership."
"It is a unique frame of reference for the Union's specific political aims of cooperation with the ACP countries. However, other provisions could also be made, to promote subregional cooperation and integration."
"Mr President. Mr, Martens has presented here a report which will find the support of a broad majority, simply because he has also provided for a broad dialogue between the political Parties."
"That is similar to what was done earlier by Mr Pinheiro, who visited the capitals of Member States to form a view on the continuation of the Parity Meeting, the relationship between the ACP and the EU. It is as a result of this dialogue that we on the European side can arrive at a clear position."
"What is missing, in my view, is a completely clear declaration by the ACP side on what their concepts are, and what their demands are."
"We can but say that this was a special programme."
"It should also remain special programme."
"This concerns the poorest of the poor and it is, therefore, a basic requirement that we on the European side also have a concept of a programme where..."
"(The President interrupted the speaker.) I do not think we should operate a policy of divide and rule, dividing the future of the ACP into A, C and P. Just because they are the poorest countries they must be able to stand together opposite us and maintain a dialogue line representing the south."
"The instruments we had formerly, such as Stabex for price stabilization, were important ones in enabling emergence from the dependence of colonialism."
"In view of the experience we have gathered, however, they must be revised, because they often continued to support a monoculture."
"Scientists have produced models for us here, and I think we should put them to use."
"From a development policy standpoint it is not acceptable to believe, as Mr Fassa has said, that these countries can develop within a WTO framework and keep pace with industrialized nations or the World market. Experience contradicts that."
"We need protection for the poorer countries so that they can first catch up in development."
"What is still missing is the inclusion of women in development."
"In these countries they are often the main people who contribute to the development process."
"What we need above all - and for me this was not sufficiently emphasized in Mr Martens' report - is the Parity Conference."
"The history of relationships is a history of partnership, and we must maintain this partnership."
"For this reason we need a place for political dialogue, for mutual discussion. That was the special thing about the Lomé Convention, and we should advocate it in the future."
"In short, we need a fifth agreement in principle, so that this story can be continued towards development, and not towards constriction within industrialization; so that structures change; so that we also obtain the budget here; so that this Parliament participates in the whole process; and above all, so that changes occur in these countries, so that a democratic development like that of the European Union can take place, and so that human rights are respected."
"Those must be the main essentials of the new agreement."
"Mr Martens has described that, so we shall support this report."
"Mr President, in its Green Paper, the European Commission rightly states that the balance of Lomé is moderate."
"Despite the trade preferences, the share of the ACP countries of the internal market of the Union has fallen from 6.7 % in 1975 to 3.7 % in 1994."
"Sysmin and Stabex have not contributed to the diversification of the exports of the ACP countries."
"Project aid has not helped their prosperity."
"My greatest objection to Mr Martens' resolution is that, despite its length, it completely ignores the Commission's analysis."
"The resolution stresses the basic principles of the Lomé Convention as partnership, predictability and certainty."
"However noble these principles may be, they have not brought about any improvement in the situation of the ACP countries after some 20 years."
"Continuing more or less in the same way, as the rapporteur proposes, is not in the interests of the ACP countries."
"Therefore on the final vote I shall be voting against the resolution."
"That does not alter the fact that I can agree with many paragraphs of the resolution."
"In particular I wholeheartedly support paragraph 20 on decentralized cooperation and paragraph 43 on the strengthening of trade cooperation and the elimination of the residual obstacles."
"However, I do object greatly to paragraph 80 in which it is regretted that development cooperation has not been further ""communitarized' ."
"In my view, the Member States must hold the responsibility for the development policy."
"Therefore I feel that the permanent political dialogue proposed by the European Commission goes much too far."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the summit of the ACP Heads of State which is due to take place in Libreville, it is now necessary for Parliament to give them a very strong political signal."
"My group, the European Radical Alliance, is convinced of the absolute need to maintain the framework of reference of the Lomé Convention by revitalizing its content."
"We are therefore in complete agreement with the rapporteur, whose remarkable work will, I hope, be able to convince not only the Council, the Commission and our ACP partners but also all the citizens of Europe, of the need for a 5th Lomé Convention."
"Let me remind you of a few essential points."
"We must fight against the loss of interest in development aid and against the so-called crisis of legitimacy which it is suffering."
"There are still shared interests between the countries of the Union and the developing world."
"We must also fight against the tendency towards renationalization of development cooperation policies."
"The European Union must remain the crucible of public development aid, for it is a privileged partner able to stand up to the Americans and the Asians."
"Similarly, we must make sure that the enlargement of the European Union is not used as a pretext to divert the Union away from pre-existing forms of solidarity, notably with the ACP countries."
"On this basis, we must set out to reorganize ACP-European Union cooperation within the framework of a responsible partnership."
"We must, nevertheless, take care that this partnership is a truly balanced one and that it is not once more directed towards solely satisfying European concerns."
"This partnership creates duties for us: the democratization process, human resource training, the development of localized and lasting economic structures."
"With this in mind, we note with interest and satisfaction that Togo, the host country of the Lomé Convention, is now combining a growth rate of 6 % per year with a positive and rapid development of its democratic institutions."
"It is a strong and encouraging sign for the next ACP-EU Joint Assembly which will take place at the end of October."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a supporter, not of a Europe of fusion and confusion but of a confederal Europe which respects the freedom and sovereignty of our peoples, you will not be surprised when I say that we do not approve of all of the spirit of the Green Paper nor the report by Mr Martens."
"We are, of course, agreed on the wishes and general principles, the partnership and the call for participation from all of the population."
"But we do not think that a globalizing vision, as somehow key to relationships between blocks, is satisfactory."
"We approve of exchange rate regulation, of course, but with regard to concrete development aid, to agriculture, industry, health, housing, we think flexible coordination is called for, rather than a centralized organization."
"Indeed, our countries have woven links with the countries of Africa, a past, a history, lessons of experience."
"France can work best with Senegal, the Ivory Coast or Togo, as Portugal probably can with Angola or Mozambique."
"I fear that in the area of development as well, people continue to pay a high price for ideological constructivism."
"Mr President, I have the honour of being the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"It is a shame that the tight agenda has not allowed the Committee on Development and Cooperation to take this opinion into consideration."
"I therefore ask, ladies and gentlemen, that you give it the necessary attention today."
"The Commission's Green Paper has the quality of presenting us with interesting trains of thought on new forms of cooperation with our ACP partners."
"It reflects the clear desire to perpetuate cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries."
"But some of the options envisaged could be dangerous, in the long run, for the very existence of the ACP-EU partnership."
"Just as does Mr Martens, who - in passing - I congratulate very sincerely for his excellent work, I and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development plead for the maintenance and deepening of ACP-EU relations."
"Whatever may be said, we must not forget that the Lomé Convention is the most advanced model of cooperation and development."
"What it brings, both for the ACP countries and for the European Union, is far from negligible."
"Today, the European Parliament is called, as has already been said, to give a strong political signal to the future negotiators."
"We want the cooperation between the EU and the ACP countries to be renewed, on the basis of a partnership in which the political dimension must be strengthened and which must link the populations more closely into the process of development cooperation."
"But this model of development cooperation is nowadays torn between, on the one hand, a growing globalization of trade and, on the other, the constraints of a European Union in the making, prompted by an inevitable opening up to the European continent."
"However, it seems to me out of the question that the European Union should challenge existing and deep forms of solidarity."
"This is particularly true in terms of agricultural issues."
"For this reason, it is a shame that agriculture and rural development have not been truly taken into consideration in this Green Paper."
"It does not take long to recognize that agricultural questions are at the heart both of the development process in most of the ACP countries and trading relations."
"Since the last Lomé Convention, agricultural trade has dominated our relations with these countries."
"But in spite of this I do not mean to say that the results have always lived up to their hopes and our expectations."
"And I do not mean to underestimate the pernicious effects caused by the erroneous functioning of the preferential trade mechanism, nor the situations of dependency that they have created."
"It is indeed for this reason that greater importance must be accorded to agricultural issues."
"If we want to put an end to situations of dependency, if you want to strive for self-sufficiency in national and regional markets, if you want to ease the integration of ACP countries into world markets, then the European Union must face up to its responsibilities, both domestic and international."
"To be efficient, cooperation policy must be integrated into other policies."
"For example, the CAP reforms must take account of the commitments the Union has made to 70 ACP countries."
"Similarly, the European Union has a duty to defend existing solidarity in the international arena, and quite obviously I am thinking of the World Trade Organization here."
"The sad banana affair reminds us that it is easy to slip on the excesses of liberalism."
"The European Union must protect its commitments."
"I am, for example, in favour of maintaining preferential mechanisms, as long as they contribute to efforts to diversify agricultural production, which is the only way of putting an end to dangerous dependency."
"Let me finish by saying that beyond the redefinition of agricultural trading relations, a balanced EU-ACP relationship must enable the stimulation of rural development, the true engine of the socio-economic development process, ensuring economic diversity in rural areas, enabling effective participation of local populations, enabling the creation of dynamics and regional and inter-regional synergies, and ensuring, at the end of the day, the food security of the regions concerned as well as the sustainable use of natural resources."
"These, ladies and gentlemen, are the directions which it is essential to take if we truly want to revitalize our relationship with our ACP partners."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Barthet-Mayer."
"I have two general requests from the Presidency to the House."
"Firstly, that in preparing their speeches, honourable Members should try to respect the time allotted to them by their groups."
"I know how difficult it is to put across such important messages in such a short time."
"However, when you repeatedly overrun, there is not enough time left for us to complete the agenda."
"Secondly, despite the short time available to you, please speak slowly because otherwise the already difficult work of interpretation is made even harder."
"I constantly receive complaints from the interpretation booths about how difficult it is for the interpreters to follow our speeches."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you know I never stop you from speaking. All I do is tell you - perhaps emphatically - when your time is up."
"I beg you to exercise some self-control please, so that we can do our work properly."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that comment was not directed at any one person in particular. Now that I have made it, Mr Rocard has the floor for two minutes."
"Mr President, Mr Martens has presented a report of exceptional quality."
"This report is a credit to Parliament as well as a useful tool for the Commission and for the negotiations."
"Thank you!"
"The report has two virtues: the strength of its language and convictions and a willingness to add to the courses plotted with many amendments and further detail, which gives the overall resolution a strongly innovative character."
"I hope the virtual unanimity in our committee heralds virtual unanimity in this Parliament to maintain a convention, to confirm that the geographic field must not change except at the request of the ACP countries, and to insist that, beyond the economic aspect, the main innovation we can expect will relate to the political aspect, absent until now from the first four conventions."
"This is aimed at support for training and democratic structures."
"This is aimed at integration - there is even an amendment which will surprise you by its technical nature but which is important in the prevention of crises and conflict resolution."
"This even aims at measures of solidarity, interafrican probably, of encouragement and monitoring of good governance."
"If the ACP countries are in agreement amongst themselves, the ideas we bring will be important."
"In economic terms we are naturally less innovative, but all the same may I remind you first of all of the importance of restoring all its power to Sysmin, our assistance to infrastructure in a market which is becoming more standardized, and above all the very new aspect, the recognition of a people's economy, which should no longer be called informal so as not to confuse it with drugs and delinquence, for the small scale grass roots economy is the very heart of development."
"When we speak, Mrs Barthet-Mayer, of the rural world, this is what we have in mind, and I think you have forgotten that."
"Lastly, Mr President, and I will finish on this note, perhaps the newest aspect of the report is the desire to move away from direct development aid towards a releasing of the brakes, by getting rid of the obstacles to development."
"Firstly we have to put an end to the intellectual plundering of Africa and protect the rare patents and licences and their new products, avoiding the appropriation of their intellectual property by multinationals from the developed world."
"Secondly we need to underline the necessity of regional integration as an aid to development."
"Thirdly we need to speculate in decentralized cooperation by stressing, Mr Commissioner, the fact that in decentralized cooperation local communities are not treated as NGOs, but as a different category."
"Finally, and this is my last point, we stress the emergence of this new and very hopeful concept of micro-credit."
"Banking consisting of tiny loans, based on trust in a small group, but without material guarantees."
"It is another world. Here is the way out of poverty."
"We are proud that this report incorporates so many innovations."
"Mr President, the report by our group leader, Mr Martens, who has the constant support for the Group of the European People's Party, is the mirror image of our years of experience in the Europe Parliament of development co-operation, not only in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, but also in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly."
"This report, which has wide-ranging consequences, is an expression of the consensus in the European Parliament, and I therefore ask Commissioner Pinheiro to include the main elements of it in the next mandate proposal for talks with the ACP countries."
"We are very interested in that."
"Let me extract three key elements of Mr Martens' report."
"Firstly, we want to see a partnership - preferably with the democracies amongst the ACP countries and with those countries that have resolutely and irrevocably taken the path to democracy, constitutional government and human rights, and who are successfully creating it by positive efforts in Government and Parliament."
"It is inconceivable to us that this cooperation should stretch to include corrupt dictators."
"These dictators should not even play a further role now in the negotiation of a new agreement."
"Secondly, the African continent should be the main objective of our mutual development work."
"The policy of good neighbourliness, the geographic proximity of Africa, the historic responsibility of European countries, but also the only modest achievements of our partnership, all are a special challenge for the improvement of our instruments and for the strengthening of a broadly based cooperation."
"Africa is the most backward continent in the world in terms of the development of its economy, society and democratic structures."
"A new impetus to our relationship is therefore essential."
"Thirdly, having an ACP development policy as part of the global development strategy means that we must also check our instruments for cooperation with Caribbean and Pacific countries."
"The poorest developing countries, who are neighbours of our partners in the Caribbean and Pacific, must also be able to participate in permanent economic and social development."
"We ask the Commission to consider whether a corresponding framing of the general preferences could not be undertaken on behalf of those poorest developing nations in Central and South America and Southeast Asia who are neighbours of our Caribbean and Pacific partners. Or perhaps the European Union could create additional instruments, within the framework of existing resources, which could reach beyond the geographic base of the Lomé Convention?"
"This question - and I would expressly address you with it, Commissioner Pinheiro - should be investigated in detail during the preparation of the mandate for EU-ACP talks."
"Mr President, the Martens report touches on an essential subject which, from the very beginning, has been one of the distinctive traits of the European Community, that is, the will to establish a partnership, a specific form of cooperation based on official aid to significant development, with a privileged geographic sphere of cooperation."
"This example is unique, its results positive."
"The desire of the ACP countries is to continue this partnership."
"The aim must therefore clearly be supported."
"This is what Mr Martens rightly recommends, by insisting on the necessity of preserving a European Union-ACP countries global framework, along with the instruments which have made Lomé a success - product protocols, Stabex, Sysmin - all of which guarantee ACP countries the minimum of predictability and security necessary to enable them to master their development."
"But heavy threats weigh against the continuation of this policy."
"In reality, we find ourselves at a complete deadlock because we have let the Commission follow two parallel and contradictory policies: a foreign trade policy based on absolute free trade principles and a policy of development aid to privileged partners."
"The contradiction now appears clear with the destruction, by the WTO, of a leading element of the Lomé measures, the banana protocol."
"If we do not want to let the WTO systematically dismantle the Lomé system instrument by instrument then it is high time that the Council at last showed leadership and used its recognized pre-eminence to define clearly and to defend with determination the broad spheres of common interest such as development, clear and long term direction, including a set of foreign policy instruments."
"This is the only way, Mr President, that the European Union will be able to avoid having its policies dictated by outside interests."
"We regret that the Martens report does not sufficiently labour this absolutely conclusive point."
"We will however vote in its favour, because of the positive will it clearly confirms for resolutely continuing our partnership with the ACP countries."
"Mr President, I also would like to welcome this report and commend it to this House."
"Commissioner Pinheiro will recall that many of us expressed some reservations about the Green Paper but we very much welcome the consultation that has taken place and the opportunity for dialogue since the publication of the Green Paper."
"I hope the Commission position will reflect that consultation, both of this Parliament, the ACP Group and of course the NGOs you have had discussions with."
"There are a number of very fundamental points in Mr Martens' report. The composition of the ACP should not be called into question until they decide that should happen."
"Reliance on markets and blanket liberalization alone is in no way a panacea for the poorest countries."
"The Commission must continue to support our view that without aid and trade preferences to provide the social safety nets there will be never any possibility of delivering equitable growth to the poorest countries."
"The EU is the biggest trading block in the world and it is about time we stopped rolling over in the face of the WTO and of the United States."
"There are a number of important priorities the committee on Development has identified relating to the central role of women in the development process."
"Also, we should introduce an independent complaints mechanism for individuals or communities who consider that their interests have not been represented."
"Moreover, the ACP-EU Joint Assembly should be consulted should there ever be a situation when Article 5 is invoked in the suspension of countries under consideration."
"I would ask that we support the 20/20 compact idea; the idea that recipient countries should be providing and increasing their basic social expenditure."
"Also, the Commission should undertake conflict impact assessment in regions of instability to ensure that we can protect vulnerable groups and communities."
"We have a fine opportunity now to make a strong case for long-term multilateral development."
"An important change of vocabulary has taken place and Commissioner Pinheiro has used that new vocabulary."
"We no longer say post-Lomé, we now say Lomé V and we very much welcome that change of vocabulary."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Martens Report is a good basis for guidance of future discussion and, I hope, the design of Lomé V in accordance with future needs."
"I should like to highlight one aspect that does not seem to me to have been sufficiently considered."
"For that reason my group has made additional proposals, but I think they conform to the line taken by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and I hope the rapporteur will be able to agree with them."
"They concern access of women in particular to basic services, be these education, health services, or even equal rights to participation in decision-making processes; for the key to development lies in strengthening women's rights."
"That is a proven fact and has been discussed for years in great detail."
"We have the concept of mainstreaming in the European Union and I think mainstreaming must be valid also for our development work."
"Accordingly, I hope we will add to the report during voting."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the successful cooperation between Europe and the ACP countries should be continued in the future, and I personally thank Mr Martens most sincerely for taking on the work of introducing this."
"There are, however, several points concerning cooperation between Europe and the developing nations which are certainly capable of improvement, despite certain successes in the past. That is also a reason for our talking it over in such detail today."
"In this context it can also be seen that a comparison of the Green Paper with the report shows how much the debate has moved on."
"Nevertheless, in my view a number of questions, to our partners as well, remain unanswered and worthy of debate."
"Firstly, there is the question of efficient management."
"We can see difficulties in acceptance of cooperation in the northern countries, if no efforts are discernible here for securing the aid by a functioning administration."
"Secondly, there is the point about expenditure on armaments."
"Some developing countries have in past years always spent more money on the army than was available for training their citizens."
"A third point concerns resources, which are sometimes rich."
"This raises the question of how much the population benefits from the country's wealth, or is it only the few who do so?"
"In this context one must also ask whether all ACP countries are equally poor, or whether there should not be a certain amount of differentiation."
"The developing countries must be strengthened to accept ever more responsibility for their own futures, and it would be nice if we could see the day when transfers of this magnitude were no longer necessary. But until that day these countries must be confident of our solidarity."
"Mr President, now that we are agreed on entering into a new Lomé Convention, it is also important that we have the courage to recognize the faults of the old one."
"That is what the Green Paper does; for example, by pointing out that the idea of partnership does not work in many countries because there is insufficient institutional capacity to conduct this partnership."
"That is only one example of how cooperation must be differentiated within the large heterogeneous group made up of the 70 ACP countries."
"When such a differentiation is made, emphasis must be placed, in my opinion, on the criterion of poverty and on sustainable development."
"In addition, as Mrs Junker has just pointed out, much more attention must be paid to the position of women than has been today."
"Mr President, I wish to turn your attention to that point in time which the negotiations for the continuation of the Lomé Convention are aimed at."
"For the EU the success of the expansionist negotiations and the start of the third stage of European economic and monetary union are matters of destiny for all Europe."
"There is a need to stress the importance of the negotiations aimed at the continuation of the Lomé Convention against this kind of background."
"It is a matter of a comprehensive geographical policy in the EU, its effectiveness, and, at the same time, its role in the worldwide context."
"We should seriously live in the hope that the EU, more clearly than before, grasps the importance of a common foreign and security policy that is vitally relevant to the developing world."
"It follows, also, that the hopefully successful expansionist negotiations must not lead to the weakening of the position of the developing world."
"Mr President, in its reflections the Committee on External Economic Relations was very much aware that the trade provisions of the Lomé Convention are economically the most significant aspect of EU-ACP relationship."
"That is why we believe a detailed analysis and assessment of the economic impact of the proposed options for change should be conducted for the individual countries."
"Such an analysis is missing from the Green Paper and maybe it is a task that the Committee on External Economic Relations should take upon itself in the coming months."
"In any case, a proper assessment should be insisted upon by this Parliament before it gives its support to any of the trade options."
"The Martens Report, quite correctly, states that non-reciprocal trade preferences are crucial instruments of development and they should be recognised as such."
"I also suggest that the Commission could do a lot better to defend its development partners vis-à-vis the WTO."
"Read this and act, Commissioner, please."
"The Committee on External Economic Relations had this very much in mind when it called for the elaboration of a trade and development concept within the WTO."
"This concept should address more radically than existing WTO rules the issue of reciprocal and non-reciprocal trade arrangements between developing and developed countries."
"Unlike the present WTO rules, it should also fully take account of the different levels of development and sizes of respective economies."
"The WTO advocates equal rules for all but if we have learnt anything at all from the discussions for South Africa and the banana panel, it is this: if you treat unequal partners equally you end up with unequal and unjust outcomes."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to say that in the past the European Parliament has always been a fundamental partner in the definition and pursuit of cooperation policies."
"But I never expected, after the publishing of the Green Paper in which problems were identified without attempting to solve them, that we might truly benefit from an orientation, a response, to the numerous problems evoked in Mr Martens report."
"Happily, we now have at our disposal a report which will provide the necessary framework, through its quality, its policy proposals and its orientations, for the Commission."
"I say this openly because it is, in my opinion, a report of truly exceptional quality."
"Having said that, and at the same time thanking Mr Martens and the Committee on Development and Cooperation and the other committees because my task and my work will be very much simplified, I would however like to touch on two or three points which have been raised."
"Firstly, the question of trade."
"I honestly believe that something must be done at the level of the WTO."
"The ministers themselves recognized, last December in Singapore, that the less developed countries needed special rules."
"But up until now, we have received no response from the WTO."
"And to be fair, it is not simply a question of having equal rules for everyone."
"As was said the other day, I could fight Mike Tyson under equal rules but I would never win, even if I bit his ears!"
"It is not enough to have equal rules for everyone."
"The weakest economies, be they small islands or the poorest countries, need something more, that has to be clearly and fearlessly said."
"Another aspect, which does not unfortunately fall within our jurisdiction, concerns the question of foreign debt."
"My dear friends, our cooperation could be a fantastic model."
"But if the majority of countries continue to be suffocated by debt, our action will be virtually lost."
"I honestly hope that, at least politically, we may all have the courage to put pressure on the Bretton Woods institution so that initiatives in favour of the most indebted countries may be a little more ambitious."
"I must underline the extraordinary efforts of two Member States, France and the United Kingdom, in the cancellation of debt, in circumstances that must be underlined."
"These efforts must be supported and we must ask other authorities to do the same."
"Finally, it has to be said that human and social development must, in all cases, be the framework for our actions."
"You can discuss macroeconomics, trade, micro-credits, the informal economy, but the very spirit of the Convention must lie in the fight against poverty and a long term vision of human and social development."
"I honestly believe that the Martens report underlines this on many occasions and that, in this respect, we are totally in agreement."
"The same applies to simplifying the convention, the participation of women, the effectiveness of aid, the EDF's incorporation into the budget."
"Regarding the latter, why this discrimination?"
"I cannot understand it."
"I have participated in negotiations as a minister and as a Commissioner, but, ladies and gentlemen, I have never heard a good argument in favour of the current situation."
"On the contrary."
"It is discriminatory."
"And in my opinion, both the Commission and Parliament must continue to do all they can to include the EDF in the budget."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to say that the Commission has decided to make proposals for a negotiating brief in two stages."
"The first stage will be that of a political framework for the negotiations that we will submit to the Council and to Parliament."
"I am telling Parliament that in advance, Mr Martens, and you will recognize your own report in a good many of these orientations."
"Secondly, at the end of the year, we will propose the detailed technical aspects that we want to integrate into the approval of a political framework."
"I hope that Parliament will be able to support us in this frontal approach, because in my opinion it is the best way of anchoring the Lomé V Convention."
"Thank you, Mr Commissioner."
"I am sure your remarks were much appreciated by the rapporteur, all the members of the committee who have worked so hard on this report and every Members of the Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Transport of live animals"
"The next item is the report (A4-0266/97) by Mrs van Dijk, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the transport of horses and other live animals."
"Mr President, this report on the transport of horses and other animals has not just appeared from nowhere."
"In October 1994 the President of the European Parliament received a petition with more than three million signatures."
"In the meantime another petition has been started which also concerns the transport of animals and since then more than half a million signatures have been collected."
"It is a sign of public outrage that exists about the way in which we transport our animals in Europe, to Europe and from Europe to other places."
"The circumstances under which this transport takes place are often horrific."
"Members of this Parliament and others who were able to see the pictures that were broadcast on television in many Member States were able to conclude that animals often arrive at borders dehydrated, exhausted, seriously injured, with broken legs in the case of horses and limbs in the case of other animals and that abuses like this also take place within the European Union."
"These animals often travel for days and are therefore completely exhausted and dehydrated."
"Such situations are unacceptable."
"The European Parliament wishes to take measures against this and there is great social pressure for such measures to be taken."
"Furthermore, it is in fact in contravention of Community law. Because under pressure from the same public opinion, in 1995, the directive on the transport of animals was amended."
"The 1995 directive lays down that the travelling time of animals may not amount to more than eight hours."
"After that the animals must be let out, given a rest period of 24 hours and be fed and watered."
"The directive is very animal-friendly but in practice far too little is done properly."
"That is for a number of reasons."
"In the first place, it is a fact that some five Member States still have not fully implemented it in their national legislation."
"But even if they had done so it appears the compliance with the directive is completely inadequate and also inadequately monitored."
"I must say that the European Commission, with the powers that it possesses, is looking at that and is helping but it does not possess that many powers to intervene."
"The second problem with the existing directive is that in this directive it is laid down that two other directives must be enacted."
"The first one is on staging points, and in the meantime a lot of hard work has been done - this directive already exists - and secondly on the criteria which the means of transport must meet if animals are to be on the road for more than eight hours."
"Owing to the lack of these criteria at the moment every livestock lorry may be used as if it is a luxury livestock transporter in which animals may be transported for longer than eight hours."
"In short, in this way the 1995 directive has become a dead letter."
"It is urgently necessary that the Council, naturally on a proposal from the Commission, now finally adopt the directive for the establishment of the criteria for livestock transporters and ensure that a change occurs to the present situation."
"The lax attitude of the Member States not only has a negative effect on the animals transported. It is also not good for the consumer."
"It is not surprising that when animals are transported under such stressful conditions, the quality of the meat does not improve."
"Animals are injured, animals are dehydrated."
"We try to set up the situation in the slaughterhouses so that animals suffer as little stress as possible when being slaughtered, particularly in order to improve the quality of the meat and we ignore the conditions when they are being transported."
"That is incomprehensible."
"The report clearly requires a maximum travelling time of eight hours for animals that are going directly to the slaughterhouse."
"In the case of animals that are going for fattening or to be used for breeding, then an exception may only be made when they are transported in extremely good quality vehicles for which the criteria are listed in the report."
"And then they must be allowed out of the vehicle after eight hours, watered, fed, rested and then possibly put back in the vehicle."
"It is incomprehensible that the European Union promotes the transport of live animals by paying out export refunds."
"Therefore this report requires that a clear end be made to this."
"Furthermore, we must realize that we must get rid of these export refunds in one way or another in the near future by means of discussions in the WTO."
"I trust Parliament will accept the resolution as it stands."
"I also have confidence that the Commission will take this resolution to heart and that the Commission and the Council will now get to work on this matter."
"Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for her total involvement and commitment to this report."
"She has done a splendid job to bring this report before Parliament today."
"It is the first time that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has actually ever addressed the issue of animal transport."
"I am delighted that they have involved themselves because unless all the players in animal production are involved and consulted, we cannot really get proper application of rules."
"Animal welfare is an exceedingly important matter, as far as transport is concerned."
"I am delighted that representatives from the International League for the Protection of Horses are in the gallery today."
"They initiated the petition, which is the largest petition ever raised in Europe. It has practically three and a half million signatures from right across the European Union."
"That shows the strength of feeling of the people of the Union that something needs to be done in this area."
"It is quite clear from a number of television programmes that when it comes to issues regarding the production of food and animal welfare this is a very important issue in people's minds."
"It is a subject, therefore, that matters to many, many people."
"It is going to be of growing importance and it is right that this Parliament address the issue today."
"The main objective must be to stop completely the unnecessary long-distance transport of animals for slaughter."
"There is no reason why they should not be slaughtered as close to the point of production, as close to their home, as possible."
"To transport animals in the undignified way in which it has happened in the past is totally wrong."
"If one takes an example of horses coming from the far east of Russia to countries within the Community being transported, perhaps for two and half or three thousand miles, five thousand kilometres; it is totally unnecessary but is a trade which is highly lucrative to those involved because of the poor value of the Russian rouble."
"They are exploiting animals quite unnecessarily and this Parliament, I am glad to say, is going to stand up and impose some rules to make sure that those animals are at least transported with some dignity."
"At the end of the day, as I said, we must make sure that they are slaughtered as close to home as possible."
"However none of this is going to be really going to be carried out efficiently unless we get proper control mechanisms at the points of entry into the European Union."
"That is something that the Commission must face up to; it is something that we will harass the Commission on until it is done completely well."
"There are many voluntary organizations throughout Europe who have the opportunity to make sure that we are properly advised when things are not carried out."
"This report is really providing what I believe is the minimum necessary to ensure proper respect for animal welfare in the transport of animals."
"Mr President, as Mr Provan commented in his opinion on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in 1983 I was the rapporteur on this same subject."
"I now feel that I am repeating myself."
"Because since 1983, not very much has changed in the welfare of animals as far as transport is concerned."
"What has occurred in the meantime has either not been implemented or only been partially implemented by the Member States or if it has been implemented, then it is not being checked."
"That surprises us and worries us a great deal."
"We obviously want to oppose the transport of live animals as much as possible."
"However, those animals that are transported must be moved using the most animal-friendly methods possible."
"Mrs van Dijk has mentioned the staging points."
"Fortunately the criteria were laid down by the Council of Ministers in May of this year under the Dutch presidency, but my question to the Commission is how are the checks and monitoring of compliance with the criteria for staging points actually organized in practice?"
"How many of the 100 veterinary inspectors that the Commission recently appointed have gone into action?"
"In what way are the reliable NGOs involved in implementing the monitoring of these matters?"
"Because again it seems, as Mrs van Dijk has said, that the eight-hour limit that we now have is a dead letter."
"Animals may be transported for no more than eight hours but nobody checks this."
"So it doesn't happen."
"So I wonder, now that we are talking about the luxury cattle trucks, or ""business-class' cattle trucks, as they have been called, when the Commission is going to establish the criteria to put these luxury cattle trucks into operation."
"It is strange that the Union's current export refunds still encourage long-distance transport of live animals."
"What possibilities does the Commission see within the WTO context to dismantle these export refunds?"
"I would like a clear response from the Commission to the suggestions in this outstanding report by Mrs van Dijk and to the specific questions that I have just raised."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"I am very pleased that we are discussing this subject today in the European Parliament, because awareness of animal protection and animal welfare has a high priority in the minds of Europeans."
"To this end, inspection of transport conditions and the condition of the animals is necessary during import as well as export."
"Naturally, sanctions are also needed for cases where controls disclose contravention of EU standards."
"Sanctions might consist, for example, of withdrawal of export licences, or import quotas granted to third countries."
"Authorization for the export of live animals should be made dependent upon a certificate from an official veterinary surgeon, who should confirm that transportation is in order."
"The strict standards applied in Austria, that is, a maximum transport duration of six hours, should become valid for the whole of Europe."
"I would regard it as a first step, however, if the international transport duration for cross-border traffic were reduced initially to eight hours."
"Furthermore, the proportion of live cattle to total exports has shrunk in recent years from 16 % to about 10 %."
"It should also be taken into account that these figures include exports of domestic and breeding cattle, which have risen from 16 % to 28 %. So, from this point of view it is a positive development."
"It should also be noted that the compensation for live cattle is much less than for carcasses."
"On behalf of farmers, however, I have to say that a complete switch from live transport is impossible, but that transport time should be kept as short as possible."
"European farmers have the closest possible interest in seeing that their animals are not subjected to distress during transportation, because pain and stress have a detrimental effect on the quality of the meat."
"In general I support the export of meat, but at the same time there is a need for encouragement of the construction of abattoirs and cold storage installations in those third countries which are the main customers of the EU, and who do not possess any such means of keeping food fresh."
"For this reason we in the European Union must build these installations, in order to make it possible for customers in third countries to buy meat instead of live animals."
"The general public is very sensitive to this aspect, and I welcome that."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs van Dijk for her very thorough report in which she makes excellent suggestions on the subject of animal transportation, so that the welfare of animals is paramount during their transportation."
"The EU must aim to end the transportation of animals for slaughter once and for all, as it causes the animals stress and suffering."
"That is Finland's official position."
"The EU must present the matter at the next round of WTO talks, as the issue should apply globally."
"With the transportation of animals for slaughter there has been a reduction in the overproduction of beef, in particular, arising from the distrust of transporters brought about by, for example, the BSE crisis."
"The rapporteur urges the Commission to cut the import subsidy for one third of the countries involved."
"I cannot go along with this as yet, because it would mean a surplus of beef, more import subsidies and pressures on the agricultural budget."
"That problem must be solved first."
"Furthermore, the rapporteur suggests the Commission should increase staff and at the same time pour more money into staging points when animals are being transported, and for the monitoring of abattoirs."
"I cannot sanction this recommendation since such monitoring operations should be the task of the authorities in Member States where transportation is being carried out."
"It is impossible to observe in Brussels what is going on in Germany, Italy or France during the transportation of animals."
"Finally, I demand that all Member States incorporate the directives in force as part of its national law, and I mean those five countries which have still not done so."
"The rapporteur should have named those five countries to put pressure on them."
"The Commission must embark upon the implementation of a ratification process with respect to those countries without delay."
"The law must be put into practice in every country and the Commission has responsibility for monitoring the process, and making demands on Member States in that respect."
"Mr President, Mrs van Dijk has written a good and important report."
"In spite of the fact that the EU has tightened up the rules on animal transport, and in spite of the pressure of public opinion on this issue, the unnecessary and cruel transportation of animals continues to a large extent."
"The reduction in transportation which has taken place is mainly due to the BSE crisis and not to greater consideration for animals."
"It is also a serious matter that the most important accompanying directives to the tougher EU directive still do not work, that is, directives on the design of vehicles and on staging points."
"As long as that is so, no transport with an overall length of more than eight hours should be allowed."
"It is also good that Mrs van Dijk tackles the system more fundamentally in her report."
"I am thinking above all of paragraph 35 on the abolition of export subsidies which mean in practice that the EU is supporting this system."
"The principle that animals should be slaughtered as close as possible to the place where they are reared is also important."
"Mr President, the cause of the scandal and the millions of cases of suffering and maltreatment of animals - unnecessary suffering and unnecessary maltreatment - is that animals are still regarded as goods to be dealt with as one wishes, so that as much profit as possible is wrung out of them."
"And when there is no further use for them, they can be thrown away."
"So it is, for example, with horses, one of mankind's oldest companions, and that is a particularly strong example as often man would not have advanced without horses."
"As long as we do not realise that animals are not goods, maintained just for our profit, nothing will change here."
"Allow me to read out something written by St Francis of Assisi in the 12th Century."
"It shows how little we have learned, even though we maintain that we are such a cultured nation: ""All the creatures of the Earth feel as we do."
"All the creatures of the Earth strive for happiness as we do."
"All the creatures of the Earth love, suffer, and die as we do."
"Therefore they are equal works of the Almighty Creator' ."
"We should take that to heart."
"We are just as much a part of creation as animals, yet we maltreat them and exploit them."
"Think about what happens in horse transporters over thousands of kilometres."
"Horses are timid flight animals."
"They are torn from their home stables, put into strange stalls, loaded onto transporters without food or water."
"They are close- tethered, they cannot lie down, they cannot make themselves comfortable, they can do nothing, and they trample each other to death."
"And we still allow this to happen today!"
"That takes place every day."
"It is exactly the same with pig transport, cattle transport, etcetera. We make great speeches, we pass many papers and resolutions, yet no one takes any notice of what happens as a result of it all."
"That has got to change!"
"If we want to be able to face ourselves in the mirror, or - as many, including myself, still do - got to church and pray, then we do not have the right to treat creatures, who are similar products of creation, in the way we do today."
"That has finally got to stop and I can only hope that the Commission stands firm at last, and that more serious controls take place within Member States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am of course in favour of Mrs van Dijk's report, which states the problem well, describing the legitimate indignation of many of our citizens and the scandals linked to the transport of animals."
"Nevertheless, I do not believe the problem can be solely examined in the light of romanticism and moral indignation. It must also be the opportunity to see what perverse mechanisms of international trade are permitting the expansion of all these misdeeds."
"Mrs van Dijk's proposals regarding improvements in the conditions of transport are good, also because they anticipate encouraging the reduction of this transport."
"This is definitely the central question."
"We spoke earlier about the difficult conditions in third countries. This is what must be attacked."
"You can clearly see the bad effects of free trade in this matter, and in this respect paragraph 38 does not go far enough."
"Why not consider a tax on imports of live animals?"
"From an economic point of view it would be logical in relation to paragraph 35, which proposes putting an end to the granting of export refunds."
"Thus it is also an opportunity to question the economic mechanisms of the overly commercialised civilization in which we are currently submerged, and its ill-effects."
"Mr President, I would first like to express regret for the fact that Mr Seal has not been present."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for a good report and a good initiative."
"Unfortunately, it is an initiative report and not legislative."
"But it is incredible - and this, of course, echoes what my colleagues have said - it is incredible that we should still be dealing with the subject in spite of the directives of 1991 and 1995."
"As has been mentioned several times today, it is reprehensible that the transport of horses, calves, pigs and sheep still takes place under conditions which time and time again have been exposed in the media, in spite of directives and good intentions."
"As a general rule, the transport of live animals is necessary, but not desirable, partly out of consideration for the welfare of the animals and partly because of the risk of infection."
"Out of consideration for the welfare of the animals, it is unacceptable that transport should take place in poorly equipped lorries over enormous distances."
"The animals suffer stress and that often leads to suffering and death."
"As far as the risk of infection is concerned, the spread of infectious diseases is increased by the long journeys."
"But perhaps it is a combination of the fact that we have vast abattoirs and that transport in Europe is too cheap that gives rise to this situation."
"We need action in this area."
"It is too cheap to transport animals over long distances."
"There is a need for precise, tough requirements for the lorries which are to transport the animals when that is necessary."
"There is a need for tougher requirements at borders and for inspections."
"There is a need for precise criteria regarding staging points, for example."
"Measures like those mentioned would be able to improve the welfare of the animals and reduce the spread of infectious diseases."
"But the aim must still be that live animals should not be transported over long distances, and that slaughtering should take place as close as possible to the place where the animal is reared."
"Some things have got easier today with refrigeration technology and so on, but we should perhaps consider whether regional self-sufficiency should be reintroduced so that there is no need to transport animals to slaughter over long distances."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have all experienced the feeling of pain."
"It is a feeling which all mammals have in common."
"Therefore it is also necessary for us to show respect for animals, and we can only do that by reducing the suffering they have to go through."
"I want to say to the rapporteur and Mr Eisma that there is a problem in the fact that we transport calves from Denmark to the Netherlands to be fattened up, after which they are transported back again."
"So I believe that we must all start by looking at the situation in our own countries."
"Mr President, when three million people take the trouble to write letters and send signatures to this Parliament with a plea for something to be done about the shameful animal transport across Europe, then something is definitely wrong."
"Moreover, when it appears from pictures from animal protection inspection teams that attempts by the Union to improve the situation for animals have not been taken up by a number of countries, that legislation is not respected, that services are not used, then we must conclude that the protests by our citizens are justified."
"Then we must also realize that the Union must tackle things better."
"I wish to stress four points."
"Animals must be slaughtered as close as possible to the place where they have been reared."
"Meat can be transported deep-frozen."
"Animals transports are often unnecessary."
"Transport of more than six to eight hours must simply be prohibited."
"It is crazy to drag animals around for so long before they are slaughtered."
"Transport of animals from outside the Union should only be admitted if they have been treated in the same way as in the Union."
"Transport of horses from Poland, Belarus and Lithuania is a downright disgrace."
"Legislation on animals transport must be implemented."
"If that does not happen then the Commission must act decisively."
"Mr President, Nel van Dijk has written a first-class report and Jimmy Provan deserves great appreciation for the action he has undertaken."
"We often discuss the people's Europe but here is a subject that has been raised by three million people."
"We expect sound proposals and action from the Commission in order to bring this undignified and harrowing situation to an end."
"Mr President, first I would like to express my warmest thanks to Mrs van Dijk for her excellent report."
"I can fully support all the suggestions she makes in it including point 35 which is being discussed."
"I am, however, quite sure that we will need new Commission regulations."
"The present regulations, although not even fully implemented, do not go far enough."
"Concrete proposals are required from the Commission."
"The transport of animals is dreadfully cruel, as has been mentioned here several times."
"I myself believe that the only way to prevent this cruelty is to introduce economic sanctions."
"Because the ending of the import subsidy - which cost ECU 300 Million in the year 1995-1996, for example - will not have a rapid effect, the Commission should now embark on a programme of measures whereby those companies guilty of abuse would have to pay back their transport subsidy."
"I think that would be one way."
"Responsibility ultimately lies with the Member States; that is why it is hard for us to get anywhere."
"Nevertheless, I think we also need more people in the Commission to monitor things."
"We need more openness; it is vital that each and every instance of abuse is publicly exposed."
"And company names should be publicized when they are guilty of flagrant violation of the animal rights."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs van Dijk on this important report."
"Let us now hope that it really leads to improvements."
"I really hope that the European Parliament today has the courage to vote through this report in its entirety."
"It is easy to be pessimistic when you read that the European Parliament has in fact voted to have improvements in the area of animal protection since 1983."
"In reality not very much has happened."
"Live animals are still exported and imported on a scale and in ways which would not have happened if the EU's own policies, its agricultural policy, did not lead to it and support it in the form of export and transport subsidies, and thereby encourage it to continue as it does."
"It is also incredibly negligent of the Commission not to set the standards and requirements which it said it would do with regard to means of transport and staging points or rest sites, which means that this directive is ineffectual in certain areas."
"We consequently have an entirely unacceptable situation."
"Mrs van Dijk takes up technical improvements which must be made to vehicles and staging points."
"I am particularly pleased about two points which are the only the only reasonable options, namely putting a stop to export subsidies or other forms of direct or indirect subsidy for the transport of live animals for slaughter, and also that the EU's policy should be that animals for meat consumption should be slaughtered as close as possible to where they are reared."
"That is the only reasonable option."
"Refrigerated transport and refrigerated lorries exist today in 1997."
"So use them, for God's sake!"
"We have seen the horrors and the brutal treatment in films showing the everyday life of animals on the road in Europe."
"That cannot be allowed in a civilised society."
"Ladies and gentlemen, vote now for this report in its entirety."
"Mr President, the report by Mrs van Dijk has my full support."
"All the proposed technical and veterinary measures for the improvement of transport conditions for animals are sensible."
"They are well-considered and above all practicable."
"They should be implemented as soon as possible."
"Let me point out that in Austria at the moment the Independent Party is doing lot on behalf of animals who suffer as a result of live transport."
"Our activities so far reach from open letters to Commissioner Fischler, through collecting signatures and action days, to blockades of sensitive border crossings; because in Austria there is a special situation arising from Austria's Animal Transport Law."
"The regulation on total transport duration has not yet been brought into line with the strictly-worded EU guidelines in this respect."
"Although in Austria the total authorized transport duration of six hours is a more rigorous limit than that proposed by the EU, a driver cannot be prosecuted if he has not exceeded this limit in Austria, even though he has been driving for more than six hours in a foreign country."
"This is - excuse me for speaking plainly - absolute rubbish, which holds life in contempt!"
"It is an invitation to misuse a well-meaning law."
"Now I come to the main problem."
"Every regulation will remain a toothless tiger unless it contains effective and stricter controls and, above all, efficient criminal sanctions."
"This means that the EU guidelines will lead to serious problems in practice, simply because they contain no criminal penalties."
"I believe, therefore, that the requirements of the relevant criminal laws should be much more strictly worded."
"In Austria, for example, we introduced on our own initiative, in April this year, an animal transport inspector on the busiest motorway route. His task is to force any truck to be taken to a specially established animal and watering station if its floor is not correctly covered with straw or sawdust, or if its animals have not been watered and fed."
"Yet again, without effective penalties, without considerable fines, we are just achieving half a solution."
"Live animal transport has expanded explosively since precisely that moment when it received such generous help from Commission."
"That shows that many people in the business are very well aware of the power of money, and with animal suffering there is still much too much money to be made."
"That is the actual core of the problem."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs van Dijk on this excellent report."
"It was and is indeed a terrible situation that we have here, in the way animals are treated to an extent and in a manner that can only be described as inhuman."
"I should like fully to support the resolution of the Commission to issue a directive on the design of transporter vehicles, whether they be cars, trains or whatever."
"We have also seen in the film how animals are herded together, how they die in the trucks, and how nothing is done to provide a half-way reasonable method of transport suitable for animals."
"Secondly, the equipment of abattoirs has quite rightly been touched on."
"Some of them have no weekend duty staff."
"Animals die and are left to lie there, they are not removed when they die. These are quite unimaginable conditions."
"Thirdly, the cancellation of any kind of financial subsidy for such transporters that are not in accordance with regulations and not up to today's standards."
"On the contrary; we need strict penalties to prevent these things from continuing."
"This financial system must also be used to achieve something close to all our hearts, namely that as few animal transports as possible, as few movements of live animals as possible, take place in Europe, and that freezer transportation is available."
"That must be our primary objective."
"This is not matter of high politics in accordance with the standards of journalists and politicians, but of something where the EU can show that it takes the concerns of citizens seriously, where the EU - the Commission, Council and this Parliament, too - can demonstrate that when citizens worry about a problem, when they have an emotional problem with something, the EU goes into action, and fast."
"For this reason I ask not just for a yes vote, but I also ask the Commissioner or the Commission to seize this great opportunity to show Europe's citizens that the EU is able to act speedily on matters that concern the public; to show that the EU is able to act fast wherever citizens think that action is needed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the van Dijk report which has arisen out of a draft resolution by Mr Provan and others was finally requested from the European Parliament by the Committee on Transport and Tourism in November 1996."
"It also concerns the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection who have been asked for their opinion."
"The report deals with a serious issue: the transport of horses and other live animals and the seriousness of the issue is also reflected by the number of committees consulted for their opinion and represented here by Mr Provan and Mr Eisma."
"In view of the time available I shall not dwell on the general conditions - means of transport, staging points, the import and export of live animals: cattle, pigs, sheep and horses in particular - but as all these points I have listed relate to the welfare of animals during transport, whether they are destined for consumption by or the entertainment of human beings, as is the case with racehorses, I should, however, like to say that I agree with the resolutions of Parliament and the rapporteur's proposals - which I applaud - as these proposals are all valid ones."
"I shall quote some of them: a maximum of 500 km for road transport or not more than eight hours' journey time; the slaughter of animals destined for consumption as close as possible to the place of production; granting powers to the veterinary inspection service; supervised staging points, particularly with regard to the supply of food and water, the loading and unloading of animals and their accommodation; improved supervision of exports and imports."
"In addition I welcome the right of recourse which provides the right to prosecute people and companies who cause suffering to the animals being transported."
"I now look forward to the Commission's proposals!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you can see from the preamble to Mrs van Dijk's excellent report, concern for the safe transport of horses and other animals goes back along way in this Parliament."
"The Commission also considers the protection of all animals - which obviously includes horses - during transport to be a matter of great importance."
"This House, as well as many organizations and individuals, has repeatedly stressed its desire to see the Community adopt effective measures in this field."
"The Commission shares your view that correct and effective Community rules on animal welfare are necessary and I can assure you that the Commission has always given and will continue to give animal welfare a high priority."
"The Commission has become increasingly concerned about the welfare of animals during transportation and, in particular, the long-distance transport of animals."
"Although the Union has various measures to protect transported animals both within its territory and also where part of the journey involves the territories of third countries, it cannot be denied that problems of inadequate enforcement by the responsible authorities of the Member States and inadequate respect for the rules by commercial operators have occurred."
"The Commission has opened infringement proceedings against Member States in default."
"I will refer now to some of the specific concerns expressed in the draft resolution, such as means of transport, staging points and export refunds."
"It should be acknowledged that considerable progress has been made in the domain of Community welfare legislation."
"I will mention a few examples."
"Following the adoption in the Council of new standards on the protection of animals during transport, there were two major obligations for the Commission to propose further detailed rules."
"Regarding the staging points, the Commission proposal was already adopted last June."
"Furthermore, in July the Commission forwarded a proposal to the Council concerning the standards for upgraded lorries."
"We expect this matter to be concluded during the Luxembourg Presidency."
"The Commission also presented a proposal to the Council under which the payment of export refunds would be subject to compliance with the provisions on the protection of animals during transport."
"As you are well aware, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development discussed this proposal just a few days ago and the matter is expected to be debated in the November part-session."
"Once this regulation is adopted by the Council, the Commission will then decide detailed implementing rules which will gradually increase the degree of protection for cattle being transported."
"Turning now to enforcement and monitoring methods, the Commission's veterinary experts from the Food and Veterinary Service have carried out on-the-spot checks in all the Member States."
"These have indicated that the uniform application of the relevant Council directive has not yet been achieved in all Member States."
"Three major deficiencies have been found."
"In many Member States on a number of occasions animals were found to be suffering during transport."
"Checks carried out by some Member States were considered to be inadequate or insufficient and the means of transport were quite often inadequate."
"The Commission, through the Food and Veterinary Service will continue its mission to monitor the situation in Member States, despite the fact that enforcement is the responsibility of each Member State."
"In conclusion, my colleague Mr Fischler has asked me to assure you that the Commission is as anxious as this House to provide the legislative framework within which the Member States can ensure that all animals are transported under statutory conditions, providing operators with a clear set of rules which they have to follow."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Votes"
"Madam President, I would like to inform you that we have as our guests today Members of the Greek Parliament and I would ask you, as President, to welcome them, if that is possible."
"Of course, Mr Trakatellis."
"Let us say it is customary that we only welcome genuinely official visits. Nevertheless, I very warmly welcome our friends from the Greek Parliament."
"Madam President, in accordance with yesterday's debate in the Chamber and also with regard to the work done in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Cooperation and Development, I should like to ask the Chamber to refer my report back to committee, and for one very simple reason. We approved the report during a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy in June when the situation in Cambodia was different from what it has since become."
"The debate yesterday afternoon confirmed the need for referral back to allow the committee and the rapporteur to change the explanatory statements, do some more work and also contribute to a peaceful resolution of the tensions that currently exist in Cambodia."
"To do all this we therefore need a little more time, without losing sight of the objective of then ratifying the agreement, but in a political context in which peace has been restored."
"For this reason I would request the Chamber to adopt the motion for referral back to committee, which I now put formally."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"Madam President, I should like to explain a simple procedural point."
"Due to an administrative oversight, the resolution from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy is not included in the text as it should be."
"Your services have agreed that this can be done by an oral amendment."
"I would ask if the House would support that."
"To help the services perhaps it would be best if it were included after Article 16 of my resolution."
"So I suggest we vote on everything up to paragraph 16, then vote on 2 to 7 from the Committee on Foreign Affairs as a whole and then continue with paragraph 17."
"I hope that is clear."
"I would add as guidance to the House that the Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted its resolution unanimously."
"So there is no question of any political dispute."
"Are there any objections?"
"There are not."
"Mr Hindley, we will therefore proceed as you suggest."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, from the enthralling debate on my report yesterday evening, a compromise proposal in the form of an oral amendment has resulted which summarizes this paragraph of my original text with the text of the amendment from the Group of the European People's Party."
"The text making this compromise possible is as follows: ""2. recalls that budgetary discipline and the achievement of monetary union are perfectly compatible with sustainable growth and job-creation policies, but that neither compliance with the convergence criteria nor the date for stage three should detract from the need for efforts on the part of the Union and the Member States to create jobs and to maintain and, where necessary, improve social security.'"
"Are there any objections to this oral amendment?"
"There are not."
"On Amendment No 4"
"Madam President, we have the classic problem with wording and translation."
"The Dutch text of the amendment on modernizing technologies has ""especially in the field of environmental protection' . ""Especially' narrows the definition."
"It should read ""inter alia, in the area of environmental protection' ."
"This is one of the possibilities."
"That is the interpretation I wish to give it and I would like to finalize that in the Dutch text by replacing the word ""especially' with ""inter alia' ."
"The Green Group has been consulted on this matter."
"Are there any objections to this oral amendment?"
"There are not."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"May I congratulate Mr Alber, as that was his final report ..."
"(Loud applause) ... and again wish him every success in his new position in the Court of Justice."
"Madam President, this amendment reflects the unanimous opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"As draftsman of the opinion I deplore the fact that the timetable did not permit the Committee on Development and Cooperation to take this opinion, which places the right emphasis on agriculture, into consideration."
"I therefore call on Members to vote in favour of this amendment."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, may we have some clarification from the rapporteur regarding paragraph 22."
"It says quite clearly: ' Takes the view that cross-border transport, etc.'"
"As far as we in this group are concerned, there are no longer any internal barriers within the Community."
"I would like an assurance from the rapporteur that relates purely to external borders into the Community."
"Regarding paragraph 26, there is a nuance in the different languages."
"In the German version it says: ' In addition it would be expedient for part of such control' ."
"In the English text it says: ' It would be expedient for part of such monitoring' ."
"We can support the word 'monitoring' but not 'control' ."
"I should like to be reassured that it is the English text that is valid."
"Mr President, I have absolutely no objection to adding the word ""external' in paragraph 22, because it is of course my intention that it concerns ""the external borders of the Union' and not ""the internal borders' ."
"In fact they should no longer be there."
"That is paragraph 22."
"With regard to paragraph 26, the English word 'monitoring' is in fact better than the word ""control' ."
"In Dutch it should perhaps be ""toezicht' instead of ""controle' ."
"That also applies to the German."
"Madam President, I would just like to ask you to check paragraph 5 in the Swedish version when you check the different language versions because there is a mistake there."
"I think it should be ""rearing and breeding' instead of ""rearing and fattening' ."
"There are also a number of other bits of nonsense there."
"So could you please check those too."
"Quite, absolutely, I can undertake to make sure that is done."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"The UN Convention is of great importance for regulating at a truly international level the problems relating to the Law of the Sea and the marine environment."
"I therefore have nothing against the substance of the convention."
"However, what I am critical of is that the EU is to become a signatory to this Convention."
"That means the EU is being accepted as a legal person, that is, a state."
"That is something I cannot accept."
"It was and still is the various Member States of the EU which are signatories to UN conventions."
"The EU is not a state."
"There is no reason at all why the EU should be a formal signatory to the Convention rather than the various Member States."
"This is all the more bewildering since not all Member States have ratified it."
"There is therefore no justification for the Member States, as the report proposes, transferring authority from themselves to the EU on matters concerning trade policy, fishing policy, environmental issues, sovereignty over sea areas and fishing rights."
"In the light of this, I have voted against the report."
"As an advocate of international intergovernmental cooperation, respecting each country's sovereignty, I am critical of giving the EU authority to represent the Member States in international contexts."
"The Convention on the Law of the Sea is, however, a very important agreement to save the marine environment and an opportunity for countries in the third world to assert their right to the sea on the same terms as the rich countries."
"Hopefully, the EU's conclusion of the Convention on the Law of the Sea will lead to the Union being forced to a greater extent to respect environmental requirements and to cooperate with countries in the third world on equal terms."
"That is why I am voting for the recommendation."
"Pettinari Report (A4-221/97)"
"The intensely sad history of Cambodia is written in blood."
"It shows something of the glaring contrasts in the ASEAN region."
"If this organization tries to mediate in the civil war, the EU should take a detached attitude."
"After the 1993 elections, the situation in Cambodia seemed to improve, but the recent battle between Premier Hun Sen and Prince Ranariddh has again brought the country to the edge of the abyss."
"We feel that the time is not ripe for a cooperation agreement with Cambodia, although we certainly agree on the content."
"We must wait for the parliamentary elections in 1998."
"That is why we have abstained on the Pettinari report."
"Furthermore, an agreement with Cambodia, but also with Vietnam and Laos, is above all a gesture of friendship by the EU as support for reforms in these countries."
"It may in no way be seen as approval of the political situation."
"In cooperation with countries such as Laos and Cambodia there must be strict supervision to ensure that financial support is given legitimately and appropriately and in no way must it reach the pockets of corrupt officials."
"Hindley Report (A4-0195/97)"
"Madam President, I also have an explanation of vote on Commissioner Martens's report, but it is also in writing."
"Madam President, in the explanatory statement in the report on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations it is stated that ASEAN was initially meant as an alliance against rising communism."
"A very worthy objective, some will think."
"And they are entitled to their opinion."
"They should not, however, forget the massacres which already resulted from that struggle in the area in question, in Indonesia, for example, even before ASEAN existed."
"But the Committee on External Economic Relations, as the committee responsible for the basic issue, is more concerned with strengthening relations with a major economic partner, and its proposal therefore seeks to contribute to resolving the impasse caused by Portugal's opposition to the third-generation agreement."
"And it does not so much as mention the blocking of the vote and the reasons for blocking it, but identifies the question as turning on possible options for a new dynamic, with protocols annexed to the 1980 agreement, active partnerships and other stratagems, stating, with excellent intentions, the need to safeguard environmental and cultural conservation, which is considered to include the Portuguese language and other symbols of a historic past in Timor."
"And emphasizing, also with excellent intentions, the importance of observing the principle of conditionality on respect for human rights."
"The opinion of the Committee for Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy is even more political: it refers explicitly to the blocking of the agreement and sees the way out of the situation as being an order that Portugal withdraw her objection, arguing that this would make it possible to create a legal basis for the protection of human rights in East Timor."
"It demands nothing of Indonesia, however, despite the fact that the country has been in continuous military occupation of East Timor for over twenty years, although the opinion, to do it justice, does call on Member States to respect the decision of the Parliament as regards the sale of arms to Indonesia."
"For that reason, we are faced with a political sleight of hand which overlooks the invasion and military occupation of a territory which needs to be decolonized, which ignores the cultural and physical genocide of a people, which disregards the decisions of the United Nations demanding practical respect for the right to self-determination, all of which reduces the protection of human rights by the amount it forgets, the amount it ignores, the amount it disregards, as if Timor were part of Indonesia."
"End of story!"
"In the name of economics, of business, solutions are sought for awkward situations, but they cannot rely on our silent complicity, because there is a military operation and invasion, because there is disrespect for the right of a people to self-determination, because there is cultural and physical genocide going on."
"The Europe of Nations Group participated in the adoption of the group of reports on the agenda for this period of additional session which deal with relationships between the European Union and the countries of Asia, notably with the Member States of ASEAN, with whom we have longstanding and deep relationships."
"The development and readjustment of our relations with this part of the world is indeed a challenge and an objective common to all the Member States of the Union."
"The European Union must take into account both the potential markets in these countries and their distinctive commercial aggressiveness."
"We must therefore pay particular attention to the balance of the agreements and reciprocal concessions, carefully studying their consequences on jobs."
"The extension of the benefits of the cooperation agreement to Vietnam is, for the Union, a way of signalling our interest in this country and our desire to take into account the realities of political and economic developments in the region."
"With regard to the cooperation agreement with Cambodia, the I-EDN group would like to signal its agreement with a policy which is, in this case, both wise and reasonable for, whilst adapting our cooperation to the difficult situation that this country is experiencing, it manages to preserve its achievements and encourages, in advance, any positive change."
"It is essential to underline the importance we attach to the organization of an equitable electoral process."
"The conditions in which the ballot proceeds should determine both the breadth and nature of our cooperation."
"Given its experience and competence in this sphere, our Parliament could certainly provide useful support in the monitoring of these elections."
"The most important thing, for the moment, is to signal our desire to support all positive progress, to punish all deterioration into violence and to protect the interests of populations benefitting from humanitarian cooperation."
"This objective is therefore perfectly consistent with the referral of Mr Pettinari's report to the parliamentary committee, which will enable us to integrate into our resolution the most recent developments in the situation in Cambodia."
"Hindley Report (A4-0262/97)"
"Since this is an area of extraordinary potential, the European Union's concern to establish a new dynamic in relations with ASEAN is understandable."
"This does not mean, however, that values which ought to be safeguarded can be abandoned, particularly in the economic and social fields."
"But, over and above these values, particularly bearing in mind the extremely serious situation in East Timor, it was necessary that very specific mention should be made of the requirement that human rights should be respected."
"This is a point to which we on the Committee on External Economic Relations have paid special attention, and it has been considered in paragraph 16 of the approved resolution, where its importance is emphasized and there is even a demand for 'the adherence to human rights conditionality in the bilateral relations between the EU and certain ASEAN member states' ."
"Whatever the attractions of big business, there are values on which Europe should stand firm, or it will lose all credibility."
"The relationship between the ASEAN countries and the EU, which has changed a great deal since 1980, certainly requires a new dynamism."
"We support the Council's and the Commission's choice of option 2."
"A joint declaration offers the parties more space to take advantage of developments and can be supplemented by agreements with the separate ASEAN countries."
"The rapporteur states that the voice of the European Parliament is more limited than if option 1 were chosen."
"We have no objection to that."
"Foreign policy is the responsibility of the Member States, after all."
"Close cooperation with the ASEAN countries is clearly desirable."
"In this context, priority must be given to trade and investment barriers."
"The promotion of exports by the EU is, moreover, no more that a supplement to the export policies of the Member States, where this task primarily lies."
"There the necessary involvement of the business world can also take shape."
"The EU should particularly create the preconditions in a multilateral context."
"I am convinced that in the field of human rights, in particular the arrogant attitude of many Western countries is distasteful to the ASEAN countries."
"Standing up for human rights is best served if the EU treats the Asian countries more as equal, adult countries."
"That does not, however, remove the basic fact that man as a creation of God is worthy of protection."
"The ASEAN countries may also be spoken to like that."
"The amendment of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is, as far as I am concerned, not on the agenda, although in view of its highly humanist nature, I can sympathize with criticism of it."
"It is not up to the EU to determine which countries in this region may or may not accede to ASEAN, however much trouble we have with the situation in some countries in the region."
"So we were able to agree to the extension of the agreement to Vietnam."
"The Council should, however, point to abuses in contacts with the ASEAN countries."
"Programmes that promote human rights should be given priority by the Union and the Member States."
"The disgusting sexual exploitation of children in Thailand and in the Philippines and also the white slave trade call for joint measures to combat them."
"Considerations about South East Asian countries mostly deal with the explosive and economic growth, trade and investments."
"It is forgotten that poverty and the lack of development are still the main problems in many ASEAN countries."
"The Commission communication also pays too little attention to this."
"Countless NGOs in the region are doing good work in that field."
"Unfortunately it is often no more than a drop in the ocean."
"In cooperation with the ASEAN countries the battle against poverty and underdevelopment must be continued unabated."
"Hindley Reports (A4-0195/97 et A4-0262/97)"
"I voted for the report on the EU's relations with the ASEAN states."
"However, it is necessary to stress the point relating to human rights more clearly than the report does."
"This has been powerfully underlined in the cooperation agreement with Vietnam, but not yet with the other combined ASEAN states."
"There are breaches of human rights in all of these states, particularly in Indonesia and the Philippines."
"For a long time the trades union and democratic movements in these states have been subjected to oppression and persecution, not least in rural districts."
"Indonesia is also responsible for the terrible genocide in East Timor and the occupation of that country."
"The EU must strongly defend human rights in the whole ASEAN area."
"Graziani Report (A4-0140/97)"
"The Euro-Canadian common declaration of 17 December 1996 and the plan of action which goes with it, in our minds, do not respect the current law of the Union, and we do not understand how the national governments represented on the Council could have accepted it."
"Indeed, you would look in vain in the treaty for any legal basis enabling the Union to sign such commitments."
"It does not relate to a common position under article J2, as this is an agreement with a third country."
"Nor is it related to a common action under article J3, for the same reason, and also because the expected procedure in these cases has not been followed."
"Furthermore, reservations must also be expressed on the nature of the areas covered by the declaration and plan of action: they certainly deal with trade relations, in which the Community has authority, but also with security, disarmament, justice, immigration, terrorism, etc., in other words areas which are strictly national or inter-governmental."
"The surprise is even greater when one notices that the whole of this hotchpotch document is co-signed by the Commission, when it only has the authority to negotiate certain limited parts of it."
"It is true that the Commission, since its initial communication to the Council at the beginning of 1996, has coldly explained the need to take into consideration the changing nature of the Union's foreign relations since Maastricht."
"One would indeed like to know what this changing nature consists of since, after Maastricht as before, common foreign policy is still of an inter-governmental nature."
"It was probably to illustrate this alleged change that Leon Brittan went to present a proposal to the Canadians without even having the formal go ahead from the Council. It is probably in the same spirit that throughout the signed document, the Union is presented on an equal legal footing with Canada, as if it were a state, when it does not even have an artificial personality."
"In reality, these agreements should have been co-signed by all the European countries, or by those who were the most interested."
"In their present state, they are legally worthless."
"Added to the desire of the authors to pass off the European Union as a sort of federal state is their determination to remove, from the body of the text, any mention by name of a Member State, even of those, France or Great Britain, who have the most obvious historic links with Canada."
"You have to read the document to be conscious, with considerable astonishment moreover, of this true passion for erasing nations."
"Indeed, the very notion of a Member State seems to have been banished."
"It appears only in a brief and sibylline phrase, added at the last minute of the negotiations to the effect that these documents have no impact on the legal position of the European Community, of its Member States, or of Canada. It is the only place in the text where the reader learns, by chance, that there are Member States in the Union."
"You will also note the obscure style (the legal position), designed to avoid displaying the shameful truth: only the sovereign Member States have the right to act in the Union's foreign policy."
"Since you must above all not talk of Member States and their different foreign policies, the Euro-Canadian documents never mention, of course, the existence of special links between France and Quebec, and the need to preserve these."
"You see here at work the integrational mechanism: instead of protecting the differences, which in theory is its duty, the Union strives to eliminate them: instead of valuing and defending member nations, it tries to remove them in order to pull itself up and place itself in the forefront."
"It seems to me that governments and national diplomats should carefully consider this text, and draw conclusions from it."
"I voted for the report on the EU's relations with Canada, but I voted against the criticism of Canada's fishing policy."
"I think it is a lot more sensible than the EU's policy because it takes account of the reduced fish stocks."
"Canada's policy is necessary to make sure there is no depletion of stocks."
"I am also opposed to the proposal that there should be a developed cooperation between Europol and the Canadian police authorities."
"As an opponent of the development of a Europol, I think it would be better for international police cooperation to take place through Interpol."
"I note, as do several of my colleagues, the happy coincidence of the particularly notable visit of the Prime Minister of Quebec to Paris and our debate on relations between the European Union and Canada."
"This coincidence leads us to accord a special importance to the unresolved problems of the Canadian federation, to which Mr Graziani has rightly drawn our attention and which determine the future of our relationships with the different constituent parts."
"Canada, as she is currently organized, carries within her, like a nagging torment and a destructive ferment, the unresolved question of the recognition of the uniqueness of her origins, due to the fact that she is the result of two founding peoples."
"An insoluble question, in any case, within the framework of a federal formula which has shown itself to be incapable of providing a satisfactory solution, since even the recognition of Quebec as a 'distinct society' within the framework of the Meech Lake Accord - which raised great hopes - could not succeed; likewise nor could the modification of the federal constitution by the Charlottetown Agreement."
"This tragedy of Canada and Quebec must encourage us to act very prudently and responsibly within Europe, for it shows that no lasting balance can be found when people feel that their sovereignty has been taken away from them."
"General de Gaulle highlighted this thirty years ago."
"And it is also the reason why we see today, across Europe but also elsewhere, so many federations falling apart."
"Of course, it is for the people of Quebec, as is their intention, to democratically give their opinion on their future and it is for us to respect their choice, whatever it may be."
"Moreover it could be, and this only appears to be a paradox, that the survival of Canada, with whom we are united by so many historic and friendly links, will be through the recognition of the sovereignty of its component parts."
"The President of the French Republic has just stated that, whatever Quebec's choice, France will accompany her on the path she decides to take."
"For our part, is it not for us to make clearly known, to both Canada and Quebec, that whatever the choice of the latter, Europe will accompany her on the path she chooses?"
"Willockx Report (A4-0255/97)"
"The Willockx report is the result of an initiative of the European Parliament which wanted to clarify, in its opinion, what the links between the convergence criteria for monetary union and the financing of the social security systems of Member States were."
"It came to such an embarrassing conclusion that it preferred to relegate it to the preamble, officially drawn up under the sole responsibility of the rapporteur, and to leave nothing but a tissue of platitudes in the final resolution this House has voted for."
"Indeed, this resolution, after having shown that it is difficult but necessary to reduce the deficit on social schemes (who would say otherwise?), gets round the problem by proposing to lighten taxation on labour in order to facilitate, in exchange, the levying of social security contributions."
"Thus this proposal brings no fundamental solution to the social deficit, nor to the wider problem of convergence criteria, for if you change taxation, you naturally have to look for economies elsewhere."
"The debate, however, must not end there."
"Monetary union will have plenty of other impacts on social schemes and the question of convergence criteria, although it is the most immediate, is not the most important."
"It is only the tip of the iceberg."
"Indeed, as the preamble shows, the most substantial consequences of monetary union will develop after it has come into effect: a centralized redistribution will have to be put in place on a European scale, for the benefit of less developed regions, notably in terms of their social security."
"Looking to evaluate the cost of this redistribution, the rapporteur quotes from studies that conclude that a European budget of around 5 to 7 % of Union GNP (as opposed to 1.2 % now) will be necessary."
"We here come up against the real difficulties of monetary union in the social sphere, difficulties that the citizens will discover in the future when they are already immersed in the new system, but which the Europe of Nations Group has denounced for a long time."
"It will be necessary to put in place, in the end, a European budget which is much bigger than the current one, with corresponding compulsory deductions which will cancel out the competitive advantages we will have been able to gain through the euro."
"Thus businesses and citizens will have made a fool's bargain."
"The link established by the report between the criteria for convergence and social security systems does not seem justified to me."
"Whilst our rapporteur has in no way challenged the pertinence of the criteria, I do not share his view that the convergence criteria would limit the margin for manoeuvre of Member States in their social mission."
"Indeed, once deficits go below the 3 % mark and have been reduced to the balance required by the pact for stability and growth, the states will have a true margin for manoeuvre: they will then have the possibility of increasing their deficit up to 3 % of GDP in order to face up to possible economic and social shocks."
"Similarly, whilst I approve of the fact that employers' contributions need to be reduced in order to reduce unemployment, a compensatory rise in other taxes would not be welcome."
"Under no circumstances must the safeguarding of our social security systems cause new increases in taxes on capital, as the rapporteur suggests."
"We would be going against much sought after economic efficiency, that is, against growth and employment, without managing to resolve the different social problems and deficits on our social accounts."
"On the contrary, it would be much wiser to rationalize our social security expenses without jeopardizing the social structure."
"To a certain extent the report is a recognition of the fact that the social situation in most of the EU's Member States is strained, mainly because of the struggle to achieve the EMU convergence criteria."
"In spite of that it is said that the policy of EMU must continue as the only option."
"There are many conclusions in the report which I find odd."
"That includes, for example, paragraph 4, where it says that in future there will be a need for more money in the social services sector because of increased pension and health insurance and that this increase in expenditure shall be compensated through reduced expenditure on child support and unemployment benefit."
"I cannot support that policy."
"To improve national finances it would be far better to save money on the military and the construction of motorways, but not on children - our future - and on those who have the most problems."
"However, the rapporteur is not satisfied with that, but is also demanding coordination of the tax system, i.e. that it be made into EU policy."
"If that were done large parts of the Swedish welfare system would collapse since the level of tax is higher in Sweden than in other countries and would therefore have to be reduced."
"There is no way that that would create any social security for the citizens."
"I do not share these visions of the social model of the future in the countries of the EU, and I have therefore voted against the report."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted for the report by Frederik A. Willockx, which is concerned with the relationship between EMU and the social security systems of the Member States of the European Union."
"The report finds that in trying to meet the convergence criteria, countries have restricted the room for manoeuvre in their budgets."
"The Danish Social Democrats agree with the above finding, but point out that restrictions in the room for manoeuvre in budgets have only occurred in those countries which have chosen to meet the convergence criteria by saving, while Denmark has chosen to boost its economy in order to meet the convergence criteria."
"The report calls for a better coordination of tax systems taking account of the Member States' different requirements for public amenities."
"The Danish Social Democrats agree that a better coordination of tax systems would be good in view of, amongst other things, the unfortunate situations we saw when Ireland drastically reduced its corporation tax and so took jobs away from other countries, including Denmark."
"The Danish Social Democrats would like to point out that social policy is still the concern of sovereign national states."
"I share the aims of the report regarding the need to ensure a high level of social protection within the European Union and the analysis noting that the convergence criteria limit the budgetary margin for manoeuvre which Member States have to fulfil their social mission."
"However, I am surprised by the unproven assertion that neither these criteria nor the date on which the euro comes into force can undermine the concerted efforts of the EU to create jobs, maintain social security and, if necessary, strengthen it!"
"On the contrary, in numerous countries of the EU, there are growing threats to the level of pensions or people's right to health care."
"No concrete measures have been put in place, alongside monetary union, to guarantee that the two objectives of healthy budgetary policy and quality employment and social security will be compatible."
"I am particularly sad that, by harmonizing social gains from above, the principle of social convergence has been abandoned and there is no social measure to achieve this."
"Finally, the Commission's White Paper strives to accommodate the growing insecurity of employment and even to justify it in the name of flexibility."
"The White Paper strives to favour the progression in Europe from a pensions system based on assessment to a mixed system with minimal guarantees for employees through assessment, the rest being ensured by pension funds."
"This would be an open door for a two-tier system of social security and for a long term swing towards capitalization, a system which is more unjust."
"I cannot approve of the report's support of the Commission's White Paper without some qualifications. Consequently, I am voting against the Willockx report."
"I agree that the Maastricht Treaty's requirements for EMU should not involve tearing down the welfare models of the Member States."
"In my opinion the risk that that will be the consequence of EMU is great."
"Therefore I cannot agree with the somewhat illogical conclusion that EMU must be carried out to the letter."
"I can agree even less that it will automatically lead to lower interest rates, promote employment and reduce social spending."
"On the contrary, there is a great risk that EMU will lead to the opposite, namely to increased regional imbalances, a massive centralization and de-democratization of economic policy and the risk of higher unemployment through the one-sided prioritizing of economic convergence criteria and the lack of corresponding requirements to increase employment."
"Proposals in the direction of a common tax policy are rejected while the committee's recommendations for switching tax from work to environmental discharges, natural resources, energy and consumption are approved."
"The negative proposals outweigh the positive."
"That is why I voted against the report."
"Because we do not agree with the idea of a common currency for the EU's Member States, we have decided to abstain from the vote on this report."
"However, we would like to make the observation that the rapporteur, in the conclusions to his explanatory statement, writes that the forthcoming intergovernmental conference must restore the balance between a unified monetary policy on one side and the Union's political authority on the other. We have misgivings that, when it has been implemented, EMU will be followed up by a common financial policy within the EU, strengthened in this report, even though the arguments on the issue are well disguised."
"Alber Report (A4-0276/97)"
"Strange coincidences sometimes occur in European affairs: at the same time as the Alber report of the European Parliament raises concerns about national resistance to the omnipotence of Community law, the draft amendment adopted at the Council of Amsterdam proposes to resolve the problem in a radical and, in our opinion, undemocratic way: to completely subordinate national constitutions to Community law."
"At European level, the Court of Justice has long proclaimed the superiority of Community law over national law."
"Moreover it draws this principle from deductive reasoning and not from the treaty itself, which has never contained a general rule on this subject (except the particular rule of article 189 regarding regulations)."
"The Court has not stopped there: it has proclaimed this superiority, not only with regard to previous guidelines but also to subsequent ones, which is more questionable."
"It has even stated that the superiority applies whatever the nature of the national standard, including fundamental laws as they are formulated by the constitution of a Member State or the principles of its national constitutional structure."
"It has finished by describing the treaty as the basic constitutional charter of the Community."
"In the face of this truly legal aggression, what has happened at national level?"
"At first, nothing."
"The authorities of final resort have endorsed the decision of the Court of Justice, governments have kept quiet, people have not understood the problem; the treaty has never been revised to include the so-called new principles clearly."
"But then, certain national constitutional courts, notably in Denmark and Germany, showed themselves to be concerned about the growing lack of democracy induced by the principle of absolute superiority of Community law."
"Had we not arrived, from logical deduction to logical deduction, at the conclusion that a simple regulation of the Commission could have greater value than a national law of referendum?"
"The Constitutional Court of Karlsruhe, in its ruling of 12 October 1993, the so-called 'Maastricht ruling', reacted the most clearly: it declares the superiority of the German constitution along with a national duty to protect the rights of German citizens in the face of possible excesses of Community law."
"It confirms that Community law is not applicable in cases where it oversteps the delegation of power agreed by the German people. It even mentions the possibility of a withdrawal from the Union if the constitutional rights of German citizens are not respected."
"So, Germany having authorized the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty, this ruling is the official interpretation of this treaty, with an equal value."
"In the face of this situation threatening supranational power, the European institutions have carefully considered their reply."
"Four years on, in 1997, they succeeded in including in the Amsterdam proposal, through the roundabout means of the protocol on subsidiarity, a clear guarantee of the authority of the Court of Justice: the application of the principle of subsidiarity does not infringe on the principles clarified by the Court of Justice regarding the relationship between national law and Community law, it said, as if these principles were already well established, as if they went without saying, and as if there were no question about them."
"Thus if the Amsterdam proposal is ratified, people will be approving, in a roundabout way, the total superiority of Community law, even regarding subsequent law, including laws passed by referendum, the complete subordination of national constitutions to Community law and the establishment of a federal European State, moreover of the most rigorous kind imaginable, that which purely and simply denies the right of people's self-determination."
"Let us dwell for a moment on the method used here: this reform, of great scope - we are all agreed - has never been clearly discussed at an intergovernmental conference."
"Nor has anyone drawn up a precise list of legal principles that the treaty would sanction if the protocol on subsidiarity were adopted."
"There is a complete lack of clarity, even though we are talking about sensible questions, extremely important for national sovereignty, where only precise and clearly delineated delegations of authority should be accepted."
"So, if we accept this fuzziness, we will be referring back to the Court of Justice for interpretations, which we know in advance will be as broadly as possible in favour of Community authority."
"This cannot be serious, and we ask ourselves what our negotiators can be thinking of, to want to make us accept such a makeshift job."
"In fact, the Europe of Nations Group has long outlined its counter proposals, notably in the draft report on the institutional nature of the European Union which I myself introduced and which, of course, was not supported by the ruling federalist majority in this Parliament."
"We consider that the network of values, of legal regulations, of solidarity which makes up our nations is the natural framework for the good exercise of democracy."
"The current European undertaking - consisting of destroying this and trying to build in its place an equivalent network covering the whole of the Union out of the well-stocked heads of Eurocrats - is a mad venture."
"It can only succeed, after having dismantled everything, in leaving our citizens in a vacuum, which cannot profit anyone."
"We therefore consider that it is necessary to protect the national democracies, and to build on this base, little by little, complementary cooperation at European level."
"Consequently, national constitutions and laws passed by referendum must be clearly recognized as the superior standards of the Union."
"The Court of Justice is not a supraconstitutional court, but a tribunal with responsibility for honestly interpreting a treaty, of which the rulings must be able to be submitted to the higher verdict of the people if they modify the initial concept of the rules."
"For all these reasons, we reject the Amsterdam proposals as well as the Alber report on Community law."
"Lindqvist (ELDR), Seppänen and Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL), Holm, Lindholm and Schörling (V), Bonde, Krarup and Sandbæk (I-EDN), in writing."
"(DA) The proposed resolution contains, firstly, a detailed rendition of one of the EU's basic integration mechanisms, i.e. the principle that EU law supplants national law (the principle of supremacy, paragraphs 1, 3-8, 10 and 13), secondly, a number of legislative recommendations, which are aimed at developing and strengthening the principle of supremacy and thereby integration (paragraphs 2, 11, 12 and 14-17), and thirdly, a dissociation from developments in certain parts of national legal systems whereby the facility provided by Community law to test secondary Community legislation is called into question (paragraph 9)."
"With the latter, the report is alluding partly to the practice of the German Constitutional Court based on the Maastricht ruling of 12 October 1993, and partly to the Danish Supreme Court's ruling of 12 August 1996, which allows the Danish Supreme Court to verify the meaning of the Danish Constitution in relation to the Maastricht Treaty."
"We are opposed to the trends which underlie the report's findings and recommendations."
"These trends will strengthen integration and reduce the importance of the national constitutional safeguard against the exercise of the EU's powers."
"We shall therefore vote against the report."
"We cannot vote for this report, since our view is that the EU should be a cooperation between sovereign and democratic states."
"Martens Report (A4-0274/97)"
"Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party voted against paragraph 87 of the resolution in the Martens report."
"We thought that it was not irrelevant to state why we did so."
"Paragraph 87 relates to a Commission proposal for a new cocoa directive."
"Everyone knows that that is a very complex and sensitive subject."
"It is a subject that requires detailed consideration."
"We cannot casually just state our opinion here on the occasion of another more comprehensive report, particularly as the proposal is now being dealt with in detail in the Committee on Environment and we will speak on it again in the next part-session."
"I can say that the PPE is in any case making every effort to contribute to it in every way it can so that there is a large majority in this Parliament lending its full weight to the necessary amendments to the Commission's proposal."
"We support the report, since it is based on the partnership principle and the fight against poverty and a greater concordance between development policy and agricultural policy."
"However, we cannot agree to paragraphs 84 and 85 because we think the WTO's trade rules should be followed in all areas."
"We think that exceptions to the WTO's trade rules are not sustainable in the long term, since they remove the necessary predictability which has to exist in the economies of all countries."
"The Commission's Green Paper on the future of relations between the European Union and the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) is an initiative with wide political implications, in terms of both strategic options and operations."
"The Commission, and particularly Commissioner João de Deus Pinheiro, the team leader, are therefore to be congratulated."
"The starting-point for a new Lomé Convention for the period from 2000 to 2010 is the awareness that the spirit and policy of Lomé are a basic element of the political identity of the European Union and that the four Lomé conventions which have already run their course represent the most advanced instrument of north/south cooperation."
"At the same time, it is assumed that economic globalization, which in theory penalizes the poorest, must be accompanied by a strengthening of solidarity with the weakest and that this dimension must go hand in hand with support for the sustainable development of those countries and giving them a stable place in the world economy."
"I should like to emphasize three profoundly innovative aspects of the policies of cooperation and support for development:"
"the establishment of forms of cooperation which transcend the traditional national level, with the object of strengthening the regional integration of the ACP countries' economies, particularly in Africa; -the selective nature of future cooperation, giving absolute priority to the poorest countries, which include most of the Portuguese-speaking African countries; -The creation of means of preventing conflict in all national and regional indicative programmes, thus ensuring greater political efficiency in the ratio between the means expended in humanitarian aid and the results achieved in armed conflicts, which, unfortunately, are so common in many of the countries in question.The report by our colleague Wilfried Martens, leader of the European People's Party, emphasizes all these ideas, reinforcing them with major innovative concepts, particularly in the case of the priority to be given in those countries to children, the war-wounded, the removal of mines, and also a total ban on the manufacture of anti-personnel mines and greater restrictions and control on the sale of arms."
"For all these reasons I support this report and appeal to my colleagues to do likewise."
"I have decided to vote for Mr Martens' report, in spite of reservations."
"The Commission's Green Paper was intended as a catalogue of ideas, but as such it is an imperfect draft."
"Mr Martens has put a lot of work into the report, but unfortunately the result is a compromise."
"A compromise which covers a large number of very significant points, most of which I agree with."
"The Lomé Convention is unique and should be maintained, of that there should be no doubt."
"But the Lomé Convention has not worked as well as it might."
"What I miss in Mr Martens' report are the guidelines and vision of how a new cooperation could be formed."
"I miss a direct criticism of the Commission's Green Paper and a prioritizing of the many substantial elements which Mr Martens has already withdrawn."
"A prioritizing in which I think that information about poverty and partnership - perhaps with more concrete content - should be given pride of place."
"Without these guiding visions and priorities, it will be difficult for the European Parliament to make a constructive contribution when the final European guidelines and negotiating mandate are to be drawn up."
"I voted for the Martens report for the following reasons:"
"1.Over the last 3 years within the ACP-EU Joint Assembly we have published, together with our ACP partners, pioneering concepts in central reports. These include, amongst others: the absolute necessity for cross-border regional cooperation in Africa; improved use of the instruments for industrial co-operation, e.g., support for young African entrepreneurs and for small and medium-sized businesses; development of the infrastructure from the coast into the interior of Africa for cross-border development of the whole region; the minimum requirements for urban development.Specific reports prepared by the Joint Assembly have been placed before the Commission, and they are to be included in the discussion mandate of the Commission and Council."
"2.A further key point of our concepts is subsidiarity and aid for self-assistance."
"A social and ecological market economy is only possible if the efforts of the NRO, national development aid and European cooperation are coordinated and combined."
"This is one firm outcome from our discussions with those concerned in Africa.3.We need to have a single, European, foreign policy towards our partners in the ACP countries, combining on the one hand peace safeguards, prevention of warlike conflict and humanitarian aid, and which also particularly encourages co-operative foreign economics and foreign trade with ACP countries, coordinating with that our development cooperation instruments.4.The new partnership, particularly with Africa, also demands greater efficiency and quality control of financial payments."
"Other necessary and vital practical changes which have to be decided within the framework of the new Convention are the financing of development cooperation as part of the communal budget, effective control by the European Parliament towards more efficient and more sparing use of means by the Committee on Budgetary Control, systematic encouragement of aid for self-help, and observance of the subsidiarity principle.Private local development organisations and the numerous development initiatives in Europe for the African Continent must be supported as a basis for the solidarity of the European population with that of Africa."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work."
"Indeed, I share his point of view on the Commission's Green Paper, which enables the fuelling of debate and a reflection on our future relations with our ACP partners. I would like to stress a few points which seem to me particularly important."
"Firstly, there is cause to rejoice in the initiative of the European Commission."
"In presenting this Green Paper, it enables a true debate to be established around different options, without it prejudging the proposals which will subsequently be made."
"The renewal, but above all the strengthening, advocated by the rapporteur of future relations between the EU and ACP countries entirely satisfies me."
"The 5th Convention will need to provide a global agreement applicable to all of the ACP countries, suited to unique institutions in order to promote interparliamentary dialogue and including tools adapted to the different levels of development of our partners."
"I am very favourable to the development of a level of regional cooperation which will better enable the prevention of certain crises."
"The approval of the cooperation by the populations in question seems to me to be a good way of ensuring greater transparency and accessibility of programmes."
"In the future, measures aimed at favouring the integration of ACP countries into the global economy must be taken concerning, notably, the setting up of true regional economic areas, the diversification of crops and produce and the modification of the rules of international trade."
"The EU must continue and deepen its relations with these countries and contribute, through a real partnership, to the fight against poverty, to the development of the awareness of environmental problems, to the involvement of civil societies and to a better awareness of the social dimension of the problems encountered."
"For all these reasons, I fully support my colleague's report."
"van Dijk Report (A4-0266/97)"
"Madam President, I should expressly like to congratulate Mrs Nel van Dijk on the report about animal transport."
"I believe this is the first step that we in Parliament have taken to get out of this situation, namely to make the conditions of animals at least more bearable."
"As a farmer, however, I should like also to say that animal suffering begins before transport."
"That is merely the last straw in what they have to undergo, because what we do to them is barbaric, how they are force-fed, how they are reared, how they are slaughtered."
"It is far removed from how we believe we can and ought to treat other creatures."
"It is no use rushing off to church on a Sunday to pray, and say that all creatures are God's creation, and then treat them like this."
"It is shameful and outrageous, what we get up to!"
"For this reason I am very pleased that this resolution has been passed in Parliament with such a large majority, because then people in the national parliaments may wake up and think for themselves what it means to live together in this creation, in this world."
"As I have said, animal suffering does not just begin with their transport, and I can but ask Mr Fischler to continue on the path towards finally changing his agricultural policy to one which includes the rearing of animals in a way appropriate to their species, finding a method of dealing with animals that is worthy of that description."
"Madam President, I want to express my delight at this report having been adopted without amendment. I congratulate the rapporteur."
"It marks an important further step forward in the laying down of proper requirements so long as we still have to carry on with the transport of animals."
"In my view, and in the view of a great many people, it is necessary that we work towards the elimination of any long-distance transportation of live animals."
"The transportation of meat should be in carcass form and not 'on the hoof' where animals can and do suffer very greatly."
"I am delighted to say that announcements have been made in Britain this week by the new Labour government that in future the rather cosy but unsatisfactory arrangements whereby transporters engage their own vets to do checks will be replaced by vets appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture in Britain."
"Transporters will have to pay for very stringent checks carried out by Ministry-appointed vets."
"Since it is essential in all this that we have proper inspection and monitoring of what is going on, this is going to be tightened up and assurances have been made that any transporters who offend against European regulations on these matters will instantly lose their licences for transportation."
"This is the only way we can ensure that decent and humane standards are applied."
"Madam President. May I first record for the minutes that both I and my colleague Karl Habsburg-Lothringen have voted, or intend to vote, against paragraphs 16 and 17."
"We are not quite sure if our machines have operated properly, but we intended to, and have, voted against paragraphs 16 and 17."
"I should like to explain on behalf of my Austrian colleagues in the VP, and also for Mr Frischenschlager in the Liberals, why we rejected the eight hour clause."
"This is not because we were in favour of a longer transport duration, but just the opposite: we consider eight hours too long, and in Austria we already have a maximum transport of six hours laid down in law."
"We shall certainly never tire of pressing in this Parliament for other European states, countries of the Union, to accept the six hour ruling."
"We were simply unable to vote for this measure, because anything else is for us cruelty to animals, and in our view should be prosecuted as a crime in all European countries."
"Madam President, I abstained on Mrs van Dijk's report even though I am naturally in favour of the protection of animals, and thus all measures enabling us to ensure their welfare during transportation, in particular over long distances."
"I have doubts for three reasons."
"Firstly, I believe that some of the measures are too strict, I am thinking of paragraph 16 regarding the length of eight hours."
"In placing the same requirements over all the countries, it raises some problems."
"I am not sure that all the consequences have been considered."
"Nor am I sure that all the economic consequences of this report have been considered as it initially related to the transportation of horses and has now been extended to the transportation of other animals."
"I think it would have been worth submitting this to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I finally, and on this point I will finish, question the absence of a measure. There is nothing regarding the occasional transportation of horses."
"As you know, many of our traditional holidays, particularly the traditional holidays of St. Éloi in Provence, bring in cattle trucks which transport horses occasionally over short distances."
"It would be good not too impose too heavy a constraint on these."
"This report is unrealistic and fundamentally flawed."
"Mrs Van Dijk reasserts the eight-hour transportation rule despite a compromise by Member States on this issue."
"Furthermore, she calls on the Commission to put an end to the granting of export refunds for the export to third countries of live cattle intended for consumption."
"The Greens are once again throwing out the baby with the bath water."
"The question of export refunds is a fundamental part of the support system of the CAP."
"Without export refunds, the EU's surplus beef will end up in new, costly and unwanted beef mountains."
"There is a demand for live cattle in third countries."
"If these cattle are not supplied by Member States then they will be found elsewhere."
"EU Member States, including Ireland, have taken considerable steps since January this year to improve transportation conditions for animals."
"If, as the Greens are demanding, export refunds are abolished, the demand for live cattle will not diminish and countries without protective legislation will gain - to the detriment of the animals."
"I voted against the van Dijk report because it would make it virtually impossible to transport live cattle out of Ireland."
"Irish beef producers have already been experiencing a severe financial crisis."
"If the proposals of the van Dijk report were to be implemented it would add to their problems."
"Many would not survive if they were denied the opportunity to sell cattle 'on the hoof' in non-Irish and non-European markets."
"If they were denied this facility they would be even more at the mercy of those that operate monopolies and cartels in the Irish cattle trade."
"Furthermore the record of Irish farmers in relation to animal welfare is an exemplary one."
"First and foremost, we can but regret the procedure established for this own initiative report of the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"In fact, it is not at all normal that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has been excluded from the legislative process and that it has never had the possibility of debating and giving its opinion on this subject, which has a direct impact on both the meat market, farmers and companies operating at all levels in the chain."
"The I-EDN Group asked for a roll call vote on two essential points."
"Point 16 of the motion for a resolution considers that the total journey time involved in the transport by road of animals intended for slaughter should not exceed eight hours."
"We of course voted against this point."
"In fact, in the guise of a report on an initiative regarding transportation of horses, the transportation of all animals is in fact covered by the text (cattle, sheep, etc.)."
"This parliamentary practice is totally abnormal."
"Point 35 calls on the Commission to put an end to the granting of export refunds for the export to third countries of live cattle intended for consumption."
"Let me remind you, on this precise point, that the European Union exports live animals to certain third countries, particularly the Arab world, who prefer to kill the animals themselves for religious reasons, because of refrigeration infrastructure or simply for employment."
"If we no longer export to these destinations, others will do it in our place."
"I wonder if there is not a connection between the pressure groups and certain third countries who wish to take part in the traditional market of the European Union."
"Finally, along the same lines, I am surprised that the same pressure groups, defenders of the welfare of live animals, do not concern themselves with the conditions of transportation of live animals imported into the European Union from third countries."
"The Committee on Transport, which is very close to these pressure groups, should have been able, for example, to ask for the withdrawal of the preferential treatment that we grant to certain third countries."
"Why penalize European exports without proposing to penalize imports?"
"As a member of the Committee on Agriculture, I can but remember that the European Union was built around a common agricultural policy integrating the notion of community preference."
"Everything is being done, within this very Parliament, to destroy the unity of European agriculture and agricultural policy."
"The transport of animals is characterized mainly by the cruelty, immorality and unethical treatment animals are forced to go through."
"In recent years we have seen many examples of this on our TV screens."
"The cornerstone must be that these transports cease."
"This report is, therefore, important and will mean a great advance for animals if it is adopted."
"This is especially true of paragraph 1, which states that animals should be slaughtered as close as possible to their place of origin, paragraph 16, which sets a maximum of eight hours for the length of time long-distance transports of animals may last without a break, and paragraph 35, in which the Commission is urged to stop paying export subsidies for the export to third countries of live animals intended for consumption."
"I consider these three points to be of great importance."
"If they become reality, I think it should be possible to avoid many of the problems which exist today."
"It is also important to make clear that these requirements are only minimum levels."
"It is up to individual countries or regions to introduce tougher rules regarding, for example, the time of transports."
"In view of the above, I am voting for the report in its entirety."
"Export subsidies should not go towards the transport of live animals at all."
"It is contrary to the whole intention of the report."
"The inspection of transports is primarily a national issue."
"New funds should not be granted for inspection services within the Commission."
"Detailed rules about the design of loading ramps etc. should be drawn up at public authority level and should not be included in the decision in principle."
"On the whole, the report is good, and I have therefore voted for it."
"I am voting against the van Dijk report on the transport of live animals because it is designed to make the whole business of trading in live cattle impossible."
"To put the proposals contained in this report into full effect would add so much to the cost of moving live animals that the price of Community meat would make it unacceptable to the consumer."
"The report ignores the fact that while relentless pressure exists on European farmers to concede free trade in agricultural products, we have no means to ensure that the costly standards we seek to impose on our own farmers will be observed by our competitors in third countries."
"A proposal contained in the report for the provision of mobile abattoirs is totally unrealistic and ignores the fact that the Commission has, through the use of EAGGF funds, encouraged the establishment of larger abattoirs and larger cattle markets in order to ensure lower costs and maintain higher standards."
"A proposal in paragraph 35 to withdraw export refunds from live cattle would seriously discriminate against farmers in remote regions where a live trade is necessary to ensure competition and maintain reasonable prices."
"The report under debate states that 'the long-distance transport of animals intended for consumption is not only undesirable but also unnecessary' ."
"I agree completely with this statement."
"There is no justification - economic, cultural or whatever - for subjecting animals to the cruelty which the live export trade involves."
"As leading EU figures gather in Amsterdam today to sign the new Treaty, it is appropriate that we should remember that one of the commitments they have agreed is to 'pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals' in implementing policies on agriculture, transport, internal market and research."
"If they are to honour this commitment, then the long-distance transport of live animals must end."
"In Ireland the livestock industry has been arguing ferociously that live exports, particularly to the Middle East and North Africa, are an essential source of revenue for Irish agriculture- The only reason why this is the case is that the authorities have focused on preserving this trade, to the detriment of other agricultural activities."
"Organizations such as the Irish Meat Processors Association have argued that it would make more sense for the government to end live exports and instead develop jobs in the meat processing sector by slaughtering animals in Ireland, instead of exporting them live."
"Sadly, successive governments have ignored these calls."
"About 1, 000 jobs are dependent on live exports from Ireland."
"The meat processing lobby estimates that three times that amount could be created if a slaughter at home policy was adopted as an alternative."
"The BSE crisis should have forced a re-evaluation of the issue."
"For years Egypt has been the main importer of Irish cattle but has now placed a ban on such imports because of fears of BSE contamination."
"Recent newspaper reports have indicated Egypt may be willing to lift the ban in the near future after an intense lobbying campaign by Irish officials."
"This would be a retrograde step, with dire consequences for animal welfare."
"Last year 5, 000 Irish cattle were stranded off the Egyptian port of Alexandria, with meagre food supplies, because the Egyptian authorities would not accept delivery."
"No amount of regulation could stop such events recurring if the government insists on maintaining its live exports policy."
"There have been several other documented instances of gross suffering to animals en route to the Middle East and North Africa."
"In February 1995, 140 cattle out of a consignment of 1, 000 bound for Egypt died when their ship entered the turbulent waters off the Bay of Biscay."
"In conclusion, I would suggest that simply tinkering around the edges of the problem will not end the inherent cruelty in long-distance live transports."
"New regulations on the vehicles used for transport and on rest periods for the animals involved are insufficient."
"I would urge all MEPs to campaign for a complete halt to long-distance live transports."
"Before commenting on the van Dijk report, as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would like to state my astonishment at the fact that a report concerning the transportation of horses and other live animals has not been put to the Committee on Agriculture for an opinion, given that it is directly concerned."
"Regarding the vote on this resolution, my group asked for a certain number of votes by division, separate votes, as well as two recorded votes in order to avoid issues being mixed up, withdrawing from this resolution the points which had been unjustifiably added and which did not concern its direct objective: the transportation of horses."
"The objective of this procedure being, of course, to isolate from this resolution anything that did not concern the transportation of horses."
"In fact, after pressure from certain associations and following a petition presented by the International League for the Protection of Horses, the 1991 directive had already been modified in 1995."
"It is completely abnormal that the Committee on Transport of the European Parliament, under the influence of these same pressure groups, should have undertaken this own-initiative report with the clear aim of challenging a text that was modified barely two years ago, and of which we know the difficulties of implementing."
"Our group asked for a recorded vote on point 35 and, naturally, voted against the proposed text."
"In fact, the Committee on Transport was hoping purely and simply to abolish all the export refunds for the export of live animals to third countries (including, of course, cattle)."
"I would like to remind you that the European Union exports to a certain number of third countries, notably Arab countries, almost 500, 000 head of live cattle."
"If we ourselves were to block our own exports to these countries, others would immediately take hold of this important market."
"As we know what the situation of the European market for beef is, we can obviously do nothing but resolutely oppose this proposal."
"We note with surprise that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has not proposed the abolition of the tariff advantages we grant to certain third countries regarding imports of live animals into the EU."
"This inconsistency clearly demonstrates the real intentions of the instigators and initiators of this text: once more pressure groups are using this as a pretext to try to dismantle the common agricultural policy and system of community preference."
"That concludes the votes."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 2 October 1997."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would like your help on a matter concerning the Minutes of Friday 19 September."
"I attended the sitting that day, as I always do. I took part in the recorded votes and stayed until the sitting was closed."
"A certain element in the media has accused me of claiming the daily allowance for that sitting without being entitled to do so."
"These statements were refuted by the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, by myself, and by other Members of this Parliament, and I believe the President himself has intervened, but nevertheless certain elements in the Spanish media have used the situation to attack me personally."
