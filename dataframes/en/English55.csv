"Text"
". Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Thors, and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mrs Corbey, for their hard work on this legislative proposal, on which we are close to a first-reading agreement, following a swift and constructive interinstitutional dialogue."
"Allow me to draw your attention to the principal elements of the Commission's proposal to replace the framework directive of 1989 on materials and articles in contact with food."
"First, the proposal extends the scope of the regulation to include innovative types of packaging, known as 'active' and 'intelligent', and provides the general legal framework for their safe use."
"It sets the general principles of safety and labelling and allows for additional rules, if necessary, to be adopted in implementing measures."
"Second, the proposal will ensure better traceability and labelling of materials and articles intended to come into contact with food."
"Third, it increases transparency and legal certainty for operators, by describing the procedure for the authorisation of substances used for food contact materials."
"Finally, the proposal will give the possibility to adopt not only directives, but also decisions or regulations, as the latter are more appropriate for certain provisions, such as lists of authorised substances."
"The proposal is in the interests of both consumers and industry."
"It would enhance harmonisation of different sectors of materials in contact with food, including recycled materials and active and intelligent packaging."
"I am grateful in particular to Mrs Thors for her intense efforts to adopt the proposal in first reading."
"The Commission supports these efforts."
"We can therefore accept all amendments that are part of the compromise package that is the result of close contact between the three institutions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are about to see the approval of a framework for our food packaging."
"It feels almost like a symbolic act because we have almost concluded all the legislative work surrounding the Green Paper on Food Law."
"After everything else we have successfully resolved, we are now to create an overall framework."
"I hope we succeed."
"I wish to emphasise that we are concerned here with approving the principles that are to apply to material that comes into contact with food."
"We are not approving new materials as such, but saying how matters should proceed."
"In my view, the fact that we are laying down guidelines and establishing limits for what is to be approved is an example of good legislation."
"In the future too, packages will on many occasions have to be expressly approved in the light of the particular substances and food they are to be used for."
"For example, what is the fat content of the food with which the material comes into contact?"
"I can guarantee consumers that we shall continue to be cautious so that, for example, phthalates are not released from soft plastic."
"As the Commissioner said, there are three principal new developments: the new administration, and thus transparency, resulting from the setting up of a European Food Safety Agency; the new principles incorporated into food legislation; and, finally, the opportunity to approve active, intelligent packaging."
"A majority in Parliament appears to be prepared to accept active packaging, that is to say packaging that can absorb oxygen and moisture in the environment or give off antioxidants."
"Research projects carried out demonstrate, for example, that tomatoes and fruit retain their proper form for longer in the active packaging."
"Correctly used, I believe that they can in actual fact lead to fewer additives."
"That would be an advantage, because we are concerned about a possible link between additives and the increasing number of allergies."
"I personally prefer active packaging around my bread."
"I myself came across an unopened package after two years and found the bread completely unchanged."
"As we said, active intelligent packaging should entail advantages for both consumers and manufacturers."
"I can also envisage situations in which such packaging helps us save energy, something which would of course be of value."
"One of the conditions of our approving the new types of packaging is that they should be compatible with Community legislation generally."
"The substances that have been allowed into food must be approved, and active packaging must not be misleading to consumers."
"A bad smell must not be covered by another smell."
"Intelligent packaging can provide us with information about the way in which food has been stored and thus show whether it has been stored suitably."
"We know, for example, that certain smoked food can be difficult to store in the right way."
"Let us hope that, in the future, intelligent packaging will be developed that shows, for example, how smoked fish has been treated and whether it has been treated properly."
"We know that, in this connection, problems have sometimes arisen involving listeria."
"As the Commissioner said, we shall have discussions concerning the recycling of material, for the requirements have become stricter when it comes also to the use of plastic, metal and paper in packaging."
"It is important for new regulations, backed by this regulation, to be adopted and for us to know with certainty that food packaging needs to be approved to ensure that it is safe."
"More rules concerning traceability will be adopted, supported by, and in line with, the previously adopted legislation."
"In its work, Parliament has tried to emphasise that the information to be preserved is that which is needed for investigating problems that may arise later."
"I also believe that the rules on traceability that we are now laying down are important if all the parties are to have equal opportunities to be suppliers to large chains of food stores."
"I am pleased that we have set out clear rules governing the language used and public access to records."
"That aspect of the Commission’s proposal was not entirely clear."
"Had there been more rules on the subject of unambiguous, binding regulations to promote sound administration, we should probably have avoided a number of amendments."
"That was not, however, the case."
"We therefore need to clarify matters here and now."
"For my part, I regret the fact that the Council and the Commission did not wish to approve the independence of the Food Agency."
"I hope that we can adopt this report at a single reading."
"That would be the case if we were to vote in favour of blocks one and two."
"That would be in keeping with the position at which we had arrived in our negotiations with the Council and with what COREPER approved last week."
"I see no reason, however, for approving Amendment No 17."
"I wish to thank the Commission and the Council for their constructive cooperation."
"Above all, I wish, however, to say a big thank you to the secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as well as to our helpful official, Mrs Köykkä, for her excellent work."
"It has been a pleasure to collaborate with her."
". Mr President, Mrs Thors, many thanks for your work."
"I think it would be a very good idea to round this off in a first-reading agreement."
"It is a fairly technical dossier, but I think that we will get a fair distance with it."
"The internal market makes it necessary to harmonise regulations for the food industry and for packaging."
"New developments require new standards."
"Active and intelligent materials and objects are just such new developments."
"Active materials interact with food in order to maintain or improve the condition of the food during its storage and to extend its shelf life."
"Intelligent materials are being designed to provide information on the condition of food."
"A possible development is a packaging material that changes colour when the milk in it turns sour or the food in it begins to perish."
"These are all interesting developments and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy wholeheartedly supports the Commission’s proposals, although it does have a few comments on these developments."
"Firstly, active and intelligent materials must not be used to mislead the consumer."
"The opportunities to do this exist, but we would like to state very emphatically that this is not the intention."
"Secondly, traceability is necessary, but our committee believes that this need not go all the way back to the tree from which a paper bag is made."
"A good system is sufficient."
"Thirdly, the consequences for trading partners must not be inequitable, and no unnecessary trade barriers should be erected, particularly for developing countries."
"I understand that some solutions have been put forward in this regard."
"Finally, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is calling for the barriers to the use of recycled materials to be eliminated."
"We cannot have a situation in which recycling is encouraged on the one hand and recycled materials are not permitted onto the market on the other."
"Food safety is of course the yardstick in this area."
"In short, our committee wants to see modern technologies being used for the benefit of the consumer and the environment."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Thors for this report and all her work on it."
"It confirms my already high opinion of her parliamentary talents."
"She will be a sad loss to this Parliament when she goes back go Finland."
"Here we have an active and intelligent packaging of a Commission proposal."
"It has received broad support in our committees and in the responses from the Council and the Commission, which I found to be entirely constructive."
"If we could do this more often, everybody's life would be simpler."
"However, there were certain questions that we had to raise."
"One was the extent to which traceability would be possible."
"I am glad that Mrs Thors took on board my own amendments. I accept her advice that we should not vote for Amendment No 17."
"Had she told me to go the other way, I would have done."
"I believe that the issue of public openness on this matter is one we should take into account."
"Another point that some of us are slightly concerned about – and it comes up time after time in these debates – is the precise role of the European Food Safety Authority."
"Time after time the mantra comes up that there will be a reference to EFSA, that it will do this or that."
"We were due to have heard from the chief executive of EFSA this week."
"That has been postponed."
"Where we are moving towards greater food safety, safer food packaging, better labelling and so on, we should not require EFSA to do all the work."
"Where there is a measure of derogation built into this, all of the Member States seem to be reasonably happy with it."
"Where the Commission has done a good job, we should move ahead and see how far the existing institutions can do it for themselves."
"I wish this report well and equally Mrs Thors."
"I congratulate her on this report."
"Mr President, I must first say how sorry I am to have arrived late for the debate, meaning that I did not hear the rapporteur’s introduction."
"Please do excuse me, but the debate began a little earlier than scheduled."
"We have chosen to accept the compromise agreed upon."
"We believe it to be reasonable, even if we should like to have gone further in certain areas, for example when it came to the content of Article 17."
"We have nonetheless chosen to approve the compromise."
"We are fairly sceptical about the active and intelligent materials."
"We nevertheless believe that the compromise is sound overall because it constitutes a clear improvement upon the original proposal."
"That is a constructive step along the road."
"Finally, I wish to emphasise that, in our opinion, traceability is very important."
"Mr President, the Commission's proposal emphasises the introduction of two new types of packaging in contact with food: what is known as 'active' packaging, which releases preservatives into the food, and what is known as 'intelligent' packaging, which warns consumers when the food has gone off or has some undesirable characteristic."
"Even though the rapporteur has attempted to improve the labelling rules, the decision-making procedures, including the procedure for authorisation by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and access to public documents, the report, as it stands, is still unacceptable to the Greens."
"Whereas Community legislation on food additives is regulated in great detail, the Commission's proposal simply introduces a general procedural framework, putting great emphasis on comitology."
"The door is left wide open for the introduction of active packaging, without providing a strict framework for specific substances."
"We have been fighting for a very long time against the ever-increasing exposure of consumers to a whole host of additives and we refuse to let these become more widespread, which would be damaging to health."
"The Greens therefore request that authorisation should be withheld from active packaging whose effects are not known, that it should be ensured that there are no toxic products in active packaging, and that Community legislation on food additives should be applied strictly if new food packaging is authorised."
"If our proposals are rejected, we will be obliged to vote against this report, which does not adequately consider the possible consequences for consumer health."
"How long will it be before we see urgent recalls of certain future types of packaging?"
". Mr President, allow me once again to underline my appreciation of Mrs Thors' excellent work, and to welcome the progress that has been made."
"After only three months of fruitful collaboration between the three institutions, we are very close today to a first reading agreement."
"If this is achieved, it will certainly be a record in terms of time."
"Mrs Thors in her earlier contribution made reference to the near completion of the work that we have been undertaking – the necessity to put in place the legislation referred to in the White Paper on food safety."
"I am happy to say that we have nearly completed that work."
"Perhaps we can reflect and congratulate ourselves on our hard work over the last four and a half years when we have worked well together to achieve these results."
"I understand Parliament’s wish to accelerate the Commission’s proposal on recycled plastics."
"I also appreciate the clarifications provided on certain aspects, notably on traceability, the authorisation procedure and the provisions on active and intelligent packaging."
"To conclude, I am pleased to accept the entire compromise package."
"I think I am correct in saying that this is Mrs Thors' last report, so let me congratulate her on it and on her work in Parliament and wish her well in her future career."
"– Thank you very much, Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon."
". – Although we are without doubt enriched by the food from the widest possible range of countries that is to be found on the shelves of our supermarkets, consumers want to have confidence that products are safe and of high quality, and we have to create the conditions under which they can."
"As rapporteur of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I welcome the revision of Framework Directive 89/109/EEC, and thank Mrs Thors for her good cooperation."
"The Group of the European People’s Party has called for a number of crucial amendments in order to make packaging, and thus also food, safer in future."
"Much as the proposal for a labelling system using the legend ‘suitable for food contact’ or the symbol of a stylised glass and fork is to be welcomed, we demand that an exception be made for items that it cannot be doubted are intended for contact with food (for example, cups, glasses, etc), thereby avoiding excessive bureaucracy."
"We also welcome the extension of the traceability principle to the materials used, although this must not result in over-regulation; it would, for example, be nonsensical for every item of paper packaging to have to indicate the origin of every tree."
"As these are always mixtures, this is not technically feasible."
"Provided that the plenary agrees to these demands, the Group of the European People’s Party endorses the compromise negotiated with the Council."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0172/2004) by Mr Goodwill, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases (COM(2003) 492 – C5-0397/2003 – 2003/0189(COD))."
". Mr President, I should like to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Goodwill, for the work done on this report on the Commission's proposal for a regulation on certain fluorinated gases."
"I am grateful for the constructive approach shown by Parliament and the rapporteur to a number of elements in this highly technical legislative proposal."
"They know that this proposal can help the European Union to meet its Kyoto commitments."
"Fluorinated gases, as defined in the Kyoto Protocol, accounted for 65 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, that is, 2% of the total EU greenhouse gas emissions in 1995, but are forecast to increase to 98 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent – from 2% to 4% – in 2010 under business as usual."
"For example, in the refrigeration and air conditioning sectors there is a strong upward trend in the use of fluorinated gases due to the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances."
"Our proposal addresses these rising trends."
"This proposed regulation, by introducing cost-effective mitigation measures, could reduce projected emissions by around 23 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2010 and obtain even greater reductions later."
". Mr President, we are all familiar with the principle of substitution, the substitution of a more environmentally friendly or more healthy product for another one which is environmentally damaging or damaging to health."
"In many ways the use of fluorinated gases has already exhibited the principle of substitution, given that many applications that were previously used with CFCs have been substituted with HFCs."
"As we know, CFCs are much more environmentally damaging than HFCs, being ozone-depleting gases which we have very successfully grappled with under the auspices of the Montreal Protocol."
"HFCs are greenhouse gases like CO2 and, as the Commissioner said, whatever action we take on control of fluorinated gases, it cannot be at the expense of the action we need to take to control CO2."
"HFCs are a drop in the ocean in relation to CO2."
"First of all I would like to make a point about the legal base."
"There has been much discussion about this, but I am firmly of the opinion that Article 95, the single market, is the correct legal base."
"If we were to use Article 175 it would make marketing of products containing these gases almost impossible across the whole of the European Union."
"Whilst I understand the situation, for example, in Austria, where they have gone further, in the interests of the single market we should maintain the legal base."
"There are a number of applications of HFCs, from air conditioning to air-sole trainers and to aerosol fake snow, for example, which we had a little bit of fun about in the press at Christmas."
"But this proposal is primarily about containment, not banning."
"In fact there are a number of applications where no alternative is possible, for example fire protection and the use of sulphur hexafluoride in switch gear."
"If we were to go along with one of the proposals that the Verts/ALE Group made, the lights would go out all over Europe!"
"With regard to vehicle air conditioning – and it is one side-effect of global warming that more people have air conditioning in their cars – the proposal was to replace HFC134a, with a global warming potential of 1300, with the more environmentally benign HFC152a, with a global warming potential of 140."
"I can see people in the gallery already nodding off, and that is why Parliament decided that we should take a bold step to actually phase out the use of HFCs in air conditioning and substitute them with the new developing technology involving CO2."
"Under the Commission's proposal there was a very complex quota system which looked as if it should start in 2009."
"In practice, however, as 20% of the vehicle fleets of most manufacturers are not fitted with air conditioning, these manufacturers would have met the first step of the quota system without doing anything."
"So actually the Commission's proposal would have started in 2010."
"The quota system is complex and would only have worked very well with a company that had a range of products which fitted conveniently into these 20% steps."
"Most manufacturers do not have a product line-up that fits in quite that way."
"And of course there was a massive loophole in the whole system, a loophole big enough to drive a Rolls Royce through, in that manufacturers could as an alternative pay a 200 euro fine for not complying with the directive."
"I suspect the manufacturers of some large expensive cars would do that rather than spend money on re-engineering."
"We also have the fact that HFC152a is flammable, which may cause some problems with regard to safety."
"That was not the final solution, and we think that using CO2, maybe a little bit later, would be a much more effective compromise."
"That is why I am very pleased that the PSE Group has prevailed on me and made me see sense and that we have Compromise Amendment No 112, which says that, based on type-approval, we should phase out the use of HFCs and substitute with CO2 from 2012, with a two-year exemption, or two-year delay at least, for some of the smaller manufacturers – what we call the Porsche exemption –, moving towards CO2, which is a much better goal, not only environmentally, but politically too."
"We also need some changes to the first line of Annex 2, which I am sure the sessional services will take care of if the compromise amendment goes through, substituting '50' for the global warming potential and putting type-approval in."
"Not all air conditioning systems are mobile: some of them are in stationary applications such as buildings like this one."
"This monstrous waste of taxpayers' money is cooled using HFCs!"
"In the case of buildings, it is important that we control leakage, and inspection and control of leakages are included in the Commission's proposal, which we support."
"But we should also reward good practice by reducing the number of inspections where leakage is not occurring, as well as stepping up the number of inspections where we have leaks."
"Finally, I would like to thank Mr Lange and Mrs Corbey for making me see sense, and Mr Davies for finally coming round to our way of thinking."
"It has been a very interesting journey and I just hope that the people in the gallery do not think we spend all our time talking about these boring technical subjects."
". Mr President, first of all I apologise for being breathless."
"The brevity of colleagues today has brought this debate forward slightly to the point where I was not quite expecting to be called to speak so early."
"Nevertheless, perhaps we can finish before the dinner break."
"I congratulate Mr Goodwill, who has written a good report and taken on board many of the comments and remarks made by colleagues."
"We are moving towards a document which will carry to the Council many of the points that we have raised and will be a sound basis for further work in the next Parliament."
"As a Geordie to a Yorkshire man, I have to say, 'Th'as done good, lad'."
"That being said, there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved."
"I hope we can get unity in this House for the change of legal base to a double legal base."
"It makes sense."
"In many respects this directive has two purposes, both to regulate the industrial market and also to protect the environment."
"We are trying to protect the environment, to remove from use, gradually and steadily, fluorinated gases, or Fgases as they are called."
"Useful though they have been to replace CFCs, HFCs themselves present problems, particularly with their global warming potential, and we have a responsibility to gradually reduce their use, but in a way that is logical, not too expensive, and where there are proven and viable alternatives."
"Our biggest step forward and our biggest technological push is unquestionably the replacement of HFCs in car air conditioning systems."
"These systems are produced in their millions, their leakability is notorious – I know of colleagues at home who have had to have their air conditioning systems refilled two, three or four times."
"I do not accept that the solution is simply to reduce the number of leaks."
"The solution is to move to a different kind of gas that does not present the problems that HFCs clearly do in that sector."
"As regards uses in other areas, there are some key and essential uses and we want to examine them carefully before we move forward with an amendment that originated with me – Amendment No 89 – which asks for an orderly phase-out over a period of time after this directive is brought into force."
"I hope the Commission can agree to that amendment."
"It gives it flexibility and a task to perform, but in a steady, logical way for which it will no doubt come back to this House for approval."
"We will not immediately be looking to remove HFCs from fire-fighting uses, where they are clearly very useful and the alternatives are, in my opinion, not yet proven."
"We will not want to remove the ban from refrigerators, where there are certain medical uses which are essential."
"The motto with this proposal is 'forward, but with a degree of prudence'."
"– Mr President, the use of chloroflourocarbons has decreased significantly, as the switch has been made to the use of hydroflourocarbons in refrigeration systems, aerosols and other applications."
"The Montreal Protocol was an attempt to eliminate CFCs, as these gases are harmful to stratoshperic ozone."
"The report before us is necessary because HFCs are not entirely harmless either: they are powerful greenhouse gases."
"Their global warming potential is a hundred or even a thousand times greater than that of carbon dioxide."
"Furthermore, it can take a very long time for these gases to disperse in the atmosphere."
"Accordingly, the danger of climate change means there is also an obligation to restrict the use of HFCs."
"I myself was active and put forward the amendments on air conditioning systems in vehicles in particular."
"My own view is that the best solution with regard to overall emissions is to switch to systems that use carbon dioxide."
"According to a recent news item, a certain Japanese car manufacturer has already switched over to the use of this technology on the production line, and European manufacturers ought to follow suit."
"Carbon dioxide is, moreover, user-friendly, because it reacts faster than HFCs to the desired temperature and is also cheaper in terms of fuel costs than the alternative gases available."
"The slightly higher price at present of carbon dioxide systems is marginal from the point of view of the consumer price of air conditioning equipment, and when mass production starts, the economies of scale will ensure that its relative cost may start to change."
"The compromises proposed by our rapporteur and agreed by the committee are not entirely in harmony with my own amendments, but I can accept them as an improvement on the original proposals."
"I think the timetable that will now be adopted is too slow from the point of view of climate change, especially as there has been a dramatic increase in the use of air conditioning in vehicles in recent years."
"All in all, then, the role of private transport in combating climate change is more important than ever."
"With stationary systems it is essential to ensure that those who fit the equipment are properly trained and that such professional people produce reports on leakage."
"In this way it will be possible on the one hand to minimise emissions and, on the other, to make certain that reports are in fact produced, which is vitally important from the point of view of monitoring."
"In this respect imposing restrictions will hopefully swiftly make an impact."
"Mr President, Mr Goodwill, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament has been intensively dealing with the problem of climate change for the past five years."
"Fortunately, our work is becoming increasingly more specific; we are now also taking real measures."
"On behalf of my group, I would like to state that we are generally satisfied with the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I would therefore like to thank Mr Goodwill very much for his work."
"What we have before us is a balanced result."
"In the battle against climate change, emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases must be reduced as much as possible."
"We therefore wholeheartedly support the committee in its attempts to tackle the biggest sources of emissions."
"These are refrigeration and air-conditioning installations, mobile air-conditioning installations and foam products."
"Two things still require some attention."
"After much discussion, my group would like to be a little more flexible with regard to the gases in fire protection systems."
"The emissions from these are extremely low and are only released in the event of a fire."
"In our opinion, consumer safety is a very high priority."
"We would like to ban fluorinated greenhouse gases, but only in cases where this is actually possible and where there are alternatives."
"A large proportion of emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases stems from the use of air-conditioning in cars."
"We have paid a great deal of attention to this, and rightly so, and in this regard I would like to thank Mr Goodwill again for his willingness to compromise."
"Many people are not aware of the negative impact air-conditioning can have on the environment and our climate."
"The fact that the use of air-conditioning increases fuel consumption in the car is far more widely known."
"In many countries, including my country, the Netherlands, it is actually unnecessary to have or to use air-conditioning."
"It is different in southern countries."
"In view of the negative effects of the fluorinated greenhouse gases in air-conditioning, I would like to call for them to be phased out as soon as possible."
"I personally would rather see this by 2009 than by 2011."
"What is certainly important is that we choose Article 175 as the legal basis."
"Member States must have the opportunity to take further-reaching measures, particularly in view of the geographical differences and the fact that air-conditioning is superfluous in northern countries."
"Member States must therefore have the opportunity to discourage air-conditioning in cars."
"Perhaps we should go even further in order to limit the installation of air-conditioning in cars."
"For example, the Commission could take a look at energy efficiency requirements for cars with all the on-board equipment switched on full, as these luxury accessories in particular cancel out any improvement in the energy efficiency of engines."
"That is definitely not a good example of sustainable development."
"In short, we would like the result achieved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to be accepted by the plenary session, with some amendments."
"Mr President, this is a good practical proposal from the Commission for doing something about global warming and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, because, although the total quantity of greenhouse gases being produced from air conditioning and refrigeration equipment is not vast, the amount is growing very substantially year by year – it is expected to increase 15 times between 1995 and 2010."
"The committee has rejected some of the key proposals from the Commission on mobile air conditioning."
"I hope it has made the position for the car industry clearer."
"However, I am not sure that the way in which we have thrown out some of the opportunities for flexibility is really the most appropriate course of action, so we shall wait to see what the Council of Ministers has to say about that and, no doubt, return to this debate."
"Most of all, I regret that the Socialist Group and the European People's Party have done this deal on pushing the date for the introduction of vehicles using carbon dioxide back to 2011 from the original proposal of the committee for 2009."
"That is not ambitious enough, certainly not for a first reading, when we have so many negotiations yet to come."
"I know it takes manufacturers many years to design a vehicle to put on the market."
"A few years ago no one used air conditioning – I have never bought a car with air conditioning."
"What do we say to future generations?"
"We did not take action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and global warming as fast as we could, because we all wanted to drive around in cooler cars in the summer."
"However convincing the industry's arguments may be now, they will look pretty weak in years to come."
"Mr President, I am also very disappointed with this report."
"It has not done nearly enough."
"It could and should have done a lot more to replace enormously powerful greenhouse gases with environmentally less harmful alternatives."
"I disagree with Mr Goodwill on the legal base."
"I still believe that Article 175 is the necessary and logical legal base."
"As far as mobile air conditioning is concerned, it is disappointing that the committee has failed to take note of those parts of European industry that are already committed to delivering CO2 mobile air conditioning as soon as possible."
"The technology is there and it works well, so there is no reason why a phase-out of F-gases cannot begin in 2007."
"Beginning this phase-out two years later, as the current draft report provides for, would mean pumping the equivalent of an additional 80 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere."
"Whilst the proposed phase-out for mobile air conditioning is at present unacceptable, there is no phase-out provided for at all for the use of F-gases in many other applications where alternatives are available."
"I believe that should be remedied."
"That is a serious omission."
"Domestic refrigerators using HFCs are left untouched by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy's report, despite EU markets already being dominated by hydrocarbon, greenfreeze technology."
"I hope that Parliament will vote to support alternative, climate-friendly technologies and take the big opportunity that stands in front of us to do something serious about the environment, rather than letting the single market ride roughshod over these very important concerns."
"It is a pity that Mr Goodwill did not read our amendments more carefully."
"Far from leading to the lights going out, the Green amendments specifically called for the phase-out of SF-6 with the exception of switch gear."
"So let us have a debate based on the facts, not on the myths."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his good cooperation, as well, of course, as the other Members of this House who are present here today."
"I think we have ended up looking in the right direction, especially as regards the issue of air-conditioning in cars, about which something has to be done, and, for the benefit of, among others, our visitors, let me say that what was agreed in Kyoto is binding in law within the European Union."
"What the decisions of 2002 and of 10 March this year mean is that this is binding in the European Union whether Russia ratifies or not, so we too have to do something about this."
"I think the facts are there for all to see."
"The first fact is that more and more cars have air-conditioning; it is fitted in 80% of all new vehicles, and every year these units discharge between about 8% and 10% of the gases that damage the climate."
"The second fact is that alternatives of various kinds are in the process of development."
"I think it is perfectly clear that we have to go down the road of seeking out the safest alternatives possible with the absolute minimum of global warming potential."
"Thirdly, that alternative is in fact a CO2-based air conditioning unit with a global warming potential 1 300 times less than at present."
"Fourthly, I believe that we have to adopt the same approach to the type approval of new cars as we do to everything else, as construction, involving the energies of engineers, plays a part in that, and we have to demand, as soon as possible, new air conditioning systems."
"Fifthly, CO2-based air conditioning systems are European technologies and European products, which, I think, also makes it apparent that, if we move on down this road, from f-gases to CO2-based air conditioning systems, the air-conditioning system of the future will indeed no longer be a climate-killer; on the contrary, the air conditioning unit of the future can also be a hit where European jobs are concerned."
". Mr President, let me comment on the amendments and come back to the purpose and scope of the proposal, because a significant number of the amendments proposed by Parliament, such as better or new definitions of terms, reinforce and clarify the Commission's proposal, and the Commission can accept many of them to a greater or lesser degree."
"The Commission also welcomes a number of amendments that strengthen the provisions on containment and inspections and the training and certification of personnel involved in containment."
"It is important to say that this proposal is only a first step."
"The Commission has indicated that it will look at a number of other issues, such as foams."
"Consequently, it cannot accept the amendments on recovery, in particular in relation to foams."
"Further action needs to be based on the careful assessment of the benefits and the costs."
"Neither can the Commission accept amendments that would either weaken the proposed inspection system of air conditioning and stationary refrigeration or put in place additional requirements as regards training and certification of personnel, both for the Commission and the Member States that have not been evaluated."
"An important part of this proposal is the reporting system, which will enable the Commission to check the accuracy of emissions reported to the UN Convention on Climate Change and to support possible further action."
"The Commission proposal tries to ensure that the necessary information can be collected without imposing too onerous a reporting system on industry, especially SMEs."
"In this context, the Commission cannot accept a number of amendments."
"The Commission believes that its proposal on use bans and the phase-out of some products and equipment containing fluorinated gases is based on a careful evaluation of all sectors and is balanced and cost-effective."
"Consequently, it cannot support the amendment that would remove the derogation for small magnesium dye-casters using less than 500 kg per annum."
"The cost for this limited number of small and medium-sized enterprises to convert to an alternative would be high, hence the exemption."
"There are two other bans that deserve comment."
"The deletion of the ban on perfluorinated carbons in fire fighting cannot be justified since, apart from some minor uses, the market has already moved to other alternatives."
"As regards aerosols containing fluorinated gases, the new definition would exclude a number of novelty aerosols, while the inclusion of pharmaceutical aerosols in the exemption category could be a big loophole."
"On the sensitive issue of the phase-out of the fluorinated gases in mobile air conditioning in vehicles, the Commission notes with interest the amendments to ban fluorinated gases, essentially HFC134a in mobile air conditioning in new vehicle models from 1 January 2009, and that a ban should apply to all new vehicles from 1 January 2014."
"The Commission prefers to remain with its overall position on mobile air conditioning, given other amendments that reject the quota system and ban all fluorinated gases used in mobile air conditioning with a global warming potential over 50, rather than 150, as proposed by the Commission."
"The latter would effectively exclude the use of fluorinated gas mixtures or HFC152a and favour CO2 mobile air conditioning systems."
"Finally, as regards the legal basis, the Commission is proposing that the regulation be based on Article 95 – the internal market – and cannot support amendments that propose that the regulation be based on a dual legal basis."
"The Commission believes that while the environmental objective of reducing emissions of fluorinated gases is paramount, the main thrust of the proposal is more relevant to the functioning of the internal market and Article 95."
"In conclusion, I should like to underline that the Commission supports many of the amendments proposed for the first reading, and Parliament, by acting so quickly, sends an important message to the Council that there is now a need for increased focus on this proposal with the aim of reaching a final conclusion as quickly as possible."
"I will hand over to the secretariat a list summarising the Commission's position on each individual amendment(1)."
"Thank you for this debate."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0193/2004) by Mrs Paulsen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on a European environment and health strategy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps I have a certain ability to come across as being particularly motherly but, being very often out and about among people, I am able to confirm that there is genuine anxiety and fear among our electorate, that is to say the people we represent."
"People are in actual fact afraid."
"They have, for example, been afraid of what is contained in food, of mad cow disease, of additives and of pesticide residues."
"Parliament, the Commission and the Council have in actual fact tackled the issue as a whole, and we are now perhaps putting the last pieces of the puzzle in place when it comes to thinking about food safety."
"We now have sound, comprehensive legislation."
"There is also a fear of chemicals of all types."
"I wish to commend the Commissioner for her work on forming a comprehensive view – which may perhaps constitute a model for the rest of the world – of the use of chemicals in Europe."
"It is these matters that have begun to be tackled."
"Air pollution and climate change have also been addressed."
"Right now, the European tabloids and popular press all too often discuss the fear of radiation – most recently from mobile phones and attendant transmitter masts."
"There is so much that is unknown and to be afraid of."
"I have inherited this report and did not write it myself."
"I rather think that it is a little too far-reaching and perhaps not sufficiently structured."
"It is important to take an overall view, so that everything is not divided up into small pieces."
"It is crucial that we obtain some sort of overall picture of the anxiety and of the problems, of what we can, and cannot, prove and of what we need to know more about."
"Subsequently, we can determine how best to draw up a strategic battle plan for coping successfully with the problems that undoubtedly exist."
"I have tried to include an aspect that is rather controversial, namely the fact that individuals have to have access to enough information to be able, as far as possible, to make choices concerning lifestyle, food, exercise and detergents – in fact, everything to which we are giving thought and attention – and to take responsibility for their own, and their families’, health."
"The health problems are now such that it is not only political decisions that apply. Instead, people must have the greatest possible knowledge."
"In order to be able to make active, informed choices, people must have access to information that is clear and comprehensible and that conveys a message that is relatively simple to understand."
"I have removed any suggestion that allergies are definitely bound up with traffic problems."
"I believe that this is an inference without proper scientific backing."
"Someone with respiratory problems or allergies is obviously hit very hard by poor air quality or air pollution."
"Since there is lung disease in my family, I can point out that, for example, the use of perfume constitutes at least as serious a problem for someone with an allergy."
"The cause of the spread of childhood allergies in modern times is perhaps also to be sought elsewhere than purely in external environmental factors."
"There may perhaps be biological factors involved."
"Mr President, that was my last speech here in the European Parliament."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"First of all, I should like to thank Parliament for its response to the Commission communication on a European Environment and Health Strategy."
"In particular, I should like to thank the two rapporteurs, first Mr Ries and then Mrs Paulsen, for their work, and that also goes for the whole of Mrs Paulsen’s time as a Member of the European Parliament and her remarkably good work in this particular area."
"Environment and health is an issue that affects us all."
"According to the latest Eurobarometer surveys, 89% of European citizens are concerned about the impact of the environment on their health."
"Nearly ten per cent say that they have a close relative or family member that is suffering from an environment-related illness."
"Our knowledge of which environmental factors actually give rise to certain effects on health is still fairly limited."
"Diseases are caused by many different factors, often in combination."
"We do not currently know with absolute certainty the degree to which the environment contributes to diseases."
"Indeed, one of the main objectives of this Strategy is to increase our knowledge and thus obtain a better basis for tackling the problems."
"The basic idea is to bring environment, health and research together in order to improve our understanding of, and thus tackle more effectively, the complicated link between environment and disease."
"I make no secret of the fact that this also entails a challenge as, in our traditional roles, we are not always accustomed to working horizontally across the traditional boundaries between different research disciplines and policy areas."
"We are currently working on an action plan for 2004–2010."
"We shall present this at the Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health in Budapest in June 2004, which is a pan-European meeting."
"Experts and interest groups from throughout the enlarged EU have participated in the preparations for this action plan."
"Regional conferences have been held in Warsaw, Rome and Brussels, where many of the issues addressed by Parliament in its report have been discussed."
"It is important to bear in mind that this is a long-term strategy."
"Completing our knowledge of the part the environment plays in various health problems will take time."
"Parliament has been expressing concern that the Strategy only concentrates on data collection and research."
"This is true in a sense, but we need this data in order to determine how best to direct our efforts."
"This does not mean that we are intending to stay passive in the meanwhile."
"There are certain areas where we cannot risk waiting until our knowledge is complete, but need to act according to the precautionary principle, and we shall do so."
"For the first cycle, in the period 2004 to 2010, we have selected a number of diseases and priority substances for particular consideration: childhood respiratory diseases, asthma and allergies, neurodevelopment disorders, childhood cancer, and endocrine disrupting effects."
"It is evident from this that children are a priority target group, and they are also the most vulnerable to environmental risks. Hence, we have made them the focus of our Strategy."
"The substances selected are heavy metals, dioxins, PCBs and endocrine disrupters."
"Taking these diseases and substances as our starting point, we hope to develop a programme capable of providing us with the information we need on how the environment affects our health."
"We then hope to extend this to other environmental threats and related diseases."
"In the report, Parliament points out the risk of duplication of work, of our failing to take account of existing research results or work done by the World Health Organisation, for example."
"We are fully aware of this risk; indeed, coordinating data from different areas is one of our most important tasks."
"I should like to emphasise that, when working on this Environment and Health Strategy, we cooperated with and consulted the World Health Organisation from the outset."
"By way of conclusion, I wish to thank Parliament once more for its support on this very important issue which, I assume, is close to all our hearts."
"Together with the comments from other institutions and from interest groups, this report, and especially the work done by Mrs Paulsen, will help us to develop a good, effective action plan."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, coupling the environment with health was demanded by Parliament on the basis of the orders set out in Articles 152 and 174 of the Treaty."
"May I remind you that in 1996, the formulation of public health protection as a separate aspect of the fifth programme on the environment and sustainable development being formulated at the time was my proposal and was accepted by all the institutions."
"Thus, for the first time, the European Union attempted to collect and disseminate widely information and knowledge on the repercussions of the state of the environment on human health."
"Today, the sixth environmental action programme includes this specific aspect, in other words environment, health and quality of life, while the first Community action programme in the public health sector, which we adopted in 2002 and for which I had the honour of acting as rapporteur, includes promoting the recording, analysis and evaluation of the determining factors of health which are linked to the environment."
"This knowledge will obviously result in the adoption and promotion of suitable strategies and measures to protect human health from the adverse effects of a deteriorating and dangerous environment."
"However, we must note that the penetration of the environmental aspect into health has been hesitant so far on the part of the Union and, consequently, the current proposal for an environment and health strategy cannot but be welcomed as a positive step, which expresses the will of the European Union to develop action in this sector, because the environmental dangers to health today are immense and require a modern, integrated approach."
"Emphasis must be placed on reducing the environmental dangers which have repercussions on human health or cause diseases, at huge economic and social cost."
"Of course, particular attention must also be paid to the most vulnerable groups of the population: children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with a serious medical history."
"The action programme proposes measures to improve the air quality in residential and work places, it proposes that studies be carried out in order to detect the hot spots of emissions and exposure to them, it calls for particular attention to be devoted to people living close to sources of pollution and for the stepping up of the policy of prevention, which focuses on stepping up monitoring of the environment for carcinogens and substances which damage the reproductive and nervous systems."
"Finally, it stresses the importance of education about environmental issues so that initiatives can be taken for raising public awareness and information."
"It is certain that, together with diet, the environment is a significant, determining health factor and, consequently, the Union strategy in this sector must include the constant collection and systematic monitoring of data which link environmental parameters with various diseases."
"Only by constantly developing scientific knowledge and research into the aspects of certain diseases with environmental parameters shall we be able to develop efficiently the Union strategy and action to protect human health."
"This strategy will allow the life expectancy of European citizens to be prolonged further."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission communication on the European Environment and Health Strategy is an ambitious step which aims to improve the quality of life of European citizens."
"There are now clear indications that 20% of the total number of diseases in industrialised countries are related to environmental factors."
"Most of these diseases affect children, women of reproductive age and poor and vulnerable groups."
"In the fifteen Member States, 60 000 deaths a year are due to long-term exposure to suspended particles."
"10% of children in western Europe have asthma, ten times more than in eastern Europe, due to the different environment."
"The 10% reduction in ozone is expected to cause 300 000 cases of skin cancer and 4 500 cases of melanoma every year at international level."
"The relevant Communication action plans so far have concentrated on specific environmental factors which are harmful to health without, however, ever having evaluated the risks from the links and interactions between the various pollutants to the human body overall."
"I believe that the proposed strategy helps to achieve an overall understanding of the threats, of how they affect human health and of what action is required."
"The Scale initiative, with incremental application in cycles, is based on scientific research to obtain the necessary information, focuses on children as the most vulnerable group, helps to raise awareness of the fact that the deterioration in the environment is harmful to everyone's health, especially children's, uses the legal instruments provided by the Treaty to take the relevant action and, finally, makes provision for permanent and constant evaluation to ensure that action is efficient."
"On behalf of my group, I should like to say that we support the Commission communication, as it is presented, but we shall not support those amendments which depart from the overall spirit and focus on individual sectors, thereby precluding other, equally important sectors."
"Mr President, doctors since the time of Hippocrates have known that our health is dependent on our environment."
"Media coverage in recent years has only confirmed people's concerns."
"Today's epidemiological landscape has changed dramatically."
"It is dominated by cardiovascular diseases, cancers, allergic conditions and respiratory diseases."
"These diseases have many causes, which are often complex and interact with one another."
"These causes are often uncertain and some are not yet known."
"It is recognised, however, that the environment, in the widest sense of the term, plays a leading role."
"Our physical environment is thus one of the major risk factors for the health of our citizens."
"I will not dwell now on the dangers presented by polluted industrial sites or nuclear power plants."
"Above all, we must from now on take more account of the immediate environment that causes thousands of cases of cancer."
"Chemicals, electromagnetic waves or urban and atmospheric traffic pollution: these are the major challenges for public health in Europe."
"Our behaviour and our way of life encourage an excessively rich diet, and stress and the intensification of work give rise to many health problems."
"For example, we must take a strong stand against smoking, in particular passive smoking and smoking around children."
"We must now put in place strong regulations allowing smoking to be banned in the workplace and in public places."
"In the face of these challenges, we are concerned by the weakness of the Commission's proposals."
"The Greens call for a still more specific and more ambitious strategy, which will be able to rise to the health challenges of the twenty-first century."
"This, may I add, is the direction taken by the amendments we have tabled."
"We must tackle the problems at their source by putting forward specific actions right now, while accepting the inherent uncertainties of scientific knowledge."
"The strategy must therefore be firmly based on the precautionary principle and the principle of prevention."
"In this context, we are calling for a significant strengthening of the strategy of reducing exposure to risks."
"The Greens ask for these various major lines of thinking and action to be taken into account, so that the European Union is able to deal with the fears and expectations of our fellow citizens and, above all, with the revolution in public health that we must carry out."
"– Mr President, the European Environment and Health Strategy will have an important role to play when the EU’s Sixth Environmental Action Programme is implemented in practice."
"It was the third priority of this environmental programme and at the time it was said that it was a very important component in the new challenges that lay ahead of us."
"In many countries the work done in environmental healthcare and environmental protection has already had a significant impact on achieving high standards of environmental health."
"We still nevertheless have work to do."
"It must also be one of the major goals in a Union of 25 countries to achieve and maintain standards of healthcare that are as high as possible."
"The prevention of disease and the general assurance of good health everywhere must play a key role when the strategy starts to be implemented in practice."
"For some reason this principle was not given due consideration by the committee when the matter was being discussed, but I hope that this issue of prevention will be given top priority in future debates."
"The first phase of the strategy will focus on factors that aim to have a beneficial effect on childhood diseases."
"This is a good basis and starting point for the aim of offering our citizens an environment in which levels of pollution are not enough to produce harmful effects on people’s health and the environment."
"To achieve this we naturally need investment in research, but also in training and education, and tangible levels of investment to ensure a better environment in the future."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur."
"I welcome this proposed strategy looking at the connection and links between environment and health and I welcome the Commission's proposal."
"I would like to focus on the issue of indoor pollution and in particular passive smoking – I know Mr Rod has just touched upon that."
"It is apt that we discuss this report in the week that the Irish Government introduced a ban on smoking in public places, especially since the Irish Government currently holds the presidency of the EU."
"The Irish Government should be congratulated on its initiative to protect the health of all its citizens, including those who work in smoky pubs, clubs or restaurants."
"Breathing other people's smoke is dangerous for your health."
"Tobacco smoke contains over 4000 different chemicals."
"In the USA the Environmental Protection Agency has classified environmental tobacco smoke as a class A carcinogen along with asbestos, arsenic, benzene and radon gas."
"Passive smoking is a risk factor in childbirth and infancy, connected to low birth weight and cot death; in children it is a risk factor in asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia; in adults it is a risk factor in heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and nasal cancer."
"Estimates suggest that in the UK alone 8000 deaths through heart disease are caused by passive smoking each year."
"This is a serious issue and there is no way to escape the fact that passive smoking is bad for your health."
"I hope more Member States will copy Ireland's excellent example."
"I thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for their hard work."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon."
"The next item is the joint debate on three reports, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy:"
"- A5-0173/2004, by Mrs Korhola, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Convention on access to information, public participation in decision making and access to justice regarding environmental matters;"
"- A5-0190/2004, by Mrs Korhola, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the application of the provisions of the Århus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters to EC institutions and bodies;"
"- A5-0189/2004, by Mrs Schörling, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on access to justice in environmental matters."
". I should like to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, the rapporteurs Ms Korhola and Ms Schörling, for making speedy progress with the proposals before us today."
"Adoption of this package of proposals will mean that we have passed a milestone in strengthening environmental democracy: the Århus Convention’s requirements on access to environmental information, public participation and access to justice in environmental matters will be set to apply throughout the whole of the European Union."
"We already have in place legislation concerning the Århus Convention’s first and second pillars – access to environmental information and public participation in environmental decision-making."
"The proposal for a directive on access to justice in environmental matters and for a regulation to apply the Århus Convention to the Community institutions and bodies will allow the Community to complete the package of legislative instruments aimed at effective implementation of the Århus Convention."
"You will remember that the proposal on access to justice also fulfils a commitment from the Commission to the European Parliament when negotiating the Public Participation Directive."
"In addition, the Commission’s proposal for a decision on the conclusion of the Århus Convention by the European Community provides the means to live up to our political commitment by becoming a party to the Convention, further to its signature in 1998."
"The proposal for a directive on access to justice aims to implement the third pillar of the Århus Convention by establishing minimum requirements for access to administrative or judicial proceedings in environmental matters."
"With its signature of the Århus Convention, the Community undertook to ensure that its requirements would be applied throughout EU territory."
"This can only be guaranteed by means of an EU-wide instrument with respect to access to justice in environmental matters setting the minimum conditions all Member States have to comply with."
"Furthermore, such an instrument will help to improve the implementation of Community law, and hence further the effectiveness of Community environmental policy."
"Of course, it is important not only for the European Community to sign up to the Århus Convention, but also to cover its own institutions, alongside national authorities, so that they are also bound by its requirements."
"This is a point that we made clear, even at the negotiation stage."
"This commitment will fully materialise with the adoption of the proposal for a regulation on the application of the Århus Convention to the institutions."
"It is hence not only another element for the implementation of the Århus Convention, but also crucial for our own credibility as regards Member States and internationally."
"We are, however, not starting from scratch."
"A number of instruments linked to the good governance process are already in place, and only need to be completed to fully live up to the requirements of the Århus Convention."
"I particularly refer to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, and to the Commission’s communication of December 2002 establishing general principles and minimum standards for consultation of interested parties by the Commission."
"I commend the proposals to the House and look forward to hearing your comments."
". – Mr President, the package of three acts now before us forms part of the package of measures for acquiring practical rules with regard to the principles agreed by the United Nations in Rio de Janeiro in 1992."
"I myself was Parliament’s rapporteur for the first two pillars of the Århus Convention, and am now the rapporteur with regard to the regulation on the application of all three pillars to Community institutions and bodies."
"I am also rapporteur for the Council decision on the ratification of the Århus Convention."
"Let me first speak about the regulation."
"The European Parliament played a very active role in the first two implementing directives on the Århus Convention."
"The outcome as a result of conciliation represents Parliament’s position very clearly in both cases and meets the minimum requirements in the Århus Convention fully, even going beyond them."
"This is now satisfactorily reflected in the Commission proposal for the regulation."
"The committee, upon my suggestion, tabled amendments to the regulation concerning exceptions regarding access to information and binding rules on public participation in particular."
"Furthermore, in order to harmonise the regulation with the Convention and the proposed Directive on access to justice, members of the public are given a legal standing where an issue directly concerns their interests or rights."
"I am also proposing a clarification to the text concerning charging for the information supplied."
"Here a distinction should be made between, firstly, the three European institutions, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and secondly, between all the other Community bodies."
"The former three have already adopted a general rule for not making charges, and that must obviously not be altered where it concerns environmental information."
"The other bodies may make a reasonable charge where appropriate."
"Furthermore, the amendments that have now been tabled are aimed at ensuring that there is adequate harmonisation between the regulation and the proposed Directive on access to justice."
"Let me then move on to the directive."
"The Directive on access to justice is problematic in many ways."
"First of all, the various fears associated with it in the Member States give rise to needless opposition to the whole Århus Convention and the Community legislation that relates to it."
"I would think that this is also precisely why Ireland, as the country holding the presidency, is unwilling to include the package under discussion in its agenda during its presidential term."
"The second problem is that this directive, which specifically relates to access to justice and the legal system, restricts the powers of the Union to a greater degree than the two earlier Århus directives."
"All this Parliament must take into consideration when taking its decision on the directive."
"The outcome arrived at by the committee was reasonably good, and the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are an attempt to ensure that the directive will actually adhere precisely to the provisions of the Århus Convention: no more, but no less."
"Given that the Århus Convention does not provide any clear basis for the text, a degree of discretion has had to be applied."
"I would like to raise the matter of the definition of ‘qualified entity’."
"The general criteria agreed by the committee are too narrow in the view of many environmental organisations."
"I do not agree."
"What is required at the end of the day is simply normal procedures that accord with good practice on the part of organisations and recommending legal procedures that are in accordance with good practice, which is probably only reasonable considering the special role these organisations will now have in monitoring society’s conformity with the law."
"Moreover, we have to consider that there are very many kinds of NGOs, and we cannot be certain about the ultimate purpose of all of them."
"That is why simple criteria for defining a qualified entity will give protection to that special entitlement we are now bestowing on environmental organisations that have a serious purpose."
"I hope that the environmental organisations are able to see this."
"If on the other hand some organisations are too small on their own to meet even these simple criteria, that may in itself even justify, in terms of the objective, which is the protection of the environment, combining skills and resources and not working as needlessly scattered units, at least as far as using the opportunity of access to justice is concerned."
"We should also bear in mind the nature of the minimum directive: Member States may if they so wish exclude some of the proposed criteria, but may not add to them."
"This gives credence to the notion that the directive will function within very different legal systems."
"I have furthermore made the provisions clearer, allowing foreign organisations a non-discriminatory right to access to justice when it is a genuine matter of cross-border environmental impact."
"The Commission proposal was not absolutely clear on this point."
"Now I will turn to the issue of ratification."
"The two Århus directives already adopted represent Parliament’s position very clearly."
"Parliament itself was able to make the provisions contained in them tougher compared to the Århus Convention."
"This is partly due to the at times intentionally vague and obscure wording of the Convention, which was simply meant to ensure the Convention would come into being in 1998."
"This tradition of international diplomacy cannot, however, be tolerated within the context of the precise formulation of Community legislation."
"As rapporteur, I hope Parliament will show more ambition where the Community has authority, as the incorporation of an environmental convention in Community legislation is different from drafting directives based on conventions in other areas, such as banning landmines."
"While the latter is a static decision, the former should be thought of as a dynamic process."
"With environmental policy, the aim is to reverse, step by step, adverse global developments, and benefit from the experience gained."
"Therefore, the implementation of an environmental convention should take shape in a way that can lead to improvements in a future revision of the convention."
"The EU cannot confine itself to the faithful duplication of internationally agreed minimum standards, but should rather use the entire margin realistically and aspire to lead the way."
"This succeeded with the two first pillars of the Convention."
"The final sections of the Århus package under discussion seem to be going in the right direction and showing a sense of balance."
"As a result, ratification of the entire Århus Convention may finally start in the Community with no needless delay, provided the necessary Community legislation is adopted."
"Mr President, we have here this evening a joint debate on all three pillars of the Århus Convention."
"I welcome this debate, and also the Commission proposal for a directive."
"In signing the Århus Convention, theCommunity demonstrated its will to improve environmental law and also involve the public in environmental decisions in an entirely different way."
"The forthcoming ratification means that theCommunity is actually duty bound to ensure that citizens and NGOs are able to enjoy this right in accordance with Community law, which is a very good thing."
"Although theCommunity and the Member States signed the Convention back in 1998 and it entered into force in 2001, it has only been ratified by a few of the EU Member States."
"It is now high time that the public and the NGOs were given access to justice in environmental matters, and also to information, of course, and participation in decision-making, which is discussed in the report by Mrs Korhola."
"This will play an important part in rendering environmental policy much more effective in the EU."
"It will improve management of, and compliance with, environmental regulations, speed up implementation, and improve environmental management."
"How can we say that so confidently?"
"Indeed, there are actually studies showing that, in countries offering the opportunity of bringing environmental proceedings and reviewing the application of environmental law, environmental law has become much stricter: there is a direct link."
"According to the intentions of Agenda 21, which are also a guiding thread for the Commission, it is individuals, not the authorities, who own their environment."
"For the first time, environmental law and human rights are being linked up, and I think that this is a positive development."
"It is also true that we have a responsibility towards future generations."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has voted in favour of the Directive constituting a minimum framework and Member States being free to go further and provide broader access to justice."
"I think that that is an excellent proposal."
"Environmental proceedings must apply to both public authority handling and the criminal dimension, since the Århus Convention does not make a distinction between civil and criminal proceedings, and I do not really understand why the Commission wishes to make this distinction here."
"We disagree on a number of points; this is clear from the amendments to this Directive."
"For example, I do not think that EU law should introduce new, unnecessary restrictions such as those on qualified entities That would force countries that currently take a very liberal view to introduce restrictions."
"I cannot, therefore, accept the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to which Mrs Korhola referred."
"These concern Articles 8 and 9, among others, and set out new criteria and procedures that are not at all present in the Århus Convention."
"In my opinion, this would create new obstacles, and I do not understand the need for this."
"Nor do I understand why we should adopt geographical and time limitations or restrictions, which are also specified in Articles 8 and 5, regarding legal standing."
"For example, both the Commission proposal and Amendment No 32 by the PPE-DE Group require an entity to be active in an area in order to have access to documents or the judicial authorities there."
"I think that this is absolutely wrong, as the nature of environmental proceedings is completely different today."
"For example, a small, local environmental organisation might need expert help from an international organisation so, in my opinion, that entails restrictions."
"In my view, being an independent and non-profit-making legal person should be sufficient to qualify for permission to bring legal proceedings for the protection of the environment and health."
"It is also very important that the definition of ‘environmental law’ apply to all policy areas and not just Article 175, to which this proposal refers."
"All environmental law based on Article 95 would also be covered, of course."
"Lastly, I should just like to say something about costs."
"I have proposed that costs must on no account be an obstacle to the ability of an entity to bring legal proceedings."
"We must ensure that the public is granted the help and support it needs."
"When legal proceedings are brought for reasons of public interest, the cost must not constitute an obstacle."
"We must be very generous in this regard."
"I hope, therefore, that my fellow Members vote in favour of the proposals that I have outlined, so that we can establish effective legislation that does not create new obstacles, but instead fulfils our aim of improving environmental law in the EU."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Wallström is wrong to say that she is implementing the Århus Convention; the reality of it is that her draft directive on access to courts goes much further than does Århus."
"Århus merely requires open access to administrative or, alternatively, judicial review proceedings;"
"Commissioner Wallström seeks to lay down binding provisions on access to the courts in all the Member States, with all environmental organisations to be empowered to object to administrative decisions and to appeal against them, with provision also for interim legal protection."
"This is to apply to the whole body of environmental law, in other words, to the whole defined in the Community as having to do with the protection or improvement of the environment, including human health and the protection or rational use of natural resources."
"The examples listed are, among others, water protection, noise protection, soil protection, atmospheric pollution, town and country planning, and biotechnologies."
"Environmental organisations are thus given a general right to contest and monitor the application of the law."
"That amounts to nothing more and nothing less than a system change in the implementation and control of the law as it stands in most of Europe’s Member States, with private bodies, in their guise as representatives of the public, being given the right to supervise the authorities."
"Our legal system knows nothing of the monitoring of law by any such body separate from the courts and from the competent authorities, and with good reason."
"Environmental associations are, at the end of the day, interest groups like any others, lacking democratic legitimacy and not bound by law and statute."
"Introducing and making binding such a dramatic extension of class action will have a massive effect on the economy and cannot under any circumstances be reconciled with the Lisbon objectives."
"It is for that reason that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has limited itself to saying that Århus must be implemented, but to a minimum standard, and if Member States want to go beyond that, then that is their decision."
"That is where the matter should rest, and so I can only hope, Commissioner Wallström, that the Council will firmly put a stop to your initiative."
". Mr President, I speak on behalf of the author of the committee's opinion, Michael Cashman, who cannot be here today."
"Mr Cashman welcomed, in his opinion, the proposal for a regulation on the application of the Århus Convention to EC bodies and institutions as a concrete step to align the EC legislation with the requirements of the Convention."
"Although the committee's opinion approves most parts of the Commission text, there was some need to improve it."
"As the rapporteur on the proposal for a regulation regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, Mr Cashman insisted that this regulation must be in line with the letter and spirit of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on public access to documents, where, after negotiations, a sensible balance was agreed between, on the one hand, the citizen's right to openness and transparency and, on the other, the need to protect certain interests and to preserve the effectiveness of the institutions' working methods."
"The opinion suggests, for example, a deletion – in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 – on exceptions where public authorities would not be covered when acting in a legislative capacity."
"The opinion suggests that the operative text of the Commission proposal should clarify that all exceptions under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 shall apply to requests for information."
"Finally, a general concern of the committee's opinion is about the deadlines proposed by the Commission."
"Particularly when it comes to access to justice, Community institutions and bodies should be obliged to act within reasonable deadlines and to increase the duty of public awareness-raising in order to achieve meaningful consultation."
"Clearly, Mr Cashman would have wanted to add his own opinion but could not be here today."
"I hope I have set out the main points that he would have proposed in the debate."
"Mr President, the subject of today's debate is not whether or not we should sign up to the Århus Convention."
"As the Community signed this text in 1998, it is now our responsibility to act so that each of our governments can implement this agreement."
"By signing the Århus Convention, the Community has committed itself to adopting legally binding instruments, namely a directive and a regulation, in order to bring Community legislation in line with the provisions of the Århus Convention."
"It was with this requirement to comply with the Convention in mind that the committee carried out its work."
"It is also along these lines that the amendments tabled in plenary, which are widely supported, were drawn up."
"Our work initially consisted in uniting the various concepts taken up in the texts and in adapting them to the definitions in the Convention."
"On the other hand, we have respected the Commission's decision to give non-governmental organisations working in the environmental sector access to justice, while further opening up this route to qualified entities with legal personality."
"In the same vein, we have turned the objective of promoting sustainable development into an essential condition, included in their statues, of exercising the right of access to justice."
"Furthermore, only the provisions contained in the Århus Convention and in the directive granted access to justice to members of the public who bring to light an infringement of a right or who have an interest in acting."
"As we were anxious that the Community institutions should be bound by the same rules as the Member States, we chose to incorporate this provision into the present regulation."
"Finally, we constantly ensured that we respected the need to apply the principle of subsidiarity to the Member States with regard to legal procedures."
"Indeed, insofar as these matters relate to procedural law in the Member States, they are based on the Member States' procedural autonomy and must not result in a restrictive legal instrument from the Union."
"It is also inconceivable that we could establish a specific provision, a sort of privileged right to easier and cheaper access to justice on environmental matters: it is essential for questions of access to justice to be dealt with consistently and on an overall basis in all sectors, not just specifically in the environmental sector."
"Finally, some of the proposals in the working document go beyond the obligations arising from the Århus Convention."
"We must retain the room for manoeuvre that the Convention gives the Member States in the implementation of these obligations."
"To conclude, I think we have reached a fair compromise which aims to promote, in accordance with the provisions of the Århus Convention, effective implementation of Community legislation on the environment."
"I could, perhaps, summarise it by saying ‘the whole Århus Convention, and nothing but the Århus Convention’."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with two related proposals which must both fit in with the philosophy of the Århus Convention and only with that philosophy."
"The question of whether or not to comply with the provisions of the Århus Convention is not on the agenda."
"What we have to look at is how to act so that our governments and the Community institutions can implement this agreement."
"The Århus Convention is undoubtedly a real advance, as it plays a part in establishing what has become essential transparency, and we are called upon here to present methods of providing the public with access to justice."
"If this Convention is to be effective, however, it must bear the stamp of modernity and set in motion greater participation among all those who contribute to improving the environment in Europe."
"That is why we should include a precise reference to the concept of sustainable development."
"It would be inconsistent to try to make do with an overly restrictive definition of environmental law, and thus to exclude whole sectors of activity that, nevertheless, play an active part in achieving our environmental objectives."
"I am thinking in particular here of professional groups."
"With regard, more particularly, to the proposal for a directive, insofar as the Århus Convention will be implemented, the first question is whether the directive is really necessary."
"This is a valid question and, if there is a directive, it must correspond to the spirit of the Convention."
"In this case, it must also respect the principle of subsidiarity: this, I may add, is also the basis of our amendments."
"This is because it is the Member States which will have to implement the requirements of the Århus Convention, and this must occur in accordance with the law in force in each of our countries and with the legal traditions applicable there."
"I would under no circumstances support amendments aiming to impose one Member State's legal practices on all the others."
"On the other hand, we must anticipate possible cross-border cases, and we must specify the conceivable procedures for appeals."
"If these points are not taken on board, then, for reasons of legal consistency, we will probably choose to do without this directive."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I want you to know that we support the Commission’s proposal and recognise its efforts to adapt this Convention to the current mechanisms of the Member States and the Community institutions for guaranteeing the legitimate right to information and environmental justice."
"As Socialists, we believe that access to justice must be as universal as possible, but must always take an organised form."
"So, on the most controversial issue, which is the way in which this access to justice is made as universal as possible, the Commission proposes that it be done by means of qualified entities, something which is still a restriction of the universality laid down in the Convention."
"Certain amendments presented to plenary replace ‘qualified entities’ with ‘NGOs’, but I do not believe that this resolves the issue;"
"I therefore propose that we follow the line approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and which I proposed myself, on a broader notion of qualified entity, according to which any person or collective affected by an environmental issue could have the right to justice."
"This, together with the modification of the definition of ‘public’, which we have also approved in the Committee on the Environment, would allow us to guarantee the universality of the right recognised in Aarhus and at the same time organise the system of access to justice in an appropriate manner."
"Commissioner, our institutions must set an example in the application of these rights."
"I therefore believe that we have the moral obligation to ensure that the regulation is more ambitious than the directive intended for the Member States, and I would call on the Commission to accept the modification of the definitions which this Parliament proposes and which I hope we will approve tomorrow."
"Mr President, on my own behalf and that of many of my group colleagues, I should first like to focus on the Directive on access to justice."
"As has been said quite rightly today, the Directive impinges deeply on the administrative and legal systems of many countries."
"There is also reason to wonder whether the legal basis is correct."
"It has been interesting to note that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy approved this Directive, and suppressed a proposal to reject it, by only 17 votes to 16."
"For many of us, it is an ideological question why environmental organisations should enjoy a privileged position compared to other organisations."
"Through our request for a split vote on Amendment No 40, you can correct that."
"Only last week, Commissioner, events in the North Sea showed that fishermen’s organisations have the same need for, and should have at least the same right to, access to justice as BirdLife or other powerful international organisations."
"Many of us share the deep ideological conviction that other environmental organisations, too, should have this right."
"We must not have some organisations that are more equal than others."
"In my opinion, this whole debate has raised the following question. What is the added value of the Directive other than to give us a deadline for the implementation of the Århus Convention?"
"This deadline could be obtained by means of a considerably simpler regulatory framework than the rather complicated situation we have at present."
"As regards the application of the Århus Convention to the Community and also the correction that we want to make to the Directive, we have every opportunity of achieving these objectives by means of good governance."
"Mr President, the Århus Convention is very important."
"In practice, it reinforces the transparency of decisions in environmental matters directly affecting citizens and the latter’s chances of actually even influencing these decisions."
"I shall begin by commenting on the aspect of its implementation that concerns Mrs Schörling’s report on justice in environmental matters."
"A proposal to reject the report in its present form has been presented; Mrs Thors, among others, spoke of this just now."
"I myself have some difficulty in understanding the reason for rejecting this report."
"The fact is that the European Union has signed this Convention."
"It is reasonable, therefore, for it to have a duty to use its regulatory framework to ensure that this Convention is also implemented."
"Surely this is a reasonable consequence of signing it."
"I believe that this will gain particular importance when the Union is enlarged by ten new members."
"The aim is to involve the new Member States so that, together with us, they meet the stipulations of this Convention."
"Reading the report, it is also perfectly clear that it does not prevent any country from having more progressive legislation."
"Each country is free to go further, to increase the rights in other areas."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy makes this clear in Amendments Nos 4 and 5."
"There is a reason for the report applying in the field of the environment, in particular."
"This is the part of EU law with perhaps the poorest levels of compliance, judging by the number of Court cases."
"In my opinion, the draft adopted by the Committee on the Environment could be improved in a couple of respects."
"Firstly, it should be extended to cover all decisions with an environmental impact, not just those decisions that are taken on the basis of Article 175 of the Treaty."
"Secondly, it is important not to stipulate a detailed definition of the term ‘environmental organisation’."
"It can hardly be the EU’s job to do this."
"It is also important not to prescribe a restriction on who is granted the opportunity of bringing legal proceedings."
"I shall devote the last seconds of my speaking time to Mrs Korhola’s report."
"It is important that this report cover as large a part of the legislation as possible."
"It is important that its scope also cover institutions such as the European Investment Bank, a major financial player, so that they have to comply with the obligations laid down in the report."
"I also think that it is very important that the public be given a partisan interest, so that it is covered by this regulatory framework."
"Mr President, why do we need specific legislation to implement the Århus Convention?"
"In our view, it is sufficient on its own, which is why we have tabled a motion to reject the directive on access to justice."
"More seriously, this draft introduces some unacceptable measures."
"First of all, there is the internal review procedure for acts adopted by the European institutions."
"What is the point of having Members of the European Parliament if their decisions are constantly challenged by NGOs selected by the European Commission, which is also the guardian of the EU Treaties?"
"Then there is the Commission's attempt to interfere in the organisation of national legal systems; this provision is illegal, as it is contrary to Article 175 of the Treaty."
"Finally, there are the dispensations from both civil and criminal procedure, allowing NGOs to receive aid to take legal action and to avoid the costs, damages and interest payable if they fail: this measure is morally unjust and legally shocking."
"In order to maintain sustainable development, I also suggest not restricting the ability to take action just to NGOs, but including those who manage rural areas – landowners, farmers, foresters, enterprises etc. According to Article 9 of the Århus Convention, it is up to the Member States to organise access to justice."
"If this draft is adopted, it will inevitably cause implementation difficulties and legal uncertainty, which seems to me to go against the desired aim."
"To successfully implement this Convention, we must respect the principle of subsidiarity."
"Mr President, Commissioner Wallström, I believe that the speeches by my fellow Members, especially those from my group but also from others, have pinpointed the fundamental problem that we have in this report."
"We are not discussing the extension of rights to information, which we all, clearly, support. We are not discussing the Convention because, as has been said, this is not what it is about as it has been signed."
"What we are discussing is a rather more general issue, which we have interpreted, Commissioner, as the Commission trying to impose its will in order to make the Convention workable."
"This has also been well documented in the speeches by various Members and in the tabled amendments: that is to say what some Members have portrayed as an attempt to fast-track environmental legislation."
"From a legal point of view and given the legal background of the Union and the Member States, the reason for this is not understood."
"Now, I am convinced that this reason originates in a healthy concern, in good intentions on the part of the Commissioner and Members, but we must be very vigilant about this aspect, because there is the risk that we will be starting a process that will delegitimise our democratic institutions, made up of elected members, governing bodies, assemblies at municipal and local level; in short, the system of democratic guarantees that are the only supreme guarantees able to fully represent citizens’ interests."
"Now, it is only right and proper to want to pay particular attention to the environment, and it is altogether desirable to want to involve all citizens."
"We must be careful, however, not to go beyond the limit of the so-called special legislation."
"When I hear Mrs Schörling talk about no limitations, neither time limits nor geographical ones, then the risk of creating counter powers becomes serious."
"If this risk were to arise in tomorrow’s final text, then I think that we would do well, as some Members have said, to vote against it."
"Mr President, in all the years that Parliament and the Council have been adopting legislation together, it has very rarely happened that a proposal put forward by the European Commission is rejected on account of the principle of subsidiarity."
"I, and with me a large number of fellow MEPs, find that the proposal now being discussed – and I am talking about access to justice, the Schörling report – should suffer this fate."
"This is because it is extremely unusual for the European Commission to submit a proposal to implement the Aarhus Convention in European Community law by way of a directive when all Member States and nine of the ten accession countries have signed this Convention, and some have even ratified it."
"The instrument of a directive to force Member States to include the Aarhus Convention in their national legislation is therefore disproportionate."
"Furthermore, this proposal is based on Article 175, although it is in actual fact about the harmonisation of the Member States’ legal systems."
"This definitely cannot be done on the basis of Article 175. The wording of the proposal is also different from the wording of the Aarhus Convention, and this will naturally cause major interpretation problems."
"I am naturally in favour of the Aarhus Convention, but I cannot but conclude that the Member States should introduce it themselves."
"They have undertaken to do so."
"The Commission’s present proposal is therefore both technically incorrect and superfluous."
"In conclusion, I would like to say that my group has very serious objections to this proposal."
"We have therefore submitted an amendment to reject the proposal, and I call on fellow MEPs to support this."
"An amendment of this kind in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was rejected with a majority of one vote, and that was not surprising, since just before the meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy it was still being assumed that I would not declare this amendment acceptable."
"Nobody had therefore prepared for the vote properly."
"I think that we should be given the opportunity to do this again tomorrow."
". Mr President, I cannot help thinking that this is also a matter of the status of environmental issues."
"Just imagine replacing the words 'environmental legislation' with 'economic legislation' or anything else, and you would consider it absolutely natural that you have access to justice; that you allow these groups access to justice or a say on these issues."
"Most of what we think would come naturally will also have to be introduced for the environmental issues."
"That is just one reflection."
"Let me begin by commenting firstly on the proposed directive on access to justice."
"Without a common framework with harmonised requirements, there is no means of guaranteeing that the requirements of the Århus Convention are met throughout the Union."
"We have signed the Århus Convention and that is the starting point."
"The Commission proposes to give legal standing to recognised environmental organisations."
"That follows from how environmental issues are defined here: what the Århus Convention is all about and what access to justice is all about in this field."
"It is restricted to environmental issues and it is clearly defined."
"This is fully in line with a Convention that gives a prominent position to environmental NGOs as advocating the interests of the environment, because on the environment we do not have a vested interest."
"We will have to heed those voices that take on the concerns of the environment."
"It is also done with respect for the principle of subsidiarity, as Member States are free to provide for access to justice for a larger public."
"Furthermore, it is left largely to Member States to develop the details of the framework."
"Much as I respect Mrs Thors, it is not always the fishermen who represent the environmental concerns when it comes to protecting the Baltic Sea, so perhaps that is not the best of examples."
"As regards the amendments put forward, the Commission can accept those that reinforce the principles of the proposal, in particular where reference is made to national legislation granting wider access to justice."
"A considerable number of amendments, however, are not acceptable to the Commission."
"Even though I understand and sympathise with your desire to maximise the benefits to the public of this proposal, I consider that amendments which propose expanding legal standing to organisations which are not primarily or regularly working in the field of the environment add requirements which are arbitrary or imprecise."
"It is also important to provide as much legal clarity as possible."
"Other amendments weaken the scope of the proposal as they modify procedural aspects, such as the request for internal review which, in the Commission’s view, is important in order to enable the administration to reassess its action before transferring the case to the courts."
"In our view, the proposal is well balanced."
"It takes on board the obligations arising from the Århus Convention, whilst leaving to the Member States the necessary degree of flexibility which will enable them to implement the legislation effectively."
"I turn to the proposal for a regulation implementing Århus within the institutions."
"I would like to emphasise that our aim is the full application of the three pillars of the Århus Convention at Community level."
"These requirements proposed under the regulation cover not only Community institutions but all bodies that exercise public functions under the Treaties, also comprising the agencies, offices or bodies such as the European Investment Bank, to the extent that their activities are relevant to environmental matters as dealt with by the Convention."
"Here again, the Commission’s proposal has made use of the flexibility parties are allowed under the Århus Convention, notably in terms of organising the public participation processes and establishing criteria for access to justice in case of impairments of environmental law."
"While keeping in line with the Århus Convention, it strived to interfere as little as possible with rules and procedures already established and operating."
"In particular, interference with the Treaty provisions as regards access to the European Court of Justice for individuals needs to be avoided."
"In this vein, the Commission considers as problematic those amendments that would aim to deviate from the regime of exceptions set up under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on access to documents."
"Neither can the Commission accept amendments that result in being overly prescriptive on the arrangements for public participation and in enlarging the access to justice provisions to complaints by individual members of the public."
"Those amendments risk interfering with the provisions of the EC Treaty in this respect."
"I will hand over to the secretariat the Commission’s position on specific amendments(1)."
"Once again, I thank you for the debate."
"Mrs Thors, did you request the floor for a clarification?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I should like to say that we very often say in this House that consumers must have the same rights as economic operators, and that all sides must be heard."
"That is what this is about."
"A situation in which certain organisations are more valuable than others is alien to a large number of us."
"That would be reminiscent of an Orwellian society."
"Finally, I should like to point out that I do not think that we can share the Commission’s interpretation that the requesting of internal reviews by qualified entities would not cause problems in the most successful, progressive countries."
"That is incorrect."
"Please, Mrs Thors, I believe you are trying to reopen the debate."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0139/2004), by Mr Manders, on behalf of the European Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage."
". Mr President, may I begin by thanking everyone who has contributed constructively to the creation of this compromise and the directive, which I hope, and I am almost sure, will be accepted."
"I would in particular like to thank the Vice President, Mr Imbeni, who headed the conciliation delegation, Mr Gargani, chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and all shadow rapporteurs, who contributed constructively to the creation of the compromise, as well as Ambassador Gunning who attended the conciliation on behalf of the Council."
"I would also particularly like to thank Ana Palacio, who has since left this Parliament."
"At the time Mrs Palacio was chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and was responsible for a unique moment in this Parliament, namely for what I call the ‘Manders procedure’."
"The ‘Manders procedure’ meant that the whole of this Parliament ultimately had to vote on which committee was authorised to draft and deal with this report."
"I found that a particular honour, and I think that it has led to an acceptable result."
"Why are we satisfied with the compromise reached?"
"Because, after decades of debate, we have for the first time found a legal title that will enable us to ensure that the costs of repairing environmental damage can be recovered from the polluter."
"The liberal principle that the polluter pays is the main theme in this respect."
"As a liberal, I am, of course, particularly happy with this. This is new, it is the cornerstone, a bridge that connects economic and environmental legislation."
"I am, however, not entirely satisfied, although as I said at my press conference after the compromise with the Council had been reached, we will have to regard this as a seed that has now been sown, and we hope that it will grow into fully fledged legislation."
"What is happening?"
"In my view, because of the extent to which this directive 'allows', there is still a very good chance that we will create a kind of patchwork quilt in Europe and that the Member States, particularly in more economically difficult times, will find the economy more important than environmental protection."
"I therefore regret that my ultimate proposal to apply Article 95, maximum harmonisation, has not been adopted and that we have taken Article 195 as the basis."
"The environmental organisations, the environmental NGOs, played a particular role in this."
"They are not complaining that there will be too little harmonisation, and during the procedure they did not support maximum harmonisation, something which I deeply regret."
"On the other hand, Europe was obviously not ready for that."
"This is also evident from the conciliation procedure, because only four amendments to the Community point of view were adopted in Parliament."
"Only four!"
"For this we had to convene three more conciliation meetings."
"Ultimately, I believe that the compromise can be described as successful."
"This was also evident in the outcome of the vote in the conciliation delegation from Parliament, because 12 to 1 in favour of the result achieved is of course fantastic."
"I hope that this is the beginning."
"I also hope that the Member States will not abuse their licence policy and the state of science in order to upset the level playing field for economic activities, which we are after all so keen to create in the internal market, by some Member States allowing more than others and doing nothing to benefit the environment."
"On the other hand, certain benefits have already been achieved."
"For example, the maximum liability amount in the IMO Convention has been increased from 50 million to 1 billion."
"The preventative effect of the directive has thus already proven its worth."
"I hope that Euratom will follow very soon, and I think that this will ultimately result in excellent legislation."
"Once again, we have made a start, and I hope that this will result in something good."
"I would like to wholeheartedly thank the Commissioner."
"It was of course one of her top priorities, and she can now conclude this theme as part of this mandate."
"I would therefore like to wholeheartedly thank her, her staff and, in particular, Charles Pirotti, who is also present today, for their constructive contribution to this matter."
"I would like to invite the Commissioner to lunch or dinner, as her busy schedule has prevented us from giving a joint press conference."
"Perhaps this is a good idea, because by way of this invitation I would very much like to explain my thoughts on how I would like to see this directive grow into fully fledged legislation in the future, and in particular my thoughts on my EMAS (Environmental Management Assessment)."
"I would very much like to speak to her about this and I therefore hope that she will take me up on my invitation."
"Perhaps there will be time for a quick beer after this debate."
"Thanks again to everyone, and I hope that a full majority will accept this proposal tomorrow."
"Thank you most kindly, Mr President, and thanks to everyone concerned for their constructive contribution."
". Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Manders."
"This is the first time I have had an offer of a date through the European Parliament plenary, or at least an invitation to a drink."
"Thank you for that, Mr Manders, and thank you for your good work on the environmental liability file!"
"You are absolutely right that we have been waiting a long time for this to come true."
"I also want to thank Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee under the chairmanship of Vice-President Imbeni, because the positive spirit which animated Parliament's delegation throughout this conciliation enabled us to find a satisfactory overall compromise: the joint text before you today, which has been approved by the Conciliation Committee."
"Thanks to this new directive, a comprehensive framework whereby environmental damage would be prevented or remedied through a system of environmental liability will be put in place for the first time."
"This new system will be a valuable benefit for the citizens and the environment of an enlarged Union."
"I am very pleased with the result that has been achieved by the co-legislators."
"We all wanted this directive to be an ambitious and workable piece of legislation, and finding a balanced compromise in such a technically complex and politically sensitive subject was certainly not easy."
"I think that the text before you will constitute a significant step forward towards better environmental protection in Europe."
"The contribution of this new directive to the conservation of biological diversity in Europe, through its application to protected species and natural habitats, is just one example of the many gains made possible by this directive."
"Thank you again, Mr Manders."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by expressing my special thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Manders, who, as we have seen him do so often in the past, has done an outstanding job of defending the environmental liability directive in the conciliation procedure, and so, this evening, let me thank him for that and also for the good personal cooperation."
"This House has been working on the environmental liability directive for a long time, and it has been the subject of major and lively debate."
"Many of its critics were already sceptical that the directive could be adopted before the elections or enlargement."
"I am all the more glad, as rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that tomorrow’s vote will make it possible for the directive to become a reality – and I hope that we will, tomorrow, adopt what the conciliation procedure has produced."
"This is a great day for environmental protection in the European Union."
"This directive will, for the first time, introduce compensation for damage to protected species and habitats – what is termed purely environmental damage."
"Moreover, there will, for the first time, be one system of liability for the whole Community, doing away with liability loopholes whose closure was long overdue and thereby benefiting the environment, so my group very definitely welcomes the outcome of the conciliation procedure."
"My group does, though, also see it as important that the conciliation procedure has produced a proportionate result, for the fact is – to use an adage quoted in the first-reading debate by Lord Inglewood, who will speak later – that the better is the enemy of the good."
"Let me pick out one point that was at the heart of the debate until very recently, and which can be taken as representative of the directive’s many crucial issues: is there, or is there not, a mandatory financial security regime?"
"My group has always rejected compulsory insurance of this kind. There are still simply insufficient reference data for a system of this sort."
"The purely environmental damage to which I referred at the outset cannot at present be calculated."
"Together with the Council and the Commission, the Conciliation Committee addressed these misgivings, with the result that insurance will not, at first, be mandatory."
"Instead, the Commission is urged to submit an evaluation report six years after the directive’s entry into force, and then decide on any new approaches that are appropriate."
"I see this as the right way ahead."
"Perhaps I may conclude by saying this on behalf of my group: let us join together in adopting what has come out of the conciliation procedure and thereby improve the protection of the environment in the European Union in the long term."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to extend the warmest of thanks to Mr Manders for the circumspect and collegial manner in which this conciliation procedure was conducted."
"I see that as the reason why we achieved such a very good outcome."
"I have to say, though, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that we Social Democrats are less than enraptured by the outcome; we would have liked the ‘polluter pays’ principle to have been enforced with much greater rigour, along with a mandatory and immediate financial security regime, but it was not possible to get that through the conciliation procedure, quite simply because the majorities in this House are not what they need to be if that is to be done – with consequent effects on the lawmaking process."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists will nonetheless be voting for the compromise, for some of the things we have managed to achieve can be described as first steps in the right direction."
"We have, for a start, managed to require the Commission, within six years, to submit a report on the availability of financial security provision, and what is very much of the essence is that it has undertaken to respond to the House’s concerns by presenting proposals for a system of harmonised mandatory financial security instruments."
"I do not think we would be able vote in favour had it not done so, and another reason why I see this as important is that it would not merely leave it to the market to develop a single European system of provision for financial liability; instead, from the very outset, one would be given shape and guided in a proper direction."
"The second reason why we will be voting in favour is that this House will be able to get the Commission to examine to what extent limited liability, as provided for in international conventions, is at present possible when goods are transported by sea."
"This report is also to examine the relation between the liability of shipowners and the contributions of those who buy crude oil, for calamities such as the wreck of the make it necessary that we again rethink the arrangements for liability at sea."
"Let me sum up by saying that we are not entirely satisfied with what has been achieved, and we would have liked much more."
"I can see Mr Manders nodding; he too, I know, would have liked more, but that was not possible."
"This, then, is a first step, and we will, in future, be persistent in seeing to it that it is followed by more as we move towards the right solution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing my thanks for, and congratulations on, the result that has been achieved after all."
"I know that it has been very difficult to bring this very important Directive to fruition."
"At all events, we now have a draft on which to vote tomorrow, and I and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance shall be supporting it."
"This does not mean that we are completely satisfied with the result."
"The ‘polluter pays’ principle is excellent."
"It is also excellent that we now have a harmonised system of liability to prevent environmental damage and ensure that the damage already done is remedied."
"As Mr Manders said, Europe had not been properly ready for it; at least, parts of Europe may not have been ready for it."
"There was a good number of us that wanted a more harmonised system, and we could have gone a little further than this."
"After first reading we were very content, but after second reading we were no longer so content."
"Now we have a compromise that we can live with, and it is a good thing that something has been achieved, after all."
"The proposal that the Commission should present a report after six years on the mandatory financial security instruments, in particular, is incredibly important if these are to function at all."
"One way of reaching a compromise at the final stage is through a declaration by the Commission, in which it makes clear that it intends to fulfil the obligations imposed on it by the compromise reached between Parliament and the Council."
"I am not sure whether such a declaration would be binding, but I hope so, so that we do not drag our heels for these six years."
"I hope that this does effectively apply."
"Perhaps Mrs Wallström could tell us something about the legal status of this type of declaration?"
"Mr President, like all the other speakers so far, I must join the chorus and say that I believe this is a reasonable compromise."
"To use an English cricketing metaphor, it is important to deal with these kinds of issues in a pragmatic way and to 'take it in singles', to move one step at a time in order to try to ensure that the way in which we deal with the kind of pollution problems that this directive is supposed to deal with actually works."
"Clearly it is important to make sure that pollution is not generated in the first place."
"I am not sure how much that has to do with the apportionment of the way in which liability arises if pollution does occur."
"If it occurs then we need to see how it is dealt with."
"As other speakers have said, the polluter-pays principle must be the right one."
"On the other hand, if one defines the polluter-pays principle, it is important that one does not just cast about to find some wretched victim who may have had some kind of association with what happened and heap all the liability on to him."
"Perhaps that is why we disagree with some of the other speakers in this debate."
"I can envisage circumstances where it is right and just that the government has a role, where pollution has taken place, and where it may not be appropriate to put the blame or impose the responsibility for what occurs on some other party."
"Lastly, it is important in the context of the politics of this kind of debate not to have a knee-jerk reaction to any particular pollution incident in the recent past."
"We often hear mention of the ."
"Of course that was a disaster, but when we are thinking about general rules against general problems, we must not be too specific."
"Mr President, my point of view is naturally closer to that of Mrs Gebhardt, who has spoken on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"This directive represents a step forward in principle, but not in practice, because its application by the Member States has a time limit of three years, the possibility of examining an obligatory insurance system is left for a period of six years and there are provisions which will not enter into force for nine or ten years."
"This at a time when these types of accident are happening constantly."
"Specifically, in the field of responsibility for damage caused by ships and other things, there are international conventions which limit the responsibility of shipowners."
"From a practical point of view, therefore, Community citizens are not going to see any difference now nor for many years to come."
"This is a beginning – Parliament has been very cautious in accepting it in order to maintain the commitment of the States – but we must be completely realistic: there is no real progress here."
"Accidents will continue to happen, causing immeasurable damage which is not insured, there is no way of obliging the shipowners or other sectors creating risks to take responsibility and there could be cases of regions, such as mine for example, which lives exclusively from its coasts, being faced with an oil slick which entirely wrecks the activity of the region without the possibility of receiving compensation nor of damage being covered by an insurance system."
"That is the reality."
"As always, however, this Parliament, in fulfilling its responsibility – which seems excessive because, since Parliament has codecision powers, it appears to be characterised by a high degree of responsibility – has preferred to suffer slings and arrows in order to accept the compromise – I would not call it a compromise, but rather a diktat – imposed by the Council and the Commission and, to ensure that the proposed Directive can go ahead, has accepted these conditions."
"In this task, Mr Manders has done everything he could."
"We are left with just a few verbal commitments."
"Let it not be said, however, that we or the electors have been deceived: this is just the beginning."
"Let us hope that the Commission does not wait for these long periods of three, six, nine and ten years, but that within a short space of time – probably as a result of another great accident, which will cause enormous damage in any part of the European Union, whether it be in the Baltic, the Mediterranean, the North Sea or any other place – it is obliged to present us, and to do so quickly, with a proposal which changes this and allows us to move ahead with much more precise rules."
"Another issue which must be clarified is whether a Directive is the appropriate instrument or whether we need a Regulation which makes this type of rule obligatory, without waiting for the States to slowly fulfil their responsibilities towards their citizens."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too extend my congratulations on the important step to be taken at tomorrow’s vote."
"I would remind you that, in the Convention’s draft of the new constitution for the European Member States of the EU, we undertake to implement a policy intended to secure social, economic and environmental development on a sustainable basis."
"In that the environmental liability directive deals with the prevention and remedying of environmental damage, I see it as a logical consequence of our commitment to the European model of the environmentally responsible market economy, and so I very much welcome the fact that the polluter pays principle will apply from now on, and that businesses or other operators will be obliged to prevent damage to the environment and, where they have caused any, to repair it themselves or bear any necessary restorative costs."
"Reference has already been made to the evaluation process and to the agreement that has been reached to the effect that preventive and restorative work has to be carried out in close consultation with the operators."
"There are two flies in the ointment that I would like to mention; one is that this directive does not deal with nuclear liability."
"We find it incomprehensible that the polluter must be held liable for any environmental damage done by wind power, biomass, biogas and solar energy installations, but not, according to this directive, when such pollution arises from the operation of nuclear power plant."
"I appeal to the Member States to ensure the exclusion from liability of normal operation permitted by the authorities and development risk, to neither of which it has as yet been possible to secure an explicit reference in law."
"We endorse the joint text."
"Mr President, again on behalf of my British Conservative colleagues – my colleague Lord Inglewood, who worked on this, has spoken already – and my Group, I certainly welcome very much the excellent work of Mr Manders over a long period and also through conciliation."
"I am bound to remark, as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, that the decision that our committee should undertake this work, much contested by colleagues in other committees, has been more than amply borne out in the practical and pragmatic response that we have had, and I think we have a workable proposal."
"However, as a number of colleagues have said – and this is a time for looking forward rather than backwards, because we have the agreement on the table – there is a lot of work to do to establish the clear responsibilities with organisations and to ensure through the so-called competent authorities in Member States that companies' operating processes and anyone involved in potentially environmentally damaging activities are fully aware of their potential responsibilities under this directive."
"I want to encourage the Commissioner – who, I hope, will leave something in place as part of her legacy as five years as Commissioner – to start to encourage Member States to exchange practice, firstly, about how they are going to establish their competent authorities or, indeed, how they are going to allocate responsibilities to existing environmental agencies that many of them have already established; and to establish the sort of networks of sharing of best practice that we are seeing in a number of other pan-European regulatory environments, such as energy and communications."
"There seems to me no reason why that process should not start at once, and also why communications to affected organisations should not also start."
"This directive, as a number of colleagues have said, has a very slow-burning fuse to it."
"Member States have quite a generous three-year timescale."
"There are also long timescales before review."
"However, if, as we all believe, prevention is what we are after – rather than clearing up damage afterwards – we need to start action straight away and there is no excuse for delaying on that."
"So I welcome the agreement."
"However, this is only the start and I am sure – and hope – that the Commissioner will leave that structure in place for us to follow through."
". Mr President, allow me to interrupt briefly."
"I wanted to know whether my offer of a date is being accepted, because if so, we can make an arrangement via the Bureau."
". Mr President, I hope we can allow ourselves to feel proud today."
"This issue has been with us and with those before us for many years."
"It is a complicated and politically sensitive issue."
"We have managed to establish the platform and although we have all said that it is a first step, it is a very important first step."
"It also establishes the attitude and re-establishes the polluter pays principle."
"We can only build on that and take it further, which is why it is such an important first step."
"I wanted to answer Mrs Schörling directly because the Commission statement about looking at the financial security again in 2006 is not formally legally binding, but you might call it politically binding."
"I hope that means as much as if it had been legally binding."
"It is an obligation and a commitment from the Commission so, of course, we will have to come back on this."
"I am sure we have only seen the beginning."
"It is so important, for the reasons you have all mentioned."
"Thank you again, and all right, I will come for a drink!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0177/2004) by Mr Sjöstedt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the management of waste from the extractive industries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the European Parliament, and especially the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Sjöstedt, for the work that he has put into his report at first reading."
"Waste from extraction can be of such a composition and volume as to pose a serious threat to the environment and human health if it is not managed correctly."
"This has of course been seen in the major accidents in Aznalcóllar in Spain, in 1998, and also in Baia Mare in Romania, in 2000, when tailings ponds burst, releasing large quantities of toxic substances. This had an extensive environmental, economic and social impact."
"The aim of this proposal is to introduce EU-wide rules to prevent water and soil pollution from long-term storage of waste in tailings ponds or heaps."
"The stability of disposal facilities must also be ensured in order to prevent the occurrence, or reduce the impact, of accidents."
"Combined with the amended Seveso II Directive on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, and a document on the best available techniques for the management of ponds for tailings and waste rocks, this proposed Directive will guarantee the appropriate management of waste from extraction throughout the EU."
"The Commission shares the views of those who have said that the proposal must have a sufficiently broad scope, and that some exemptions, for example concerning waste from prospecting, should therefore be removed."
"In this context, the exemption for inert waste should not be extended to cover all non-hazardous waste, as that would weaken the proposal."
"Contamination from mines can indeed pose a problem, but it cannot be regulated by this proposal, which concerns waste."
"Regarding historical waste, the Commission supports the amendments containing requirements for the most contaminated sites to be inventoried."
"In our opinion, however, it should be the Member States which make the decisions on the rehabilitation of these sites."
"We also support the amendments emphasising the need to make appropriate plans for the closure of disposal facilities as early as the design phase."
"I should like to conclude by pointing out that the Commission is striving for a directive that is sufficiently comprehensive to enable the achievement of these important environmental objectives."
"Mr President, before I go into detail on this proposal and Parliament’s suggested changes and improvements, I should like to recapitulate on the background to this Directive."
"It was prompted by the serious environmental disasters in Spain and Romania that the Commissioner also mentioned."
"We should be aware that the problem of collapsing mine dams is something that recurs almost yearly in different parts of the world, including in the EU."
"At the same time, it can be said that an environmental disaster is lurking, in the form of the leakage into the environment of old mining waste, about which we often know very little, chiefly heavy metals."
"All things considered, this could be said to constitute a considerably greater environmental problem than the mining currently in operation."
"At the same time, EU legislation in this field has been inefficient, as the existing directives on waste, some of which currently apply to mining waste, are ineffective and ill-suited to this type of industrial production."
"This makes it perfectly clear that a new directive is needed in this field."
"Hence, we should like to thank the Commission for its proposal."
"This has many good points, for example regarding the safety of ponds and the effective prohibition of the method involving a high cyanide content, which had been used in Romania."
"This Directive will make that method inadmissible in future."
"As a Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and as rapporteur, I should also like to see further improvements."
"Firstly, it is important that this cover all relevant types of waste."
"For that reason, we have chosen to remove a number of exemptions, for example concerning waste from prospecting."
"I also think that it is important that it cover waste that is removed from the nearest production site."
"I am especially grateful that we have been able to agree on a definition that I think works well, because the definitions issue was rather complicated in this case."
"There is now agreement on this within the political groups."
"I should also like to mention inert non-hazardous waste."
"It is important to realise that even waste that is not intrinsically or chemically hazardous can cause major environmental problems."
"This can happen if it is incorrectly stored, if it is allowed to contaminate water resources, or in the case of soil acidification."
"It is important that this waste, too, be covered by rules requiring that it be restored and managed properly."
"I do not think that the decision taken by the Committee on the Environment goes far enough in this regard, and have therefore tabled Amendment No 98, which would put this right, in my view."
"One of the key points in this report concerns historical waste, which is perhaps the greatest environmental problem of all."
"It is not sufficient to just make an inventory. We must also ensure that we really do address this issue, otherwise we are only going halfway towards tackling environmental problems."
"In my opinion, it is important to include this in the suggestions made in the report, so that we are also able to use Structural Funds to really address this."
"This will represent an opportunity for the new Member States, in particular, to address these quite significant environmental problems."
"I also think that this should be seen as an opportunity for new technology and for that research and development currently taking place in the EU that to some extent already leads the world in this field and, above all, can do so in the future."
"On the subject of financial guarantees from companies, too, we opted for a compromise among the political groups even before first reading."
"This involved our allowing Member States considerable freedom to give shape to these financial guarantees."
"This is a good thing, as many countries already have effective systems in place."
"At the same time, Commission approval will be required so that the guarantees meet requirements, which is only reasonable."
"Regarding technical solutions to the various provisions of the proposal, my aim as rapporteur was that we avoid going into technical detail and shackling these proposals to various technical solutions: that would hinder adaptation to technological developments."
"I believe that we have indeed achieved this result."
"Another point that I should like to mention is that, from a global perspective, a large proportion of the least responsible mining takes place in the very poorest countries."
"We have inserted into the report words to the effect that, where EU funding is granted for mining projects, for instance from the European Investment Bank, compliance with the requirements laid down in the Directive will be a prerequisite for this aid."
"Another point that I have chosen to emphasise concerns the monitoring of dams."
"Despite construction requirements, there are often shortcomings in that dams are not adapted later, nor are they monitored as required if the production conditions change."
"We have also seen this in these accidents."
"Another important point is that we want planning to take place right at the beginning, before the closure phase."
"Taken as a whole, I think that the Committee on the Environment’s draft strengthens the Commission’s work significantly, whilst still being fully in line with it."
"I hope that these proposals will enable us to address the fundamental problems that I mentioned at the beginning: preventing major dam collapses, making leakage of pollutants into the environment a thing of the past, and establishing legislation in this field that is effective in practice and comprehensive."
"The framework for doing so is now in place."
"I should like to take a couple of seconds to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the representatives of the Commission for their constructive cooperation."
". – Mr President, the main issue in this directive is the definition of waste in the extractive industry sector, where waste is either non-hazardous or hazardous."
"The way some of the amendments have been worded with regard to inert waste only serves to confuse the whole situation, resulting in a sea of endless questions."
"Non-hazardous waste, which is the kind of waste associated with extractive industries, is indeed non-hazardous, because it is material that has its origin in nature."
"Nature’s own environmentally non-hazardous material, waste rock, cannot be waste, especially if it is still being used as filler material in mines and quarries, for soil improvement or road construction."
"Making waste rock subject to a waste tax in Finland could only cost the jobs of hundreds, if not thousands, of people."
"European extractive industries will bring remarkable added value for the European Union."
"The socio-economic impact of the new extractive industry will be of crucial importance, especially for sparsely populated and peripheral regions."
"It is by no means a matter of insignificance how this branch of industry should be handled."
"Telephones, windows, glasses, crockery, cutlery, transport and building, to name just some goods and sectors of industry, are all based on this industry."
"Now it is a question of whether we want to keep this industry in Europe under our own supervision and in compliance with the principle of sustainable development, or drive it outside the Union, where its environmental implications are beyond our control, through legislation that is too constraining and unfamiliar to the sector."
"It is crucial that an explicit Minerals Policy for the European Union is drawn up, taking into account environmental and economic factors."
"Once again this would be a task for the Commissioner responsible for competition."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe being a well-ordered, clean and ecologically-minded place, there is particular interest in waste policy, and this evening we turn our attention to the waste produced by mining."
"Needing as we do the riches of the earth in order to live, we seek them out, process them and use them."
"They are of differing value, and it is their utility value that is decisive."
"The question arises of whether all of what we do not at present use or process is to be categorised as waste."
"I do not believe that it is."
"In order to get at the material deeper below the surface, good soil, earth and overburden are removed, transported away and later tipped back onto the excavated sites, thus guaranteeing the return of fertile fields and meadows, in other words, that the earth will be as good as it was before."
"What made discussions in Committee so difficult was the definition of waste, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, in its report, the Sjöstedt report, has opted very firmly for the definition that is already in the Waste Framework Directive."
"We are in favour of real waste – polluted material or stones – being properly removed and disposed of."
"Overburden and topsoil – at least as the terms are used in German – constitute reusable materials that are vitally important elsewhere, in that, without them, opencast mines could not be properly filled in, and recultivation would be impossible without topsoil."
"All those who engage in extractive work, or who make incisions in nature, are also under an obligation to leave behind them tidy, orderly and, above all, hazard-free land when their work is done, so it is right that the plans should include a contractual provision for renaturation and recultivation with effect from the commencement of work."
"We lay down sureties for this; these must, however, be both secure and flexible."
"This is where the Member States are under an obligation to lay down criteria, which must then be approved by the Commission."
"We are, above all, concerned about the misdeeds of the past, the incorrectly decommissioned mines, the tailings that were piled up; this is what we term historical waste."
"It is right and proper that we should speak up in favour of making an inventory of the one and removing the other, but this requires more time."
"There is a need for criteria that are capable of being met and put into practice."
"In Amendments Nos 71 and 72, the rapporteur does not go far enough."
"A directive on mining waste does not have to repeat and recapitulate everything that is already regulated in other European Union directives, such as the Landfill Directive, the Water Framework Directive and the Waste Framework Directive."
"I would again like to point out, by way of conclusion, that all our efforts must have sustainability as their objective."
"Environmental, economic and social considerations must be weighed in the balance, no less when approving plant than when restructuring it and imposing conditions on waste management plans."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have arrived late, but that is because we currently have not only mining waste to deal with, but also – basically, indeed, anticipating the next parliamentary term – and again, with our REACH system, in other words with chemicals policy."
"I have just been spending the evening with BASF, a major chemicals business, and have had to leave them in a rush in order to get here."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists is very happy with the legislation we now have on waste from the mineral-extracting industry."
"What we in Europe need is unified standards for the management of this waste, which will not only lead to greater similarity between the conditions under which companies compete in the Member States, but will also, at the same time, improve the public’s living conditions and their environment."
"The Committee’s deliberations generally focussed on the definition of what is meant by waste and on the financial guarantees to be provided by the industry, but a broad majority backed what we agreed on, and there was general agreement on it; we hope that the plenary will tomorrow follow us in that agreement."
"We want every company to be obliged to ensure that it is able to repair any damage to the environment for which it is responsible."
"We do not insist that only one form of financial surety should be possible."
"Although we have left a great deal of leeway and many options, the Member States and the Commission must guarantee to us that this will work."
"When it came to defining mining waste, we took on board everything from everyone who engaged in the discussion process – the industry, the environmental NGOs, the Court of Justice, and, not least, the Commission."
"There is no question of us in the Committee having voted to reinvent existing legislation; quite the contrary, that is precisely what we have avoided."
"We have made a number of improvements to the Commission proposal with environmental considerations in mind."
"We have made the connection between ecology and economy, something that Social Democrats have always been keen to do."
"The fact that the plenary has only 20 amendments from the groups to vote on testifies to the good work we have done in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I found working on this dossier with my fellow Members of the Committee a very pleasant experience; the Commission, too, was very helpful on many occasions, and so let me now express my warm thanks for that."
"Mr President, my Group very much supports the rapporteur's position on this issue."
"We feel it is an extremely important area."
"Mining and quarrying waste accounts for nearly 30% of the annual EU waste, which equals hundreds of millions of tons of waste."
"I come from a country which encouraged mining activities without looking at the long-term consequences of these activities, and some of the mines have left a history of major problems which will reach far into the future; for example, Tynagh Mines in Ireland is one of the most obvious cases."
"There has to be accountability here."
"Because of the lack of proper control, mining companies have been able to get away with leaving behind, when they have finished their operations, a legacy which continues to pollute our environment and our water."
"This directive goes a long way towards ensuring that this does not happen."
"All extractive waste has to include inert waste."
"That is extremely important."
"In relation to historical waste, that is particularly important in countries like my own where mining activities are not as prolific as they have been in the past."
"I support everything that the rapporteur has said."
"It is a very important report, and a very important position has been adopted by the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I hope that the Commission can accept the rapporteur's amendments, which improve the Commission's proposal."
"It is also in line with many of the environmental groups around Europe who feel that this is crucial, as well as the rapporteur's recommendations."
"Mr President, I wish to begin, like everyone else, by thanking the rapporteur for his report."
"He has done a good job over a relatively short period of time."
"This is a much-needed report and, for obvious reasons, the accidents in Romania and Spain, but also other incidents that have taken place around the Union over time, have demonstrated quite clearly that this kind of material poses a real danger to human health and to the environment if it is mismanaged."
"This proposal deals with those environmental industrial problems."
"Many of us were somewhat surprised by the number of amendments initially tabled on the proposal, but in many ways that simply reflects the importance and the seriousness of the nature of this proposal."
"Sadly, we in the UK have long been aware of the dangers of mining waste since the terrible disaster of Aberfan in 1966 and the terrible deaths that occurred there."
"Consequently, our national legislation has been particularly strict and strong with regard to mining waste."
"However, there were parts of this new legislation that were new, innovative and worthy of adoption."
"There were some, though – particularly the extension of the scope to inert waste – which I felt were misguided."
"Nevertheless, I felt that the need for a registry of closed sites and previously occupied new sites was particularly important if we were really to establish the full extent of the problem across Europe."
"In the end, we have a good result."
"I commend the proposal to the House."
"It will fit neatly alongside the complementary legislation – IPPC, Seveso, and landfill – and make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment, human health and sustainable development."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to mention the definition of waste."
"This proposal does not contain a specific definition of waste from the extractive industries, but instead reproduces the general definition of waste from the Waste Framework Directive, 75/442/EEC."
"This does not prevent such waste being reused for a beneficial purpose, for instance in construction materials."
"It is important to make this clear."
"I should like to give the Commission’s reaction to important amendments."
"The Commission can accept Amendment No 32 fully, and Amendment No 26 in part or in principle."
"The amendments concerning the scope of the proposal are of course of particular importance."
"Amendment No 15 concerning Article 2.3 proposes that material such as unpolluted topsoil and waste from prospecting be covered by the limited requirements pursuant to this Article."
"The Commission can support this course of action, as it increases legal certainty and also improves environmental safeguards."
"We also support the amendment to the effect that disposal facilities for inert waste should also be covered by the provisions on serious accidents."
"Amendment No 15 proposes that the limited requirements of Article 2.3 should include non-hazardous waste."
"That part of Amendment No 15 would have a significant impact on the overall effectiveness of the proposal, and the Commission cannot accept that."
"For different reasons, the Commission cannot support the amendments that introduce certain measures for exhausted mine voids that have been allowed to fill up with water."
"We think that this issue should be resolved under the Water Framework Directive."
"It is necessary to manage the great burden from the past presented by closed and abandoned disposal facilities."
"The Commission has proposed an exchange of information on methods for charting and rehabilitating these facilities."
"Amendment No 71 would make this information obligatory at EU level."
"Drawing up inventories to identify the worst sources of pollution is a major step on the way to solving this problem."
"The Commission can support this strategy."
"Decisions on the rehabilitation itself should, however, rest with the Member States."
"Another issue is the requirement for financial guarantees to cover the costs if operators can no longer be held responsible."
"The Commission can support the clarifications in Amendments Nos 66 and 67, but cannot accept the part of Amendment No 66 that stipulates that these procedures be approved by the Commission, as this falls within the Member States’ competence."
"Nor can we accept amendments concerning the form of these guarantees, as the text should retain its present flexibility."
"A transitional period has been granted for disposal facilities granted a permit before the entry into force of this Directive."
"Amendment No 74 contains an attempt to introduce certain requirements during that period, including by referring to the Water Framework Directive."
"The Commission thinks this unnecessary, as the provisions of EU water legislation and also the general requirements of the Waste Framework Directive apply."
"In addition, the rationale behind the transitional period should not be undermined."
"Amendments Nos 29 and 35 underline the need for appropriate management of the closure and after-closure of disposal facilities."
"A number of amendments also propose making reference to EU standards for evaluating environmentally friendly management."
"Amendments Nos 32 and 57 establish a direct link to the objectives of the Water Framework Directive, and Amendment No 46 establishes a direct link toprotected areas."
"Finally, Amendment No 7 also explains the role of this Directive in EUdevelopment aid."
"The Commission supports these amendments, which have the same objectives as the Commission proposal and which increase consistency with other important EU legislation."
"I am going to leave a complete list, giving the Commission’s opinions on the amendments, with the Secretariat(1), and I should like to express my thanks for this initial debate on this important proposal, which will raise the profile of both these problems and our proposed solutions."
"As many Members have said, action is needed, as these problems are much more common than we think, as are the recurrent accidents in Europe and around the world."
"The problem must be tackled."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Wallström."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon."
"(2)"
"The Commission can accept the following amendments wholly or partly and subject to rewording: 5, 6, 10, 18, 19, 25, 26, 27, 28, 90, 31, 32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 52, 56, 58, 62, 64, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 82, 85, 86, 95, 96, 97, 98, 106, 109 and 119."
"With regard to Amendment No 10, the Commission would accept the possibility for stricter national rules provided that they are compatible with the general rules of the Treaty."
"The explicit reference in the amendment to banning the export of horses for production or slaughter would require a specific legal examination in this regard."
"The Commission would support Amendments Nos 28, 73 and 95 on the use of a satellite navigation system provided that the measure only applies to vehicles carrying out long journeys."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 9 and 16 in relation to the scope of the regulation, the Commission could accept an exemption for transport of less than 50 km (vs. the amendment's 100 km) but not for animals transported for sporting events or shows if for commercial purposes."
"The Commission cannot accept the following amendments: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 29, 33, 34, 41, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 53, 54, 55, 57, 59, 60, 61, 63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 81, 83, 84, 87, 88, 89 to 94, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 107, 108, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 120, 121, 122, 123 or 124."
"The Commission can accept the following amendments as part of the compromise package: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15."
"The Commission cannot accept the other amendments."
"The Commission can accept the following amendments as part of the compromise package: 9, 10 and 11."
"The Commission cannot accept the other amendments."
"The Commission can accept the following amendments as part of the compromise package: 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22."
"The Commission cannot accept the other amendments."
"The Commission can accept the following amendments: 1, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 and 20 to 91."
"The Commission can accept the following amendments subject to rewording: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 16, 18 and 19."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment: 7."
"The Commission position on the 112 amendments is as follows: it accepts 10 amendments in full – 8, 9, 12, 14, 18, 29, 35, 46, 50 and 78; it accepts 19 amendments in principle – 3, 7, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 24, 30, 31, 32, 40, 52, 77, 81, 82, 95, 102 and 107; it accepts 9 amendments in part – 33, 34, 41, 52, 53, 63, 70, 93 and 111; it rejects 74 amendments in full – 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 36, 37, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 47, 48, 49, 51, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 79, 80, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 94, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 104, 105, 106, 108, 109, 110 and 112."

"– Mr President, on the way from the Chamber to a meeting of my group yesterday, I was pushed into a corner by a camera team, prevented from continuing on my way, and hurt my back in the process."
"I would ask you, as a matter of urgency, to ensure that Members can go about their business in this House without interference from representatives of the media."
"I will have the services look into that to ensure that we can go about our business as we ought to be able to in the House."
"– Mr President, as I am sure you are aware, next Wednesday the world will commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Rwandan genocide."
"Nearly one million people were slaughtered, and international intervention came only too late."
"Even now, we have to ask if there is the political will to put in place the measures likely to prevent future suffering on this scale."
"You will, I know, agree that there must never be a 'next time', and I would therefore request that tomorrow we remember the events in Rwanda ten years ago and that we have a minute's silence in support of the need to never stand aside again."
"I take note of that for the opening of tomorrow's sitting, Mrs Kinnock."
"The next item is the joint debate on the European Council and security:"
"- European Council report and Commission statement – European Council meeting (Brussels, 25-26 March 2004) and"
"- Council and Commission statements – Security of citizens in Europe following the Madrid bombings."
"–Mr President, President Prodi, I am very pleased to be here with you today to report on the outcome of last week’s spring European Council."
"When I last had the honour to address this House in January on the priorities of the Irish presidency, I said that the overriding objective of our presidency was to secure outcomes that would have a positive impact on the lives of Europe's peoples."
"I believe that last week's European Council has contributed to securing positive outcomes in a very real way."
"The European Union has shown, yet again, that it has the ability to address new challenges."
"It has shown that when we move together, we can make a real difference to people's daily lives."
"The significant progress made at last week's European Council was due to many factors."
"One important factor, I am convinced, is the excellent working relationship that has been built up between the Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament."
"The theme of the Irish presidency is 'Europeans – working together'."
"The European Council has clearly shown how much can be achieved when we succeed in doing this."
"At the meeting, as honourable Members will be aware, the European Council adopted a Declaration on Combating Terrorism."
"We agreed to resume our negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference and to reach agreement no later than at our meeting in June."
"We identified what needs to be done in practical terms to promote sustainable growth and more jobs."
"We discussed a range of foreign policy issues, including the Middle East, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Balkans and Russia."
"Sadly, as we are all too well aware, last week's European Council took place in the shadow of the terrible attack in Madrid on 11 March."
"I want to express, yet again, my sympathies to the families of the victims."
"I know that all here will agree with me when I say that this attack was a grave challenge to all that the European Union stands for."
"In considering how to respond to this threat, the European Council wished to ensure that everything that can be done is being done to protect our citizens from the scourge of terrorism."
"At the same time, fundamental human rights in our democracies must be protected."
"I believe that the Declaration on Combating Terrorism adopted by the European Council strikes the appropriate balance."
"It highlights our existing cooperation, it seeks to improve and emphasise the need to implement what we have agreed."
"I am glad to say also that the Declaration endorsed a proposal made by European parliamentarians to declare 11 March a European Day commemorating the victims of terrorism."
"The Declaration contains a number of specific areas for action. These include measures to improve intelligence sharing, to strengthen border controls and the security of travel documents, enhanced protection for our transport systems and measures to counter the financing of terrorism."
"It also contains a commitment to effective cooperation with third countries and other international organisations, in particular the United Nations."
"A Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, Mr de Vries, has been appointed, reflecting the need for coordinated action across the European Union."
"The European Council will look again at the Action Plan on Terrorism in June and we will all agree the key tasks and the deadlines by which these tasks are to be achieved."
"The European Council also agreed a Declaration on Solidarity against Terrorism."
"This commits the Member States to act jointly in a spirit of solidarity if one of them is the victim of a terrorist attack."
"The Declaration represents an important political signal of our solidarity in the fight against terrorism."
"I appreciate very much that President Cox participated in the first session of our meeting on terrorism."
"The solidarity shown by the institutions of the Union conveyed an important message."
"The threat of terrorism is a threat to our security, our democracies and our way of life in the European Union."
"We will do everything in our power to protect our people from this threat."
"I am particularly pleased that there was major progress in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"On the basis of my report, the European Council requested the presidency to continue its consultations."
"It also requested the presidency to arrange for the resumption of formal negotiations in the IGC as soon as appropriate."
"It decided that agreement on the new Constitution should be reached no later than the June European Council."
"When I spoke here in January, I made clear my commitment to seizing any opportunity to take forward the IGC, and, if possible, to conclude it during our presidency."
"But at that time, and indeed up until the European Council itself, it was not clear how far we would be able to go."
"We were not certain that it would be possible to relaunch the IGC, even though we very strongly wished to do so."
"Indeed, many people, during the initial stages of our presidency, told me that they thought there was little chance."
"We could not have reached agreement on a timeframe for the conclusion of the IGC without the political commitment of my colleagues in the European Council."
"Last week, we all rededicated ourselves to the Constitution, and acknowledged its value and importance."
"The sooner it is in place, the better."
"We also recognised that, even though the final negotiations will be difficult, there was no reason to believe that they would become any easier in time."
"Indeed, there was a general sense around the table that delay might even create further complications."
"There was also a sense of the need for flexibility and compromise on all sides."
"The development of this positive and constructive spirit made it possible to decide to go for it now."
"This is a huge step forward, and great credit is due to this Parliament."
"You have consistently urged the Member States collectively to drive forward the negotiations."
"Your very positive endorsement of the presidency's strategy has been deeply appreciated, and I look forward to continuing to work with you and your representatives over the period ahead."
"In our consultations with all delegations, we have been able to confirm that the great bulk of the Convention's text is not in dispute."
"We have also ascertained that many of the additional proposals made by the Italian presidency would have been acceptable to partners in the context of an overall agreement."
"There are still several outstanding issues, which vary considerably in complexity and sensitivity."
"We have, however, also been able to identify possible ways forward and believe that all of them can be resolved."
"This will not be easy."
"It will require give and take from all sides."
"But I believe that the key ingredient – the political will to reach agreement – is now there."
"Parliament’s representatives, like those of all other delegations, have made clear to us which issues are of particular importance to you."
"It is not possible for me to say that any delegation will secure every point it has raised. However, I can assure you – as I can assure everybody else – that the presidency will be open and even-handed in its dealings with everyone."
"I can guarantee that you will not be bypassed or blindsided in the negotiations."
"I want all participants to be able to recommend the final outcome to the people of Europe as fair, balanced and positive."
"As I said in my report, the most difficult issues remain the size and composition of the Commission, and the definition and scope of qualified majority voting."
"At last week's meeting, we did not enter into detailed discussions on these issues, nor did I try to draw conclusions."
"But I offered my broad sense of which avenues for compromise might be most productively explored."
"I recognise that the Commission must be both effective and legitimate."
"I feel that these two perspectives should be reconciled through maintaining for an extended period a Commission comprising one national of each Member State, moving thereafter to a reduced size on the basis of equal rotation."
"It is clear that only a voting system based on double majority can command a consensus."
"It is also vital that we keep the requirement for increased efficiency firmly in view, while paying due regard to balance among the Member States and to their specific concerns."
"It should be possible to reach an outcome that meets the concerns of all."
"I believe this could be done through some adjustments of the population and Member State thresholds and through arrangements for confirmation of the transition to double majority."
"But clearly, further consideration of the details is required."
"As regards the scope of qualified majority voting, there is a general desire – shared, I know, by Parliament – for its extension, with a view to promoting efficient decision-making in a larger Union."
"At the same time, there is also a need to take account of the particular concerns of Member States in relation to a number of specific issues."
"I believe that a satisfactory overall outcome, which will involve a growth in the number of areas subject to QMV and codecision, in comparison with the present Treaties, will be found."
"These issues are unlikely to be finally resolved until close to the end of the negotiations."
"However, in the period ahead, it will be essential to reach agreement on as many subjects as possible, to boil down to the minimum the number of outstanding questions."
"In this process, the presidency intends to make use of the full range of channels, including bilateral meetings and official-level discussions."
"But the IGC is, of course, conducted at political level, and I will be asking Foreign Ministers to take forward work on a range of issues during the final negotiations at the level of Heads of State or Government."
"Like you, I would very much wish to conclude the IGC at the earliest date."
"However, account will have to be taken of a number of factors, including the formation of new governments in some countries and the number of issues still to be resolved."
"I assure you that if we discover that there is a real opportunity to finish before June, we will do so."
"We should not underestimate how far forward we have come."
"Only a few short weeks ago, few would have been optimistic about our chances of finishing by June at all."
"So far, as presidency, we have sought to keep expectations modest but ambitions high."
"No ambition is higher than the achievement of our common objective of a Constitution that will deliver for our citizens and help make the Union more effective at home and in the wider world."
"With your help, I look forward to reaching that goal."
"When I spoke to this House in January, I set out the high priority that the Irish presidency was giving to the Lisbon Agenda and of our firm determination that the spring European Council should serve to revitalise and reinvigorate the Lisbon process."
"I was greatly encouraged by the response of the European Parliament to our ideas at that time."
"I am pleased to report that the European Council had a fruitful discussion last week."
"We focused on the key issues where action is crucial if we are to re-inject momentum into the Lisbon Agenda."
"My colleagues agreed with my proposal that discussions should be on two overarching themes – sustainable growth and employment – as the key challenges needed to be tackled urgently."
"The European Council agreed that we need a balanced approach if we are to ensure that future growth will be sustainable."
"We need to maintain sound macro-economic policies while promoting greater competitiveness and innovation."
"At the same time, social cohesion must remain central to our approach."
"Equally, future growth, to be sustainable, has to be environmentally sound."
"The European Parliament’s constructive engagement with the Council has been pivotal in enabling us to make real progress on all aspects of the Union’s work, not least in legislative work directly related to the Lisbon Agenda."
"Legislation agreed in recent weeks ranges from financial services to rail market opening, to intellectual property rights and to environmental liability."
"I look forward to more results in the weeks immediately ahead."
"It is highly important for the continuing credibility of the Lisbon Agenda that we meet our objectives."
"I am delighted in this context to welcome your approval yesterday of two important legislative proposals – the Financial Instruments Markets Directive and the Transparency Directive."
"A key challenge identified at the European Council was in the services sector, which remains highly fragmented."
"Success in creating a true single market in this area will yield considerable benefits for the European consumer."
"The services sector has accounted for 70% of job creation and growth over the past ten years."
"I am pleased to report that the European Council, seeing the potential for expansion in this area, agreed that the draft directive on services, currently under consideration in the Council, should be agreed as a matter of high priority."
"The development of better regulation will lead to enhanced competitiveness and productivity."
"The European Council welcomed the four-presidency initiative led by Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the UK, which will drive this issue forward as a priority over the next two years."
"We will return to the issue of better regulation at the November 2004 European Council."
"If we are truly to encourage competitiveness, innovation and entrepreneurship throughout Europe, we must have a strong science and research capacity."
"Progress in the research area is a central element of the Lisbon Agenda."
"We must work to ensure that researchers remain in Europe, and are attracted to working in Europe."
"The European Council agreed, as a first step in this process, that the European Framework Programme for Research and Development should be made more user-friendly, to facilitate greater R[amp]D investment by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies."
"The European Council also stressed the need for investment in basic research."
"Such research is an essential building block for innovation and competitiveness."
"Growth must be not only economically sustainable but also environmentally sustainable."
"One of the most interesting new areas in this regard is that of environmental technologies."
"The European Council recognises the importance of enabling companies to exploit new technologies, and has called for the rapid implementation of the Environmental Technologies Action Plan."
"We have also invited the Commission and the European Investment Bank to see how financial instruments could be mobilised to promote such technologies."
"The Commission is to prepare a report for next year’s European Council on progress in this area."
"Of course, growth and competitiveness are not ends in themselves: they are the means to secure and develop the European social model, with its emphasis on sustainability and inclusion."
"Protecting the most vulnerable members of our society is an essential part of the Lisbon Agenda."
"The European Council placed employment at the very core of its agenda."
"Creating more and better jobs is the most urgent issue to be addressed over the coming year."
"The European Council agreed that Member States should give urgent attention to four particular structural challenges, identified by the Employment Taskforce and reinforced in the Joint Employment Report."
"These are to promote greater adaptability by companies and workers, attract more people into the labour market, improve the quality of employment, and encourage greater investment in human capital."
"There is a real benefit from taking action now to maximise employment opportunities."
"High employment will boost growth and also provides the best route out of poverty and social exclusion."
"Next year’s spring European Council will review progress made in this area over the course of the year."
"Particular attention will be given to the extent to which national actions have boosted progress towards the Lisbon employment goals."
"The Council and the Commission have been invited to jointly prepare a concise synthesis report, drawing on the joint employment report, specifically for that discussion."
"As I indicated earlier, Parliament’s role has been pivotal in enabling us to advance the Lisbon Agenda."
"One of the areas on which we hope to make progress over the coming weeks is that of a mobility package aimed at enabling workers to move more easily between Member States."
"We have worked together cooperatively on Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 which, once agreed, should bring significant benefits in terms of better coordination of social security systems and easier access to entitlements."
"I hope that we can finalise this dossier jointly before the end of the term."
"Equally, I look forward to fruitful cooperation on the related dossiers of Europass and the Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications Directive, which are aimed at making it easier to have educational qualifications recognised in other Member States."
"Governments alone cannot bring about the range of changes required to reach the Lisbon goal."
"All stakeholders have a vital role to play in progressing and facilitating change."
"To this end, the European Council agreed to the presidency's proposal to establish Reform Partnerships in each Member State, according to national arrangements and traditions, involving the social partners, civil society and the public authorities."
"These partnerships will provide a useful mechanism for building commitment for change and reform."
"We all recognise that much more needs to be done if Lisbon is to be implemented within its original timescale."
"Next year's mid-term review will provide a critical opportunity for us to take stock of what needs to be changed if we are to speed up the implementation process."
"We need to build our preparations for the mid-term review on a good foundation."
"To this end, Heads of State or Government invited the Commission to establish a high-level group, chaired by Mr Wim Kok, to carry out an independent review to contribute to this exercise."
"Wim Kok’s appointment will provide continuity with the earlier work of the Employment Taskforce."
"His unparalleled experience will provide a vital and invaluable impetus for the mid-term review."
"We have asked the High Level Group to report by 1 November of this year, to enable the Commission to bring forward its own recommendations to next year’s spring European Council."
"The European Council reviewed a number of issues on the international agenda and adopted conclusions on the Middle East Peace Process, Iraq, the Strategic Partnership with the Mediterranean and the Middle East, Russia, Afghanistan and the Ivory Coast."
"We also considered Cyprus."
"The European Council reviewed the situation in Kosovo following the recent outbreak of ethnically motivated violence."
"The situation appears to have stabilised, but remains tense."
"It is essential that the primacy of the political process be reasserted and that local politicians take responsibility for that situation."
"The European Union remains fully committed to a stable future for a secure, democratic, prosperous and multi-ethnic Kosovo."
"The Union will continue to support fully the efforts of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General, Mr Harri Holkeri, and the Standards before Status process."
"The Council also discussed the situation in the Middle East, which continues to be of grave concern."
"The presidency is maintaining close contact with the leaders of the principal Arab States to ensure that momentum in the peace process is not lost."
"Foreign Minister Cowen has visited Cairo and Damascus in the last two days and has emphasised the need for a concerted effort to advance our common goals of peace and security in the region through a just resolution of the conflict."
"On Afghanistan, the European Council looks forward to the international conference on Afghanistan that is taking place today in Berlin."
"The European Union remains firmly committed to the reconstruction of Afghanistan."
"Foreign Minister Brian Cowen is representing the EU at this important conference together with Mr Javier Solana and Commissioner Patten."
"The negotiations on a Cyprus settlement are in the final phase as we meet here today."
"The accession of a united Cyprus on 1 May remains the strong preference of the European Union."
"In our conclusions, the European Council reiterated the Union’s support for the UN-led negotiations and reaffirmed our readiness to accommodate the terms of a settlement in line with the principles on which the European Union is founded."
"This European Council took place at a critically important time in the history of the European Union."
"As we set out in our presidency programme, the first half of 2004 represents a time of great change and challenge, but also of great hope and opportunity for the Union."
"The first of May will mark the end of the post-war division of the continent and enable us to move forward together towards a better, more inclusive Europe."
"Terrible events like those of 11 March only serve to reinforce our determination to work together to forge agreements that will, in every sense, make Europe work."
"I look forward to continuing to work in full cooperation with the European Parliament and the European Commission."
"I particularly thank you today for all your cooperation over the last months."
"As we stand on the threshold of enlargement, we can continue to show that the new Europe, working together, has both the will and the determination to deliver the positive outcomes and decisions that our people deserve."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the process of European integration began life as a peace process."
"Over the last half century the peace objectives have evolved and stabilised, and today all the players in our united Europe share some deep-felt principles, because being part of the Union means respecting the fundamental rights of the person, regulating public life democratically, and developing and protecting our political, economic and social development model."
"I have been thinking about these principles a lot recently while reflecting on the internal and external challenges facing our Union, mainly because when confronted with the increasingly horrific threats of terrorism we seek common points of reference."
"The European Council which closed in Brussels last Saturday followed the same instinct."
"As you know, the Spring Council is the focus for the economic governance of the Union."
"Recent events, however, led to profound changes in the agenda, principally the Madrid attacks on 11 March, in the wake of which the Council adopted a number of measures to ensure our safety against the threat of terrorism."
"Once again, the attack struck down innocent citizens, and once again our first thoughts must go to them and to the victims’ families."
"The aftermath of the attacks has affected all Europeans: it has affected us personally and it has affected our civic and political institutions."
"Terrorism is the worst challenge since the Second World War ever to confront both the democratic, civilised principles regulating public life and our societies themselves, based as they are on respect for human rights."
"I am pleased to be able to tell this House that the Council has decided to face this threat with the greatest determination that is physically possible."
"The Declaration approved in Brussels leaves no room for doubt: the European Union Member States are forming a united front with the shared objective of completely eradicating terrorism."
"I therefore wholeheartedly welcome the measures to coordinate and unify intelligence, police and security systems that were agreed upon last weekend."
"At this historic stage, remember that this is the highest level of coordination possible, since it was not possible to set up a single European security agency."
"That would perhaps have been wonderful, but it was not feasible in practice."
"I am sure, however, that this is just the first step on the way to even greater integration."
"Looking to the future, the goal is in fact to set up joint operational structures at a European level."
"The most important thing at the moment, however, is that Europeans have realised that force alone is not enough to defeat terrorism."
"It takes force and it takes intelligence to understand and resolve its underlying causes."
"Alongside the military force and repression option, we also have to follow the political route with equal determination."
"Both options must be pursued multilaterally, since unilateral approaches are no longer enough."
"First, as the Declaration solemnly states, it means strengthening the bond of mutual trust between Europe and the United States, which is already close and loyal."
"Without this strong alliance there can be no hope of keeping world peace."
"It is, however, just as fundamental to ensure that the United Nations has both a central role to play and the credibility that this requires."
"The UN must be actively involved in any intervention on the ground and in any political projects aiming at restoring stability in crisis regions."
"The European Union, for its part, has the opportunity to make the most of its experience of peace-keeping and dialogue accumulated over almost half a century of its existence."
"Our contribution must be to involve and mobilise the resources of all countries in order to isolate terrorist groups."
"The aim is to drain terrorism of its lifeblood, and that means preventing recruitment and cutting off any technical, logistical and financial support."
"Terrorism also has an ideological component, however aberrant it may be, as well as a political agenda, and so it is necessary to confront the crisis situations that split the world and threaten its stability."
"First – and I am pleased to go along with what the , Mr Ahern, said just now – a solution must be sought to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: this is the topmost priority of all."
"The success of our strategy against international terrorism in fact depends on peace in the Middle East."
"Then we have to work towards achieving a breakthrough in Iraq."
"Both these initiatives – in the Middle East and in Iraq – have to be concluded and carried through under the aegis of the United Nations."
"The objective is, of course, to restore Iraq to the Iraqis in as short a time as possible, whilst ensuring security, independence and the highest levels of democratic involvement."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as I have said, the Spring Council is devoted to the governance of the Union, and the session on the economy has further strengthened this role."
"For some years, however, the European economy has been in difficulty and this threatens one of the pillars of our Union: our economic and social model."
"Four years ago, in Lisbon, the Union decided that in order to maintain and develop our way of life we should put in place a thorough reform of our economic systems."
"The Council’s conclusions reveal that there is very broad convergence in analysing what needs doing, as contained in the report that the Commission submitted to you in January."
"We all agree on benchmarking, coordination and the priorities to encourage growth and competitiveness."
"We have been repeating them for years: we need to invest in research, development and human resources."
"It is not enough, however, to agree on the things that need doing; we also need serious, hard work and the means to implement them, but we do not have either."
"Indeed, I am very sorry to say that we have not yet succeeded in progressing from words to deeds."
"Most of the decisions that have been taken have not yet been transformed into concrete action at Member State level, and there has not been the expected shift of resources into those investments that we all – I repeat, all – consider necessary."
"These uncertainties and the paucity of financial commitment demonstrate the two basic problems with the system of governance of the European economy: on the one hand, the Lisbon process lacks a strong point of authority at Community level, which is the only way to coordinate measures; on the other, we have to reckon with the dynamics of modern political organisations."
"Investment in human resources and knowledge, which we all consider indispensable, does take a very long time to provide a return."
"The trend in politics, however, is increasingly to favour measures that produce a visible return before the end of the electoral term, which is much shorter."
"To be fair, I have to say that some Member States have initiated major, even painful reforms, demonstrating a sense of responsibility, foresight and political courage."
"The Council has reaffirmed the need to stay on this path because everyone has realised that the future of Europe is at stake."
"I hope that the reforms that have been started can, this time, be finished and can be extended to the fields of knowledge, training and research."
"For the time being, it seems that the political will has been found to implement the European Growth Initiative quickly, which includes a raft of quickstart projects in research and development, transport, energy and information technology."
"These are clearly defined measures that have already been approved by the European Council and can all be put into motion quickly."
"Real progress is needed starting this year, and by next year we need to have made up for the delays in transposing the Lisbon directives into national laws."
"I am sorry to have to make these points, but I believe it is only right and proper to do so."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I shall end this speech with some brief thoughts on the European Constitution, the same thoughts with which the started his address."
"We have seen that external and internal challenges are threatening to undermine the pillars supporting the home that we live in together."
"In these difficult times we must set aside our differences and provide the European Union with the means required to build a more solid framework of cooperation, one which will allow us to make joint decisions and to pool our resources."
"Let us not fool ourselves: we can only confront the challenges facing Europe today if we remain united."
"No European country, however big and strong, has the means to do so alone."
"In this respect, the Spring Council has brought us some good news, which I am pleased to be able to end on today, and it also keeps up my reputation of being the eternal optimist."
"All told, I have not been wrong in being an optimist in recent years."
"The stage was set in Brussels for the resumption of negotiations on the constitutional treaty in the near future and for their conclusion before the end of the Irish Presidency, thanks to some extraordinary mediation by the Presidency, to whom I extend my praise and admiration."
"Positive signals had been arriving in recent weeks from various governments, saying that they were ready to compromise."
"Confirmation came during the Council that things were finally moving in the right direction – from a psychological and human point of view as well."
"The toughest problem to solve is still the one that caused the previous deadlock: the thresholds required for qualified majority voting."
"It is not just a matter of percentages, of course, but of something on which the whole future of our integration process depends: the enlarged Union must simply be able to make decisions."
"If the threshold required for a majority decision is too high, the Union will no longer be able to make decisions about fighting terrorism, economic governance or anything else, because a small group of countries will be able to block any proposal."
"That is the point, quite simply, and up to now the discussion has focused on the size of this blocking minority."
"I ask you all to think carefully about the fact that one cannot have an institutional debate while thinking about the ways and means by which Member States can block any decisions."
"The discussion should, instead, centre on the opposite question: what are the best ways and means to make decisions, not to block them?"
"Judging from the latest developments, another failure seems to have been averted; it therefore seems likely that we will soon have our long-awaited and beloved Constitution."
"Nonetheless, I appeal for the final compromise to be a good one that will allow the enlarged Union of the Twenty-Five to operate efficiently."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Brussels Summit had as its focus and main subject the terrible events of March 11, 2004 in Madrid, and it was good that it drew from them the necessary conclusions."
"As one who can still well remember how the US President John F. Kennedy in 1963 said in a divided Berlin: ‘Ich bin ein Berliner’, I think that, as Europeans, we must adopt a similar attitude towards our Spanish partners and friends."
"We must say that this attack in Madrid was not only an attack on Spain, but an attack on Europe as a whole, on the entire Western world, the entire world."
"So it is in sympathy and solidarity with Spain that we must commit ourselves to action and to clear and decisive promotion of the European Union and the unity of Europe."
"This must be our answer to terrorism."
"I would like to thank you at this point very much, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for your leadership, which has made it possible for this signal to be sent out from Brussels."
"Europe is now to act!"
"Europe wants to be united, and Europe wants to find its way to the future together!"
"It is right that the summit has accepted the solidarity clause in the version of the Constitution."
"This is a solidarity clause against terrorism."
"However, Europe must show solidarity in general, when faced with external attacks, and, now more than ever, we know that domestic and foreign policy form an integrated whole and that the one cannot be separated from the other."
"We also welcome the appointment of a coordinator for matters of internal security, and, in Mr Gijs de Vries, a former Member of this House, we have found an excellent candidate for this position."
"I look forward to collaborating with the Coordinator for Internal Security!"
"Let me also say, however, Mr President-in-Office of the Council – and this intervention will certainly not be the last word – that we would have welcomed it if the office of the security coordinator had been established not in the area of foreign policy and intergovernmental collaboration but, as the Commission wanted, in the area of the Community institutions, so that it would also be subject to Parliamentary and legal control."
"I think this is important for the future, and, whilst I would not wish to put a question mark against the creation of this position, it will also be necessary for us not to treat it simply as an alibi in order to be able to say that we have done enough in this area."
"What is now needed is a very specific policy for us to implement in internal security."
"For this reason, I very much regret that the European arrest warrant is not yet in place, and we urge the five Member States who have not yet ratified to do so."
"We must also build up Europol, which would be much more effective if these difficult financial negotiations did not have to be conducted between the Member States of the European Union whenever we want to give it money."
"Why do we not make Europol, too, subject to the Community method, so that it can be financed from the Community budget?"
"That would make everything much easier."
"I also think we should accept the Community method in this area, too."
"I believe that the most important thing, in discussions of internal security and terrorism, is that we should tell the Arab world that we do not identify terrorism with them or with Islam."
"Let me say this now – permit me to say this as a German – I remember the discussions after 1945, when there was talk of the collective guilt of the Germans."
"That was rejected, and rightly, because not everybody was responsible for the crimes of National Socialism."
"In just the same way, we should not today make the mistake of equating terrorism with the Arab and Islamic world as a whole."
"We want cooperation; we want collaboration with the Arab and Islamic world."
"For this reason too, I emphatically agree with the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, who has said – as you also have done, Mr President-in-Office of the Council – that peace in the Middle East with security and dignity for all people in Israel and Palestine is absolutely crucial in terms of peace in the world and peaceful relations between Europe and the Middle East and the Arab world as a whole."
"We must counter contempt for humanity with the dignity of man, asserting our principles of life against their principles of death, and, in place of hatred, our desire for collaboration."
"The message must now be – and I must thank you warmly for it – that we are gaining a Constitution, of which our group is very decidedly in favour, and the entire European People’s Party has declared it to be the topmost priority."
"We would like to say to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that it would be a magnificent achievement if, under your presidency – we would like to see it before the European elections – you were to be able to bring the Constitution to a successful conclusion."
"We wish you every success."
"We support you."
"The right answer to give the world is that Europe is determined and united."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, above all as a person from Madrid and speaking on behalf of my fellow countrymen in this House, please allow me to express my gratitude for the expressions of support, solidarity and condolences received not only from Europe but from the whole world."
"I would like expressly to address President Cox, because his institutional declaration on behalf of Parliament had an enormous impact in Madrid and in Spain and was a match for the dramatic circumstances we are living through."
"We have shown that we are building Europe through the minutes of silence all Europeans held following the tragic events in Madrid."
"If the – who, unfortunately, shares with me and with others a long experience of fighting terrorism – will allow me, I would like, as well as expressing gratitude for these gestures – and this applies to both sides of the Atlantic – to say that we must not confuse stoicism and resistance with cowardice and appeasement; that terrorism must not only be fought with tanks, planes and invasions; it must be fought with dignity, with resistance and also with the necessary coordination of intelligence services and with legislation such as that we have been trying to create in the European Union since 11 September."
"In this regard, I must say to the Council that Parliament worked extremely quickly and that the Council, in this case, has taken a step forward with the appointment of Mr De Vries – and I agree with Mr Poettering’s criticisms with regard to the circumstances of this appointment – but it is notable that, at the moment, five Community countries have yet to transpose the arrest warrant into their national legislation and that we still have problems in terms of the application, specifically, of measures to combat money-laundering."
"This demonstrates that we are not working seriously to combat terrorism and that we have to take very important steps, because we feel solidarity but we are all threatened."
"Having said this, Mr President, please allow me to move on to the second issue, which is the Constitution."
"I believe we should welcome the step forward taken by the Irish Presidency and I believe that the announcement of the candidate to the Presidency of the Spanish Government, Mr Zapatero, has been a significant step forward in terms of unblocking this situation."
"He has stated that the Spanish, the Government of Spain, believe we must be back in Europe and, furthermore, taking the approach which governments of my political colour have always followed."
"In relation to this point I would like to point out, on the one hand, something which is very important: qualified majority and codecision, which are essential issues in terms of European democracy."
"Furthermore, I would like to address the President of the Commission and say that the circumstances in which he finds himself must lead us to reflect on an important issue, which is the role of the Commission."
"Because he has very good Commissioners, President Prodi is at risk of almost always being ‘on the raft of Medusa’ at the end of the term of office."
"We already have at least three or four Commissioners who are returning to their countries – which demonstrates that there is life after the European Union – but this is raising a serious problem: we cannot continue with a situation in which a Commissioner is in office for just ten months."
"That is not sustainable."
"I would also like to draw attention to the fact that the Greek Commissioner, Mr Dimas – and I do not believe this is his responsibility – has spoken in plenary before moving on to the hearing in the relevant committee."
"We must all try to take care to respect the way things are done, that is essential in a democracy."
"With regard to the Constitution, Mr President, I would also like to thank the former Mayor of Rome, Mr Rutelli, for the gesture of solidarity and dignity he has shown in proposing an amendment – which I hope will be approved today in Parliament – which gives this treaty we must approve, the European Constitution, the title of ‘Constitution of Madrid’."
"I believe this is a gesture we can all be proud of and naturally I intend to support it."
"Finally, with regard to the important issue of Cyprus, I would like on behalf of our group to reiterate our unconditional support for the efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to find a solution to the issue of Cyprus and by doing so to help the enlargement process to be successful."
"I believe we must call on both parties to take this historic opportunity and to unify a country which has been divided for 40 years, thereby removing the last remaining wall in Europe."
"Mr President, it has been a while since everybody left a European Council meeting smiling."
"I congratulate the presidency on a focused summit that delivered in many respects."
"This summit suggested that there is another Europe: one that can actually get things done."
"European Liberal Democrats and Reformers welcome the new will to reach agreement on a European Constitution by the June European Council."
"President-in-Office, a combination of events and canny diplomacy have paved the way for agreement."
"In the words of an Irish blessing, 'may the road rise up to meet you'."
"This House badly wants a deal, but our terms have not changed and will not change."
"We expect a treaty based closely on the Convention text."
"We expect the Council to respect the budgetary powers of Parliament and extend democracy in our Union through qualified majority voting and greater codecision."
"We expect the Council to make the difficult compromises needed in good faith and then go back to sell those compromises at home."
"This show will not be over in June."
"Ratification is a mountain still to climb."
"This summit also acted decisively to fix the way we protect ourselves against terrorism in Europe."
"My Group welcomes the appointment of Gijs de Vries as anti-terrorism coordinator and demands that he be given a clear mandate to ensure he can get the job done."
"The next step is to reinforce the resources at Europol and set it to work: no new bureaucracy, no duplication, no more foot-dragging from European intelligence agencies who do not like to play with others."
"If this is not our frontline defence against terror then it is just a cheap gamble with the safety of Europeans."
"Liberal Democrats and Reformers also back a strong commitment to ratifying existing instruments such as the European Arrest Warrant."
"We have proposed an implementation league table that will name and shame states which take lightly the safety of their citizens."
"The weekend's decisive tone has to translate into action."
"Let us be clear about that new decisive tone."
"Let us remember what Europeans – what Madrileños – had to endure."
"This House has been urging a more concerted policy on terrorism since before 11 September 2001."
"Let us recall that when the Commission asked for EUR 15 million for counter-terrorism intelligence last year, the Council offered EUR 1 million."
"Europeans deserve better."
"A counter-terrorism policy conceived in panic is far too likely to invade private lives and erode public freedoms."
"On biometrics, on passenger data transfers – that is what we are in danger of getting."
"My Group wishes to remind the Council that it has once again ignored the explicit demand of this House that it discuss detention without trial at Guantanamo Bay and that it commit to raising that issue with the Americans at the EU-US summit."
"Any European government that reckons on the issue going away has not reckoned on the will of this House."
"My Group welcomes the commitment in Council to speeding up the pace of reform on the Lisbon Agenda."
"We remind the Council that 40% of the single market directives have not been implemented in all Member States."
"We remind the Council that the Growth and Stability Pact must be revived this year so that Europeans can have confidence in the sound management of Europe's economy."
"The tone of public debate in Germany and France suggests that European governments are not properly making the case for reform at home, whatever they may say in Brussels."
"Before this summit I called for a sense of urgency on three areas: terrorism, the IGC and economic reform."
"To paraphrase W. B. Yeats, of our quarrels with others we make rhetoric, of our quarrels among ourselves we make poverty."
"The summit showed a willingness to get back to the business of Europe."
"Let us hope the political will holds and the momentum lasts – for all of our sakes."
"Mr President, the conclusions of this Spring Summit show that government leaders are stubbornly pursuing a policy that is indifferent to the worsening economic and social situation, that turns a blind eye to the high levels of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion and the increase in social inequalities and a deaf ear to the protests of workers threatened by the relocation and restructuring of multinational companies."
"We saw an example of this only yesterday, with the Canadian multinational , which is seeking to close many of its production units in countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Portugal, and which, where my own country is concerned, is the only company engaged in producing rolling stock and train carriages."
"It is clear today that, four years after expectations were raised by the so-called ‘Lisbon Strategy’, which was approved during the Portuguese presidency, the socio-economic situation is considerably worse and not a single one of the social aims has been attained."
"This is demonstrated by the new Commissioner for Social Affairs’ acknowledgement that only 10% of the ‘Lisbon Strategy’ objectives have been achieved."
"This has not stopped the Council from announcing more of the same, however, despite the fact that we are less than two months away from the accession of a further ten countries whose economic and social situation is less than rosy."
"The Council’s recipe for success is still to commit to this ‘competitiveness’, to promoting what it considers to be business culture, to greater job flexibility and insecurity, to lower labour costs and wage moderation and to attacking public services – in other words, to the neo-liberal agenda of economic and financial groups, instead of being concerned with people’s living and working conditions, with sustainable development, with greater economic and social cohesion and with providing fresh impetus for public and social investment, specifically in the railways, in health, in the environment, in education and in research."
"The Council suggests that the priority should be to speed up the pace of reforms in the fields of employment, social security and health, despite growing public opposition to measures that, in some of our countries, are jeopardising fundamental social rights."
"What is being promised is ongoing support for the process of liberalisation and privatisation in many sectors, demonstrating blatant prejudice against the public sector."
"Continued intervention in this sphere cannot be allowed, because this threatens the existence of high-quality public services and employment, which are crucial to combating poverty and to guaranteeing social inclusion and a high standard of living for the entire population."
"Economic and monetary policies must be revised, liberalisations must be halted and the Stability Pact must be reviewed in order to prioritise the social criteria, employment, training, education and research, which are all areas crucial to Europe’s sustainable development."
"What is needed are effective measures to put a brake on the relocation of multinationals and to give European employees’ organisations the right to a ‘suspensive’ veto."
"Working people must be treated with dignity and well-being and social progress must be placed at the heart of Community policy-making."
"– Mr President, it has been said that this was a European Council of newly-discovered cohesion in the wake of the terrible tragedy in Madrid, which has left us in no doubt that today we are all potential victims of indiscriminate terrorism, whereby blasphemous criminals manipulate a great religion to their own bloody ends."
"We hope that there really was cohesion but, after reading the conclusions and listening to the President-in-Office of the Council, and especially after observing the measures taken by the Member States and the proposals made by the Commission regarding asylum and the protection of their citizens’ personal data, I must express our deep concern."
"We call on Mr Prodi and the Council to take note of the resolution that Parliament is to adopt today in this respect."
"It is cast in very different language from yours, gentlemen."
"Europe can and must choose a different path to combat terrorism from that of the United States, with its lies, its arms race, its pre-emptive wars and its Guantanamo Bay."
"We need a path that sets democratic stability, respect for human rights and a rejection of emergency measures as preconditions for action on the international stage and for cooperation in matters of internal security."
"What do we see today instead?"
"We see the pathetic inability of the Member States’ governments to cooperate, hiding data and information from one another, as Mr Javier Solana has pointed out; we see the Commission making startling, untenable proposals about asylum which are clearly in breach of international conventions, and proposing to give away citizens’ personal data to mysterious US administrative bodies; we also see the umpteenth good man, Mr De Vries, placed at the head of a vaguely defined, once again wholly intergovernmental working group, while not a single clear idea emerges for a plan of action based on common, democratically approved rules."
"It is thus quite clear now that we do not really want our police and secret services to cooperate in fighting terrorism, but we do want to set up generalised surveillance systems for passengers and citizens, under the illusion that this means we are monitoring everything."
"How serious we are about the fight against terrorism can also be measured by the European Union’s ability to give itself a constitution, as we have all said here today: a constitution able to keep its promises of effectiveness and democracy."
"The positive spirit of this European Council does not, however, rid us of our concerns, which were strengthened today, Mr Ahern, by your ambiguous message about the Italian Presidency’s well-known or, rather, infamous 82 items, which every so often pop up as a basis for negotiations and are just as often forgotten."
"If that is the case – and please tell me if it is – then the new Constitution will just be a pale and untenable copy of the Treaty of Nice."
"The European Council talked a lot about the economy and growth."
"This flood of words is also found in the conclusions, which list so many fundamentally important issues that one cannot actually see which ones are the real priorities."
"The only thing we are sure of is that the environment is a non-priority, and for us that is a great setback."
"It is not surprising, then, that in this stalemate, and for lack of any real, practical plan of action and any true political leadership, it was decided to do something typical of the socialist tradition – even though most governments today are centre-right – which was to set up another working group, chaired by yet another great man, Mr Wim Kok."
"They never choose a woman, mind you!"
"I think that would actually be a good idea."
"Our objective – I have to point this out – is in fact a shared one."
"We have to take steps to get the European economy out of the vicious circle of low growth and high unemployment."
"Again, however, we express our scepticism at the approach supported by this European Council and also, alas, by the European Parliament in its resolution, which in this respect we cannot support, an approach that makes competitiveness an absolute dogma."
"In comparison with whom should we be competitive?"
"Ask the voters who have just voted in France and Spain; ask them what they think of the systems and conditions of work and welfare in the United States and in developing countries."
"You will realise that the strategy we need is very different, one that is well within reach for the European Union."
"Of course, it would be possible if the decision was made to get out of a stability pact that is now dead but still very much alive in political rhetoric, if the decision was made to make use of potential forms of sustainable growth that we are still ignoring, and if the decision was made to invest in sectors of the future, like research, clean energy, ecotourism and public transport."
"This is what we are asking for; this is the path we are asking you to follow to achieve growth."
"Something other than bridges and motorways!"
"Mr President, I too share the view of the previous speakers that the summit of European Union leaders was a success across a number of fronts."
"Firstly, there is clearly good will among European Union leaders to secure an agreement for a new European Union Treaty, and I would like to commend the efforts of the President of the Council, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, for the very positive role he has played in moving these negotiations forward in recent times."
"The Taoiseach has certainly intensified the series of bilateral negotiations with other European Union governments with regard to the provisions of a new EU Treaty, but, as the Taoiseach said himself in Strasbourg in January, this is a job one cannot do on one's own."
"It requires the good will and the support of many from both the smaller and larger Member States within the European Union."
"The IGC is now moving forward at a strong pace."
"We must now consolidate the good will there is, secure agreement with regard to the bottom-line issues and try very hard to strike a deal before 17 June for the new European Treaty."
"I fully understand and believe that this is not going to be an easy task, but we must not underestimate the challenges that lie before us."
"We must be realistic about one particular situation."
"If an agreement for a new European Treaty is not reached in or around the time of the next European Council meeting of EU leaders, then agreement may be difficult to reach in the medium term."
"This is primarily the case because the dynamics within the European institutions are going to change."
"There will be a new President of the European Commission, perhaps half the Commission will be replaced, and the composition of the European Parliament is going to change by July of this year."
"That could mean two out of every three Members present at this Parliament being replaced."
"I would like to urge the European Union governments to go the extra mile and strike an agreement which will ensure effective operation of the European Union for many years to come."
"As Mr Prodi said here this morning, our European Union must be able to take decisions."
"He said no small group of countries should be able to block decisions, and this is so."
"We need a Treaty which will ensure that the European Union institutions can take decisions in a simplified and effective manner for many years to come."
"We have seen too many treaties from the European Union in the recent past."
"Indeed, they were coming so fast at one stage that they were being discarded before they were implemented."
"We all look forward now to the historic occasion of enlargement on 1 May, but we need to change the manner in which we take our decisions so as to ensure that the European Union as a political and economic entity becomes stronger."
"The scourge of international terrorism must also be tackled head on, and I agree wholeheartedly with the views and comments expressed by the previous speakers."
"I welcome the strong support from EU governments for closer cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs."
"Appointments of key new personnel in Europe to tackle international terrorism in Europe are to be welcomed, but we must remember that democracy is fragile and we must be strong in our efforts to promote the rule of law and protect democratic institutions."
"Al Qaeda represents evil of a barbaric nature and for Al Qaeda human life means absolutely nothing."
"From its perspective, the more people Al Qaeda can kill to weaken democracy in the western world, the better."
"Al Qaeda has bombed America, it has bombed Africa, it has bombed Asia, it has bombed the Middle East and it is now bombing Europe."
"However, I want to reiterate what Mr Poettering and others have said: we must not in any way believe that all Arabs are terrorists."
"That is not so and we should never allow anybody to say so."
"Only by collective resolve can we defeat the evil of terrorism, and I welcome the recent measures taken by European governments in this regard."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European elections will – as you perhaps know – be held between 10 and 13 June, but it is to a perfect travesty of democracy that approximately 300 million voters in twenty five countries will be summoned."
"Indeed, what is really at stake will be carefully hidden from them."
"The Constitution?"
"Move along, there is nothing to see here!"
"We shall reveal it to you after the elections, after several days, to show what kind of contempt we have for universal suffrage, or, rather, what fear it instils in us."
"Oh, yes, this Europe of yours, more democratic, more transparent, closer to its citizens, is off to a good start – with a cover-up."
"The entry of Turkey, which would change the very nature of the European project?"
"Move along, there is nothing to see here."
"We shall inform you of our decision after the elections, and many of those who are preparing to open the doors of membership to this country in October will campaign in June by swearing to God – and you can say that again – that they are opposed to it."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a great responsibility falls to you today: you must move the June Council forward before the European elections – a week would be sufficient – so that the first elections of the enlarged Europe would not be yet another hoax."
"Because if such were the case, on such a scale, do not doubt, Mr President, that the backlash would be equal to the insult to democracy in Europe."
"– Mr President, on the subject of the Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, I believe it is a delusion to take the shortcut of getting the national bureaucracies to cooperate without any democratic or judicial control."
"As with Europol, with Eurojust it is not just a matter of individual rights and freedoms, however serious these issues may be, but also a problem of effectiveness: indeed, you have not succeeded in conferring true powers on this coordinator for the fight against terrorism."
"This is not consistent with someone who wants to see more effective counter-terrorism measures and a faster reaction capability, someone who wants not less democracy – which is the dream of all bureaucracies – but more democracy and more rule of law."
"If creating Mr Counter-Terrorism is to be the paradigm for the new Constitution that we want, any modest increase in powers at the expense of giving up democracy and the rule of law is not the road that we want to go down."
"A final word on Iraq."
"The European Union is calling for the UN, but it is calling for it to cover up its own inability."
"The terrorists have a political agenda, a political goal, which is the withdrawal of Europe – or what is left of Europe – from Iraq."
"We would have preferred it if the European Union had had the strength to choose, to propose and to decide to do the opposite of what the terrorists want."
"Mr President, the terrorist attack in Madrid was an attack on all of us who believe in democracy."
"I welcome the resolution from the spring summit to appoint a counter-terrorism coordinator."
"All our Member States must cooperate fully to minimise the risks for all our citizens."
"My Group leader, Mr Poettering, is right: we must not equate the Arab world with terrorism."
"We must do all in our power to work with the many leaders and spokespersons in the Arab world who feel as strongly as we do in the West about these atrocities."
"The key, of course, is resolution to the intractable problem of the Middle East."
"We must never forget that terrorism is rooted in poverty and social exclusion and, as we discuss the economic governance of the EU at the spring summit, we must realise that our economic growth depends on peace and stability which, in turn, depend on our efforts to ensure economic stability and growth in those parts of the world where poverty and social exclusion are the norm for millions of young men and women."
"Countering terrorism is in large measure countering poverty."
"As far as the Lisbon agenda is concerned, I say to our Taoiseach that we have failed yet again to deliver progress on our much-quoted ambition for the EU to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010."
"Your words, President-in-Office, about fruitful discussions, re-focusing on key issues, sustainable growth in employment etc. etc. etc., could be those of any President-in-Office over the last four years: they have all said exactly the same."
"I am afraid there has been no progress on practical transposition in our Member States."
"You have only to look at the fact that 400 000 EU-educated researchers are working in the United States today."
"We educate them, we give them knowledge, and then they leave."
"The benefit of that knowledge is developed elsewhere in the world."
"President-in-Office, why did an Irish presidency choose to initiate diplomatic relations with the military dictatorship in Burma?"
"Why now?"
"We have avoided it for very good reasons for many years."
"Please answer me, but do not tell me that as President-in-Office you had no option but to negotiate on behalf of the EU."
"I object strongly, as I am sure do many Irish people and colleagues here, to Ireland initiating diplomatic relations with a military dictatorship that controls the Burmese against the will of its people."
"Finally, may I echo the words that my colleague Mr Watson used and say 'may the road rise up to meet you' – '."
"To all those involved in the Irish presidency, may you achieve the signing of the Constitutional Treaty in June."
"You have all our good wishes."
"Thank you for the progress on consultation you have made to date."
"Thank you, as Enda Kenny said recently in the Dáil, to the Permanent Representation and all the civil servants behind the scenes who made this technically a very good presidency."
"– Mr President, , every man and woman here will welcome the fact that you have been able to resurrect the issue of the Constitution."
"Although it is not a breakthrough, what you have achieved is a really major step forward."
"You can rely on our support for every further step in the Constitution-making process."
"There are three matters that still particularly concern us: the first is the qualified majority."
"We are glad that the principle of the double majority seems to have been accepted."
"However, in the design of this double majority, the crucial objective is not strengthening the blockade minority, not making it easier to hold the European Union back, but strengthening its capacity for decision-making."
"Please do not accept shoddy compromises in this area."
"The second matter is the qualified majority in internal and legal policy."
"In view of the need to be able to act against the threat of international terrorism, , it cannot be the objective again to expand unanimity, but the task must be to introduce majority decisions in the area of internal and legal policy also."
"This is necessary also – but not only – to make the struggle against terrorism more effective."
"Thirdly, you will be aware of our reservations, our worries and our demands where the European Parliament’s budget rules are concerned;"
"I would like to remind you of them, since the result of the Convention, the Convention draft, is itself a compromise, and one that has not found great favour with this House."
"However, I say to you now that a Constitution tending to reduce the intrinsic right of any Parliament, namely the right to set the budget, cannot be acceptable to us in the European Parliament."
"Finally, a particular comment, , on the Irish presidency: for what you must do in the next three months, there is no better symbol that the Irish harp."
"This is because all the peoples of Europe are like the strings of a harp; each country with its own tone, but all needing to be plucked if a tune is to be played. , seize the strings, get your fellow Heads of Government to vibrate and sing!"
"Finish up in June with the tune which all Europeans are expecting, Beethoven's Ode to Joy: ‘’!"
"Shamrock diplomacy from an unexpected quarter!"
"Mr President, it is of course a great tragedy that it should take acts of terrorism of the kind seen in Madrid for Europe’s leaders to pull themselves together."
"Despite the fact that terrorism has reared its ugly head in several Member States on previous occasions, we have perhaps naively believed for a long time that these major attacks could never happen to us."
"We are now realising that the fight must take place at global level, but also by means of intensified European cooperation."
"Therefore, it is good that many important steps were taken at the summit at the weekend, even though they are insufficient."
"We must create much better preconditions for the coordination of intelligence services and also, in time, create a kind of European FBI that is also operational."
"Where miscreants and criminals operate across borders, so must the long arm of the law."
"The most important work in the fight against terrorism, however, is the work on peace and development, and there is much that the EU can do in this regard."
"A cohesive foreign policy is an important means to this end."
"It is very important, therefore, that the Convention’s proposals in this field be adopted."
"I should like to thank the Presidency for the work it is doing in this field."
"Mr President, it is with emotion that we receive and share the solidarity with the victims of the terrorist attacks of 11 March expressed by the Council, the Commission and particularly by you, Mr President Pat Cox."
"Furthermore, we support the proposal to dedicate that day to the memory of the victims of terrorism each year."
"We believe that the measures on police and judicial coordination and information, as well as the creation of a person responsible for combating terrorism at European level, are positive elements in the fight against terrorism, but we must not fall victim to the controlling and suspicious hysteria which the United States has demonstrated through the Patriot Act, with measures which violate human rights and the foundations of democracy and freedom."
"In fact, together with creating terror, that is one of the objectives of terrorists: to undermine democracy."
"In this regard, we do not agree with the proposals for police control which involve biometric and similar data."
"We believe that the response of Spain and Europe, which is so different from that of the United States following 11 September, is the right one."
"Instead of turning to aggression, military reaction and reducing freedoms or invading countries, we have placed the emphasis on police investigations in order to bring these criminals to justice."
"Europe’s international role can and must be aimed at achieving a fairer and more cooperative world, without poverty or inequality, which deprives the attackers of democracy and freedom, who must always be condemned, of any justification."
"Amongst these measures, with a completely different approach to that of the United States, are those which involve putting an end to the illegal and unjust occupation of Iraq and the recognition of the State of Palestine, in order to put an end to another equally murderous illegal occupation; that of Palestine by Israeli troops."
"We must hold a world conference against terrorism under the auspices of the UN, where the different measures can be explained: cooperation amongst police forces; structural problems: poverty, debt, inequality; the role of the financial institutions and also of the different commercial bodies; combating tax havens and money-laundering."
"These measures have also been mentioned by Mrs Doyle."
"Finally, with regard to the possible and desirable modification and completion of the European Constitution – which has been opened up following the appointment of Mr Zapatero as candidate for the Presidency of the Spanish Government, together with other movements in Europe – we believe it is important to take this opportunity, together with the necessary reform of the decision-making process, to achieve more democracy and solidarity in the European Constitution, with scrutiny by Parliament and by popular sovereignty with changes to the Stability Pact, which will lead to progress throughout Europe."
"Mr President, on 11 March, all we Members of the European Parliament came to this House horrified by the news of the terrorist massacre in Madrid at 7.30 in the morning."
"Please allow me, firstly, to express my condolences and solidarity with the victims and their families, and also to reject all forms of terrorism."
"That morning I had felt particular anguish, added to so much blood and so much anguish, at the realisation that the attack could have been the work of the ultra-radical Basque fanatics of ETA."
"At midmorning, I heard a Belgian television station point out the possibility that it may have been carried out by Islamic terrorists."
"At midday, when an oral amendment was presented to the House declaring 11 March the European day against terrorism, the Member presenting that amendment blamed ETA."
"By then there had already been the early call to the police by the witness who saw three hooded men in Alcalá de Henares and the van containing detonators and verses from the Koran had been found."
"And there had also been statements denying the attack and the involvement of ETA from the spokesman of Batasuna."
"It was already known that the attack had not been by ETA and, despite that, pressure was applied and the involvement of ETA was artificially maintained in the Resolution of the European Parliament and in that of the United Nations Security Council."
"For all of these reasons, I believe that the Spanish Government of Mr Aznar’s Popular Party was trying to evade its responsibility for having participated in the invasion of Iraq, against the wishes of the Spanish citizens, of the United Nations and international law, and once again took the opportunity to blame ETA and nationalists for the problems which authoritarianism and intolerance such as theirs has created in Europe and in the world."
"Neither did the discovery of a rucksack with detonators and a mobile phone used by Islamists do anything for their argument; nor the repeated communications claiming that the Al Qaeda organisation was responsible for the attacks."
"The Popular Party continued to blame ETA, by means of personal calls by Mr Aznar to the main daily newspapers and by the Foreign Minister to Ambassadors, and also by means of the ineffable public appearances by Minister Acebes."
"To make matters worse, millions of European citizens and governments of other States were shamelessly deceived by the Popular Party Government, who did not care a jot about the risk of further attacks and deaths in other cities, provided that the Spanish people did not know until after the elections of Sunday 14 that the horrors suffered in Madrid were a response to the unjust and illegal war in Iraq."
"Fortunately, the Spanish citizens were able to demand the truth and get rid of the government which tried to deceive them."
"And let us hope that we can convince ourselves soon that the best recipe for combating terrorism is to put an end to injustice and poverty, of which there is so much around the world, and in that way we will be able to live in peace."
"– Mr President, 25 countries have now agreed to prepare an EU Constitution by 17 June."
"Compromises have already been negotiated behind the scenes, and a double majority, with population as a decisive element, has been approved as a principle."
"What are now being negotiated are the percentages for the number of countries and the number of citizens."
"There are also negotiations concerning a smaller Commission from 2014, so that not all countries will any longer have a member of the Commission."
"What cannot be agreed upon now can be decided later by qualified majority."
"We propose instead that all countries retain one Commissioner, and that the Commissioner be elected by, and be answerable to, the national parliaments in order to uphold the democratic principle."
"We also propose that 75% of the countries, at the same time representing 50% of the population, shall be required as a qualified majority."
"We also want to see the EU slimmed down, with most of the 100 000 pages of EU legislation scrapped and the Member States legislating on all matters that do not have a cross-border dimension."
"Instead, the EU should focus on what the countries themselves are unable effectively to legislate on."
"In cases where we are ourselves unable to act, we have no democracy to lose, but we can instead gain joint influence where we should otherwise be powerless."
"The minority's proposals from the EU Convention may be laughed at in this House."
"My experience from all the group visits and meetings is that the minority's fifteen points correspond much better to the attitude of the majority of voters."
"Anyone who is in doubt about this can look at the regional elections in France, where the great leader and Sun King from the EU Convention will soon be the former chairman of a council."
"Adieu, Giscard d'Estaing."
"See you at the referendums on the EU Constitution."
"Finally, I should like to congratulate Bertie Ahern on the appointment of our old colleague Mr Gijs de Vries as Counter-terrorism Coordinator."
"He has always fought for openness and citizens’ rights."
"He is someone in whom I have confidence, in contrast to the head of OLAF, who steals computers and telephone and address books to reveal journalists’ sources."
"Mr President, given the short time that has been allocated to me, I should like to confine myself to one aspect, and that is the problem that many people in Europe have with defining the problem of terrorism."
"Terrorism is not simply a problem in isolation; it should, for the most part, be seen in the context of Islamic extremism."
"This can be seen worldwide and I need not give recent examples of it."
"We need to learn to accept this and take it into account when determining counter-terrorism strategies."
"We should therefore put a stop, in the first instance, to growing Islamic extremism within the EU."
"In Belgium, for example, the state security service complains that it lacks the necessary means to monitor Muslim fundamentalism."
"Recently, the Belgian Government appointed eight well-known fundamentalists to the Muslim executive, of which they will make up half."
"Meanwhile, in some mosques, as everywhere else in Europe, jihad is being proclaimed."
"Today of all days sees the presentation to this House of the report on anti-Semitism by EUMC, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia."
"This is the cleaned-up version, because in the original version, it was pointed out that anti-Semitism occurs mainly among Islamic immigrants and that is why we have now started censoring our own reports."
"As long as we remain wedged in this politically correct autism, we will be unable to develop an efficient strategy against the terrorism that is threatening us."
"Mr President, on behalf of the MEPs of the PPE-DE Group, I would like to express my gratitude for the countless expressions of solidarity, and thank you personally for your support and company during these times of anguish."
"We are constantly thinking, naturally, of the victims and their families."
"Therefore, together with other colleagues, we in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are taking the initiative of recommending to the European Union that it establish a day in memory of the victims."
"Plenary decided that it should be 11 March and I am glad that this proposal has been ratified by the Council almost unanimously."
"Mr Ortuondo did not support it and he will know and explain why."
"The European institutions’ support for the victims must not just be moral, however, but also material."
"In order to cover these needs, my group requested the inclusion, for the first time in the 2004 budget, of a line of EUR 1 million for the creation of a pilot programme to support the victims of terrorism and their families."
"Unfortunately, circumstances demonstrate that more must be done and, without prejudice to the measures to assist victims, which the Council has approved, I would like to express our desire for the financial contribution for the pilot project to help victims to be significantly increased, raising the status of that project to a wide-ranging Community action."
"That, Mr President, is the commitment of the PPE-DE Group which has been included amongst the political priorities for the next legislature and which provides for the creation of a European fund for compensating the victims of terrorism."
"Ladies and gentlemen, following 11 September an action plan to combat terrorism was approved but, nevertheless, on 11 March 2004, some of the measures laid down in it had not been transposed into national legislations."
"I repeat the request made by several colleagues, because it is essential that the Member States cooperate by quickly incorporating the measures adopted within the framework of the third pillar."
"It is vitally important to improve security in the prevention sector in Europe."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to point out, on the basis of my country's experience, that it is not easy to defeat terrorism. It requires persistence and tenacity, but it is an inescapable challenge facing all Europeans if we want to continue to live in free and democratic societies."
"Nobody is free of this threat and it would be a tragedy if some people tried to evade it by looking the other way."
"We will overcome it if we face it together, with democratic conviction and with the force of the Rule of Law."
"Mr President, following 11 September this Parliament worked quickly and very seriously supporting the Commission and calling on the Council for a series of measures to confront terrorism."
"The Union's institutions worked efficiently to achieve a common definition of the crime of terrorism and to achieve and implement the European arrest warrant."
"In this and other Community institutions great statements were made in favour of better police cooperation, a strengthening of the task force of police chiefs, an operative Europol under effective judicial control; furthermore, efforts were made to achieve the establishment of minimum judicial guarantees and, finally, to create a framework providing us with greater security and speed in situations such as the one which had arisen in the United States."
"Furthermore, this happened during the debate on the new Constitution, which was creating a framework providing significant opportunities to improve the legal area for police and judicial cooperation and to subject it to the essential parliamentary control."
"But the moment passed and the measures proposed only moved forward by inertia, at a pace, Mr President, which has not yet taken us anywhere."
"We have had to experience the recent horror in order to return to this issue in formal session, on a Wednesday morning."
"Mr President, on 11 March we all had a sad role to play."
"If there is one thing the citizens expected from us it was cooperation in order to offer certainty, and what we displayed, for various reasons, and with differing degrees of responsibility, was complete confusion."
"The European Commission is right to say that we do not need new ideas."
"We only need to implement those which are on the table, which are already boring and hackneyed."
"Even so we have succumbed to the temptation for a new one and we have created a ‘Mr Terrorism’, and I do not know what he will do unless we improve the global framework of mutual trust."
"Europe can and must act differently."
"We do not need a European Patriot Act."
"We can and must offer more security on the basis of mutual trust and close cooperation while strictly respecting the freedoms and rights that terrorism aims to destroy."
"I hope that the next time we talk about this we are not still drying our tears, but that we have a firm will to face up to today’s world."
"A world in which Europe, working to promote internal cooperation, can also offer a path and a guide in order – within the framework of the United Nations and multilateral action – to deal with the significant dangers we are facing."
"Mr President, the Taoiseach says that he believes that the principle of the dual-majority system is now accepted."
"But it seems to me that it is not yet accepted in practice because one sees the various ministers trying to supplement the dual-majority formula with further qualifying clauses which would permit a specified number of Member States to form a blocking minority."
"My strong advice to the presidency would be to reject such superfluous complications."
"It would be far better to achieve a simple formula, say 55/55, which dispenses with the need for a third key."
"Europe cannot be built upon mathematical equations, but on political trust."
"– Mr President, the criminal attacks in Madrid clearly show that Europe has become the direct target area of international terrorism."
"This puts the European Union in a new position."
"The political world must take account of this, in both the short- and the long-term."
"Unfortunately, the Heads of State or Government are confining themselves exclusively to the short-term, to exaggerated activism, which at the end of the day produces only an illusion of security rather than the real thing, and we also run the risk of ending up in an Orwellian Big Brother state in which the basic rights of citizens are increasingly sacrificed."
"It is not simply that – as we are also currently experiencing in Germany – each day ‘a new security policy idea is run through the roost’."
"Benjamin Franklin, the father of the American Constitution, was right to say that a person who is prepared to surrender his freedom to win security will lose both."
"It is not possible to prevent terrorist attacks by military means, that is to say, by war."
"My main criticism of the resolutions of the European Council relates above all to its failure to understand the basic truth that combating terrorism is one of the European Union’s strategic tasks."
"This is because terrorism and criminality can only successfully be combated if political action is taken to address their causes in the breeding-grounds of the prophets of hatred and violence."
"Poverty, exploitation, despair and loss of rights and contempt for religious feelings and cultural traditions are what prompt terrorism and violence."
"So I say that the best prevention and the best protection against terror, violence and war is a just international order."
"Europe must therefore develop a convincing policy, one that seeks a peaceful and just balance of interests between the rich north and the southern hemisphere and puts an end to the plundering of the so-called ‘third world’."
"The immediate tasks include the withdrawal of the USA and its allies from Iraq, the peaceful resolution of the Middle Eastern conflict, and also an embargo on European arms exports."
"Such are the long-term strategic tasks that the European Union must set itself in the struggle against terrorism."
"Mr President, the European Summit in Brussels last week gave a mandate to the Irish presidency to complete the negotiations for the Constitutional Treaty by the next summit on 17 June."
"To move from a Union of 15 Member States – soon to be 25 – to a single state with legal entity, whose laws will have primacy over the laws of those Member States, is a development which my party – the UK Independence Party – believes should not be concluded without the express will of the population by a referendum."
"Our politicians in Westminster voted yesterday to deny the British electorate that right."
"That decision will certainly lead to public discontent."
"We shall continue to put pressure on our government to concede a referendum."
"Opinion polls show that the British people, if given the chance, would reject this Constitution."
"It is my party's unambiguous view that Britain would be better off out of the EU, and the first step towards that position would be to deny Mr Blair a mandate to sign the Constitution."
"If he does sign up to it, let us be clear: it will mean the end of our right to self-government."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the summit was – as has been frequently stated today – held under the shadow of the attacks in Madrid."
"It is a positive signal that an antiterrorism coordinator has been appointed and the solidarity clause from the draft Constitution has been brought forward."
"These are signs of the necessary European collaboration, which can be entered on the credit side of the account."
"However – hand on heart – the knowledge that police and security services must cooperate and that the results of investigations must be exchanged across borders is not new."
"Since the attacks of September 11 there has been a lot of talking but not much action."
"Europe moves slowly, as Robert Schuman once said."
"How true!"
"The Lisbon strategy of 2000 has the ambitious objective of making the EU the strongest economic area in the world."
"We are still waiting for the results."
"In Laeken, the starting gun was fired for a Constitution, but Poland and Spain, and also France and Germany, have not played a distinguished role at the Brussels Summit."
"Is the end of the blockade in sight?"
"Hopes for this are not unjustified."
"The Irish presidency has so far done good work."
"Nevertheless, I am realistic and I see that many chapters in the draft Constitution are still controversial: the question of how many Commissioners there should be for each country, the principle of rotation, the weighting of the votes."
"There is no questioning the fact, though, that the enlarged Community must be able to take action – at least in terms of lip-service."
"I hope that actions will follow!"
"Mr President, I want to associate my party and our 37 members here in the European Parliament with the words of the Council communiqué expressing sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the terrorist attacks in Madrid, with their families and with the Spanish people."
"On Lisbon, I welcome many of the points in the Council statement: the need for substantial structural reform, the completion of the internal market, better regulation and sharing of best practice."
"However, current European economies remain so restrictive and inflexible that progress will be hard to achieve."
"There remains, I must say, a deafening silence on our own inability to reduce the tide of regulation, which gravely damages our competitiveness and destroys jobs."
"Good intentions, sadly, are no substitute for practical measures."
"On the Constitution, Mr Watson and Mr Duff's party leader in the UK has joined my party in calling for a UK referendum on a Constitution."
"On Monday in the House of Commons he argued that a Constitution was needed in order to define and make clear the limits of EU power."
"The question, he said, is: does this Constitution have constitutional implications?"
"The answer he gave was an unequivocal 'yes'."
"You have argued, Taoiseach, that Member State governments must show flexibility and compromise on all sides – I noted your words."
"However, in that very same debate Mr Blair said that the issues of tax, social security, the UK abatement, foreign policy, defence, and criminal justice are all parts of our nationhood, and we will be insisting upon them."
"Therefore there are two further questions."
"Firstly, on asylum and immigration in that debate, Mr Blair assured the people of Britain that it was absolute rubbish to suggest that the EU would have any role in determining any policy decisions or laws in this area."
"Secondly, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, he assured the British people that the European Court of Justice would have no jurisdiction whatsoever to enforce this Charter or the rights that were expressed within it."
"I think it is a rather different legal situation and would be grateful for your view."
"It is hardly surprising, when our Prime Minister denies that a Constitution for the EU has any constitutional implications, that people find it rather difficult to trust him."
"That is why my party says that we should trust the people and have a referendum."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the Irish presidency, the Taoiseach, Minister Roche and Minister Cowen for the progress they have made on the European Constitution."
"It is rare that I have an occasion to welcome the work of this government, but when it is earned I am willing to do so.(2)"
"Having congratulated the Irish presidency, I should also like to extend my congratulations to the commitment and professionalism of the Irish civil service and the diplomatic corps, without whose support it would not have been possible to make progress."
"An enormous step forward has been taken, but we still must reach a conclusion on the text."
"As one of the 200 parliamentarians from every corner of Europe who prepared this text in open forum, may I say that what we have is a qualitatively different treaty proposal from any treaty that has ever been put before the people of Europe."
"It is therefore important that any further negotiations or any intent to change difficult compromises are made in as open a forum as possible."
"I believe that it will not be acceptable to this Parliament, or to the people of Europe, for deals to be done, behind closed doors, which seriously damage the coherence, the values, the objectives and the capacity to act that the current text provides."
"It is important, if we are going to have ratification by all 25 states, that the process in which the presidency is now engaged seeks to ensure that the people are also involved in that process."
"With regard to the issue of terrorism, it has been correctly emphasised here that intelligence is the key to defeating terrorism."
"I would suggest that we need to take the notion of 'intelligence' in its broadest sense."
"The collection of information is important to prevent awful atrocities, such as those we have seen in Madrid."
"However, the use of our intelligence is also necessary to undermine the sense of alienation and injustice felt by many of those who are recruited to commit these kinds of awful acts."
"It is not enough for us to simply seek to improve our capacity to arrest, detain, charge and imprison, important as that is; we must guard against those actions that undermine the very rights that we seek to defend."
"We have to ensure that we also improve our intellectual capacity to analyse and understand exactly what is driving this new form of terrorism."
"It is not the same form of terrorism we have experienced in France, Ireland, Spain and elsewhere, by ETA and other terrorist organisations."
"We need to look seriously and seek to engage with those sections of the communities of Europe that are alienated to the point of murder and terror."
"Mr President, the intention has always been for the spring European Council each year to be devoted to economic and social affairs, growth and development."
"There was very little of that this year."
"I admit that there were subjects to discuss that were important in themselves, but I wish to object to the almost total disregard for economic and social development."
"The Lisbon process is not at all functioning as intended, and the problems are great."
"Unemployment is high, investment is not what it could be, and so on and so forth."
"Vigorous policy efforts in the Member States would of course be required, as it is there that economic policy must be given tangible form."
"Instead, the only guidelines originating from Europe that carry real weight are found in the Stability and Growth Pact, which does the opposite and puts them in a straitjacket."
"I fully share Mr Prodi’s view that the Stability and Growth Pact is idiotic."
"It is high time that we did something about it and made economic development in Europe rather more dynamic."
"Nor is the social aspect of the Lisbon process functioning as it should."
"Everyone is talking about lifelong learning, but in reality the Member States are investing nothing at all in education; on the contrary, they are making cutbacks."
"Something should really be done, and the electorate is reacting."
"In both Germany and France, we are seeing how the electorate is protesting against an economic and social policy that is now being left to its own devices."
"–Mr President, we all were deeply affected by the attack in Madrid, and I am very pleased that the European Council of last 25 March responded to it by anticipating the solidarity clause."
"Indeed, this principle of solidarity, above and beyond any procedures that can be discussed, must have unanimous support from us."
"In addition, the Council has set 17 June as the deadline for the end of the negotiations on the draft of the European Constitution."
"This decision is less simple than it seems, because compromises on some essential points have still not yet been reached."
"Its intention, it seems, is above all to exert pressure on the recalcitrant countries."
"This decision also seems to have very little respect for universal suffrage."
"Indeed, whether the agreement will be announced after the European elections or whether it is achieved a fortnight before does not change much."
"In any case, the result is that there will be no time to organise a concrete debate."
"Once again, Mr President, this method speaks volumes about the sort of Europe that this Constitution heralds."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, regarding the conclusions of the European Council, I would like to take the liberty of emphasising three points."
"What we expect in response to terrorism, and after the tragedy at Madrid, is determination and effectiveness."
"Whilst we are satisfied that a coordinator for the fight against terrorism has been appointed, it is still necessary that he should be able to be effective."
"I wonder, therefore, about the powers he will have."
"We are demanding more efficiency for Europol and Eurojust, just as we can only regret that certain countries have not yet given their opinion on the European arrest warrant."
"Mr President-in-Office, this will have to be settled if things are to change, because, in Madrid, it was not Spain that was attacked, but all of Europe."
"These events lead us to ask the question: what do we want to make of Europe?"
"A simple market, a free trade zone, or a genuine, united political Europe?"
"Europe is a boat that is moving forward, it is not being built on fear, but on ambition and will."
"The time for hesitation is past."
"We need more Europe, we need a constitution as soon as possible, because Europe must propose a contract of trust to the Europeans."
"Finally, our political action must be coherent, effective, and sustainable."
"Priority must be given to economic and social issues; we need to re-establish economic prosperity in order to resolve the social question."
"Our immediate objective should be economic prosperity, on which employment depends, and which is the sole source of social progress."
"It cannot be invented or decreed; achieving it depends on the space left to the creators of wealth."
"The thread running through all our policies should be a refusal to discourage the spirit of enterprise, which means that it is necessary to tackle even more resolutely the brakes that are preventing this change of outlook."
"Returning to economic prosperity by an increased freedom of enterprise is a desirable priority, but it cannot be continued if it is not accompanied by a new social contract based on clear partnerships and a modern trade unionism, more interested in reform than in entrenching its own status or defending vested interests."
"In view of the confusion of some of our fellow citizens, the action of reform can be understood only if it appears to be benefiting the greatest number and putting an end to injustice. This is how we will get our fellow citizens involved in the European project."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is moving forward with its responses and, after the drama in Madrid, after the one in New York, we have made, and are continuing to make progress in the fight against terrorism."
"After New York we had a long and difficult negotiation on the European arrest warrant."
"We had consolidated the advances concerning Europol and Eurojust."
"Behind the scenes, though, implementation is so slow and so heartbreaking for our fellow countrymen that it is necessary to find other means to force the hands of the Heads of State or Government."
"Indeed, having given their agreement to the Council, they then forget to implement the subject of the agreement in their own countries."
"Take the European warrant; it is not right that so many States have not yet ratified this essential tool as we wanted them to do after New York."
"Today, after Madrid, Mr de Vries, a former Member of this House, has been appointed coordinator."
"Everyone is delighted, because everyone knows his determination in these matters, everyone knows his determination to work to establish a European prosecutor."
"If, though, he has neither the necessary resources or a clear mandate, we shall be left powerless."
"It was under the pressure of events that a coordinator was appointed, even though, in fact, there is an underlying idea, an intuition, one that inspired many of us within the Convention itself: the idea that, with regard to matters where the Heads of State or Government are entitled to their say and must be able to cooperate actively with the tools of a European vision, tools that are in the hands of a Commission, better coordination between various European authorities is needed."
"What we have done for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, we understand that, in a way, we shall have to do in the field of justice, security, and freedom."
"In fact, this coordinator is a foretaste of what must one day, doubtless, be implemented."
"Today, though, he has no relation, no link with the Commission."
"I believe that it is necessary to reflect on this if we want to be effective in coordinating the resources of the fight against terrorism."
"In this spirit, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have in your hands the future of the European Constitution, because you now have a defined mandate with a somewhat difficult schedule, one that is certainly welcome in so far as it provides Greater Europe, which will be finally reunited on 1 May, with a Constitution in the short term, but that is, all the same, somewhat problematic in view of the elections to the European Parliament."
"Put simply, what I want to do is to draw your attention to the elements that this House regards as essential."
"There is, as others before me have said, the question of Parliament's budgetary powers."
"Beyond this, though, I see a risk of backing down with regard to what was enacted in the Convention: I want to speak about the prospect of a European prosecutor, I want to speak about qualified majority voting where it was possible to get it, in the fiscal and social area, even though this is not enough."
"I see a risk of backing down in the field of increased cooperation and linking clauses."
"I see a risk that the revision of the Constitution may not be dealt with."
"This would be very serious."
"Finally, Mr President, you have a very serious problem where the composition of the Commission is concerned."
"I know the tendency: it is to give one commissioner per Member State."
"I again want to draw your attention, however, to a proposal that is on the table, that of not specifying the number of commissioners in the Constitution, and leaving to the President of the Commission, with the European Council, the freedom to define the balance of the composition of the Commission, by simply imposing a limit of one commissioner per Member State at the most."
"Perhaps, for a certain time, this will lead to a Commission of 25 that will have to get organised, but at least we would leave ..."
"– Mr President, Europe has woken up to the subject of terrorism, although it still leaves a bitter taste in the mouth to realise that this only happened after the massacre by Al Qaeda butchers of workers, children and ordinary people in Madrid."
"What is surprising, however, is that in this morning’s speeches and also in the 18 pages of the Declaration on Solidarity against Terrorism there was no explicit reference to it."
"I had to wait until the speech by Mr Claeys, a Flemish Member, to hear anyone spell out the danger posed by Islam, fundamentalism and the terrorism arising from it."
"I shall confine myself to making two points, the first of which is a moral imperative."
"If we want to be able to face the memory of the victims of this terrorism, we must address the problem of European Union aid to the Palestinian Authority and the destination of that aid, so that it does not end up funding terrorists, suicide bombers or even those purportedly social activities like training camps, which are actually schools for fundamentalism and extremism."
"We must also address the activities that go on in European mosques: in recent days, not just in Rome but throughout Europe, hundreds if not thousands of mosques have been holding prayers for Sheikh Yassin, the theorist and instigator of suicide bombings and terrorist murders."
"Mr President, it is clear that the conclusions of the Spring Summit have been affected by the terrorist attack in Madrid, which has not just had political consequences, but also obvious economic consequences in view of the uncertainty, instability and insecurity that all terrorism brings, as the citizens of Madrid are well aware, having suffered this terrible attack, and as the Spanish citizens of the Basque country are also aware, since for more than 20 years there has been a nationalist government which throughout this whole period has not been able to guarantee either the security or the most fundamental rights of the citizens and whose President, incidentally, was the first political leader in Spain to blame the attack on the terrorist group ETA."
"I would like to say, Mr President, with regard to the constitutional issue, that I do not agree with the opinion expressed this morning in the House that the change of government in Spain has led to the new climate created."
"This new climate has actually been created as a result of the attitude of the Member States – including the most reluctant – in view of the new circumstances and I would like to stress that Spain has always been prepared to negotiate to make its conditions more flexible."
"Europe wants and needs a constitution, but it must be a constitution in which all European citizens are recognised."
"It is important to point out, Mr President, that, not only in view of the phenomenon of terrorism, but also of the crisis with the Stability Pact, the appreciation of the Euro and the challenges and opportunities raised by enlargement, the climate in the European Union at the moment is not at its most optimistic."
"The media has stressed that Europe has lost one point in competitiveness over the last ten years in comparison with the United States and that today the prosperity of the average European Union citizen is 30% lower than the prosperity of the average United States citizen."
"What elements do we need in order to recover the path of sustained growth and increased employment?"
"Mr President, apart from the structural reforms required by the Lisbon strategy, the most important thing, the qualitative leap which Europe must make, is to relaunch the European project, not as a mere monetary union, not as a mere single market, but the real political project, and, to this end, we are counting on the Presidency of the Council and, in particular, the Presidency of the European Commission."
"– Mr President, in one respect this Spring Summit has given us renewed hope."
"We can say: ‘Ropes away, full steam ahead with the good ship !’"
"I very much hope that it will be possible to find a satisfactory solution to the critical points that have already been mentioned by others here today."
"The fact is that we need this European Constitution in order to make it clear that Europe is not only a market, that we are not just an economic and currency union, and that not only do we have a single currency, but we also want to speak with one voice as a Community of values and rights."
"We must also speak with one voice in another area, in which the diversity of voices is much too great."
"The Lisbon strategy is not yet lost."
"We are still interested in sustainable growth, full employment and social cohesion."
"However we are far from the objectives which we have set ourselves: the economic spring has not yet arrived, we have mass unemployment with more than 14 million people unemployed, and more than 55 million people are living on the edge of poverty, and, if we consider investments, we must really speak of an ‘investment moratorium’ in Europe."
"Internal demand has not been stimulated either; certainly it is not just because of the feeling of uncertainty as a result of globalisation, or the uncertainty as to how Europe will advance, but also because of the fears of terrorist attacks, that European consumers’ willingness to buy leaves much to be desired."
"We also lack the necessary stimulus actually to achieve production growth, which we can implement only through a higher purchasing rate, that is to say, through a reduction of unemployment, in the European Union."
"The European Union needs a new dynamism."
"Even if it were to be the case that tomorrow the European Central Bank, in view of the low inflation rates and the low growth of money supply, were to use its scope for manoeuvre and reduce interest rates, even that would not be sufficient."
"Further political measures are required."
"This does not mean speeches at summits, or agreements reached at them."
"It means implementation measures in the Member States."
"We will lose success and credibility if nothing is done about this!"
"Mr President, Europe needs more projects like the Airbus, which has shown that public-private partnerships, different countries, different employees, different companies can work together."
"Why cannot Europe organise other successful projects with these values, which would really create hope, which would really create specific jobs, which would quite specifically promote the European lead in specific technologies of the future?"
"For this, the investment drive, the Quickstart programme, is certainly a step in the right direction, but it is not sufficient; it is simply too little."
"We must continue to strive for reforms; we must dismantle barriers to trade and in particular services, but we must also concentrate on investment, and the Pact must not be an obstacle to this."
"The continued lack of a Community patent is also a deterrent factor for leaders in research and development."
"Although the Heads of State or Government have now seriously promised that it will come, it still cannot come this year!"
"Only visible and specific results will convince the citizens of Europe of the advantages and added value of Europe."
"Europe is once again at the crossroads."
"Either we increase the rate of purchasing, muster optimism and dynamism and banish unemployment, or the credibility of the European unification process is in jeopardy."
"Mr President, may I, too, congratulate the Irish presidency on the way it has handled the IGC negotiations. The Taoiseach referred just now to the importance of give and take in these negotiations."
"I return to the issue of give and take in relation to one specific point – the budgetary powers of the European Parliament."
"The text of the Convention involved a bit of give and take."
"We, as a Parliament, have given up our right jointly to decide by interinstitutional agreement with the Council on the financial perspectives and simply, instead, give our assent to those perspectives."
"In exchange, we have taken the right to have the final say within those ceilings and within a margin of manoeuvre on every item of expenditure – what was previously obligatory and non-obligatory."
"That is a balanced, fair package with give and take."
"Some finance ministers are arguing only for take on their side and no give."
"They would reduce Parliament to giving just an opinion on the financial perspectives and they would also place limits on the other aspects of our budgetary powers."
"That, frankly, is not acceptable to the European Parliament."
"It would be one of red lines – we, too, can have red lines."
"I turn to what 'Harry Pottering' said on behalf of the PPE-DE Group."
"He said that his Group is altogether in favour of the Constitution."
"I am delighted to hear that in his Group, the British Conservatives are in favour of the Constitution, because that is not what some of them said in a debate of the House of Commons yesterday, nor what Jonathan Evans said in a debate with me on BBC television last Friday."
"They are going to oppose the Constitution, indeed, they even announced in the House of Commons that they will use every parliamentary device they can to thwart it."
"They are also stirring up scare stories about the Constitution."
"They are alleging that it creates a centralised superstate with all powers handed over to Brussels, where Brussels will be able to overrule national policy in every area of governance."
"We, in this House, know that is not true."
"They are telling fibs and trying to stir up the Eurosceptism that is latent in much of the British press and in parts of public opinion to their electoral advantage."
"We cannot let them get away with this."
"We must have a debate based on the facts and not the myths."
"I hope that 'Harry Pottering' will sort out his Group – wave his magic wand, perhaps – and ask those Members who apparently want to belong to his very federalist group in the European Parliament to draw the consequences of that."
"Under our Rules of Procedure, you join a political group on the basis of political affinity."
"I wonder what affinity there is between the British Conservatives and the bulk of the PPE on this fundamental question."
"There seems to be none, and I invite the PPE-DE to have a vigorous internal debate on this matter."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I do not wish to begin my speech without expressing my gratitude, in my capacity as a Spaniard and as chairman of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for the European Council’s support for this Parliament's proposal that 11 March should be the European day for commemorating the victims of terrorism."
"Recent events, as well as causing us dismay and anguish, have made us aware – as we in my country have unfortunately been for a long time – that the civilised world is at risk, in danger, from a new enemy whose limits cannot be defined: terrorism."
"And combating this enemy, which has many tentacles and which kills in a merciless and brutal manner, does not involve a normal war, it is not a traditional war, but it is – and there is not the least doubt of this – an unequal and criminal war against societies built upon principles such as freedom and democracy."
"The European Union must unite in its efforts and urgently implement all the legal, financial and human instruments needed to combat terrorism."
"For all these reasons, I believe this Parliament is obliged to send the European Council a message of support for the measures it adopted on 25 March, contained in its Statement against Terrorism, but also, with the legitimacy we have as representatives of the European citizens, to tell it that we cannot accept the lack of political will on the part of the Member States to implement these measures for a minute longer, as is currently the case – and I would stress just a couple of the most obvious examples, such as the European arrest warrant or the framework decision on terrorism."
"And it is even less acceptable that, for purely budgetary or procedural reasons, the most effective instruments in the fight against terrorism, such as the Anti-Terrorist Unit, created within Europol as a result of the 11 September attacks, should be dismantled."
"Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, reality demonstrates that the European Union is often faced with significant difficulties when it comes to adopting decisions, and with 25 Member States I fear that this will mean that many decisions will be deadlocked."
"So why do we not – following the example of the last European Council, which used the solidarity clause, laid down in the still draft constitutional treaty – anticipate the implementation of the system for adopting decisions by qualified majority, already included in the text of our future constitution?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe – and I will end here – that this would make our work to combat what has shown itself to be the greatest danger currently facing the stability of democratic societies based on the rule of law much easier."
"Our citizens deserve no less, ladies and gentlemen."
"– Mr President, thank you very much for your consideration; great things are currently going on in my group, and so we had to be there."
"I would like to extend very warm thanks to the Irish presidency of the Council."
"In these days, we are witnessing history being made, and it is the Irish presidency that is making it."
"Through its shrewd and prudent conduct of the negotiations, whereby it is nevertheless boldly pursuing its objective, it has been able to put the Constitution back on the table."
"I would like to thank them warmly for this."
"I believe that we can still see a few places in which substantial negotiation will still be necessary. The Taoiseach, as the President-in-Office of the Council, has also made this clear with his points – first six of them and then a further 22."
"I would like once again – like many speakers – to make it clear that the budget right, and the associated Financial Perspective, is the prerogative of any parliament."
"I hope that this will be remembered in the negotiations."
"We have also sought this Constitution in order that an enlarged EU should have the capacity for action."
"We have succeeded in getting double majority accepted in principle; now, though, we must also have figures for the double majority, so that it enables greater decision-taking power."
"Thirdly, I believe, precisely in the case of majority voting in the Council, that it must be ensured that we insist on majority voting in particular in the areas in which our citizens are particularly threatened because of terrorist actions, namely justice and internal policy."
"Just to mention here three important areas in this context."
"I would also like to point out, however, that we, in this Parliament, should make joint efforts with the Commission to support the Irish presidency."
"If it were to be confirmed that Mr Barnier has become the French Foreign Minister – which I regard as good news – I would be glad if, because of its importance, his position in the Intergovernmental Conference were to be reallocated to President Prodi himself in the next few months, in order thereby to underline the fact that the Commission, too, is right behind the process."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, the atrocities in Madrid have moved the fight against crime and terrorism to the top of the European agenda."
"Europe needs to join forces on a scale hitherto unseen."
"European leaders should have realised much earlier, before the attack in Madrid and preferably even before the Treaty of Amsterdam, that one of their most important political responsibilities is to guarantee external and internal security for the Union."
"Bringing about measures that are sufficiently effective and multi-faceted requires respect for fundamental rights, and also democratic transparency and monitoring."
"Otherwise, there is a risk that the measures that directly affect citizens will be too weak and enjoy insufficient support."
"This particularly applies to intelligence."
"European leaders should have given the EU better real powers to hit out at terrorism and cross-border crime long before we were forced to adopt panic measures."
"Years of inactivity are reflected in the programme with which the Irish Presidency is now exemplarily presenting us, but the issues merit a long-term approach."
"The harsh reality is that European leaders should have shown European political leadership much sooner."
"An official in charge of counter-terrorism is certainly needed, but the Commission must be the central player."
"The most natural thing would be to build on the competence we already have in the Commission, and supplement this with a Commissioner who fills the gap that the escalated fight against terrorism threatens to create in citizens’ basic protection, particularly the protection of their privacy."
"A package solution to the crisis is not sufficient to fight terror."
"Instead, long-term measures on a Community footing are required."
"Mr President, the fight against international terrorism is the EU's greatest challenge."
"In my London constituency yesterday British police arrested eight British citizens of Pakistani descent with half a tonne of bomb-making material."
"We need much stronger measures to combat this scourge, and my party, the British Conservatives, will even accept the appointment of a counter-terrorist coordinator if this can be shown to improve security."
"I also fully support cooperation between law-enforcement, judicial and intelligence services and agencies, not just within the EU, but globally with allies such as the USA, and with other powers such as Russia and China which have their own domestic Islamist problems in Chechnya and with Uighur minority and terrorists who are connected to Al Qaeda."
"British Conservatives reject the European arrest warrant and do not accept that this problem has anything to do with Third World poverty, as many terrorists come from wealthy middle-class educated backgrounds."
"Indeed, the poorest areas of the world like Africa have themselves been victims of foreign terrorism, as we saw in the embassy bombings in Kenya."
"We need strict enforcement of legislation on combating money laundering and on the freezing of terrorist assets, and the ratifying of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters concerning the monitoring of bank accounts."
"Europol's anti-terrorist unit needs beefing up, but we do not need a European public prosecutor, and the UK is wise to stay out of Schengen and control its own borders."
"The European public fully accepts that security comes first and that their cherished freedoms, including privacy, will be curtailed in this fight."
"Lastly, I call for more condemnation by Muslim leaders of terrorism and the rejection of extremism within their communities."
"I was particularly disturbed to read that 13% of British Muslims support suicide bombers."
"I therefore welcome the statement yesterday by the British Muslim Council which has called upon all the leaders within their mosques to reject terrorism and to cooperate fully with the UK police and authorities in identifying those behind these recent attempts at violence."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the wake of the European Council meeting we can at last feel satisfied."
"Ireland can be given credit for having made headway with many difficult issues."
"At last it seems that the Intergovernmental Conference might reach agreement on the new Constitution."
"The Convention’s proposal is a good basis for a constitutional agreement, as it is a balanced one that takes the interests of Europe as a whole into account."
"There has been a lot of water under the bridge since the Lisbon Agenda was agreed."
"Unfortunately, however, the currents have not brought the Union any closer to that celebrated goal which, in terms of its ambition and considering developments in the last few years, is almost as unrealistic as Brezhnev’s five-year plans."
"On the contrary, any little faith there was in the EU’s ability to carry out adequate structural reforms has got watered down in the flood."
"What then are the structural reforms that are spoken about so much?"
"Free movement of the labour force must be guaranteed."
"Transition periods for the new Member States are a mistake that should be corrected as soon as possible."
"The EU budget should not be cut in the next budget period: the focus must be on work to support competitiveness and growth."
"The implementation of internal market legislation in the Member States must be stepped up."
"We also have to be wary of too much detailed, stringent regulation."
"It is often the case that we regulate too much and do not implement enough."
"Such laws as those pertaining to chemicals can often prove annoying from the point of view of improved competitiveness."
"According to the Finnish Ministry of Trade and Industry, the proposal would lead to almost a 2% reduction in GNP in Finland and other EU countries over the period 2007-2017."
"Is this reasonable?"
"The cowardly terrorist attacks in Madrid deeply affected not just the Spanish nation but all of us in Europe."
"Regrettably, the terrorists achieved their objective."
"This should not be allowed to happen again."
"There are still problems in the fight against terrorism."
"Did we not say after the appalling attacks of 11 September that we would increase the exchange of intelligence between Member States?"
"There is a big gap between what politicians say and real action."
"We have to take heed of this."
"It is nevertheless necessary in the fight against terrorism to ensure that the basic rights of our citizens and civil freedoms are not needlessly restricted."
"Law-abiding citizens have no cause to fear in Europe."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only did the attack in Madrid kill many people, but it also undermined the sovereignty of a European state."
"The fact is that, twist it how you will, the terrorists obviously succeeded in influencing the sovereign decision of the Spanish electorate."
"Not least as a result, terrorists have intervened in Europe."
"I wonder whether Europeans have recognised the nature of this threat appropriately and are prepared to meet it."
"The reaction so far has been relatively weak."
"We have resurrected programmes that we have had ever since September 11, 2001, yet which have been only inadequately implemented."
"Recourse has been had to visionary ideas, such as setting up a European Secret Service, which could perhaps be considered in the distant future, but certainly does not address the real threat."
"Calls have been made for someone to be appointed to deal with this – pretty much the standard response to a European problem – and someone actually has been;"
"Mr de Vries is a highly-esteemed man and a former Member of this House."
"What is important is not that he has been chosen, but rather the question of what powers he is to have."
"To this question, few answers have been given."
"The need of the moment would appear to be prevention, for which purpose the data available in Europe, for example on terrorists, should be gathered together."
"Although the national services possess a great deal of information, there is little willingness to share it at the European level."
"If Europe collaborates more closely and reliably in this area than it has so far done, it will now have an opportunity to defend itself against the terrorists in the long term and with impressive impact."
". I should like to thank all Members for their constructive remarks."
"Many points have been made in this debate and the Irish presidency has carefully taken note of them, including a number of common themes that have arisen."
"At the outset Mr Poettering, Mr Barón Crespo, Mr Watson and many others raised the issue of terrorism and the threat that we face."
"We are all committed to combating terrorism in accordance with the fundamental principles on which the Union is founded."
"I can assure everyone that our efforts on counter-terrorism will be undertaken with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"That of course is something that we must fully adhere to."
"Our immediate priority is to ensure the security of European Union citizens."
"However, we also need to address the wider factors that contribute to terrorism."
"That is not to justify terrorism; rather, it is an essential step in its elimination."
"Many people have made the point here in recent weeks that we need to work to try to understand the root causes of terrorism."
"An Irish colleague, Mr De Rossa, made the point that this is different to a lot of the terrorism that we have seen in recent decades."
"It is very clear in the European Council that while we do not in any way seek to justify any of the acts, we have to try to understand them to see how we can cope with it – not by talking to people who are engaged in it, because they will not listen to anybody, but we have to understand and study the root causes."
"I agree fully with the view expressed by Mr Poettering and Mrs Doyle that there can be no question of casting collective blame on any group of people or nations for the scourge of terrorism."
"We must not stigmatise the Arab world."
"I want to register my absolute agreement on this point."
"I am determined that we will work in close partnership with the leadership of the Arab world."
"As I reported, that is precisely what the presidency is doing."
"In the fight against terrorism it would be totally wrong and unacceptable for there to be any suggestion whatsoever that the Arab community in general is implicated or bears any kind of collective responsibility."
"The declaration on combating terrorism underlines that we are at one in the European Union in assessing the gravity of the threat that terrorism poses."
"We are also at one in our determination to face down that threat."
"We will report on progress at the June Council meeting on the implementation of these measures, including a revised European Union plan of action to combat terrorism."
"I look forward to working closely with the Commission, the European Parliament, the Council secretariat and the newly appointed counter-terrorism coordinator, Mr de Vries, in taking this work forward."
"We are working with a real sense of urgency."
"Many people have stressed the need to follow up on the declaration and the other work at the European Council."
"Yesterday, at the Justice and Home Affairs Council, we invited Mr de Vries to engage in what turned out to be a very useful, concrete discussion about how we take that work forward."
"The Council also acted decisively to meet the first deadline set in the declaration – that is for the draft directive on compensation to victims that has been bogged down for some time in arguments about the legal basis."
"The European Council set a deadline for 1 May and the presidency invested a particular effort to ensure that yesterday's JHA Council would reach a political agreement."
"I mention that in order to emphasise the determination to translate the declaration into concrete delivery."
"We made a start yesterday and will do everything in our power to keep progress on track throughout the remainder of our presidency."
"I also emphasised last week that all of us in the Council have to make sure that the measures that we have agreed since 11 September must be put through as soon as possible."
"We have given deadlines in the declaration."
"Most of that has to be concluded this year, either in June or in December."
"Mr President, I am very grateful to you and all Members for your continued strong support for concluding the IGC, as expressed by Mr Poettering, Mr Barón Crespo, Mr Watson and many others."
"It has been instrumental in creating a political atmosphere in which people were prepared to commit themselves to reaching an agreement by June."
"As my colleague Mr Collins said, it will be more difficult to reach agreement if we do not move ahead now."
"There is no political or administrative point in waiting for the year to drag on; it will only become more complicated."
"Like you, I would prefer the earliest possible agreement, ideally before the elections."
"That is what I asked for last week."
"However, as I said at the beginning of my contribution, a range of factors might make this hard to achieve, and we will have to wait and see what progress has been made."
"There have been many changes in the European Council in recent weeks, and the position of a number of governments – not only the Spanish – is changing, which creates some difficulties."
"Thus, we will do our utmost to move that on and make as much progress as possible."
"I want to see as many issues as possible resolved quickly."
"One way or the other we should be able to clear a lot of the issues prior to the European elections."
"So, even if the last few are not there, people can see them."
"I do not see any great difficulty about that."
"I take the point made by Mr De Rossa and others that we have to make that as open as possible, and I intend to do that."
"When we make changes, I shall try to explain them as we go along, as I have been doing over the last number of months."
"Obviously, double majority was a big issue – to bring everyone around to that as a basis in our efforts to make progress."
"However, the fact of having made that decision opens up flexibilities in other areas."
"I mentioned a few this morning."
"I think we will be able to move that debate on and not have to wait until the end of the debate."
"Mrs Frassoni raised the question of how many issues remain to be resolved in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The figure of 82 was mentioned this morning."
"Thankfully it is not 82, but there were about 22 issues at one stage."
"In my address I identified some of the key issues: obviously, the Commission; voting in the Council; and the seats in the European Parliament – particularly for the smaller Member States and also for the new Member States."
"In addition, a balanced outcome must also be struck on the extent of QMV under the new Constitution – I noted what a number of Members said about that."
"There is a range of further issues, many of which were the subject of proposals at the Naples Summit of the Italian presidency."
"They were never agreed because they were not discussed at the December Council."
"The basis for those proposals is there, but, as in all these things, there are nuances to people's positions, and over the last three months I have been trying to reach agreement on those."
"I do not think they are deal-breakers, and it will be possible to conclude them after some discussion."
"We have explored options on all these issues in our consultations with partners to date."
"They are aware of my view and of the areas in which we can achieve compromise."
"As always, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, but I would hope that we are moving towards agreement on many of these points."
"As a result, we believe that it should be possible to reach a satisfactory outcome on all those issues and then we will come down to the few difficult ones."
"There are still difficult questions to resolve, so doing the deal will require further flexibility and compromise."
"However, if we keep the big picture in mind – a Constitution that will help the Union connect better and do more – it is my firm view that we can succeed."
"I agree in particular with Mr Watson that not only must we agree on a Constitution, but we must also be ready to sell it to our parliaments and peoples."
"I hope that this will be the end of the ongoing debate for a while, because, as has been correctly said, constantly moving from one debate to another – Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice, etc. – creates many problems and difficulties."
"On the Lisbon Agenda, Mr Barón Crespo, Mr Watson and others called for renewal of the momentum behind the Lisbon Agenda."
"As I said earlier, the European Council agreed a message of confidence and determination, showing that Europe has the will and the capacity to advance the Lisbon Agenda."
"We need to concentrate on translating our objectives into realities."
"A few speakers drew attention to the continuing problems of delivering on the Lisbon Agenda."
"I could not agree more."
"It is a point that I underlined most strongly in addressing my colleagues at the European Council."
"It is a point that was addressed first in our European Council conclusions."
"President Prodi and I made this point at our press conferences last week."
"I made it when I met the social partners."
"However, as we all know, delivering on the Lisbon Agenda depends, for the most part, on national actions."
"At the summit we tried to sharpen the focus rather than go on endlessly about hundreds of conclusions and benchmarks left, right and centre."
"We tried to focus it further and to increase peer pressure to promote the exchange of best practice."
"In addition, we took the new collective steps I described in my opening statement."
"However, there is no magic bullet to deliver Lisbon."
"We need focus, resolve and determination, and detailed work must continue on an ongoing basis."
"I genuinely believe that we left the spring European Council with our individual and collective resolves strengthened."
"That has been useful."
"Your role will be critical and crucial here in supporting the process of implementing the essential reforms."
"I hope that we – the Council, Parliament, and the Commission – can work constructively together to ensure that we finalise as many Lisbon-related dossiers as possible before the end of your term."
"I appreciate and thank you for what you have already done."
"The challenges ahead may be significant, but the potential benefits for our people in Europe are also considerable."
"I agree with those who stressed the need for Lisbon to be reflected in real improvements in the daily lives of our citizens."
"Mr Barón Crespo mentioned Cyprus and, of course, today is the day when it is hoped that the Kofi Annan negotiations will conclude."
"It is going to be difficult, but they are endeavouring to meet the deadline of today."
"They have worked extremely hard over the last ten days or more, and will continue to do so."
"The European Council obviously discussed this at a crucial time in the search for the settlement to the Cyprus problem with United Nations negotiations."
"I have kept in touch with all the parties over the past months."
"Over the last year I have had several meetings with Mr Erdogan, President Papadopoulos and the United Nations staff involved in this issue."
"At the European Council we reiterated our strong preference for the accession of a united Cyprus next month."
"We have offered our full support to the efforts of Secretary-General Annan to help the parties seize the historic opportunity to bring about a comprehensive settlement."
"We urged all parties to maintain a full commitment to a successful outcome."
"In line with the understanding reached with the parties in New York last month, Secretary-General Annan has expressed his determination to conclude these negotiations in Switzerland tonight; so I wish the negotiators well."
"Kofi Annan hopes that the parties will sign a final version of the settlement plan and that the guarantor powers will endorse it tonight, so that it can be presented as an agreed document to the people of Cyprus for approval in April."
"It is clear from this morning's debate that we all share that hope."
"A number of Members raised the budget issue."
"The points were well made."
"Points were made about the existing compromise."
"We will emphasise those points in the debate."
"In replying to Mr Hänsch and others, I would say that I am fully conscious that the procedures for agreement on the Union's budget are a particularly sensitive matter for Parliament."
"I will take that fully into account."
"As presidency, we will attach particular importance to ensuring a balanced outcome which all, including Parliament, can accept."
"I will pass on the remarks which were particularly directed to the Ecofin Council to its President, my colleague Mr McCreevy."
"In response to Mrs Doyle's important point about Burma, the decision to establish diplomatic relations with Burma/Myanmar was taken in the context of our presidency of the Union and the need for Ireland as EU presidency to deal directly with the Burmese authorities, which otherwise, we would not have been able to do."
"Before establishing relations – the need for which we understood – we consulted Aung San Suu Kyi and she expressly concurred in our decision because she understood the need for us to do the job and that we would actually do it."
"So we did check that and she concurred with it."
"As presidency of the European Union we have both an opportunity and a responsibility to speak to the Burmese authorities on behalf of the European Union."
"Of course, we could have done nothing."
"But our goals continue to be the return of democracy to Burma, an end to human rights violations and the realisation of peace and prosperity for the long-suffering people of Burma, which we all want."
"It is our belief that the appointment of an ambassador to Burma expands the platforms from which we can promote these goals of the European Union and the international community."
"With the exception of Luxembourg, all Member States maintain diplomatic relations with Burma."
"In conclusion, thank you to everyone who has spoken for the points made."
"I also thank the leaders of the groups for their cooperation and ongoing contacts with the presidency and with the Members of the IGC group, to whom I have had an opportunity to talk on numerous occasions, as recently as earlier this week in Dublin, where they were attending the Foreign Affairs Chairmen's Group."
"I am deeply conscious of the consistent support of Parliament across a range of issues on our agenda."
"I look forward to your continued support in the coming months."
"I will of course be addressing the new Parliament on the other side of the June European Council, but I assure you that there will be some mechanism whereby we can continue to keep abreast of all the issues in the intervening period."
"I will do everything in my power to maintain that connection and keep you and your colleagues abreast of the ongoing details as they unfold during April and May."
". – I shall be very brief because I identify completely with the replies given by Mr Ahern and the energetic policies developed on all the subjects covered by the European Council."
"I should just like to make an observation on what Mr Barón Crespo said in his speech."
"He expressed a keen concern for the way certain members of the Commission have left to take up important government positions."
"I cannot deny that this may cause some problems, and I cannot deny that it requires quick decisions to ensure the effectiveness and continuity of the delicate job of the Commission in these last months of its term."
"The first, truest and strongest reaction for me is one of great satisfaction."
"The fact that national governments are time and again headhunting Commissioners to get through times of crisis or to prepare for re-election is clear, official recognition of the great political role that this institution has played throughout this term of office."
"I have always maintained that the Commission is a political body, and I have always consistently asked Commissioners to assume their own political responsibility for what they say and do."
"If you see how former Commissioner, Anna Diamantopoulou has taken on the main role in the Greek political campaign, how Mr Solbes Mira is very likely to be responsible for managing the Spanish economy, and how Mr Barnier will probably be given foreign policy in France, you will understand the role that the Commission has played over the last five years."
"When the first change happened, Commissioner Dimas was quickly and efficiently brought in and he has already started his excellent work. I shall be just as quick so as not to interrupt the Commission’s work for a moment and will take full responsibility for making these interim periods as short as possible."
"It will be the same with the other two cases ahead of us and any others that occur in future, since there probably will be other cases; there will be other Commissioners standing in the European elections, something that I consider a highly positive sign."
"I just hope that this will prove to be a two-way process, and in the end there will be Members of this Parliament who can join the next Commission."
"These are in fact the rules of democracy, the ways in which Parliament and the Commission reinforce each other."
"This speech is certainly very general, but it is a serious and truly necessary one, and those speeches about a bureaucratic, technocratic body are talking about the past: the facts have shown what the real situation is."
"As for my Commission, it will continue to operate with collegiality, efficiency and continuity, and I shall vouch for this continuity until the end of our mandate, that is, until the night of 31 October to 1 November."
"Could you also let our friend Mr Poettering know, Mrs Doyle? I am sure he will be very pleased."
"Mr President, I am speaking as a result of personal comments during this debate relating to my abstention on 11 March when an oral amendment was presented proposing that 11 March be named European Day against terrorism."
"I must clarify that I am not against an international day against terrorism, nor a European day against terrorism."
"If I had been against, I would have voted against;"
"I abstained, because in the justification of that statement a false and manipulative element was introduced, which deceived European opinion with regard to the identity of the perpetrators of those tragic and horrific attacks."
"It was also stated that the Basque Government has not been able to beat terrorism in twenty years."
"I must point out that Mr Aznar, the Popular Party Government, promised to put an end to terrorism within five years; eight years have passed and now, rather than one form of terrorism, we have two."
"We must begin to understand that it is not possible to beat terrorism through police and judicial measures alone."
"The key is that we must put an end to injustice and poverty."
"The key is to respect the identity, culture and religion of other people and to have equitable international legislation, that we respect everybody and not just when it suits certain interests."
"Mr President, Mr Ortuondo has not referred to me personally, but he has referred to certain things I have said during the debate, and I believe I have the right, in accordance with Rule 122, to respond to these comments in which he has quoted verbatim some of the things I have said."
"I do not normally go on the attack in these debates, because I believe that dirty washing should be laundered at home."
"But the truth is the truth – whether it is expressed by Agamemnon or his swineherd – and Mr Ortuondo, before launching into assertions and giving advice to others, should take a look at his own house, because, whether he likes it or not, the only politician responsible – and when I use the word responsible in this context I have serious doubts about a person who brings together an anti-constitutional project which is intended to destroy the unity of Spain – has been the President of the autonomous government, from his own party."
"I therefore reaffirm everything I have said and I do not withdraw a single word."
"Mr Ortuondo Larrea, I am sorry but cannot allow any further responses."
"You will have to settle this elsewhere."
"You have each had a chance to use Rule 122 once."
"You will not get the opportunity to use it twice."
"I thank everyone for their contributions to the debate: the Taoiseach, President Prodi and all our colleagues."
"I have received six motions for resolutions(3) tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at12 noon."
". Where the Italian Presidency failed to lay down the European Constitution, the Irish appear to be succeeding."
"We now have, unexpectedly, a unique opportunity of involving all Europeans in this process."
"We must give the voters clarity before they cast their votes between 10 and 13 May."
"The Council will therefore need to issue the text ahead of time in May, which is quite feasible."
"How decisive, however, is the Council?"
"How strong, for example, is the will to actually get an effective grip on terrorism?"
"Although the new terrorism coordinator, Mr de Vries, is undoubtedly the right man for the job, he has an impossible task if national security services decline to cooperate."
"We also wanted definite decisions from the Council about giving the European economy a shot in the arm by stimulating innovation, making the labour market more flexible and abolishing unnecessary rules."
"We received another clear decision: a committee is being set up."
"When will the Council at last take responsibility?"
"I doubt as yet whether the report by the Kok committee for economic growth can make a difference."
"In the final analysis, it is the countries themselves that have to carry out structural reforms."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to welcome Oleg Viktorovich Morozov, the leader of the delegation from the Russian Federation State Duma to the European Union-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee and Vice-President of the Duma, and Alexandr Nikolaevich Belousov and Gennady Alexandrovich Gorbunov, members of the Federation Council, who are all in the official gallery."
"The delegation is in Strasbourg for a number of meetings with our delegation to the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee."
"I offer them our greetings and appreciation for being here."
"– Since Parliament is today being visited by a high-level delegation from the Russian Federation Duma, I should like – and not just on my own behalf, I believe – to express our indignation and outrage at the Russian Government’s policy in Chechnya."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I ask for a moment of your attention for a point of order."
"Mr President, I am speaking because I would like to put a request to you, as the acting President, one I submitted last Monday to the President of this House and would now like to repeat."
"It is as follows: a Member of this House has made extensive allegations against his fellow-Members, relating to various matters, which this person alleges to be directed at other Members."
"I am personally affected by this, as are also many other Members from my country."
"These are allegations that I think should be examined."
"I make this request for myself personally, Mr President, but also on behalf of all 34 other German Social Democrat MEPs, and I am aware that Members of the other groups – the Greens, the PDS and the CDU/CSU – will also certainly have something to say about this."
"Accordingly, for my own part and on behalf of all my other colleagues, I ask that each individual accusation that has been made should be examined by the competent bodies of this House, especially the legal service and the college of quaestors, in close collaboration with the Court of Auditors and OLAF – every single one of these allegations!"
"At the same time, Mr President, I request that the results of the examination of the objections should be made available before the end of the period of session of this Parliament – that is, by May – to the House and therefore the public."
"It is not acceptable, Mr President, for anyone to come and make allegations, so that an entire institution then has to justify itself."
"I request that, by due process involving the legal service, the quaestors, the Court of Auditors and OLAF, each of the allegations made should be examined and the results published."
"I ask this for myself and for all the other Members concerned."
"– Mr Schulz, this is a subject on which I believe the House has given its appraisal."
"To a great extent we agree with your position."
"The President is aware of it, since he spoke to you about it at the beginning of this session, and so I am sure steps will be taken in this direction."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to draw your attention to the matters described by Mr Schulz and to endorse his request for the allegations to be examined immediately and the public and ourselves to be informed."
"Between 50 and 60 German MEPs have been maliciously accused of having wrongly drawn their daily allowance, allegations that I emphatically reject!"
"The daily allowance is not remuneration for participation in the sessions."
"In addition to participating in the sessions, we all have innumerable other tasks to perform, which are not entered in any session schedule, and in order to be present for such works in Brussels or in Strasbourg daily allowances are needed to meet expenses."
"Accordingly, we cannot accept being defamed in this way."
"I once again emphatically reject the allegations."
"A Member of this House is exploiting his parliamentary rights in order to spy on colleagues in the most unworthy and disgusting way."
"For this reason also, Mr President, I demand that these events be investigated immediately and that – as I have said – the public and we ourselves should be informed."
"– Mr President, for three weeks, this House has been haunted by the anonymous allegation that Members have been forging signatures in the attendance lists."
"Since yesterday evening, the ‘rumour mill’ in this House has been saying that the administration has completed its investigations with the assistance of graphologists and concluded that there are no forgeries."
"I think that it is unacceptable that today, Wednesday, these investigations having been concluded, this information is not being publicly announced here in the plenary session and to the press."
"What I expect of the President of this House – not you yourself, but rather the President in his capacity as such – is that the results of these investigations should be publicly made known before today is out."
"– Mr President, I would like to endorse the comments made by the previous speakers."
"What is currently going on is a campaign against the European Parliament as such, one that I believe we must repudiate."
"It follows that we must clarify matters completely as soon as possible, because I am afraid that it will have as its consequence very low turnout at the next elections."
"If we want to regain public confidence, we need an explanation."
"We urge all the institutions to play their part to wrap up this matter as quickly as possible and finally to put an end to this campaign."
"Mr President, I am speaking to ask the Presidency to communicate with the honourable Member Mr Hans-Peter Martin and ask him to submit to the same procedure that Mr Schulz and other German colleagues have agreed to submit to with regard to the accusations made against them, particularly in the Austrian press."
"– Mr Barón Crespo, all these requests will be scrupulously passed on to Pat Cox."
"– Mr President, I would like to unreservedly endorse what was said by the previous speakers."
"Yesterday, in this House, we held a press conference in which all the political groups took part."
"We wrote a joint open letter to a specific newspaper in Germany and set out our view of the allegations."
"Only if each specific allegation is specifically refuted will we all jointly be able to restore the popular and public confidence in this House; what is at stake is the standing of every single one of its Members, the standing and integrity of the European Parliament itself."
"I therefore ask that each allegation should indeed be examined specifically, as Mr Schulz has proposed."
"– Mr President, as a representative of the European Parliament, I have the honour of participating in a government conference."
"As the chairman of the Committee for Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I have been holding frequent discussions – in the Council, in the Commission and in the embassies, with representatives of other countries, some of which are candidates for accession."
"May I ask for your support and protection, to ensure that Mr Martin cannot portray this activity in the exercise of my mandate as a disadvantage to the public?"
"Mr President, on a point of order further to those that have already been raised, I would also like to ask the Presidency of Parliament to consider exactly what the rules are – and how they are enforced – as to the use of cameras filming Members going about their duties."
"In every legislative body or Council with which I have been associated, there are firm rules about what can be done and what cannot be done."
"The evidence we have shows that a lot of things have been going on that should not have happened, and they ought to be stopped."
"Can we have the assurance that will happen?"
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I shall bring all the observations that have been made to the attention of Pat Cox."
"I personally agree with a great many of them, and I am sure a clarification will be given."
". – Mr President, please allow me, on behalf of the committee, to comment on a report which we have now unanimously accepted, because this has to do with an extension to the Lamfalussy procedure."
"What this means is that the legislative rights of the European Parliament will not be reduced without a provision in the European Constitution, so far only in Article 35 of the draft."
"What is at issue is that, if we delegate legislation to expert committees and the executive, we should at all times retain the right of review, so that, in the context of institutional balance, we are treated in exactly the same way as the Council."
"This has led to major problems on the issue of legislation on securities, but we have seen that this House has been able to remain in control of the legislative process, retain sovereignty of definition and draw a clear line between technical and political problems, so that the European Parliament, elected by the people, and therefore sovereign, has in fact also remained a co-legislator."
"What is now at issue is its extension to the banking and insurance sector."
"Here, the institutions, the legislative participants of the European Council and the Commission with their right of proposal, have given us an assurance that they will respect the rights of the European Parliament as a participant in the legislative process, and they are now also both issuing a declaration to that effect, so that no privileged treatment of the other legislator arises."
"We are prepared to adopt this procedure because legislation is becoming more and more complex, as will also be apparent in the area of telecommunications, but we cannot delegate sovereignty of definition and the political determination of legislation to experts or to the executive."
"Having received these guarantees from the Commission and the Council we will now proceed to vote on my report, which permits the expansion, but which at the same time makes it clear that the Parliament remains the legislator in the codecision process."
"That was not established with this degree of clarity prior to the Convention draft, but now we have here an agreement between the institutions, and I see this as a major step forward for this European Parliament."
". Mr President, I would like to make a statement in relation to the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council to establish a new financial services committee organisational structure."
"In particular I wish to bring to the attention of the House the contents of a letter which was sent by the President-in-Office of Ecofin, Minister Charlie McCreevy TD, on 24 March to the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"The contents of the letter are as follows:"
"'Concerning the proposal for a directive to establish a new financial services committee organisational structure, presented by the Commission on 5 November 2003, I would like to clarify a few points which have been raised during the contacts between the Council and the European Parliament."
"When in March 2001 the Stockholm European Council took the decision to apply the Lamfalussy approach in the securities sector, the following passage was included in the Presidency Conclusions: ‘The European Council notes that, within the framework of the comitology decision of 28 June 1999, the Commission has committed itself, in order to find a balanced solution for those cases of implementing measures in the field of securities markets acknowledged in the light of the discussions to be particularly sensitive, to avoid going against predominant views which might emerge within the Council as to the appropriateness of such measures."
"This commitment shall not constitute a precedent.’"
"'The Council, noting that this commitment on behalf of the Commission does not constitute a precedent, and taking into account the function of the Lamfalussy approach in the securities sector, will not ask the Commission to make a similar undertaking within the framework of the extension of the Lamfalussy approach to the banking and the insurance sectors."
"'Concerning the question of interinstitutional balance, you will recall the statement of the representatives of the governments of the Member States meeting within Council on 9 December 2002, wherein they decided that they would draw the attention of their Heads of State and Government to the importance of a revision of Article 202 of the EC Treaty and invited them to consider this question in the preparation of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We now have on the table of the Intergovernmental Conference a draft Constitutional Treaty which regulates the delegation to the Commission of the power to enact delegated regulations."
"The Treaty is not agreed yet, but I can affirm to you that the representatives of the governments of the Member States meeting within the Council favour the idea of a balanced legislative system in accordance with the principles set out in Part I, Article 35, of the draft Treaty.'"
". Mr President, the proposed directive before you, while largely technical, is of considerable importance for the success of European financial integration."
"Over the last few years we have moved to a whole new approach on the European regulation of securities designed to ensure that Europe can react quickly and effectively to market developments and opportunities."
"With this in mind, the Commission put forward the proposal designed to establish a coherent and effective regulatory system across the financial services area."
"In doing so, we were mindful of the reservations of Parliament and, in particular, of your concerns on ensuring institutional balance with the Council."
"I must, therefore, congratulate you for the very cooperative way in which your Members and the Council, and in particular the Irish presidency, have worked with us to reach a solution."
"With this in mind, I now wish to make a formal declaration on behalf of the European Commission."
"The integration of the financial services markets is essential to strengthen the European economy, as was stated by the European Councils of Lisbon and Stockholm."
"The implementation of the financial services action plan by the date set in the Councils' conclusions, that is, 2005 for the entire action plan, is crucial if this objective is to be achieved."
"The Commission is very pleased with the close cooperation among the Community institutions and expresses its confidence in the continuation of this cooperation for the implementation of the Commission's proposals in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts chaired by Baron Lamfalussy."
"The Commission notes that the second intermediate report of the interinstitutional securities markets monitoring group, the follow-up committee, declared that the Lamfalussy process proves to be a viable instrument for improving the efficiency and speed of legislation on, and regulation of, financial markets within the European Union."
"In a general way, the Commission, in its White Paper on governance, declared that its executive responsibilities must be more clearly established and that the Council and Parliament should have an equal share in the control of the manner in which the Commission fulfils its executive task."
"The Commission emphasises its commitment to placing Parliament and the Council on an equal footing in the control of the competences delegated by joint decision."
"It states in this respect that, since the statement of President Romano Prodi during the plenary session of 5 February 2002, it has made concrete proposals to revise Article 202 and, in anticipation of the possible adoption of the new constitutional treaty, to modify the ‘comitology’ decision of 1999, thus demonstrating its objective, that of reaching a well-balanced solution."
"Meanwhile, while awaiting the possible adoption and entry into force of the draft constitutional treaty, there is a need, in the field of financial services, without this establishing a precedent, for flexible regulating mechanisms, although the institutional balance must be fully maintained."
"In this respect, as regards the area of securities, a letter was sent on 2 October 2001 by the commissioner responsible to the Chairman of Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"This letter was followed by a formal declaration delivered on 5 February 2002 at a plenary session in Parliament."
"In the specific context of an extension of this approach to the area of banks, insurance companies, and professional pensions, as well as OPCVMs (mutual fund schemes), the Commission is in a position to reiterate the following."
"Take note of the intention of Parliament to limit to four years ..."
"... from the coming into force of each directive concerned, the duration of a delegation of new enforcement jurisdictions to the Commission, subject to a continuation proposed by the latter and accepted by Parliament and the Council."
"The Commission may be able to accept future amendments adopted by Parliament to this end."
"It could make sure that Parliament is granted a period of three months from the first transmission of the drafts of the enforcement measures to allow it to examine them and give an opinion on them."
"However, in the case of a duly justified emergency, this period may be shortened."
"The Commission can ensure complete transparency in relation to Parliament during the entire procedure of adopting the enforcement measures, and also guarantee wide public consultation prior to working out the drafts of the enforcement measures."
"The Commission would welcome the creation of groups of market participants within the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee, as well as the Committee of European Securities Regulators."
"It recalls its political will to see to it that Parliament benefits from identical treatment. The Commission reaffirms its commitment to ensure effective cooperation between institutions, to keep the strictest account of the position of Parliament and the resolutions that it could adopt respecting enforcement measures that would exceed the jurisdiction provided in the basic act and its objective, in these cases, to reach a well-balanced solution."
". – Mr President, I refer to Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"This report on ‘the new policy for the neighbouring states’ involves reorganising the lending facilities of the European Investment Bank."
"In consultation with the majority of the coordinators, I would like to request that the plenary should vote on the individual amendments, but should postpone the vote on the draft legislative resolution, so that we again have an opportunity to negotiate with the Commission and the Council on our amendments and so that the views of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy can also be taken into account, to the effect that the negotiations should impose new priorities in connection with Russia and the new Independent States."
". Mr President, the Commission believes that there is a good basis for agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on this amended regulation on development cooperation with South Africa."
"Amendment No 3 is the only obstacle to approval by the Commission and – I should note – by the Council."
". – Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his explanation."
"In these circumstances, we can withdraw Amendment No 3 and can also announce that Amendment No 2 will be replaced by Amendment No 4."
". Mr President, in this report, I propose rejection of the Italian initiative organising joint flights for the removal of illegal nationals, and I do so for two reasons."
"Firstly and fundamentally, the main point of my report is to emphasise that the European States cannot just extend the repressive aspect of the asylum and immigration policy, while, at the same time, neglecting whole sections of it regarding legal immigration and the integration of nationals from developing countries who have legally settled in our countries."
"Moreover, this initiative proposed by Italy does not at all constitute added value for European action in this area."
"I would like to say formally here that the mass returns are a lamentable practice ..."
"… that should be used only exceptionally, while this initiative would tend to make more general, and therefore commonplace, this type of measure."
"Furthermore, it seems to me truly deplorable that the only elements constituting a guarantee for the preservation of the rights of the expelled persons are, in this resolution, placed in a non-binding appendix, which is particularly revealing of the Council’s intention to build a Europe that is nothing but a fortress."
"Finally, on its form, the Council may not, as it has done, disregard Parliament's opinion on a subject that touches on so many fundamental liberties."
"Parliament's consultative role, which is already only a formality in this area, would become totally superfluous for proposals of this sort, which proves – if there were still need to do so – the need for reform of our institutions, whose victims are, in the first place, the citizens whom we represent."
"It is for these reasons that I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to reject this initiative."
". Mr President, I wanted to indicate that I am in favour of sending this text back to the committee."
"Mr President, on this matter the European Commission has chosen an illegitimate course of action, which has taken away the European Parliament’s powers by well and truly surrendering European sovereignty to the United States of America."
"At this point I would, therefore, ask the Commission whether, instead of going through the motions of making us vote, it might not consider it better to hand over the issue to the only democratic institution with decision-making powers that is involved in this case, that is to say the United States Congress."
"Mr President, you are right that we must investigate transparency and accountability."
"Could we also investigate whether we are within the law with regard to employment?"
"I have been continually concerned at the lack of an assistants' statute."
"Does this not give us an opportunity to check and confirm that we are within the employment legislation?"
"– Mr President, I am one of the victims of Mr Hans-Peter Martin’s libels, and I am no longer prepared to put up with this sort of thing."
"I accordingly request – and wish to have it on the record – that Mr Hans-Peter Martin’s parliamentary immunity be suspended."
"I will be bringing criminal proceedings against this Member for libel, defamation, insulting language, damage and all other offences that may be considered relevant."
"I therefore ask that his parliamentary immunity be suspended, so that the proceedings can be brought."
". It should be noted that what is known as the Lamfalussy process for adopting legislation on the financial markets was accepted by the European Parliament, which meant that the basic political choices involved in the process would be taken by codecision and that the technical measures for implementing them would be adopted by the Commission."
"The main aim of this process is to speed up the implementation of the financial services action plan, in order to create a single market, as an integrated capitals market, by 2005."
"This process would benefit the main market operators because it would give them substantial influence over lawmaking and would liberalise the movement of capital and financial instruments in order to feed speculators’ greed."
"The European Parliament accepted this process because it agreed with its aims, thereby placing its legislative power in the hands of others."
"We cannot, therefore, complain or call this process a simple comitology procedure."
"By establishing a new organisational structure for committees responsible for financial services, the European Commission is attempting to apply the Lamfalussy process to the banking sector, to insurance and to collective investment undertakings."
"The European Parliament is once again critical, but once again approves the process because, once again, it agrees with the stated aims."
"This is a good lesson for those who are such vocal advocates of codecision."
". The background to producing this Association Agreement – the aim of which is to improve EU-Central America relations – is that, having concluded association agreements with the countries of Central America and the Andean Community which are identical to those already concluded with Mexico and Chile and to those currently being negotiated with Mercosur, we wish to establish a basis for an overall interregional agreement that will facilitate the creation of an EU-Latin-American Association, including a Free Trade Area."
"The intention is thus to increase the EU’s influence in that region, providing a counterbalance to the powerful influence that the United States already exerts there by focusing its interests, firstly on creating a US-Central America Free Trade Area and then on establishing what is known as the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA)."
"Whilst I am aware of these developments, I do believe that competition is always a good thing and that all relations that can be established with these countries will be mutually beneficial, both for the Member States involved and the EU as a whole, and for the balance of socio-economic and geostrategic relations in the intercontinental context."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
". There is a clear need for the third EU-Latin America summit in Mexico to set the date for the opening of negotiations on association agreements with the countries of Central America and the Andean Community, with identical characteristics ‘, to those already concluded with Mexico and Chile, or to those currently being negotiated with Mercosur."
"I share the rapporteur’s opinion on the fundamental role that these agreements could play for a subsequent global interregional agreement leading to the creation of a Euro-Latin American partnership, including a free-trade area, by 2010 at the latest, as the European Parliament requested in its resolution of 15 November 2001."
"The main aims of the new agreement are to strengthen relations between the EU and Central America by developing political dialogue and reinforcing cooperation, and to create the conditions under which, building on the outcome of the Doha Work Programme, a feasible and mutually beneficial association agreement, including a free trade agreement, could be negotiated between the parties."
"I voted in favour."
"The views I expressed in my explanation of vote on the Obiols i Germà report also hold true for this report, in other words: the context in which this Association Agreement has been produced consists of laying the foundations for a global interregional agreement that will help to create an EU-Latin America Association, including a Free Trade Area, thereby increasing the EU’s influence in that region and acting as a counterbalance to the influence that the US has or wishes to have there."
"Unless this association is established, the interests of the countries in that region will become polarised, firstly on creating a US-Central America Free Trade Area and then on setting up what is being called the Free Trade Area of the Americas."
"We should, therefore, promote relations with those countries that are mutually beneficial, both to the countries and Member States involved and to the EU as a whole and also to the balance of intercontinental socio-economic and geo-strategic relations."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this report."
". I share the concern expressed by the rapporteur as regards the strategic need for the European Union to establish closer cooperation with Latin America as a whole."
"This must be a geo-strategic priority for Europe."
"I regret the fact that the Commission has failed to make more progress on stepping up or improving relations with that part of the world, which shares Europe’s values and history."
"This is something that Parliament has been calling for."
"From this point of view, I welcome the new agreement on political dialogue and cooperation that has been proposed, which is intended to strengthen relations between the Union and the Andean Community by extending political dialogue and enhancing cooperation and by establishing conditions that will enable us to negotiate a ‘viable and mutually advantageous’ association agreement, which would include signing a free trade agreement."
"I am particularly concerned to note the worsening political and social situation in Venezuela, and believe that concluding this agreement could give the European Union greater power to act in order to promote democracy and social stability in that country."
"The forthcoming Guadalajara Summit could be a good opportunity to promote this relationship, setting a realistic timetable for establishing a genuine association between the European Union and Latin America."
"I voted in favour."
". In relation to Amendment No 1 of the report on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC, Euratom) N° 2728/94 establishing a Guarantee Fund for external actions (COM (2003) 604), I would like explicitly to emphasise that ‘new’ atomic power stations also includes those that are to be ‘completed’ (such as Cernavoda in Romania)."
"I would like to make it clear once again that a ‘new’ atomic power station is also to be understood as meaning the ‘completion’ of an existing one."
". This report proposes to amend Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2728/94 establishing a Guarantee Fund for external actions, in light of the accession of new Member States on 1 May 2004."
"The Guarantee Fund covers guaranteed loans granted to third countries and the guarantees for these loans."
"With ten countries soon to join the EU, in 2004, the Fund will be affected by the fact that various countries have benefited from European Investment Bank (EIB) loans, guaranteed by the EU budget, which means that these will be covered by the target amount from the moment they join the Union."
"The guarantees will remain in place, but the associated credit risk will now be transferred to the Union budget."
"This proposal for an amendment establishes rules to address all of these situations and to ensure an ordered transfer of these responsibilities from the Fund to the budget."
"In terms of the financial implications, this is an exceptional and inevitable financial operation, because it is linked to the process of enlargement, and I have consequently voted in favour."
". The Guarantee Fund was originally established as a way of protecting the EU budget from potential risk in relation to its growing external loans."
"The guarantee fund mechanism covers three different types of lending in third countries: guarantees for EIB lending, for EU macro-financial assistance loans (MFA) and for Euratom external lending."
"In this context, the Fund is also an important instrument for our policy of cooperation with third countries."
"The aim of this proposal is to remove the new Member States from the coverage of the fund, provided that they do join the European Union, and to establish a uniform framework for future rounds of enlargement."
"We have no objections to this."
"We do, however, agree with the rapporteur’s view that the funds’ parameters should be set more appropriately, because they could be seen as being over-cautious."
"Amongst the amendments that are proposed, we feel that it would be useful but somewhat unrealistic slightly to relax the provisioning rate of the Fund before the current financial perspective runs out."
"As the rapporteur confirms, the Commission should carefully assess the fund’s financial parameters and submit proposals that are more in line with the real risks within the post-2006 framework."
"This proposal for a regulation arose from the need to amend Regulation 2728/94/EC/Euratom establishing a guarantee fund for external actions, with a view to new Member States joining on 1 May and their ensuing new status. This guarantee fund covers guaranteed loans to third countries and guarantees for these loans."
"The guarantee fund mechanism was originally established in conjunction with the financial perspective for the 1993-1999 period as a way of protecting the EU budget from the potential risk associated with the increasing number of external loans, and so the fund only covers risks for loans and guarantees to third countries."
"In tandem with this proposal, the Commission submitted a general report on the workings of the guarantee fund, which concludes that the fund continued to meet its main objectives during the 1998-2002 period."
"I have, therefore, voted in favour of this proposal which, as a technical budgetary instrument, pursues a policy with which I fully agree and which strives to ensure that the European Union must pursue firm external action, to support development and to promote the well-being of peoples and nations beyond Europe’s borders."
". The Commission proposes that the European Investment Bank’s mandate to grant external loans, guaranteed by the Community budget should be revised, so as to take account of the New Neighbourhood policy in the context of an enlarged Europe, which is included in its proposals for a political and financial framework for 2007-2013."
"If we consider the ceiling for loans, which stands at EUR 20.260 million, we will rapidly conclude that the report accompanying this legislative proposal adds little to the underlying geopolitical considerations and objectives, particularly that of creating a pan-European-Mediterranean free trade area, in which the European Union can exert political, economic and military influence at regional level."
"The neighbourhood policy includes Russia as a matter of priority, for which the rapporteur proposes an increase of EUR 500 million in the provisional share-out, and the countries of the Mediterranean basin."
"These loans would clearly serve a policy of influence, self-interest and regional interference on the part of the European Union."
"This is an objective that we reject."
"More worrying still, however, is the fact that this policy of good neighbourliness has appeared at the expense of the EU’s cooperation and development policy, particularly with the ACP countries, Latin America and Asia."
". This proposal is concerned with the revision, by the end of the last remaining period of the mandate, of the Community banking guarantee for the European Investment Bank (EIB), designed to cover loans granted by this bank, on the basis of Community own resources, to non-Member countries."
"The Union’s enlargement, on 1 May 2004, will increase the EIB’s lending capacity, without increasing the ceiling for its mandate to provide external loans, which will be particularly favourable, at a time when the European Union is stepping up cooperation with the potential candidate countries from the Western Balkans and is preparing gradually to extend its relations with other neighbours, to the South and East."
"According to the EIB’s Banking Activities Plan (BAP), the use planned for the various regional packages during the remaining period of the mandate suggests a total volume of loans that is greater than the overall amount that has been set."
"Bearing these projections in mind, the Commission has proposed a new geographical distribution of the volume planned for the mandate, maintaining the current limit of EUR 19.46 million."
"Given the need to improve the Union’s relations with its closest neighbours, I have voted in favour of the amendments that have been tabled."
". This is a report of a theoretical, conceptual, and even ideological nature."
"Reading the explanatory statement gives one the impression that we are living in an idyllic world."
"This world can be divided into ‘donors’ and beneficiaries of the philanthropy of these ‘donors’."
"Nevertheless, the ‘donors’ should be accountable to their taxpayers, which would impose conditions – and rightly so – on their capacity to provide aid."
"This is why in this world, there is a real need to ensure that this aid is not misused and why the concept of ‘good governance’ was introduced by the World Bank in 1991, with a definition of its main aspects."
"Both the Commission communication and the critical assessment made in this report (extending the idea beyond the sphere of the State, which is seen simply as the ‘supplier’ to ‘civil society’), consider ‘good governance’ to be a terminological concept which is more pragmatic than that of democracy, for example, and that this concept should underpin the EU’s development policy."
"The real world is far from idyllic, however."
"There are opposing interests in conflict with one another, and no amount of ‘good governance’ can conceal the scant importance attached to cooperation in the entire range of Community policies, the absence of any concept of solidarity or respect for what is ‘different’, and the constant presence of conditionality, which imposes economic and social models."
"We therefore feel that this report is dangerous, because it portrays the world as those acting in good faith would like it to be or could be and not as it is."
". I have voted in favour because I believe that the European Union must continue and step up its efforts to promote democracy as a crucial strand of its development policy."
"Promoting genuinely democratic governance, at local, regional and national level is an unequivocally important factor, which can never be overemphasised and without which we will not see the desired harmonisation of public administrations."
"For this reason I would highlight the absolute need for the greater involvement of civil society, which will enable us to undertake ongoing electoral and parliamentary reforms, in order to ensure that political activity is broader-based and more effective."
"In this regard, I support the rapporteur’s statement on the need to end impunity, which will only happen if independent judicial systems are established or strengthened and civil and political freedoms are fully respected."
"Without prejudice to the greater or lesser ability of individual States, I would lastly endorse the idea that refusals to provide assistance must be limited to cases in which governments ignore or are responsible for ongoing breaches of the basic universal rights of men, women and children."
"This, must not, of course, preclude pursuing dialogue and providing humanitarian assistance or food aid."
". I wish to record my support for this report as a major step forward in facilitating the application of the 'polluter pays' principle."
"When environmental damage occurs, the first question always is: who is going to pay?"
"This report makes it possible to apply the 'polluter pays' principle, a principle which must be used with great consistency and efficiency."
"The requirement for the Commission to present a report, within six years, will also give us the option to revisit this important area and properly assess its impact in practice."
"In an ideal world I would expect that citizens would be protected from any risk of environmental damage – and thankfully we are making progress in terms of some real preventative measures."
"But, unfortunately, far too much environmental damage still occurs and we must have tough measures to make sure those who cause such damage really do pay the cost."
"The measures included in this report will also ensure that polluters face similar requirements, and penalties, right across the European Union."
". This is a process that has now reached the third and final stage of negotiations between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"This is a process that has been marked by pressure from big business – see, for example, the opinions of UNICE, the European employers’ federation – in order to avoid liability for direct damage to the environment, with the governments of some EU countries having defended these interests in the negotiations on this directive."
"Despite the fact that the agreement fails to include some of the proposals tabled by the European Parliament, by my parliamentary group in particular – and without going into detail on the fundamental issues it raises, on the concepts that it adopts, on its proper implementation and on all its consequences, in particular for small- and medium-sized enterprises this is a compromise that could help us better to combat damage to the environment, paying particular attention to damage caused by big business."
"As I have pointed out, policies on protecting the environment and natural resources are crucial to everyone’s future."
"Priority must be given to active policies and measures targeting prevention, research and support for access to technology, with particular emphasis on the problems and needs of micro, small- and medium-sized businesses."
". As I said at first reading when we voted on this proposal for a directive (14 May 2003), it is extremely important that we adopt a global Community system for preventing and remedying environmental damage, including water pollution, damage to biodiversity and soil contamination, which poses a serious risk to human health."
"After several years of debate and repeated environmental disasters, we have reached a crucial point for effectively preventing and remedying environmental damage; in other words, a real watershed."
"I welcome the agreement reached in Conciliation on a financial guarantee (the compromise reached with the Council lays down that, six years after the Directive’s entry into force, the Commission will present a report on the situation concerning the mandatory financial security instruments)."
"I also welcome the gradual approach and the exclusion of low-risk activities."
"In the planned future revision, the European Commission must pay particular attention to the differences between levels of liability in the various Member States without overlooking the need closely to observe the principles of subsidiarity and of proportionality as regards the action of the Member States."
"This common position improves on the legal framework for environmental protection."
"I therefore voted in favour."
". The contamination of animal feed can have the consequence of impairing food intended for human consumption."
"The case of BSE is a good example, in which the use of animal meal led to one of the most serious food crises ever seen in the European Union."
"The same could be said of nitrofurans, dioxins, the hormone MPA (medroxy-progesterone acetate), or of antibiotics, with consequences, upstream, for human health."
"We are facing an extreme case today in the shape of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) because the meat or milk of cattle fed with products containing GMOs are not covered by the labelling and traceability procedures."
"I believe that the principle of primary responsibility for compliance with food legislation and food safety lies with the animal feed businesses."
"In conjunction with traceability, this principle could allow for rapid action that would put an end to risks to human and animal health and to the environment."
"Nevertheless, how we ensure the financial liability of operators whose activities cause economic damage to the animal feed sector is a key issue, bearing in mind that these operators are frequently supported by public funds."
"The Commission proposes that there should be a financial guarantee, in this case an insurance, although we have reservations about this point, because an assessment must first be made of the socio-economic impact of this measure, which must not invalidate an effective system of financial liability."
"There must be monitoring and the law must be observed."
". The proposal for a Community regulation must match the commitments given in the White Paper on Food Safety, provided that it sets requirements for a complete system for registering all operators of businesses in the animal feed sector and requirements for animal feed production."
"This proposal establishes requirements in the field of animal feed hygiene at all stages of use, production, processing and distribution of animal feed and upholds certain requirements for imports from third countries which stipulate that these countries must meet standards at least equivalent to those set out in the regulation (measures to be implemented under the comitology process)."
"In my view, without wishing to play down the importance of food safety, we must avoid measures that are excessively restrictive or harmful to animal feed producers and which are unreasonably harsher than those that apply to producers of food for human consumption."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour."
". This regulation is aimed at updating legislation on materials that come into contact with foodstuffs, establishing a framework regulation that sets out the rules by which packages and materials should be covered, the safety standards to be achieved and the procedure for the authorisation both of materials and methods."
"It also includes new provisions on active and intelligent packaging."
"This regulation forms part of the overall package for enhancing food safety."
"Food safety is highly dependent on packaging, which not only protects food from light, micro-organisms and air, but also helps to preserve the taste and freshness of food."
"Special care must, therefore, be taken with the materials that come into contact with food, and also with the functions of these materials."
"Nevertheless, as regards the key premise that all packaging must conform to Community food safety legislation, and must not mislead consumers, we have major reservations about the concept of active packaging."
"Active packaging means changing the condition of food; adding aromatic substances, removing odours or adding preservatives to extend the shelf-life of products."
"This could disguise the true condition of the food."
"We therefore agree with Amendment No 6, but feel that more rigorous studies should be carried out on the use of this type of packaging and of its active materials."
". We are now seeing the emergence of what are known as ‘active’ and ‘intelligent’ packaging for food preservation, but European legislation has not always kept pace with these developments."
"This is an attempt better to preserve consumer health and to facilitate the free movement of goods, by establishing a legal framework for technological development, issues currently governed by a directive that dates back to 1989 and which is now under review."
"The draft defines as ‘active’ packaging designed to interact with food to preserve its qualities and to extend its shelf-life and as ‘intelligent’ packaging which is able to provide information on the condition of the food content."
"Account is also taken of other recent materials and products."
"Taken together with the specific traceability measures proposed, these food safety measures will contribute to a real improvement in the quality of food products, to greater confidence on the part of European consumers and, of course, to higher food safety standards."
"I therefore voted in favour."
". – The explanatory statement quite rightly denounces the ‘social’ apartheid that continues apartheid pure and simple, and claims to act to ‘reduce the gap between the poor and the rich.’"
"If this were even slightly true, we would vote in favour of this report, but we have our doubts, because the main sector mentioned as destined to receive a restructuring benefit of EUR 15 million is the South African wines and spirits sector."
"It seems doubtful that this type of assistance will reach the townships, the squalid and crowded districts where the poor live."
"The report does not even make it possible to rule out the hypothesis that, among the wine producers in question, besides rich South Africans, there are also big Western companies."
"Furthermore, nothing makes it possible to verify that the ‘direct budgetary support’ is indeed going toward social budgets or public utilities and not, for example, toward the purchase of arms and military and police equipment to confront the poor."
"This being so, we prefer to abstain."
". I have for a long time monitored developments in South Africa’s socio-political situation and I believe that reinforcing cooperation with the major countries of southern Africa could promote development and strengthen democracy in that region."
"I share the rapporteur’s view that trade and development policies must be geared towards combating poverty, to promoting employment and social justice, to creating wealth, to ensuring a fair distribution of income and to general economic, social and cultural development."
"It is, however, crucial that, in this context of combating the social causes of the insecurity currently facing that country, we do not overlook measures for effectively halting the spiral of violence, which has resulted in countless innocent victims, including many citizens of Portuguese nationality or extraction."
"I believe that allocating EUR 15 million of EU funds for restructuring the wines and spirits sector must take account of the breach of industrial property rights arising from the illegal use of traditional European wine names, such as those associated with Port wine, by South African producers."
"In order to reaffirm the desire for EU cooperation with southern Africa to promote democracy and development there, I voted in favour."
". The European public has fortunately been paying greater attention to climate change, which has helped to improve research conditions."
"This will enable us in future to adopt better technical and technological solutions, which provide guarantees both for human progress and for the sustainability of this development."
"According to experts in the field, this proposal for a regulation is crucial to the first phase of the European Climate Change Programme (ECCP) and is intended to establish a legislative framework for reducing hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), which are powerful greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol."
"Fluorinated gases currently account for 2% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union."
"Nevertheless, their potential for global warming is considerable, because many of them have a long atmospheric lifetime (up to fifteen years)."
"The proposal must make it possible, in line with the forecasts, to reduce fluorinated gas emissions by 2010 and then effect even larger reductions."
"Various studies are being conducted in this field and must, of course, receive appropriate support from the European Union, in particular financial support, in order to fulfil the obligations established at the Johannesburg Summit in 2002: political coherence, sustainable management of natural resources and promoting methods of consumption ..."
". In 1998, the European Community and its fifteen Member States signed what was called the Århus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, the main aim of which was to allow the public to become more involved in environmental matters and to actively contribute to improved preservation and protection of the environment."
"Signing the Århus Convention requires measures to be adopted that are legally binding on the European Community’s institutions and bodies, and this regulation does this specifically as regards the three pillars of the Convention: access to information, public participation in the decision-making process and access to justice in environmental matters."
"Access to high-quality information (preferably made available on public electronic databases), must today be considered to be a standard prerogative of citizenship."
"Only by establishing rules for this access will we effectively contribute to ensuring public control in an area that concerns everyone – a genuine citizenship of the environment, including access to justice in environmental matters at Community level."
". This proposal comes in the wake of two other initiatives – public access to environmental information and public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment – intended to contribute to the implementation of the Århus Convention of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations (UN/ECE) on Access to Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters."
"The European Parliament report contains some aspects that I welcome, in particular expanding the definition of ‘qualified entity’ (specifically to cover local authorities), the possibility of involving private organisations, as it states, ‘to respond to the increasing privatisation of traditionally public functions’, or the guarantees for the participation of bodies that lack the financial ability to bear the costs."
"This is an instrument of last resort, which could contribute to reinforcing the action undertaken by communities in order to protect their living conditions and the environment in which they live."
". This report should be seen against the backdrop of the important package on the ‘environment’ and, more specifically, on the European Union’s incorporating into its legal system the Århus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in environmental matters (III pillars)."
"It also aims to remedy various shortcomings in monitoring the implementation of environmental legislation."
"The Directive now being proposed establishes minimum conditions for access to civil and criminal proceedings in environmental matters and explicitly defines the criteria capable of ensuring a better transposition of environmental law with the least possible impact."
"As I said, specifically in my explanation of vote on the Korhola report, there must be effective public control in an area that is of concern to us all – a genuine ‘Citizen’s Control’ to protect our environmental heritage."
"This proposal formalises the terms in which this control could be undertaken in a democratic way."
"Nevertheless, I abstained in the final vote, because the report does not make clear its position on the Convention, which has already been signed by the Member States and this led me to harbour some reservations."
"I am very pleased with this European Commission proposal."
"Up until now, there has in fact been no specific legislation applicable to the extractive industries."
"The existing directives were used, in particular the framework directive on waste and the landfill directive."
"That was not really satisfactory, however, especially since the extractive industries produce large amounts of waste."
"It is easy to imagine the chain of harmful effects on the environment that might flow from bad management."
"It was therefore high time that these activities were regulated and the specific needs of the sector met."
"Generally speaking, the extractive industries view this proposal favourably."
"I know that some differences have emerged concerning the classification of waste."
"The most important thing is to establish criteria for determining which kinds of waste are hazardous and which are not."
"It is also important to look to the future and encourage research into more sustainable production that produces less waste."
"I also support the creation of a financial guarantee to pay for the rehabilitation of sites after closure."
". As a follow-up to the Commission communication which addressed, amongst other matters, the management of mining waste, given the specific characteristics of mines and the considerable disparities between subsectors of the extractive industries, work was undertaken on re-assessing Community environmental policy, in light of recent mining accidents, for example at Baie Mare, in Romania, and at Aznacollar, in Spain."
"Of course I support this proposal, because it sets minimum requirements for improving the management of waste from the extractive industries, including, to be specific, for the environmental and human risks related to waste processing and elimination operations."
"Furthermore, the form of waste recovery that the proposal advocates is aimed at preserving resources, reducing the pressure that is exerted on the exploitation of natural resources."
"The Directive’s provisions seek, therefore, to cover the sectors that present serious risks to the environment and to health or which present potential risks of serious accidents, paying particular attention, for this reason, to the structural aspects of an environmental policy which, as the European Union proposes, should be sustainable."
"Lastly, I would emphasise the introduction of some important amendments aimed at upholding the interests of small quarries that have to meet the demands of the directive."
"I voted in favour."
". In order to meet its international commitments, the European Union must formally approve the decision on the conclusion of the Århus Convention."
"The aim of the Convention adopted at the Ministerial Conference ‘Environment for Europe’, which took place at Aarhus, Denmark, on 25 June 1998, is to facilitate access to information on the environment and improve public participation in decisions that could have consequences for the environment, to which we could add a ‘third pillar’: access to justice in environmental matters."
"The Stockholm Declaration on the Human Environment, of 16 June 1972, stated that everyone has the right to live ‘in an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being’ (...)."
"In the Maastricht Treaty itself, the Union gave a commitment to consider environmental protection in all its policies."
"This measure complies, therefore, with Article 175(4) of the EC Treaty, which explicitly stipulates that the Member States must ensure that environmental policy is implemented and this also constitutes a further important step towards the desired sustainability of development in the EU."
". This proposal for a regulation on the European satellite navigation system proposes creating a management structure for this system that is as effective and reliable as possible."
"The Commission therefore suggests creating two bodies: a Supervisory Authority and a Safety Centre."
"The proposed Supervisory Authority is to be a Commission institution; as the Commission owns the Galileo infrastructure it is also to be responsible for controlling the satellite navigation system."
"For its part, the Security Centre is to guarantee the system’s operational and external security."
"I agree with the rapporteur’s suggestions that the know-how acquired by already-existing structures should be incorporated into the institutions to be created, specifically by transferring the knowledge of the European Space Agency (an organisation that has been very closely involved in this programme), to the Supervisory Authority."
"I also share the rapporteur’s concern to strike a balance between the independence of the Supervisory Authority and the transparency of its appointment procedures."
"I agree, in particular, with the statement that an annual report from its director to the European Parliament would not in itself constitute a sufficient guarantee of this transparency."
"I therefore voted in favour."
". I support this measure, because it constitutes a step forwards in establishing a system of judicial and police cooperation, which is necessary if the area of freedom, security and justice is to come into being."
"This framework decision is aimed at replacing simple cooperation in criminal matters, by implementing the principle of mutual recognition."
"It must consequently allow for more rapid and effective cooperation and, at the same time, render the European arrest warrant more effective."
"It will enable a European Evidence Warrant to be issued to obtain objects, documents and data for use in proceedings in criminal matters, provided that these items are already available in the executing Member State."
"Measures such as the European arrest warrant and the European Evidence Warrant will only be effective, however, when they are implemented by all Member States."
"We can, therefore, only regret the fact that the framework decision on the European arrest warrant has not been implemented throughout the EU by 1 January 2004."
"Only eight Member States have implemented it."
"I thus welcome the fact that the recent European Council set a deadline for June for implementing measures to combat terrorism that have already been adopted, including the European arrest warrant."
"I hope that this time, finally, the measures set out following 11 September 2001 are transposed and implemented."
"Everything depends on the political will and the political will does appear to exist!"
". I, like other Members of the House, fully understand the desire to see closer cooperation between the judicial authorities in all the Member States."
"In particular, I wish to see mutual recognition and respect for decisions and judicial processes."
"Since the Tampere Summit, and following the September 11 and March 11 atrocities in the USA and Madrid, there is an understandable wish to take action against alleged criminals and terrorists."
"However, all these initiatives must be predicated on the principle of protection of civil rights and fundamental freedoms."
"I am greatly concerned that these basic protections are not sufficiently enshrined in this current proposal."
"I have a number of concerns which include a major doubt about the legal bases; serious questions concerning the lack of protection and safeguards, particularly the use of surveillance measures and coercive methods; permitting evidence to be used that would be inadmissible in an Irish court; undermining Irish Constitutional protection for defendants; allowing self-incrimination."
"Parliament does not have legislative powers in the area of criminal law, which is best decided at national level."
"For these and many other reasons I voted against the report."
". It is regrettable that the EP has not taken the opinion of its Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and rejected this initiative from the European Commission."
"This proposal falls in line with the federalist approach, which seeks to remove fundamental powers from the Member States, powers that go to the heart of their sovereignty."
"This would jeopardise their citizens’ rights, guarantees and freedoms."
"The European Evidence Warrant is a ‘relative’ of the European arrest warrant, which was approved, let us remember, on the pretext of ‘combating terrorism’."
"As has been stated, the European Commission’s main aim is to replace current legal assistance mechanisms, based on international conventions, with a system of mutual recognition, requiring a judgment in one Member State to be recognised directly, without it having to be converted into a national judgment."
"As has been pointed out, the process is moving ahead without any safeguards being provided to protect the rights of the citizens of each State because, if the prospect of cooperation between States is jeopardised, the guarantees that are safeguarded at this level are also in danger."
"It is also to be regretted that amendments have been rejected seeking to ensure compliance with rights, guarantees and freedoms enshrined under the sovereignty of each people in each State."
". The report refers to a proposal aimed at enabling a Member State to issue a European Evidence Warrant, which may be executed in other Member States."
"The European Evidence Warrant is, in other words, a judicial order issued in one Member State, for the specific purpose of obtaining documents and data for use in criminal proceedings, which may be executed within other Member States, without its having to be converted into a judicial order in the Member State concerned."
"In its proposed form, the European Evidence Warrant will make it possible to obtain evidence that is already available in the State of execution."
"It cannot, however, be used in order to initiate action or to request the performance of investigations in the form of interrogations, hearings, interception of communications, monitoring or surveillance of individuals, and so on."
"Overall, I welcome the report in as far as it addresses the issue of the European Evidence Warrant."
"I do not welcome, however, references made to procedural safeguards in Amendments Nos 5 and 7."
"This report is concerned with the European Evidence Warrant, and, given that this document is not the appropriate place to address the issue of procedural safeguards, I have no choice but to vote against."
"The radical Members of the Lista Bonino believe that the proposal for a Council framework decision on the European Evidence Warrant for obtaining objects, documents and data for use in proceedings in criminal matters is premature."
"As with the European Arrest Warrant, we simply believe that we cannot continue to integrate criminal law and apply the principle of mutual recognition of measures and decisions in criminal matters between the Member States without simultaneously stepping up safeguards and rights of defence in Europe."
"The Commission had promised to submit a framework decision on safeguarding the rights of suspects and defendants in the European Union. This is something that Parliament has repeatedly called for but this proposal is currently blocked."
"Given this situation, the decision that we would have pushed for would have been to reject the proposal in question or to make its entry into force conditional on the approval of the framework decision on safeguards, in order to ensure full respect for procedural safeguards in criminal proceedings, which are key to effectively protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe."
"Obviously, we voted against this Italian Government initiative for several European countries to organise joint charter flights to return ‘illegal nationals’ to their countries of origin, not only because its brutality really does give the European Union a ‘fortress Europe’ image, but also and in particular because we reject the very idea of a fortress Europe surrounded by barbed wire and using military force to expel undesirable migrants."
"We want a Europe where there are no obstacles to movement or residence within and which is also open and welcoming to the world outside."
"Among other things, this means granting official papers to those who are denied them wherever in the European Union they may be."
"The Italian Government’s initiative seeks to organise European charter flights for the ‘mass’ expulsion of third-country nationals."
"The European Council approved it even before receiving Parliament’s opinion."
"The Commission has announced EUR 30 million: this is an unacceptable way to proceed."
"It is the very idea of this initiative that must be rejected, however, as hundreds of organisations and thousands of European citizens have rightly demanded."
"The discriminatory, humiliating and degrading nature of this method of removal is a betrayal of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"More widely, an excessively security-conscious and repressive immigration policy is a threat to migrants, to international relations and to Europe itself."
"As Kofi Annan recently reminded us, we cannot close our doors and eyes to the world around us."
"On the contrary, Europe must be open to those who are prepared to risk everything to flee war, poverty and sometimes death."
"Europe’s need for an ambitious, humane and supportive common policy means instead that migrants should be considered agents of development."
"For that to be the case, we must abandon ‘fortress Europe’ as a matter of urgency and make sufficient money available for genuine cooperation and mutually advantageous development."
"We rejected the Italian Republic’s initiative on ‘European charters’, which are a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights and referred to discreetly as ‘joint flights’."
"We are outraged by the determination that the European Union in general and some of its Member States, such as France, Germany and Italy, are showing in seeking an arrangement for rationalising the removal of third-country nationals by organising joint flights at any price."
"We find the idea of providing EUR 30 million to pay for this type of operation, as the Commission and Council propose, scandalous."
"This fortress Europe policy is nothing but shameful."
"We would prefer to see the same determination, the same effort, devoted to fighting unemployment, inequality and poverty in the EU."
"That does not seem to be the priority of the Fifteen, however."
"They prefer to pander to the electorate’s populist and xenophobic tendencies by describing immigrants as our societies’ number one problem."
"In this context, however, together with human rights and anti-racist organisations, we continue to reaffirm the need for a different immigration policy in Europe, a policy based on open borders, respect for the right of asylum and equal rights."
"I have nothing against developing vocational training by harmonising it at European level."
"However, that vocational training must include a large portion of general knowledge, language learning and so on, which means that the big employers must not be involved in the running, management or even the inspiration of that training."
"Otherwise, we will simply be manufacturing labour to meet the changing needs of the bosses and not to serve the interests of young people."
". I am pleased to support this report, which recognises that Cedefop's achievements to date demonstrate its ability to make a valuable contribution to the development of the Community's vocational training policy."
"The Agency, created in 1975, provides excellent services for the European Commission, the European Union Member States and the social partners, as well as for the associated countries of Norway and Iceland."
"Cedefop provides policy makers, researchers and practitioners with information to promote a clearer understanding of developments in vocational training and thus enable them to take informed decisions for future action."
"I believe the proposed amendments will improve the efficiency of Cedefop's administrative procedures, and am particularly glad to see that they will lead to a balanced representation of men and women by addressing this issue in the whole chain of the nomination and election procedure."
". As successive external evaluations have shown, the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop), an EU Agency that was created in 1975, has, over the course of the years, made a vital contribution towards developing the Community’s vocational training policy."
"The tripartite composition of its Board is reflected in the participation of government representatives, employers’ organisations and employees’ organisations, with the Commission as the fourth participant on the Board, which gives its opinions greater legitimacy and enables it to make better-informed and more effective decisions on the ground."
"The proposed amendments to the basic Regulation of Cedefop are intended to increase its ability to respond, in view of the impending enlargement, and to provide an institutional framework that is more efficient, more flexible and more effective."
"I wholeheartedly welcome the fact that all of the social partners will be involved in consultations on a social project that will lead to an increase in professional qualification and jobs, and will, in turn, lead to improved quality of work."
"For this to happen, I feel that greater emphasis must be placed on informing the citizens of Europe about the work of this and other agencies, in order to raise awareness of the enrichment, both individual and collective, that can be derived from ongoing vocational qualifications."
"The Moderate Party delegation has opted to abstain from voting on the above matter."
"The fight against terrorism and the protection of privacy are not opposed to each other."
"A far-reaching, effective fight against terrorism requires respect for fundamental rights."
"The United States’ requirements have put airlines in an impossible situation, as the requirements infringe EU privacy protection, or obstruct air transport."
"The Commission has tried in an exemplary way to find a solution."
"We do not, therefore, support the resolution’s call for the Commission to withdraw the draft."
"The draft improves the present situation, but still has serious shortcomings."
"The data-protection commissioners in the Member States and the EU, the Article 29 Committee, point out the worrying lack of data protection."
"The draft necessitates a thorough legal revision, and consequently we support an examination by the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"A prompt changeover from the ‘pull’ to the ‘push’ system is necessary in order to remedy the lack of data protection."
"Preconditions for a satisfactory agreement are that passengers be guaranteed information on which data is transferred to the US authorities, and that passengers have the option in practice of giving voluntary consent to such a transfer of personal and economic data, and to inspect the data recorded."
". Conservative MEPs fully support the fight against terrorism and all the means which can be deployed to meet this end."
"We are aware of the fact that considerable negotiations have been underway between the European Commission and the US authorities regarding passenger information."
"We are satisfied that the agreement which has been reached provides the right balance between privacy and the means of protecting our lives and liberties."
"Whilst we understand that passengers may find this inconvenient from time to time, recent events have shown that we must all remain alert and vigilant."
"We are all in this fight together."
"In repudiating the Commission, which had negotiated an agreement with the United States allowing it to consult the ‘passenger files’ of airlines providing transatlantic flights for the purpose of combating terrorism, Parliament has taken a decision that may be criticised on two counts."
"Firstly, it can only confuse our partners by making them doubt our determination to combat terrorism, when only last Friday the European Council adopted a seemingly very resolute declaration to do precisely that."
"Secondly, it overstates the sensitivity of the ‘passenger files’ problem, since that data is hardly confidential, especially so far as the police authorities responsible for protecting the lives of those very same passengers are concerned."
"The European Parliament has made this false move because it wants to boost its own importance and acquire the image of a defender of freedom; it may also be due to an element of anti-American demagogy and, lastly, to provocation from the Commission, which has clearly exceeded its powers."
"To crown it all, the national parliaments have been sidelined completely."
"It is a fine mess for something that seemed so simple at the outset."
". The radical Members of the Lista Bonino are greatly satisfied with the adoption today by the European Parliament of the resolution prepared by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on the transfer of passenger data to the US authorities."
"Indeed, the resolution deems wrong the Commission’s decision, which considered ‘adequate’ the US system that regulates the issue of privacy associated with handling passenger data collected in European territory. It also claims that the Commission exceeded its powers and calls on it to withdraw its decision."
"Furthermore, the resolution states that Parliament could decide to ask the Court of Justice for an opinion on the legality of the draft international agreement with the United States."
"We believe that today, in spite of strong pressure from the Commission, national governments and the United States, the European Parliament has boldly and fully accepted its role as representative of the European citizens and defender of their rights and freedoms, democracy and the rule of law."
". I have voted for the terms of this agreement which would prevent an unacceptable amount of personal passenger data being transmitted to the US authorities."
"While I fully respect the need for the highest possible level of vigilance against terrorism, the terrorists will have won if we sacrifice civil liberties and human rights under the pretext of ensuring security."
"The current draft agreement permits excessive personal data to be transferred: it also allows unlimited access to, and retention of, such data."
"It denies passengers the right to correct incorrect data or lodge appeals with an independent authority if they are denied entry to the US."
"I am very disappointed that Ireland voted for this agreement, thus giving the green light to unwarranted intrusions into the privacy of Irish passengers."
"The Commission must modify its draft agreement text to ensure that European citizens' data protection rights are protected."
"Irish and European passengers deserve to know that their basic civil liberties will not be sacrificed in the fight against terrorism."
". In December 2003, the Commission, exceeding its competences, concluded an agreement with the USA on transmitting air passenger data."
"Only later did it table its draft decision to the Council and to Parliament."
"As we have previously stated, we are vehemently opposed to that agreement."
"Under the pretext of the ‘war on terror’, personal data are to be transmitted to the USA, covering 34 areas – including telephone numbers, credit card details, political opinions, family background, religious convictions and state of health – without any safeguards or effective monitoring."
"This state of affairs only goes to show how the so-called ‘war on terror’ is used to undermine citizens’ rights, freedoms and safeguards."
"As we have previously stated, this is an unacceptable and illegal agreement, which violates the European directive on data protection."
"The responsibility for ensuring the protection of people in terms of the basic data on air passengers currently lies with individual countries, yet this agreement seeks to remove from individual countries any responsibility effectively to block transfers in order to safeguard citizens’ rights."
"We consequently agree with the overall thrust of this resolution, especially as it calls on the Commission to block the current system of transmitting data to the USA and to withdraw its proposal for a decision."
".– Τhe resolution recognises, as the Communist Party of Greece has denounced, that the European Union, which has proclaimed itself the guardian of fundamental rights, is allowing privacy to be blatantly violated by passing on sensitive personal data from its airlines to the USA."
"Similarly, it notes the violation of the law by the Commission and the national authorities, which have not yet set the legal procedures in motion to prevent airlines from passing on this information."
"It also calls for the Commission to withdraw the draft decision, which basically subjects the ΕU to the American claims which were presented a few months ago following consultations with the American side."
"In its conclusions, however, the resolution, instead of proposing a ban on any transmission of personal data, considers that there is a legislative gap and proposes that an agreement be concluded with the USA simply with less data, a shorter storage period and the right of persons whose data is on file to take action to correct information in their files."
"For the immediate future, it calls for passengers' consent to the transmission of 39 items of data."
"Any refusal would, of course, mean they would not be allowed to enter the USA."
"Irrespective of the intentions of its authors, it again proves that the European Parliament accepts the terms of the USA, like a deputy sheriff."
"For these reasons, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote."
"The fight against terrorism is crucial to our security and has our full support."
"The work in combating terrorism must be carried out globally and be preventive, but the fight must always be weighed up against respect for the privacy of individuals."
"Today, the European Parliament has been voting on an agreement between the EU and the United States relating to the surrendering of data selected on no clear basis from commercial passenger lists, for forwarding to the US Bureau of Customs and Border Protection."
"Amongst other things, we take issue with the amount of PNR (Passenger Name Record) data to which the USA wants access, the number of bodies that have access to these, the intended use of the data, the absence of the option of appeal for those refused entry to the United States on account of PNR data, and the United States having direct access to the data without needing to request it."
"There is currently no legal basis in the EU that permits the use of PNR commercial data for protecting public security."
"Therefore, we propose instead that a real international agreement between the EU and the United States be drawn up that clearly stipulates purpose, data, guarantees and responsibilities."
"The agreement in its current form threatens to eliminate the rule of law."
"Therefore, we support the report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak and are voting against this agreement with the United States."
"Terrorism is one of the worst scourges of our time, and must be fought vigorously and effectively at both national and international levels."
"If it is to be effective, international cooperation in combating terrorism must extend to personal data, particularly in the case of air transport."
"We support the collection and handing-over of data on air passengers to the US authorities, but this must be carried out on the basis of clear rules of law (in the USA and Europe), it must be proportionateto the objective, and there must be clear provisions governing which data is collected."
"It must not take place automatically (the ‘pull’ system)."
"It must be made clear which authorities have access to the data, and it must be laid down clearly how long the data may be stored."
"The airlines’ responsibilities to passengers must be laid down, and passengers must have the option of appealing to an independent authority."
"It is regrettable that the personal data of European passengers is being surrendered to the USA without a legal basis, because this means privacy protection being disregarded."
"These irregularities must be addressed."
"The Commission should therefore withdraw its draft and present a new legislative proposal that pays attention to the above points."
"Only legislation of this nature can reconcile the fight against terrorism with respect for privacy and fundamental rights."
"We have voted in favour of items 1 and 10 (adopted by 226 votes to 203 and 233 votes to 207, respectively) in the resolution, and in favour of the resolution as a whole (adopted by 229 votes to 202, with 19 abstentions)."
"In our opinion, the boundaries in matters of public health should as far as possible be drawn at national or local level where individuals themselves cannot make decisions."
"We in the Moderate Party voted against the above report, as it is our opinion that matters concerning the local environment – in this case concerning the indoor environment and passive smoking, for example – should not be dealt with at EU level."
"The principle of subsidiarity should also be applied to decisions on the protection of local water resources."
". Many questions are raised by the Commission’s initiative and by Parliament’s corresponding report."
"We welcome moves to achieve a greater understanding of environmental threats to human health, to identify disease burden caused by environmental factors and to plan policy responses to challenges that emerge."
"I do wonder, however, whether we would be better advised to assess and to show evidence of the impact of current policies in force at EU level, examples of which include the effects of the common agricultural policy on large agricultural companies; the policies of liberalisation that encourage the privatisation of essential public services, such as access to water, which are entirely focused on profit (for the few); or the watering down of the Kyoto objectives by establishing a market of polluting emissions, with priority given to the interests of large corporations."
"There are indeed other examples."
"It is, consequently, a pity that the report makes a brief reference to the need for ‘an intersectoral approach’."
"The report also places emphasis on the need to apply the precautionary principle, when the science is not conclusive but when there is a potentially serious or irreversible threat to health or the environment, especially in the context of the debate on genetically modified organisms (GMO)."
". The strategy before us is aimed at reducing diseases caused by environmental factors."
"Indeed, a recent report on the matter by the European Environment Agency revealed that, in large European cities, some 60 000 deaths per year may be linked to prolonged exposure to air pollution."
"The risks are greater among children than adults."
"In line with the European strategy in the areas of the environment and health proposed by the Commission, the Council approved a range of conclusions, which are to be implemented in the SCALE strategy."
"Between 2004 and 2010, SCALE will focus on the four main problems of public health – childhood respiratory diseases, asthma, allergies; neurodevelopment disorders; childhood cancer; and endocrine disrupting effects – and on its three ultimate objectives, namely to reduce the disease burden caused by environmental factors, to identify and prevent new health threats caused by environmental factors and to strengthen EU capacity for policy-making in this area."
"The Commission’s intention, therefore, is to establish an integrated European system that can monitor the area of the environment and health and intervene where necessary."
"This will create synergies and will facilitate the sharing of data and working practices, in order to achieve a better understanding ..."
"That concludes the vote."
"Before we return to the scheduled business of the House I should like to take this opportunity to respond, on the record, to the invitation made earlier today in my absence while I was at the press conference with the Irish presidency and President Prodi to comment, on behalf of this House, on a number of issues that have a prominent media focus in some Member States at this time."
"As President of this House I have a double duty: I, and we, have a duty to our electorate and the public to be accountable; and I have a duty to this House to be fair."
"I intend to try to fulfil both duties to the best of my abilities."
"In recent days and weeks there has been a fevered climate generated by the tabloid press, not least, but not only, in Germany."
"I first wish to make a general point."
"As President of this Parliament I refuse to accept that we, the elected Members of this House, should suffer some kind of collective guilt."
"We should not be presumed guilty if we do not individually establish our innocence."
"I want this to be clear, especially for some of the German tabloids who have led this campaign."
"The German media, of all the media in Europe, should know in their hearts that collective guilt cannot be visited upon any people or any institution."
"Through you I want to give to the wider world the clearest assurance that we will respond to any evidence or substantiated allegations that come to our attention, but these must be based on evidence not prejudice."
"Let me repeat here today that the most substantial exercise in reforming this House – the attempt to provide ourselves with a statute which took so many years and which secured a majority in this House – failed because of governments, not because of our will."
"Let those who failed us shoulder their responsibilities."
"Let me turn to a specific case."
"Recently there was an anonymous allegation made in respect of two observers from an accession state."
"That anonymous allegation, like so many other allegations of course, first saw the light of day in the media."
"When it came to our attention we decided that since there were alleged disputes about the bona fide signatures of some observers, we would invite an opinion from an external, independent and recognised handwriting expert."
"Only this lunchtime, by coincidence, has that report come to me."
"The expert concludes that all 27 signatures submitted to analysis are authentic – that is to say written by the person alongside whose name they appear."
"Let me be quite clear here and now."
"On the basis of external independent expert evidence there are no grounds on which to base a suspicion of fraud or irregularity in this particular case."
"Indeed the institution arguably has a special duty of care to ensure that no residual suspicion should point to the individuals in question."
"Sadly, I can only conclude in this particular case that these allegations, which proved to be unsubstantiated, were made with malicious intent."
"As President of this House I refuse to allow our work to be derailed by malicious or unsubstantiated rumour or prejudice from whatever source within or without."
"Let me say for those who do not know – and so I am not addressing the House but through you those who may be following our proceedings at this moment – that it is the practice of this House to ensure that a Member signs on each day of attendance."
"That may be done here in our plenary session."
"It may be done when we meet in our groups."
"It may be done when we meet in committees."
"It may be done, if we wish, in a central register."
"When a Member signs that register in the plenary, that does not constitute an obligation to spend the rest of the day sitting in plenary; nor an obligation to spend the rest of the day sitting with one's group, if one signs in a group; nor in a committee; and most certainly not an obligation to sit all day in the central registry, if one signed there."
"Demanding signatures as evidence of attendance is not the universal practice in the parliaments of Member States."
"I should like to point out that we demand more in this House in that regard than many parliaments who are states of this Union and who have parliamentary democracy at their core."
"I say to our friends within and without that if, beyond what I have just recorded here, there is evidence of fraud, then produce it and we will deal with it as we dealt with the evidence to which I referred earlier."
"I want you in this House to know – and the public to know through this House – that we will treat every case without fear or favour."
"But we will treat everyone on the presumption of innocence until there is clear evidence to the contrary."
"We will be led only by evidence."
"We will not be led by prejudice and we will not have tabloid newspapers writing our script."
"(1)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0206/2004) by Mr Baltas, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, containing a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the application by Croatia for accession to the European Union."
". Mr President, as you know, on 21 February 2003 Croatia filed an application to accede to the European Union with all the formalities and responsibility required for such action."
"The Commission will express its opinion on this application by the end of April. The European Parliament, via my report, prepared a proposal for a recommendation to the Council on the application by Croatia for accession in accordance with Rule 49, paragraph 1 of the Rules of Procedure, which was endorsed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"This report required particular attention in order to be balanced and adequately substantiated, so that the initiative of the European Parliament for a recommendation to the Council would be duly considered by it and would represent the views and demands of all sides in an exemplary manner."
"I thank my honourable friends for their help in this direction."
"In brief, the main points of this report, to which Croatia must give due attention, are the following: first, the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia."
"Note is taken of the progress made towards cooperation with this international court, as well as of the remaining matters outstanding, especially now that General Gotovina has been handed over to the Court."
"Secondly, the return of refugees and displaced persons."
"Parliament attaches great importance to the honouring of this promise, which it considers to be one of the basic criteria for the accession of Croatia to the European Union."
"It notes with satisfaction the election of minority representatives to parliament, but expects more to be done to safeguard all the preconditions for the return of refugees and displaced persons, such as legal protection, housing, reconciliation and their smooth integration into Croatian society, without discrimination or fear."
"Thirdly, good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation."
"Good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation are on the right path and the report emphasises that this is a key precondition for the development of democracy in Croatia itself, as well as an example for the safeguarding of peace, stability and economic development in the area as a whole."
"Fourthly, the judicial system and administrative infrastructure."
"Note is made of the reforms and adjustments to the judicial system in accordance with that which prevails in the European Union, but exemplary application and incontestable social acceptance are expected in the interpretation of the laws, as well as in raising the authority of judges."
"Similarly, a modern administrative infrastructure is one for the correct management of Community resources, while particular attention is expected in combating any cases of corruption and in quickly serving citizens."
"Fifthly, the tripartite dialogue between Croatia, Italy and Slovenia must continue in the good spirit which surrounds it today so that all the differences and outstanding issues can be settled."
"Sixthly, freedom of expression and independence of the mass media."
"Freedom of expression and the independence of the mass media are the basic precondition to the operation of democracy and no interference in the freedom of expression in the form of state intervention is justified."
"Seventhly, free market economy."
"The progress made by Croatia with the operation of the free market is recognised and note is made of the achievements of Croatia, both in the year on year increase in gross national product over recent years and in the reduction in the level of inflation, which is close to the European Union average."
"Eighthly, new government and European orientation."
"The determination of the new government to continue the efforts of the previous government in following a European orientation is considered positive and the willingness of the new government to promote all the necessary reforms so that Croatia can advance quickly towards the objective of integration into the European Union, which it too wants, is particularly appreciated."
"We call on this House to vote in favour of this report and the amendment proposed by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which I endorse."
". Mr President, the Commission very much welcomes the Baltas report."
"We have analysed it with great attention and interest, and I am glad of the opportunity here to make a few initial comments."
"Mr Baltas makes an assessment of important political and economic issues such as minority rights, refugee returns, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, reform of the judiciary, freedom of the media, regional cooperation, economic and structural reforms – issues that are at the top of the our agenda at every meeting with the Croatian authorities."
"Although the report is destined for the Council, the Commission has taken a particular interest in it and would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Baltas and the European Parliament for this interesting assessment of Croatia."
"At this stage the Commission is still preparing its 'Opinion on Croatia’s membership application', which we hope to adopt in the coming weeks."
"The Opinion on Croatia’s application is based on more than 10 000 pages of information provided by the Croatian Government."
"We are using exactly the same criteria to evaluate this application as we did with all previous applicants."
"As in all other cases, political criteria will play a key role in this context, and Croatia must meet them before negotiations can start."
"Therefore, today the Commission is not in a position to comment in detail on all the subjects mentioned in the Baltas report."
"Parliament will receive a copy of the Commission’s Opinion when it has been adopted, it will contain our analysis of whether Croatia meets the Copenhagen Criteria and our recommendation to the Council on whether or not membership negotiations should be opened."
"The European Union is a community based on a set of shared values."
"A country must show that it adheres to them before it can start membership negotiations."
"Therefore, the assessment in the Commission’s Opinion will focus on whether Croatia respects these values of democracy, respect for the rule of law, human rights and the rights of minorities, which make up the political criteria for EU membership."
"The European Commission fully acknowledges the progress made by Croatia in the last few years."
"The political situation is stable, and democratic achievements have been consolidated."
"Regional cooperation has been strengthened."
"The economic situation is improving; growth prospects are good and, more generally, the economic outlook remains positive."
"Croatia has already started to work intensively in order to align its legislation with European law."
"At the same time, a number of important questions remain to be carefully assessed and are currently very closely monitored by the Commission: questions such as cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, refugee returns, respect for minority rights, judicial reform and regional cooperation."
"Croatia’s prospects for membership are clear, as they are for all the countries of south-eastern Europe."
"However, it needs to meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"Provided it does that clearly and unequivocally, it can expect to progress further towards eventual membership of the European family."
"– Mr President, one year ago Croatia applied for membership of the European Union with the support of all its political parties."
"We should remember that Croatia could have been joining with Slovenia on 1 May were it not for the terrible years of war that it, and its neighbour Bosnia-Herzegovina endured, and the four years of Serbian occupation of one third of its territory, which resulted in the independent young democracy taking many wrong turns."
"In the last five years, Croatia has made a clear decision for Europe and created the conditions for joining."
"I can tell the Commissioner that it has good relations with its neighbours and regional cooperation is working."
"The modernisation of its economy is under way and the economic data give cause for optimism."
"I agree with you that judicial reform is lagging behind."
"Administrative capacities could also be improved."
"Everything cannot be done in a day, however."
"Croatia is on the right road and is determined to pursue that road single-mindedly."
"The new government’s objectives include the return of refugees and/or the return of property."
"This year has already seen these ambitious objectives embodied in an agreement between the government and the Serb minority."
"It would be nice if the European Union could at last prevail upon the Republika Srpska in Bosnia-Herzegovina to take back Croatian refugees from Croatia."
"That would make housing available for the Serbs who want to return."
"The lack of employment opportunities, especially in the parts of Croatia where the Serbs used to live, is a major obstacle to their return and I hope that the CARDS programme will be able to assist here, too."
"Croatia is cooperating well with The Hague, to which, last year, the Croatian Government even opened its archives."
"Last year, too, three Croats accused of war crimes were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment in Croatia itself."
"Three weeks ago, two re-indicted generals went to The Hague voluntarily."
"Europe should not judge Croatia’s cooperation with the International Court only by the case of Ante Gotovina, who is a member of the French foreign legion, is said to have a French passport, and may be lying in the sun in Cannes or Corsica, or may well be anywhere."
"He is not in Croatia, otherwise he would already have been captured."
"To hold Croatia hostage to the Gotovina case is unjust and fails to do justice to the progress it has undeniably made."
"The Baltas report also mentions the problems concerning the border between Croatia and Slovenia."
"I believe these problems are close to being resolved."
"I would just like to make one comment about the unilateral announcement of the fisheries protection zone in the Adriatic."
"That was foolish."
"It was perfectly legal, but I think the new government is right in now seeking to put it on a sounder footing in regional cooperation with Slovenia and Italy."
"The Commission’s treatment and assessment of Croatia’s progress will send a signal to the entire region."
"Every politician I have met in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Serbia is keenly awaiting the outcome."
"They will then be able to see whether the tremendous efforts we are demanding of them for their nations will be really worthwhile."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Baltas, the rapporteur, most sincerely for his very balanced report."
"Both the country from which I come and this group to which I belong are very well disposed towards Croatia, but that does not mean that we turn a blind eye, or even two blind eyes, when it comes to assessing whether it is ready for Europe."
"I only wish the Commission would see how important it is for Croatia that we should give a positive opinion; I agree with the previous speaker totally in that respect."
"It would also send a signal to all its neighbours that the way to Europe is open to them as well as and when – and provided that – they take the necessary steps towards Europe."
"Sadly, no country in the Balkans has done so much."
"Are the problems already resolved?"
"No, they are not."
"Although Croatia has basically good relations with its neighbours, I believe there are still a few problems to be resolved with Slovenia."
"I am very pleased that there are not only good relations with neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, but that both the previous government and the present one have demonstrated that Croatia is now interested in a common Bosnia-Herzegovina and not only in the well-being of the Croatian-speaking population there."
"As far as the situation with the war criminals is concerned, I believe that Croatia has done a lot in the last few years and months to make progress here."
"I believe we must be fair and objective about this, too."
"I sometimes feel that many countries that have themselves taken longer to come to terms with their own past and their own crimes and to face up to them are making greater demands on Croatia."
"Croatia needs to know that this is a crucial issue, however, and it must therefore show every willingness to cooperate."
"Regarding the return of refugees, this has always been a very important point for us in talks with Croatian representatives and here in the European Parliament."
"I think Croatia needs to intensify its efforts to bring back all refugees, and this of course includes exchanges with neighbouring countries."
"With these things in mind, Mr President, I believe we should give a favourable reception to the Baltas report."
"Also with this in mind, I ask the Commission to be very positive in its approach to Croatia."
"– Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of Croatia’s accession to the European Union."
"It will also point the way to accession for other countries in the western Balkan region."
"Macedonia has already submitted its application."
"The ELDR Group supports Croatia in its efforts to prepare for accession to the EU and to succeed in the accession negotiations."
"At the same time we would state that we require better levels of cooperation from Croatia with the Hague Court than hitherto."
"Our group is asking for a separate vote on paragraph 1(q), which urges Member States to ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Croatia."
"Some Member States have postponed ratification precisely because they have been dissatisfied with Croatia’s levels of cooperation with the Hague Court."
"Our group thinks they should be able to consider when the agreement should be ratified themselves."
"Croatia’s accession will once again be a new step in the enlargement of the European Union."
"When Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and the five countries in the western Balkan region join the Union, the number of Member States will rise to 33."
"Moldova and Ukraine have also taken their first step towards accession, and they have been invited to the European conference."
"Enlargement works on the principle that all European countries that fulfil the conditions for accession can join the Union."
"As enlargement progresses the EU’s Wider Europe Policy and Neighbourhood Policy will become ever more important."
"The European Parliament must also get more involved in these than it has up till now."
"On the other hand, a rapidly enlarging Union must differentiate internally, employing a process of closer cooperation."
"Internal differentiation and the Wider Europe Policy will gradually allow us to create a Europe of concentric circles."
"Finally, I would like to thank my colleague Alexandros Baltas for his excellent work in drafting this report."
"– Mr President, Mr Baltas has made a very balanced recommendation to the Council with regard to Croatia's application for accession to the EU."
"It names quite categorically the main areas of persistent concern from the point of view of the EU, which are good neighbourliness, the refugee issue and cooperation with the International Yugoslavia Tribunal."
"In addition, the rapporteur has not lost sight of Zagreb's major difficulties with these objectives and its efforts towards achieving them."
"He quite rightly mentions the indispensable contribution of Croatia's neighbouring countries to a climate of mutual trust and security in the region, something that Mrs Pack also pointed out."
"In summary, Mr Baltas' report is, in my view, 'terribly' good, and I use the word 'terribly' for a reason that you will understand."
"All the more interesting were for me the rather critical reactions to the draft recommendation by a number of Croatian academic participants."
"Across the board, their comment was that 'the European Union is on each occasion asking a great deal from us, but what exactly does the average Croatian citizen stand to gain?'"
"There is no shortage of daily concerns for them – I would mention employment, education, health care and housing – but these are not addressed in Mr Baltas’ report, thorough though it otherwise is."
"Not for nothing does he ask the Council, in paragraph 1, point(s), for greater assistance for Croatia in its persisting difficulties on the road to Europe."
"This request is given an added twist by a surprising result of a poll in Croatia this week."
"No less than 82% of the interviewees are opposed to Croatia’s eventual accession to the European Union."
"Let us hope that this is only a snapshot in time, and one that will soon fade away."
"All in all, Prime Minister Sanader's pro-European course is under pressure, so what he needs is actual back-up from Brussels."
"On the other hand, Zagreb is clearly keen on integration into the Euro-Atlantic community."
"It is therefore up to the European institutions to offer Croatia a close transatlantic relationship."
"– Mr President, I would like first of all to express my pleasure that things have now got moving in connection with Croatia’s application for membership of the European Union and that there are definite prospects for the opening of negotiations."
"I can only agree with what Mrs Pack has said and confirm the great efforts Croatia is making to come closer to the European Union."
"I have followed developments in Croatia since 1995, first as a delegation chairman and then as chairman of the EU-Slovenia Joint Parliamentary Committee, and have found that steadily increasing efforts have been made in the right direction."
"Of course, things moved very hesitantly and with great difficulty in the early stages, but eventually they gained momentum."
"The new government under Ivo Sanader has really advanced by leaps and bounds, especially in policy towards minorities and the coexistence of ethnic groups."
"I say that as a representative of a minority."
"The approach taken by the new government, and by the prime minister in particular, calls for our utmost admiration."
"It could be considered an example for other countries wishing to join the EU and be held up as exemplary in terms of a new intake and new opening between majority populations and minorities of any kind."
"Positive considerations have also prevailed as a result of international arbitration in the border disputes or differences of opinion over the border in the Piran Bay."
"I believe that is the right way when both states have legitimate interests and this question need not therefore be a stumbling block any longer."
"I would therefore like to thank Mr Baltas for this good report and I hope that the Commission will do what it can to get negotiations started."
"– Mr President, I find the Baltas report essentially very well-balanced and logical."
"The situation has calmed down considerably in recent times, which is very important in that region."
"On his visit to Belgrade, President Mesic apologised to those who had suffered pain or damage at the hands of Croatian citizens."
"The Serbian President apologised in turn for the evil deeds committed by Serbian citizens against Croatians."
"It will be easier to achieve reconciliation now that these gestures have been made, even though only a few years have passed since their very bitter, hard-fought war."
"The Prime Minister, Dr Sanader, visited the Serbian minority during their Christmas holiday and then addressed the Italian minority in Italian: none of this would have been possible a few years ago."
"Even that characteristic bitterness towards Slovenia no longer exists."
"This is the context that will help to resolve the controversy surrounding arrest warrants and the return of refugees."
"If this, then, is the context, there is also a chance of reasoning with Croatia about its unilateral decision to declare part of its coastline an ecological and biological zone."
"In his report, Mr Baltas states that this unilateral decision by Croatia runs counter to the practice of dialogue and consultation, which is at the heart of efforts to manage problems which have a regional impact."
"Then, of course, there are Zagreb’s difficulties in implementing its economic and political reforms."
"We should recall that inflation between 2000 and 2002 fell from 7.4% to 2.3%, and we know what that means."
"Nevertheless, a scale published by the , measuring the results achieved by the candidate countries joining this year and in coming years, shows that the first candidate countries joining the European Union in May get an overall score of 80%, whereas Croatia is only at 50%."
"It still has a long way to go."
"I believe there is a danger, which was mentioned a little while ago, of seeing people get disappointed."
"They may be disappointed because Croatia is not joining the Union straight away, but Mr Baltas reminds us that Croatia will need much perseverance and time before it can acquire the means necessary to consolidate the rule of law and democracy."
"Thank you very much, Mr Volcic."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0207/2004) by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the situation as regards fundamental rights in the European Union (2003)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking everyone who has contributed to this work and helped to improve it."
"Since the Charter of Fundamental Rights was adopted, it has been the European Parliament’s frame of reference when drawing up its annual report on fundamental rights, a report which is an essential part of our parliamentary life."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights is effectively seen as a definitive set of guidelines."
"For 2003, however, we have taken a slightly different approach, looking at only a few articles of the Charter and comparing them with what we find in reality and practice."
"The first question we might ask is why is the European Parliament interested in fundamental rights?"
"Well, my answer is that this House is the expression of the people’s sovereignty and it is therefore bound to speak out on matters directly affecting the citizens, especially where their dignity is concerned, since its main role is to represent them and to defend their interests."
"Public freedoms and fundamental rights are enshrined in our constitutions and in our national and European laws."
"The draft European Constitution even includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights in its preamble."
"The European Parliament’s legitimacy in matters relating to fundamental rights has been strengthened by Article 7."
"It may, on the basis of a reasoned proposal, formally notify the Council where there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of principles mentioned in Article 6."
"In this respect, this report should strengthen the European Parliament’s capacity to carry out its role in monitoring fundamental rights within the EU."
"This is the fourth report."
"As you know, the report is written by a different political group every year."
"This year, I had the pleasure of preparing it."
"In this report, we have tried to gauge the effectiveness of the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to gauge their effectiveness in respect of all individuals, irrespective of gender, ethnic or cultural origin, sexual orientation, religion, handicap or status."
"Since 11 September 2001 in particular, we have seen an enormous number of measures taken at both EU and national level to combat terrorism, transnational crime and illegal immigration."
"Today, in the name of EU security, limits are being imposed on our public freedoms and fundamental rights."
"Many measures are directly or indirectly affecting a number of vulnerable groups and social movements."
"However justified the fight against crime, insecurity and terrorism may be, it should under no circumstances be allowed to undermine fundamental rights and democratic freedoms since this would threaten the very foundations of the European Union."
"We have therefore chosen to take as the report’s underlying theme the criminalisation of social movements and vulnerable groups."
"Target groups which we have identified include trade unions, support and human rights groups, migrants and refugees, victims of trafficking in human beings, Roma and gypsies, journalists, women, children and people with impaired mobility."
"My attention has been drawn to three points in particular, which I would like to outline to you briefly."
"So far as the freedom of the press is concerned, the existence of free pluralist media strengthens the principle of democracy."
"On the question of media pluralism, we have just put to the vote a report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on the risks of the violation thereof in the European Union and especially in Italy."
"I will not therefore go over the matter again, but I would like to remind you that her report refers to the provision of information to EU citizens and the duty of the media and institutions to respect the citizen’s right to be fully and objectively informed."
"The right to objective information is vulnerable to that information being politically manipulated."
"Unfortunately, we saw some examples of this in the United Kingdom at the time of the Iraq war and in France during the heat wave."
"The report shows, for example, that some governments have a virtual monopoly and that in some countries television, the private sector or the press are highly concentrated."
"The freedom of the press and unfortunately often our rights, too, are threatened by this very concentration of the media and the pressure that some journalists find themselves under when providing their information, because of their political or ideological affiliation."
"The directive will therefore have to be amended to require Member States to preserve media pluralism and strengthen the protection of confidential sources."
"I turn now to the right of asylum."
"Europe’s humanist tradition of asylum rights is being replaced by a closed-border security policy."
"Laws are not yet harmonised, a variety of national laws are often used to restrict the right of asylum and the treatment meted out in detention centres and living conditions in them are far from ideal."
"We must of course be able to guarantee the right to health and to ensure that all citizens enjoy that right."
"All rights of this nature are linked to citizenship and we are well aware that European citizenship cannot be built without these rights in today’s Europe."
"I am therefore asking you to be particularly vigilant to ensure that our rights, which are increasingly threatened, remain the only things that govern our policies."
"Finally, if the European Union is to be credible, if it is itself to respect rights and be respected, it must put its own house in order and not be afraid to respond and take action when violations occur."
". Mr President, at the outset I should say that as a past United Nations human rights fellow and indeed as a one-time chairman of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, I am particularly pleased to be here to speak on this report."
"I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on what is a fundamental report of critical importance to the Union. The report merits careful consideration."
"As the rapporteur said, if the European Union is prepared to demand high standards in the human rights area, it should also be prepared to scrutinise its own performance and deliver high standards."
"Given the wide range and nature of the report, it is not possible to address all the concerns raised, but I will endeavour to address some of the key issues."
"In recent weeks we have all been horrified by the tragic events in Madrid, and our deepest sympathies go to the victims, their families and all the people of Spain."
"As the Taoisech has already reported, a declaration on terrorism was adopted by the European Council and sets out a package of measures designed to enhance the capacity of the European Union to meet the threat of terrorism."
"We are also conscious of our obligations to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms when undertaking any counter-terrorism measures."
"There can be no compromise on these fundamental values; there is no trade-off."
"The effective suppression of terrorism necessitates respect for due processes and for the rule of law."
"The Declaration commits us to combating terrorism in accordance with the fundamental principles on which the Union is founded."
"The European Council also agreed that negotiations on the new Constitution should be resumed."
"As the Members of this House will be aware, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was discussed extensively at the European Convention, and on which there was an overwhelming consensus, is an element to be incorporated in the new Constitutional Treaty – something that we will all welcome."
"The Tampere European Council in 1999 agreed to work towards the creation of a common European Union asylum system on the basis of the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention."
"We welcome the progress made yesterday in the Justice and Home Affairs Council on the Asylum Qualifications Directive."
"Our priority is to finalise this and to reach agreement on the Procedures Directive as part of the completion of the first phase of the Common European Asylum system."
"Turning to another issue, trafficking in human beings is an appalling, exploitative and criminal practice."
"The Brussels Declaration on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, endorsed by the Council last May, provides the basis for a comprehensive five-year programme, which we are actively working towards."
"The Council has also agreed measures to give assistance to victims of trafficking through the provision of short-term residence permits to victims who cooperate with the competent authorities."
"In this context I recall the framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, which was adopted last year and which is all part of the human rights defence spectrum."
"In relation to the issue of solidarity and social exclusion, Member States have adopted national action plans in the context of the Lisbon Agenda, outlining the actions to be taken to combat social exclusion."
"The second such plan was developed in all Member States last year, following a consultation process with social cohesion interest groups."
"The European Council agreed that a high level of social cohesion was central to the Lisbon Agenda and that strategies which make a decisive impact on social exclusion and on the eradication of poverty should be reinforced."
"It focused particularly on the key role that could be played by the modernisation of social protection systems."
"We see employment as the primary route out of poverty and out of social exclusion; employment in well-paid jobs, enabling citizens to enjoy higher levels of prosperity throughout the Union."
"The European Council recognised that delivering more and better jobs was the most urgent issue to be addressed."
"It is essential to attract more people into the labour force."
"Achieving higher rates of labour force participation by women and older groups should assist in combating social exclusion and in averting the continuing higher risk of poverty experienced by these groups."
"It is also in the interest of the Community to do this in any event."
"Turning to equality issues which were addressed in the report, the overall effect of the three European Union equality directives is to require Member States to prohibit direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment on the grounds of gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation in relation to employment, self-employment or occupational and vocational training."
"Victimisation is also prohibited."
"It is important now that we move ahead to fully implement these vital protections for some of the more vulnerable groups in our society."
"Making progress on the draft directive on equality of access to the supply of goods and services has been identified as an important priority of the Irish presidency and has an impact in this area."
"The representatives of the Member States meeting within the European Council in Brussels on 13 December 2003 noted the importance of human rights data collection and analysis to assist in policy formation."
"They agreed to extend the mandate of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia to become a Human Rights Agency, and the Commission is preparing a proposal to give effect to the European Council decision."
"On free movement within the Union, I would like to record the adoption of the directive on long-term resident status for third country nationals. This opens the possibility to access long-term resident status after five years of legal residency and the recognition of equality of treatment in a series of aspects of social and economic life."
"Given some of the wilder statements in some of the media referred to by the rapporteur about issues relating to free movement, this is a very welcome development."
"On a personal note I would like to mention in particular that there is a reference in paragraph 155 to judicial delays."
"I have to say to the rapporteur that I was most impressed by the fact that an Irish case is cited there."
"It is a case in which I myself was involved and the delays there were, in my view, unforgivable."
"I have noted with interest the question of participation in European and local elections and the democratic deficit."
"As we approach the European elections, it is in all of our interests to encourage and to ensure the highest possible turnout of all eligible voters."
"Participation is at the very heart of democracy."
"Unfortunately, it is clear from public opinion surveys, poor voter turnout in European Union elections and media reporting that many Europeans feel disconnected from the European Union and consider that they are not sufficiently informed about the EU."
"For this reason the presidency has decided to convene a Ministerial Conference on Communicating Europe which takes place next week."
"The Conference will have two key objectives: to discuss how people might be better informed about the European Union and to assess how we might promote greater engagement by all Europeans in deciding how our Union develops and moves ahead."
"Once again I would like to thank you for the opportunity to participate in this debate and, on a personal level, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on what I regard as a very fine and an extremely significant report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to pay tribute to Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs for an excellent report that bears clear witness to Parliament’s continuing efforts to establish a genuine policy of fundamental rights within the European Union, which we want to build together."
"Once again, this document is based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, although the rapporteur has chosen a subject-based overview of the Charter, analysing the criminalisation of vulnerable social movements and groups."
"In the context of the fight against terrorism, which is, unfortunately, a highly topical subject again, and one that affects us all deeply, we must ensure that fundamental rights and public freedoms are respected."
"I can assure you that I cherish this principle and I hope that after the tragic events of 11 March in Madrid we shall be able to overcome some of the difficulties encountered in the past and adopt legal rules for the protection of individuals, including the common procedural guarantees in the matter of criminal procedure that are essential for building mutual trust and applying the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions."
"The measures taken to protect democracy and the rule of law in Europe against all forms of crime and against terrorism must strike a clear balance between the protection of fundamental rights – especially the rights to security and freedom, which are inseparable – on the one hand and social protection measures on the other."
"Clearly, the European Union has reached a very important juncture so far as the protection of fundamental rights is concerned."
"By enlarging, laying down its constitutional rules and developing an area of freedom, security and justice, it is about to define its true identity."
"Your report serves a very important purpose, namely to monitor the observance of fundamental rights by the Member States, which is very important in itself, and also by the European institutions."
"The report will also help to promote fundamental rights, and that is essential for the future."
"All of your recommendations to the Commission will be looked at very closely to ensure that they are acted upon in the most appropriate way."
"I shall now address a few points in greater detail."
"First of all, the Network of Independent Experts on Fundamental Rights has just completed its report for the year 2003."
"The Commission has just received the final version of this report, which will be forwarded to you officially as quickly as possible."
"I would like to emphasise that in response to Parliament’s request made last year, the Network has this year sent us the 25 national reports on which the summary report on the whole Network is based."
"Like the Network’s first report, the 2003 report, which expresses the views only of the Network of Independent Experts and not those of the Commission, focuses not only on a number of concerns relating to respect for fundamental rights but also, it must be said, on positive aspects, in particular the good practices developed by some Member States that might be the inspiration for similar solutions in others."
"The Network of Experts is anxious to preserve the link between the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is their benchmark, and the more general trends in international human rights law, in particular changes to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The Network’s report covers an enormous range of issues."
"The Network stresses the contribution that the EU can make, in exercising its powers in criminal matters, towards safeguarding fundamental rights in several respects, for example in the fight against racism and xenophobia, the fight against trafficking in human beings or the fight against impunity for serious crimes under international law."
"The Network makes valuable comments on the development of asylum policy in the Member States and in the EU’s instruments."
"In this connection, Mr Roche has just pointed out that the Justice and Home Affairs Council reached agreement yesterday on a vital directive bringing the definition of refugee into line with the 1951 Geneva Convention, approximating the systems of subsidiary protection in all the Union’s Member States and covering the crucial and delicate question of persecution by non-State agents."
"The Network’s report also expresses concerns about the slowness with which European law is adapting to changes in the laws of some Member States concerning the definition of the family."
"I turn now to the question of the Human Rights Agency."
"As Mr Roche has just reminded us, the December European Council decided to extend the mandate of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia to make it a Human Rights Agency."
"The creation of a Human Rights Agency has also been called for by this House, in Mrs Swiebel’s report on basic rights in the European Union in 2001, for example."
"The Commission had already begun to consider whether it was appropriate to create an agency of that kind."
"The idea was also put forward in the Commission communication on Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, which we presented to Parliament last October."
"Around July, the Commission will be presenting a discussion paper so that the idea of setting up a Human Rights Agency can be the subject of a wide-ranging public debate."
"We believe the agency’s creation should be preceded by a wider debate on its aims and how it should operate."
"To allow the next Parliament to take part in the discussion, the dialogue with civil society will continue until October and will end with a Commission-organised public hearing, on the basis of which we intend submitting a draft regulation on the new agency in spring 2005."
"I cannot commit myself on the substance of the regulation at present, but I can assure you that the agency’s creation will in no way compromise the study of racism and xenophobia; these will continue to be important pillars of the agency’s activities, and of its political visibility."
"It cannot be otherwise when fears of growing racism and xenophobia are again being felt in Europe, as evidenced by the Vienna Monitoring Centre’s work and, in particular its reports on anti-semitism, which will be presented to Parliament today."
"It is also clear that the agency’s creation must not be allowed to upset the existing institutional balance."
"Finally, we are not planning to extend the agency’s mandate beyond the territory of the European Union for the time being."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, European policy on fundamental rights is taking shape."
"The year 2000 saw the proclamation of the Charter and, following the European Parliament’s recommendation, in 2002 we set up the Network of Experts, which I mentioned earlier."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Nice was an important staging post for the application of Article 6 and Article 7 of the Treaty."
"The new constitutional treaty will make the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding and will allow the Union to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"In its communication on Article 7, the Commission presented an outline analysis of the conditions for applying that article in the future, with the emphasis on prevention; this will involve, inter alia, cooperation between the institutions and with the Member Sates and dialogue with civil society."
"The future of European integration depends on the common values of fundamental rights, the rule of law and democratic institutions."
"All activities in the field of justice and internal affairs must be rooted in those common values."
"Thought will have to be given to how the internal and external dimensions of human rights can be addressed coherently."
"I am firmly convinced that with the Constitution we are profoundly changing the Union’s legal and political environment."
"I hope that, together, the Commission and Parliament will be on the right road towards building a genuine fundamental rights policy within the European Union."
". Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Boumediene-Thiery on her far-reaching report."
"I should record that in many ways my party is not altogether happy with the Charter of Fundamental Rights as it came in and, especially in view of what we have heard from both the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, we have concerns that it could become yet another framework for regulation and bureaucracy, when common sense and good manners should be allowed to have their individual way."
"With the imminence of our elections, we are all aware that the largest party in Europe is now the apathy party."
"We are very conscious that the forecasts for turnout in June are going to be even lower than in the past."
"A major task facing the next Parliament will be to bring the citizens of the new Europe to a greater understanding of, and involvement with, the institutions."
"And they are institutions, not institutions."
"There are a number of methods by which citizens can make their voices heard."
"They can apply directly to their elected national governments, which make up the Council; to their Commissioner nominated by their elected government; to us, as elected representatives; to the European Ombudsman; and also to the Committee on Petitions of this Parliament."
"It is on behalf of that committee that I have submitted an opinion on this report."
"We in the Committee on Petitions have noticed how often we are able to sort out things which should have been sorted out at a national, or even sometimes a regional, level."
"However, the continuing existence of the Committee on Petitions provides a very useful safety valve and stopgap, and, uniquely among Parliament's committees, its work will continue over the interregnum into the new Parliament."
"Some of you may have noticed that there is a work of art – I assume it is a work of art – in the centre of the tower building courtyard: a glass globe, approximately two metres in diameter."
"From a distance it seems simple and transparent, but the closer you get to it, the more complicated the construction appears and the more opaque the surface."
"This is a superb, but ironic, symbol of both this Parliament and the European Union."
"I therefore suggest that it is the job of the new House and the new Commission to make the present institutions work and to simplify their relationships with citizens."
"This would do much to meet the objectives laid out by the President-in-Office and to ensure that we, when we are re-elected, have the support of our citizens."
"Mr President, this report, on which I should like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, confirms the pattern of human rights violations and human rights problems in the European Union, which we have also identified in the four previous reports during the life of this Parliament."
"Misconduct on the part of government personnel and police officials, conditions in prisons, unequal treatment, discrimination, racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and particularly recently, the increasingly-threatened erosion of civil rights, such as the rights of suspects, the presumption of innocence, and last but not least, privacy – all of this under the guise of the fight against terrorism."
"Mrs Karamanou will say something more about this in a moment."
"All in all, these reports, and particularly the last one by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, prompt us to reconsider what should be the political response of the European institutions to all of this."
"That is why I am especially pleased that Minister Roche, present here on behalf of the Irish Presidency, has stated in no uncertain terms that the European Union must be prepared to search its own heart."
"I very much appreciate this statement."
"Other presidencies have avoided the issue or have failed to turn up at all to debates of this kind, and it appears to me that such honesty should be very much appreciated, so all honour to him for that."
"Nevertheless, we should question whether the EU can, as yet, be considered to possess a fully-fledged human rights policy."
"The fact is that it does not."
"We are moving in the right direction, but what we have at the moment is fragments and building blocks all the same."
"In a relatively short space of time, over the past five years, important normative and institutional parameters have been moved."
"As various speakers have already pointed out, although changes have been made, all of these combined efforts still have not led to a coherent human rights policy."
"Allow me to outline the various points in the remaining time that is allocated to me."
"First of all, we have a Charter which explicitly states the human rights obligations of the Member States."
"That is truly wonderful."
"Secondly, we have a European Parliament which uses this Charter as a basis for its reports."
"That too is commendable, because that makes the process systematic and verifiable."
"Thirdly, as the Commissioner rightly pointed out, there is a network, and that has not only made the reporting, but also the analysis and advice-giving much more professional."
"We should certainly continue down this road, for that is a major achievement."
"Fourthly, we have Article 7 of the Treaty, to which the Council in Nice added a warning mechanism."
"That too is enormous progress, because to put it bluntly, it takes more than an atom bomb to wage war."
"Fifthly, we have received the Commission’s communication of October 2003, which fleshed out this revised Article 7."
"As a result, we know what the Commission thinks about how this should be handled, although we are still waiting for the Council’s opinion on this Commission communication."
"I assume that Parliament will be discussing it during the next session."
"As the Commissioner has already pointed out, the sixth building block we have is the Human Rights Agency."
"This is the outcome of a decision reached by the Council back in December."
"I am pleased that it has made a first step in the course of decision-making to be followed."
"I will contribute to this myself, as far as I am able to do so."
"Seventhly, this has also been mentioned, we will soon have a Constitution in which the article on values will be reinforced and in which the Charter will be included."
"That is all wonderful, but they are mere building blocks, and do not yet form a coherent whole."
"What we really need is a coherent human rights policy covering all goals, institutions, instruments and finances."
"Moreover, I should very much like clarity in the question as to what extent the human rights problems in one Member State are actually an issue for the European Union as a whole, so that countries and Member States, and we too, dare to call each other to account much more honestly than we have done to date."
"Let me once again say how delighted I am with the contributions by Mr Roche, on behalf of the presidency, and by Commissioner Vitorino."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Roche, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Boumediene-Thiery for her good work on an important report."
"What is the situation like in the EU-15, which is a Union founded on the equal value of all human beings, humanism, tolerance and human dignity?"
"I should think that the vast majority of us in this House can see cracks in the EU façade."
"Welcome to our Union: refugees are insulted and excluded and run the risk of losing their lives on the way to a better life in Europe."
"An important step towards a common policy on refugees was taken yesterday, as the Minister said, but it has been a long time in coming, and the proposals do not go far enough."
"Eight hundred thousand women and children are bought and sold as commodities in a loathsome sex trade."
"Women suffer genital mutilation, risk being forced into marriage and suffer abuse daily just for being women."
"Freedom of the media and of expression are being reduced."
"Homosexuals suffer discrimination."
"Anti-semitism is on the increase, and Jews are hearing the same slogans that resounded through Europe in the 1930s."
"There is evidence of hatred and violence in the report being presented today."
"Racism and implacability towards immigrants are growing."
"Millions of immigrants are excluded from society."
"Muslims are being persecuted."
"Islamic fundamentalism is growing strong in the suburbs of our towns and cities."
"Indeed, it was in our Union that 190 ordinary Spaniards lost their lives on their way to work on an ordinary day."
"It is true to say that freedom has never been stronger than this spring, when Europe is united and old wounds are healed."
"At the same time, however, we know that our EU-15 will bring many shortcomings along with it into the new EU on 1 May 2004."
"I should like to conclude by saying that it is regrettable that virtually all Member States are introducing restrictions on the new Member States."
"European leaders should have been able to prevent this together by being better prepared and having adapted the acquis communautaire in time."
"Many of our new friends are justifiably disappointed by this."
"In conclusion, I should like to say that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party requests the support of the House for two amendments on the European arrest warrant and the French ban on headscarves."
"– Mr President, this report on the situation as regards fundamental rights in the European Union contains references to a large number of abuses in different areas."
"In view of the recent meeting of justice and home affairs ministers and their messages, I would like to concentrate on the protection of refugees, that is on Article 18 (Right of asylum) and Article 19 (Protection in the event of removal, expulsion or extradition) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The report, on which I sincerely congratulate the rapporteur, accuses the Member States of so far being unable to agree on a directive on asylum procedures and the status of refugees."
"This very week, the home affairs ministers have now agreed to this."
"It is good that the new directive will also give people who are fleeing their homelands because of persecution by non-state agents recognised status in all EU countries."
"That is something that I and many non-governmental organisations and citizens have worked for."
"At the behest of my government, unfortunately, refugees – but not victims of political persecution – are being disadvantaged when it comes to access to the employment market."
"I cannot see any objective reason for that and I also think it is counterproductive economically because refugees with so-called subsidiary protection will be forced to work illegally in order to survive."
"Those who preach about fundamental and human rights to the outside world must also look at their own performance and not be always looking only at ways their neighbours could improve."
"That is right and I am glad the President-in-Office also sees it that way."
"Europe’s own record on migration and asylum is in my opinion downright shameful, as the report clearly shows."
"I would like to draw particular attention to the fact that people who have made their lives here in the European Union still do not have the right to vote, even though the European Parliament has called for it on many occasions."
"I also want to point out that the concept of a safe third country will make it virtually impossible for refugees to enter the European Union legally in future."
"The only way to get asylum here will be to jump out over Europe with a parachute."
"I would therefore like us in Europe to have the courage to make a change of policy so that we will not again have a report criticising the European Union for so many different serious violations of human rights."
"– Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Boumediene-Thiery on the work she has done, which was also very important for the subsequent debate that took place in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I feel I must point something out: for years now this annual report has been getting more and more like a copy of itself."
"We see persistent infringements, always of the same rights; there is always the same debate, but we never get to the crucial point raised by Mrs Swiebel."
"Do the Commission and the Council really want respect for fundamental human rights to be a proper policy?"
"We expect a reply to this."
"Should the reply be, however, that we already have Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, then you must understand right now that that is a false answer."
"Even though the conditions for implementing it exist, Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union has never been implemented and never will be in an institutional context in which the European Commission, for obvious reasons, will never have the strength to go against one of the Member States."
"Therefore, in view of the recurrent infringements denounced in these reports and in the absence of sanctions, it is inevitable that we shall yet again see this picture deteriorate even further next year."
"The so-called counter-terrorism initiatives should be added to all this."
"In recent times, the only practical consequence of all the initiatives taken by the Council, or which the Council would like to take, despite their stated purpose of fighting terrorism, has in fact been to repress citizen’s freedoms."
"As regards the only truly useful initiative, that of breathing life into a European intelligence agency, we have read the statements by the Italian Minister for Internal Affairs saying that that is not possible because each national agency is possessive about its own data."
"If this is how the European Union protects its citizens from the dangers of terrorism, how can it ever have the strength and the ability to protect its own citizens from the infringements committed against them by the Member States themselves?"
"Mr President, I would like to start by echoing the point made by Minister Roche in his introduction that it is to the European Union's enormous credit that we can produce this critical self-appraisal, this report on human rights within the EU."
"It is very easy to criticise other parts of the world; it is more difficult, and to our credit, that we are prepared to look within the European Union, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the governments working together to make a more democratic institution – not by any stretch of the imagination a super-state that needs to be feared, as we might read in the papers."
"As Commissioner Vitorino quite rightly said, there are many positive points that we can take on board from this; and we can build on good practice from one country to another."
"I also agreed both with him and with Minister Roche when they spoke of the need to develop a modern interpretation of the Geneva Convention on refugees."
"The situation today is different from the post-war era of 1951, but the challenges may be similar, even if the practicalities will be different."
"We all need to cooperate if we are to implement its principles."
"Nothing could be more important for an EU of 25 countries than to have a common European policy on immigration and, alongside but separate, a common European policy for asylum."
"The rapporteur has referred to the need for this and I commend her on her work."
"As she says, it must not be based on the lowest common denominator; rather, a system that will gain the most respect and be the least subject to criticism will be based on the highest possible standards, will respect families, and will respect human rights."
"Mr President, I too share many of the views and proposals put forward by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery."
"To be brief, I should like to confine myself to the worries associated with the ultra-security-conscious approach that has just been confirmed by the last European Council."
"Following the American model, this positioning is dangerous and menacing; more to the point, it does not get to the roots of terrorism."
"Under the guise of fighting this curse, the legislation piling up in each of our countries is already giving rise to new infringements of human rights."
"I am thinking, for example, of the so-called preventative measures concerning the issue of visas in Germany, of the measures authorising the quasi-deportation of twenty-six thousand people in the Netherlands, of the measures in France that have brought about an increase in expulsions of more than a third in comparison with the start of 2003."
"The European position is getting further and further away from the universal principles of asylum and solidarity."
"Have not the Heads of State just flouted these principles by authorising de facto, as from 2005, the keeping of systematic records on all people living in Europe?"
"The same attitude prevails in the draft directives aimed at harmonising asylum policy."
"Should we not therefore be worried, as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has just made clear, about the concept of safe third countries to which refugees can be passed on without any certainty about their safety?"
"Finally, the same can be said of the European charters, which our Parliament has fortunately just rejected."
"On the contrary, the future of human rights in Europe will involve a genuine policy of welcome, equality of rights, including the right for everyone to vote and to be elected in all elections, and complete respect for the freedom of expression, including freedom of association."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament has discussed a whole raft of reports on constitutional rights."
"On every occasion, it is remarkable how each rapporteur manages to outshine their predecessors in criminalising millions of Europeans who are faced with the tragic effects of unbridled immigration."
"It will not do to blame the few politicians and governments who make timid attempts to do something about the huge implications of asylum abuse, for a lack of solidarity."
"It is intellectually unfair to systematically fling the reproach of racism and xenophobia in the face of politicians who believe that our densely populated societies can no longer deal with fresh waves of immigration without catastrophic social effects."
"Less than two weeks ago, young immigrant gangs caused senseless destruction to various private properties here in Strasbourg, and they have done the same thing every Christmas for years."
"Maybe some rapporteur might be able to include in their report on constitutional rights a paragraph on the rights – to physical integrity, safety and ownership – of the Europeans who live on the outskirts of our cities."
"It would be more useful than the umpteenth hollow and irrelevant document about how badly we as Europeans tend to treat our fellow citizens."
"– Mr President, it is true that this report on the situation as regards fundamental rights in the European Union is in danger of becoming almost a routine appointment. So as not to repeat what has already been said on other occasions or by other Members, I shall therefore focus my speech on three topics in particular."
"The first, inevitably, is the family."
"Speaking not only for myself but also on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I strongly reject paragraphs 102 and 103, which yet again call repeatedly for legal recognition of cohabiting couples, even same-sex ones."
"We also reject Amendment No 157, which adds to this demand the right even to be able to adopt children normally."
"It seems that some people will never learn the old lesson that on this issue it is pointless to attempt to go against the European Treaty, which clearly attributes to the Member States the power, the competence and the sovereignty to decide on this sensitive issue themselves."
"A second topic that I should like to address is that of press freedom and pluralism, which only yesterday was the subject of a heated debate in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Once again, in language quite unsuitable for this House, paragraph 63 says that in Italy the notion of pluralism is trampled underfoot with the greatest cynicism."
"Come on, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, that is a sentence for an electoral manifesto, not for a debate in the European Parliament!"
"We therefore strongly reject Amendments Nos 84, 85 and 86, which reiterate this misunderstanding and in the end put Italy in the firing line all by itself, as if all media problems were concentrated in our country."
"They start, it is true, with assumptions we can all share, such as the criteria of pluralism, freedom and access to the press for all, but then they reach conclusions so restricted to the individual case of Italy that they end up discrediting all their noble assumptions as well."
"You just have to read the report by Reporters Without Borders, who certainly did not get together within the Italian Prime Minister’s organisation but are, as you know, an organisation of left-wing journalists."
"They carried out some research in Italy in April 2003, which they later published, in which they arrive at very different conclusions from those that characterise yesterday’s unbelievable report from the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, with its even more unbelievable amendments. For example, there is a conflict of interests in Italy, it is true, but it is being resolved these days – I might say right now as we speak – in the Italian Parliament, the only forum where this issue can be discussed seriously."
"A reform bill is on the point of being passed, a reform that the Italian left never had the courage or even the ability to propose during their seven years in government."
"Reporters Without Borders say that the press in Italy – I am quoting them directly: I am not making this up – is ‘free and pluralistic, although weakened by the hegemony of television’."
"In contrast to what happened yesterday in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, they do not talk about censorship or media tyranny."
"On the political orientation of television news broadcasts, both public and private, they write that they are ‘substantially balanced’; the only explicit criticism is the distancing from the screen of public figures like Mr Biagi, Mr Santoro and Mr Luttazzi, whom – I assure you if you do not know them – nobody in Italy misses, except perhaps the political bosses who pay them."
"A final word, this time, after so many negatives, to recommend the adoption of Amendment No 199, tabled by Mr Borghezio and myself, on the compensation due to Italian military detainees for the forced labour they did in Germany between 1943 and 1945."
"Only the Italians have not been compensated."
"We call on Germany to compensate those Italian citizens who worked hard against their will in factories and labour camps, even though it is now really very late."
"I should like to tell Mr Schroeder to do so quickly, because the youngest of them is 80 years old, and 10% of them die each year that passes."
"Mr President, the annual report on fundamental rights comes along at a difficult time, marked by the recent terrorist attack on Spain and the violation of the right to life of dozens of innocent people."
"At the recent European Council, discussions and decisions unfortunately focused on the after-effects and failed to address the essence and causes of the new situation created by the war against democracy, as President Pat Cox called terrorism."
"I am certain that the repressive measures being promoted not only fail to get to the root of the evil, the massive inequalities and discriminations in the modern world, but also threaten to sweep away fundamental freedoms and democratic rights, thereby strengthening the objectives of terrorism from another quarter."
"In other words, we are being driven with mathematical precision into a sorry situation, in which the protection of personal data will be non-existent and privacy will be permanently under the scrutiny of big brother."
"Terrorism is being used as an alibi to increase spending on security and convert modern democracies into autocratic police states in which every citizen is treated as a potential terrorist."
"While all this is happening on the terrorist front, another terrible crime being committed on a daily basis against thousands of women and children in the form of a modern slave trade has recently been added to our political agenda."
"Fundamental rights and democratic freedoms in the European Union are indeed under serious threat."
"Mr President, this annual report on human rights policy draws attention to the increasing numbers of infringements that take place in the EU, and makes concrete proposals on how this situation might be resolved."
"The report raises many valid points, of which I should like to highlight the reference that it makes to the fact that many women are denied the right to abortion in the EU, as is currently the case in Portugal, where, indeed, they are still subject to criminal proceedings."
"I applaud the rapporteur when she calls on the Member States to guarantee access for all women, including young, poor and immigrant women, to safe and legal abortion, emergency contraception, affordable reproductive and sexual health services and sex education."
"I hope that the Portuguese Government – and the prevailing political climate in my country – will finally take this proposal on board."
"I should also like to highlight the way in which the report condemns all forms of violence against women and calls on Member States to combat and eliminate violence against women and children in Europe."
"Mr President, I thank the rapporteur mainly for her continuous commitment to human rights."
"However, in the report there is no recognition of a crucial and urgent issue – the torture of Basque political detainees."
"Yesterday, a young girl, Ainara Gorostiaga, was released on the orders of the Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzón, after spending two years in prison."
"She had been kept incommunicado from February 2002."
"Miss Gorostiaga admitted all the charges against her, but then retracted, saying that the statement had been extracted under torture."
"Judge Baltasar Garzón now recognises that she is not guilty."
"Three other youngsters have already been released because there was no evidence against them either."
"Two years incommunicado because of torture!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, ?"
"– Mr President, if good intentions and earnest words could change the world, Mrs Boumedienne-Thiery’s congenial report would constitute a revolution."
"When, however, I read about all these rights couched in long words, I am led to think about a Danish politician who, back home in our windswept country, got elected on a programme designed to give a boost to cycle paths."
"It is the same refrain that underlies this report, namely the notion that rights are derived from words. In fact, rights are derived from social practice, struggle and political activity."
"What also strikes me in this report is a detail of the tribute paid to the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I have nothing against rights – quite the contrary – but why was the European Union as such not allowed to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights?"
"Its doing so would have achieved the same result."
"The reason is that there is another agenda whereby these rights are, to the very greatest degree, concerned with the actual process of integration, and it is this duplicity in the agenda that prompts me to make this observation."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the hypocrisy of the talk about fundamental rights in this House can hardly be surpassed, especially when it comes from the Right."
"When the Council and governments initiate more and more new surveillance programmes, plunging thousands of migrants into sheer despair with their Fortress Europe policy, leaving them stuck at borders, allowing them to drown at sea, and the few that make it are then interned in the EU only to be removed again as soon as possible, the European Parliament, which claims to be the guardian of fundamental and human rights, actually applauds."
"Unfortunately, the reality looks rather different to all those who are deprived of their most elementary civil rights."
"State, police and racist violence are everyday occurrences in the European Union’s capitalist society."
"The blatant justification of torture in Germany by numerous politicians and representatives of the judiciary and police in 2003 is a specific example of this."
"Unfortunately, when my draft resolution condemning this justification of torture was rejected in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, this was brought about by those groups that are now defending their political friends."
". Mr President, the debate was very interesting."
"I concur with the view put forward by many that our Union is rooted in a shared commitment to freedom, human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law."
"Our Union must be an exemplar in all of those areas, otherwise we are an exercise in hypocrisy."
"I mentioned that in the Tampere programme the Council reaffirmed the importance that the Union and the Member States attach to the absolute right to seek asylum, mentioned by several Members."
"It agreed to work towards the establishment of a common European asylum system."
"That is very important and absolutely correct."
"Mr Evans, for example, said that the system we establish must have clarity."
"He is absolutely correct in that regard."
"Given the debate that has been raging in a number of Member States, I want to touch upon the issue of migration, an issue raised by a number of Members."
"There is a disturbing rise in xenophobic comment, particularly in some parts of the popular media."
"Europe is open to migration."
"Indeed migration into Europe is both necessary and desirable, along with migration within Europe."
"The development of a common EU migration policy is therefore of particular importance."
"Both Mr Evans and Ms Kaufmann touched upon this."
"It is important that we have a clear-cut policy on legal migration in order to help put an end to some of the disturbing hysteria."
"The Irish presidency will continue to support an initiative by the Commission to combat trafficking in human beings, especially bearing in mind the work of the expert group in this area and the Brussels Declaration."
"Quite a number of speakers made reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the draft Constitutional Treaty."
"It strikes me that the Charter of Fundamental Rights elements in the draft Constitutional Treaty are one of the great pillars on which that Treaty is based."
"The Charter provides an additional safeguard for citizens of the Union in their dealings with the institutions of the Union or those of Member States when they apply Union law."
"I simply cannot understand how this can be portrayed as anything other than positive."
"I was therefore surprised by the contribution by the Earl of Stockton in this regard."
"I do not think it is correct to portray the Charter as a negative; it is positive in every regard."
"The Earl of Stockton made the point that common sense and good manners are the best protection."
"Perhaps he would be right if we lived in an ideal world, but we do not."
"We live in a less than perfect world."
"My personal experience is that common sense and good manners have failed us on more than one occasion."
"Several Members made reference to the importance of a free press in the protection of civil liberties."
"A free press is fundamental to the protection of civil liberties."
"The same Members, however, mentioned concerns about excessive concentration."
"Concentration is a fact of life right across the European Union, and to the extent that it interferes with the free exercise of comment or dulls the capacity of a free press to act as a protector of all our liberties, such concentration is a cause for concern."
"I thank Members for the very interesting and stimulating debate."
"I also want to thank Members for the kind words they had to say about the Irish presidency."
"I can assure you that the presidency, in carrying forward the Council's work, will give careful consideration to the points that have been made today."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on this report."
"We may not agree with every single word and every comment in the report, but it is incredibly important that we hold a mirror up to ourselves from time to time to see if we can meet our own high standards."
"This report certainly helps in that regard."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as this debate and this report both clearly demonstrate, fundamental rights unfortunately continue to be violated in the EU."
"I feel, however, that for Members of this House, who are soon to go before the electorate in elections that are especially important for the EU’s future, it is worth recalling that the extraordinarygains of the past five years in the area of human rights are something to be proud of and may, indeed, encourage the citizens to take part in the electoral process, given the prospects for establishing a European policy on fundamental rights."
"The Convention that approved the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Parliament’s annual role in identifying problems in fundamental rights – sometimes a highly ideological debate, but certainly always a topical one – the amendment of Article 7 of the Treaty of Nice, the fact that a Fundamental Rights Agency has been established and, as the President-in-Office of the Council Mr Roche has just said, the prospect of giving the Charter of Fundamental Rights a central role in the draft Constitutional Treaty, constitute, in my view, a range of aspects that will show the citizens that this body, which they elect directly, has always placed the issue of fundamental rights at the forefront of political debate and activity."
"My second observation concerns the references made to asylum policy."
"We cannot hide the fact that Member States have differences that are sometimes difficult to surmount, and that sometimes the price we have to pay to get over these differences is an agreement based on the lowest common denominator."
"We have always viewed such agreements as one part of a gradual definition of asylum policy and migration."
"We cannot close our eyes to this, but let us not be defeatist."
"Today, I must confess – and it pains me to say this – the day after the Council of Ministers finally adopted a directive defining the concept of refugee, aligning systems of subsidiary protection and recognising that non-State agents can be agents of persecution, in which case refugee status can also be granted; we welcome this directive, which contains excellent proposals in the area of international protection and is a major step forward in defining a European concept of asylum."
"Let us, today at least, not be defeatist and let us recognise the positive elements of the steps that have been taken."
"My third comment concerns the protection of privacy and fundamental rights in the war on terror."
"We are not in the process of creating an Orwellian world."
"It cannot be denied that we face a threat and in order to protect our open way of life we must prevent terrorism and protect our citizens."
"To this end, we must make use of the technology that proves to be the most appropriate."
"We must not tilt at windmills, nor must we fight technology merely for the sake of it."
"What we must do is ensure that this technology is used in accordance with the law and the required safeguards as regards privacy and guarantees of fundamental rights."
"This is the challenge facing us, and Parliament must, accordingly, be involved in defining the legal rules governing the introduction of biometric data on passports and visas, and of data cross-checking in the area of security."
"Lastly, the key frame of reference of the policy of protecting fundamental rights in the EU is the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but is not solely confined to the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"We do not wish to be cut off from the general development of the protection of fundamental rights across Europe as a whole, notably in the scope of the Council."
"There is, therefore, no conflict between conferring constitutional status on the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights and at the same time advocating that the EU should join the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The future European Constitution points in this direction."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at12 noon."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the World Bank Extractive Industries Review."
". Mr President, this is an interesting debate, because we are discussing a report of the World Bank."
"The Extractive Industries Review launched by the World Bank Group in 2001 will guide the Bank’s involvement in the oil, gas and mining sectors."
"The consultative process is a significant element of the Group’s overall review of its activities in this area."
"It is important to note that the result of this initiative – in the form of the comprehensive consultation report produced by the review team, led by Dr Salim – is being examined by the World Bank, and its response to that review is awaited."
"So in a sense, we are discussing something that is a work in progress."
"The process must be allowed to take its course in view of the significant recommendations in the review."
"The importance of protecting and managing the resource base of economic and social development was reaffirmed by Heads of State and Government at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002."
"Raw materials, such as minerals and petroleum, provide the foundations for economic growth and well-being, both in industry and in our everyday lives."
"They are essential in manufacturing, transport, heating and other activities and, most important of all, they are essential in the countries in which the extractive activity takes place."
"While mineral extraction makes a substantial contribution to economic development, the benefits must be balanced by measures to foster the environmental and social pillars of sustainable development through good governance."
"This is the area most Members will probably be concerned about, because good governance has not always been present."
"In recognition of the need to balance these demands, actions were agreed in relation to managing the natural resource base in a sustainable and integrated manner."
"The World Bank is not alone in recognising the need to address all elements of sustainable development."
"In many ways this review parallels work carried out by the European Union in recent years, such as strengthening the governance of mining through, for example, amendment of the Seveso Directive and a proposed new directive on the management of extractive industry waste – an issue that is of concern right across the Union."
"The European Union is also taking forward policy on sustainable development through initiatives such as the planned Thematic Strategy on Sustainable Use of Natural Resources."
"At its meeting on 2 March, the Council of Environment Ministers gave broad policy orientations in relation to the future development of the Thematic Strategy."
"The Extractive Industry Review recognises the potential contribution of mining and petroleum to the World Bank’s primary mandate – i.e. the alleviation of poverty – and proposes a considerable number of measures in this regard."
"They merit some detailed consideration."
"I note also that the World Bank has endorsed the Transparency Initiative launched at the Johannesburg Summit."
"This is a particularly important initiative."
"This, again, is a complex issue and there is a need for greater clarity on how taxes and royalties for such operations are distributed."
"I should also say that there is probably a need to consider whether they are properly or appropriately distributed – but that is for another time."
"Detailed environmental protection measures in the Extractive Industries Review include proposals such as closure planning and guidelines on tailings management in extractive industries."
"In many ways these reflect concerns that we are also addressing."
"The European Union guidance note on best available techniques for mining wastes is very advanced and will set out best practice in this area."
"Many local factors, such as climatic conditions, determine the most appropriate ways to mitigate potential adverse impacts."
"Nevertheless, our work in Europe will make a useful contribution to better environmental practice and standards in managing mining waste, as well as the Cyanide Code of Practice developed by the UNEP through multi-stakeholder consultation and participation."
"We support the conclusions of the Johannesburg Summit and the Plan of Implementation, including the specific commitments in relation to the mining, minerals, metals and energy sectors."
"We also support the promotion of corporate responsibility and accountability, and the exchange of best practices in the context of sustainable development."
"Our position on these issues is clear and, I expect, well known to all interests, including the World Bank."
"Nonetheless, our interests and concerns in those areas are worth underlining and restating."
"Climate change remains one of the most significant environmental concerns for the Union."
"The Union remains fully committed, for example, to delivering on the Kyoto Protocol target."
"As parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and ratifiers of the Kyoto Protocol, the European Community and its Member States are eager to ensure that the activities of the World Bank are in harmony with the European Union’s objective of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere at safe levels."
"According to the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global emissions of greenhouse gases will need to be drastically cut over the rest of this century if this goal is to be achieved."
"The recommendations of the Extractive Industries Review in this regard are consistent with a recognised need to move to less carbon-intensive sources of energy."
"The promotion of cleaner and less greenhouse-gas-emitting energy sources in developing countries, with a particular focus on the promotion of renewable sources of energy, are in keeping with meeting the objectives of the EU’s long-term climate change objectives."
"In conclusion, we look forward to the response of the World Bank to this review."
"As I said, the response is still forthcoming."
"We welcome the wide-ranging and transparent nature of the consultation involved in this process and appreciate that the work now under way by the Bank is well informed by Dr Salim's report."
"The European Union’s progressive approach to sustainable development is well known, and we also anticipate a response from the World Bank that will be consistent with its overall mission, in particular in poverty reduction and the promotion of sustainable development."
". Mr President, the Extractive Industries Review, commissioned by the World Bank, is an important report and its recommendations should be carefully examined by the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Commission."
"The Commission is a grant donor focusing on poverty alleviation."
"Extractive industry support within the European Community development programme has virtually ceased."
"The specific instrument in the mining sector, Sysmin, was discontinued under the Cotonou Agreement."
"Under the Ninth European Development Fund, any programmes in the mining sector have been defined by partner countries themselves, in line with the ownership concept."
"Less than six percent of funds have been allocated to mining activities in national indicative programmes."
"In addition, increasing environmental concerns within the European Union have led to the generalisation of the use of environmental impact assessments since the 1990s."
"This also applies to cooperation with financial institutions such as the European Investment Bank or the World Bank."
"The OECD discusses guidelines for officially supported export credits. It recently announced an agreement to strengthen common approaches for evaluating the environmental impact of infrastructure projects supported by the export credit agencies of OECD governments to ensure that they meet established international standards."
"As Parliament is aware, the European Union launched an 'EU Energy Initiative for poverty eradication and sustainable development' at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002."
"The initiative’s secretariat is housed within the Commission."
"It aims to respond to the very issues raised by Parliament, by contributing to providing the access to energy necessary for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals."
"This objective will be achieved within the context of activities driven by participating developing countries, through the provision of adequate, affordable, sustainable energy services."
"Although the initiative does not have a technology focus, it strives to promote the provision of affordable and sustainable energy services. In doing so, it seeks to promote the choice of the most economic solutions on the basis of economic, social and environmental impacts."
"This involves the promotion of cleaner and more efficient fossil fuel technologies."
"The Commission also houses the secretariat of the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition."
"This Coalition aims to enhance renewable energy deployment within developing countries."
"Let me conclude by assuring you that the Commission supports the call for the full implementation of the recommendations of the Extractive Industries Review, which relate to the sustainability of investments, the promotion of good governance, popular consent, social and environmental impact assessment and the respect of human rights and core labour standards."
"Mr President, this is the second time today that we have discussed mining and quarrying."
"This morning it was Mr Sjöstedt’s report, and now it is this resolution that indirectly concerns the mining and quarrying industry."
"I agree with both Mr Roche and Commissioner Vitorino that the energy, mining and quarrying industries are of great importance to the economies of many poor countries."
"At the same time, however, we know that this type of industrial activity often takes a form that has not been of direct benefit to the poor majority, has often given rise to serious environmental damage and has also, unfortunately, resulted in the income from the concessions granted chiefly ending up in the pockets of various ministers rather than in the treasury, where it could have contributed to development in these countries."
"The study to which we are referring here is interesting and important."
"It points out the opportunities for these industries, and also the risk of the activity not taking place within a framework of social, environmental and human rights criteria."
"The consequences often turn out to be an increase in poverty and the destruction of the environment."
"We met Dr Salim a week or so ago when he was passing through."
"He gave a large number of examples of difficulties for the local population in various project areas: forced displacements, environmental damage, and so on."
"It is important that the World Bank bear in mind the criticism levelled by the study, and I note that both the Council President and the Commission agree with many of its recommendations."
"It is very important that the EU Member States, the governments of which make up a large proportion of the Bank’s Board, coordinate their activities in this field and ensure that the Bank bears the recommendations in mind."
"I think that the Presidency could play a very important role in this."
"If it is now important that the World Bankreconsider matters, it is of course equally important that a number of other financial institutions also do so."
"Commissioner Vitorino indicated that a certain amount of agreement has been reached on the activities of export credit agencies."
"This may be so, but it is extremely flimsy at present."
"We need much stricter criteria for their activities, above all with reference to the social, environmental and climate situations."
"To give an example: between 1994 and 2000, the export credit agencies in our OECD countries guaranteed investments in new energy production equivalent to approximately USD 100 billion."
"All of that activity was fossil-fuel based; not a single cent was spent on energy efficiency or renewable energy."
"A number of measures are needed in this regard."
"Without elevating this report and this study to absolute truths, they are nevertheless a good basis for pushing on and tightening up policy in connection with both poverty issues and sustainable development."
"‘I do not for a moment doubt that sooner or later the economic war that Shell is waging in the Niger Delta will be exposed and that the crimes that have been committed in this war will be punished.’"
"Those, Mr President, were the words of Ogoni leader Ken Saro-Wiwa ten years ago."
"In the West Saro-Wiwa is now, ten years on, still the best known critic of the extractive industries."
"Shell has since changed parts of its policy for the better and the Extractive Industries Review is mainly concerned with projects of the national industries."
"The present analysis of the extractive industries shows that much remains to be done before the World Bank can operate effectively in this sector."
"The struggle of the Ogoni people in Nigeria is symbolic of one of the main conditions for World Bank participation, that is the guaranteeing of the right of the indigenous peoples, without coercion and properly informed, to assent in advance to projects that are funded by the World Bank."
"For many developing countries raw materials are their primary source of income, but even if they have liquid or solid gold in their soil, the indigenous peoples of these countries see very little of the proceeds from it."
"Poverty, a high mortality rate, civil war, corruption and totalitarianism frequently stand in the way of development in these countries."
"Apart from the indigenous peoples, the environment also comes off second best to the rapid profits that raw materials bring."
"It was the same Ken Saro-Wiwa who remarked that the fish in the Niger Delta taste of oil."
"This is why it is of the utmost importance for the PSE Group that the European Council and the Commission discuss this report and set tough conditions for World Bank participations and extraction projects, so that they can only take place if the standard requirements in relation to the social, economic and ecological consequences of raw material extraction have been met."
"Paramount must be that decisions on projects are subject to good governance requirements."
"Only in this way can these raw material-rich countries develop as a whole."
"This can also be done by supporting the publish-what-you-payinitiative, by which insight is provided into payments and income and the indigenous peoples have the guarantee that the proceeds do not simply disappear into the pockets of the rich, but actually benefit the indigenous peoples."
"This can also be done by refusing to fund projects in conflict areas and finally this can be done by strengthening existing natural habitatpolicy and not investing in projects in protected wildlife areas, but investing positively in renewable energy sources."
"Mr President, following the UN report on the situation in the Congo and the US Government report on global warming, a report commissioned by the World Bank itself has now confirmed the fears that the Greens have been expressing for some time."
"What has happened is that the World Bank set up a study on the extraction industries, which, after two years of consultation with public bodies, governments and business, has produced a report which is damning with regard to its development policy."
"The report highlights the deficiencies and counter-productive effects of the World Bank’s policy in countries rich in natural resources."
"In the words of the study itself, the World Bank has attracted too many investors, without taking any real interest in helping the countries to develop their abilities to convert their natural riches into means of combating poverty."
"Similarly, the Commission has emphasised the lack of action on the part of the World Bank in terms of environmental and social supervision."
"In this respect, the study states that, if the full force of the market is unleashed without any robust frameworks, the resultant damage may be extremely serious."
"There are numerous examples of loathsome financing."
"The Yanacocha gold mine in Peru is the prototype toxic tragedy."
"Managed by an American company, the mine has flattened five mountains, displaced thousands of people and polluted with cyanide the water throughout the entire region."
"The World Bank has also given its support to the Chad-Cameroon pipeline, which we were alone in combating, and which has had disastrous social and environmental consequences: massive migration, an increase in the unreliability of food supplies and an increase in prostitution, with a consequent increased prevalence of AIDS."
"Can we really speak of a development policy?"
"The exploitation of oil, gas or mines is not necessarily the same thing as poverty reduction."
"In countries still subject to a high degree of corruption, where the legal frameworks are still unreliable and democracy is uncertain, the World Bank unfortunately is doing nothing to encourage sustainable development."
"On the contrary, in numerous countries, the extraction industries have been associated with violations of human rights and civil conflicts, as has been seen in Burma."
"Even worse, more than 80% of the World Bank’s oil financing is actually going to the North and not to poor countries."
"The consequence of this blind and generous investment: countries with disappointing results outnumber the countries making substantial progress."
"The Greens, in line with the study’s recommendations, are advocating a moratorium on the financing of oil projects until 2008, the cessation of financing for coalmines in order to combat greenhouse gases, the encouragement of clean and renewable energy along with energy efficiency."
"The European Union has a major role to play here in demanding, through the Member States, that the World Bank should take account of the study’s recommendations."
"The World Bank has been on the wrong track for too long and it is time for it to change course so that development policy can at last benefit those most in need."
"Mr President, we did not ask for this debate simply in order to tell the World Bank what it should do."
"We also need to know the position of the Council, in which 15 Member States – all playing a very important role in World Bank decision-making – are represented."
"We want to ask the Council what position it is going to take on this extractive industry report and whether or not it intends to coordinate the position of the Member States in this respect."
"In the Mr Roche's interesting remarks I did not hear the answer to this question; the very reason we asked for this debate."
"We are convinced that we must have parliamentary scrutiny of what the World Bank does, and also that we, as a European Union institution, need to know what our Member States do when they are in the World Bank."
"So the World Bank is not something outside this institution or outside your institution, Mr Roche."
"Mr Vitorino said very clearly that he thought, and that the Commission thought, that the most important recommendation had to be supported."
"I repeat: I would like to know what the position of the Council is, if any, and if there is any intention of having any kind of discussion on this point."
"We think that discussion of this issue in the Council is absolutely crucial for two reasons."
"Firstly, because the conclusions of the report say very clearly that investing in the oil, mining and gas sectors does not in itself reduce poverty."
"Sometimes, as you heard in the report, it is detrimental, and this is also of importance to the European Union."
"Secondly, we are convinced that if the World Bank's objective is to reduce poverty and alleviate the exclusion of indigenous populations and poor people, we cannot continue to support a method of financing a project that is detrimental from this point of view."
"So please, Mr Roche, tell us what you are going to do."
"Mr President, as the end of the parliamentary term approaches, we should be very civil to one another, and I note that debating the issue of the World Bank report is a very good initiative."
"We are also aware that we have an expert in our midst, as Mrs Frassoni is a member of the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank."
"It is quite right, therefore, that we should discuss this issue and endeavour to coordinate the approaches of the EU Member States."
"Speaking of the World Bank in general terms, it unfortunately appears that, in some respects, it has the worst record when it comes to the management of development projects."
"When I was in Niger around a month ago, all the parties in Niger had put their work on the Education For All plan in order; except the World Bank."
"Its management is so concentrated that it does not work."
"I hope that Mrs Frassoni will be able to address this matter, too, as part of her work with the other members of the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank."
"We know that the World Bank has experience in this area, as it said long ago that it is access to resources of this kind that leads to increased conflicts."
"We must take its recommendations seriously, therefore."
"They must serve as a guide in our grants for projects and our decisions on various nations and the degree to which we choose to help them."
". Mr President, it was a short but very interesting debate."
"I would like to say at the outset that I did not mean to disappoint Mrs Frassoni, but I did make in my own contribution a number of points relating to measures that have been taken."
"However, I accept the point she made regarding the World Bank not being something from which we are disconnected as absolutely valid."
"Indeed, Mr Wijkman commented on the protection of vulnerable countries and communities and in particular protection where the temptations of corruption are huge."
"Of course this is true, and as regards good governance, the World Bank has a responsibility to ensure that."
"We know from the cases cited here what is happening."
"We know of the environmental degradation suffered particularly by powerless indigenous peoples."
"Mr van den Berg also spoke very dramatically about what he described as the silent and hidden ecological war, and another Member made a point about gold mining and the degradation it has caused."
"In fact it is quite correct."
"These matters should be of concern to the World Bank and to the international community."
"Mr van den Berg rightly spoke of the need to balance development on the one hand with the rights of indigenous peoples and, equally important, the need to ensure that monies from exploitive and extractive industries are dedicated to the service of the peoples of the region, a point touched on also by Mr Rod."
"I would like to make the point that this is a relatively new area of concern to the Council, but the Council is ensuring that the European Union continues to play a role in global fora as a leading partner in favour of sustainable development."
"That is the most important point, and sustainable development is the term that covers all of these issues ranging from the impact on, for example, indigenous peoples to the impact of environmental degradation and it also includes the disappearance of the yields of this development through corruption."
"At the meeting of 2 March, the Council reiterated that the implementation of the commitments to the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development must continue to have the highest priority and to be integrated into all relevant internal and external policies of the European Union."
"I take that point as relating specifically to Mrs Frassoni's point."
"The Council expects that all Member States will defend these common views in all international fora, including the World Bank."
"If I disappointed you in my earlier contribution, I hope I have made up for it now!"
"I have received six motions for resolutions(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on international organ trafficking."
"I give the floor to Minister Roche, on behalf of the Council."
". Sorry, Mr President, I was a little distracted – Mrs Frassoni was flirting with me there."
"It just goes to show that on occasions the European Parliament can be a much more pleasant place to be than Dáil Éireann;"
"I have not had that experience before!"
"We now turn from humour to something quite horrific – the modern equivalent of Burke and Hare, namely the trafficking in human organs."
"As medical science has progressed in the area of organ transplantation there is a growing demand for organs, with a resulting problem in trafficking in human organs."
"This is an appalling and disgusting practice and is a serious violation of human dignity and physical integrity."
"It also has serious implications for the combating of organised crime, because as in everything else, organised crime has managed to get into this particular area."
"We know of the involvement of criminal gangs in this quite extraordinary activity."
"I am aware that this has been an issue of concern and debate in Parliament."
"In fact, I commend Parliament because it has been very much to the fore in condemnation of this practice."
"It is also an issue of concern to the Council and it is important that in addressing this we do so properly and are clear on the scope of the problem."
"This is a complex and multi-dimensional issue and requires careful consideration."
"A proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the prevention and control of trafficking in human organs and tissues was presented by the Greek presidency in February 2003, in the framework of the Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"The aim of the proposal is to contribute to combating trafficking in human organs and tissues as a form of organised crime."
"The draft Framework Decision contains proposals to require Member States to ensure that the removal of an organ from a donor using force, threats or fraud, or the removal of an organ from a donor who has consented because of payment, become criminal offences."
"Also included as offences are the recruitment, transportation or harbouring of a person where use is made of force or threats or where payment is made for the removal of an organ or tissue."
"It also proposes that participation by medical or nursing staff in the transplantation of an organ in the knowledge that it has been acquired by any of these means will be a criminal offence."
"The proposition in the framework document will be quite wide."
"The proposal has been discussed on a number of occasions by relevant Council bodies."
"Several Member States questioned the need for an instrument at this time."
"It has also transpired that Member States have no precise information on the scale of the problem, within the European Union or involving it as a destination."
"In this regard, the findings of the Falcone project, which includes a 13 Member State study of the matter, will be of interest."
"The Irish presidency will continue to monitor Member States’ views on the usefulness of a measure such as this at the level of the EU with a view to establishing whether progress might be made in respect of such a measure."
"Turning to the related issue of the legal use of organs for transplantation, very specific issues arise because of the shortage of organs."
"There is a need to ensure high standards of quality and safety."
"The Commission has indicated that it will conduct a thorough scientific evaluation regarding the situation of organ transplantation."
"It will present the conclusions of this evaluation as soon as possible and we look forward to receipt of that report."
"I can summarise by saying that at this stage we are very much at the beginning of a process which may well take a long time to reach any form of finality."
"But the fact that we are debating it is an indication that there is an awareness and a concern about the issue."
". Mr President, the Commission welcomes the debate here today on a problem that gives rise to serious concern, that of trafficking in human organs."
"The victims of this type of crime are particularly vulnerable human beings, in particular children."
"Illicit trafficking in organs can lead to significant health risks for both the donor and the recipient."
"Trafficking in human organs is an obscene violation of the right to physical integrity and, in the most tragic circumstances, of the right to life, as recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"The Commission has recently been increasingly informed about alleged situations of illicit trafficking in human organs in Mozambique and Albania, not least through written questions recently addressed by Mr Ribeiro e Castro and Mrs Karamanou."
"It has also been alerted by increasing rumours in the media."
"These alleged situations of trafficking are particularly worrying and the Commission is following them very closely, through the Commission's delegation in the regions concerned and in close dialogue with Member States locally, in particular in the context of the political dialogue with these countries."
"In relation to the situation in Mozambique, the Commission has contacted the Office of the Attorney General, who has assured it that investigations are under way."
"The Commission also reinforced its concern at a meeting in Brussels with the Ambassador of Mozambique."
"The reality shows that trafficking in human organs tends to move from the south to the north and from the poor to the rich, not excluding, however, movements within a particular region."
"Regional and international cooperation are essential to tackle this phenomenon successfully."
"The criminals in this type of activity benefit from the weaknesses of local police, often undermined by corruption, which therefore does not prevent the transboundary illicit trade in organs; as well as from inefficient judicial systems."
"It is worth mentioning that the Commission has been emphasising how important it is for Albania to take the necessary steps to conclude an agreement with Europol."
"Albania, as I mentioned earlier, is one of the countries alleged to be the scene of activities of trafficking in children's organs, whose destination is, allegedly, the European Union."
"In order to prevent the entry into the European Union of human organs resulting from illicit trafficking, the measures taken to improve cooperation between Member States' police services and customs administrations and to strengthen external border controls are of great value."
"However, specific measures directed at this type of crime seem currently to be inadequate."
"It was in this spirit that Greece, during its presidency of the Union, presented an initiative for the adoption by the Council of a framework decision concerning the prevention and control of trafficking in human organs and tissues."
"The aim of this initiative – as already mentioned by the presidency – was to define which types of conduct should be punishable in all Member States and to establish minimum rules relating to the penalties for such offences."
"The Commission was largely supportive of this initiative, while recognising, however, that more in-depth legal and factual examination and knowledge of the situation in the Member States was necessary."
"In this context, and in view of the weaknesses detected when trying to move forward the Greek initiative, it is important to mention that Europol's competences were extended in January 2002 to include illicit trade in human organs and tissues."
"Europol is currently studying this phenomenon and collecting relevant information and data concerning the legal and illegal aspects of trafficking in human organs."
"Europol can indeed have a great added value in this common fight."
"As far as the collection of information is concerned, I should also refer to the fact that the Council of Europe has recently looked at the issue of trafficking in human organs and that it produced a report in December 2003 that provides a useful insight into the current situation in Europe regarding this phenomenon."
"Under the Commission's AGIS financial programme for police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, it is also possible to support projects in this particularly delicate area of criminality, which has still not been fully examined."
"In addition it is important to stress that the Commission recognises that the severe shortage of organ donors remains a major obstacle to preventing the full development of transplant services and imposes a severe limit on the number of patients who are able to benefit from this form of therapy."
"This shortage of organs can encourage illicit trade."
"The Commission is fully aware of the consequences resulting from the shortage of organs and, for that reason, it has indicated as a priority action in its work plan for 2004 for the implementation of the programme on Community action in the field of public health 2003-2008, the development of a strategy for the European Union in order to raise awareness and increase availability of organs used for transplantation."
"Indeed, the Commission has already conducted a survey of the current practices and legal requirements related to organ transplantation in the Member States and the acceding countries and is in the process of analysing the results."
"This analysis will be communicated to the European Parliament, as well as to the Member States, as soon as it is concluded."
"In conclusion, a number of initiatives have been launched to combat illicit trafficking in human organs and the Commission will continue to support such initiatives as are appropriate in order to combat this unacceptable trade."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, trafficking in human beings is one of the most sickening manifestations of the growing phenomenon of international crime, and the trafficking of children is more sickening still."
"The trafficking of children in order to remove organs is the most gruesome part of this immoral and repulsive business."
"From the point of view of ethics, I have no interest in discussing the reasons behind this criminal activity, whether it be for reasons of witchcraft, organ trafficking or whatever."
"There are human beings who need our support and our protection, people who lose organs or even their lives as a result of this practice."
"Information has recently come to light on the continued practice of this type of criminal activity in Mozambique, which is, of course, cause for great concern."
"In addition to the human dimension of these events, we Portuguese have linguistic and cultural ties with that country."
"I therefore welcome both this debate and the one that took place yesterday in the Portuguese Parliament, on the initiative of Mrs Morais, a Member of the Portuguese Parliament."
"I was also pleased to see that the Prime Minister of Portugal, Dr Durão Barroso, raised the matter with the Mozambican President during his ongoing State visit to the country."
"I should like to make three points on the matter."
"Firstly, we must combat this crime wherever it occurs."
"I do not believe we can take any other stance."
"Trafficking in human beings and, especially, children for removing organs, is a despicable trade that must be combated and is one of the worst manifestations of the growing phenomenon of international crime."
"All specialists agree that most organised networks are international; like other types of crime, this goes beyond national borders."
"If we are to tackle crime effectively, to identify criminals and to protect victims, international cooperation must be strengthened. This brings us to my second point."
"We must not feel embarrassed at our level of development."
"I have read that the reluctance on the part of some countries to recognise that this type of criminality goes on in their territory is down to the narrow-minded notion that it only happens in developing countries."
"The truth of the matter is that this type of appalling activity occurs everywhere, given that it is a crime to buy, just as it is to sell, human organs and that there are fewer and fewer borders in international crime."
"On 23 October last year, in this House, we debated a proposal for a framework decision on promoting the fight against trafficking in human organs and tissues, to which both the President-in-Office of the Council and Mr Vitorino referred."
"At the time, I expressed our concern at the emergence of this phenomenon, and mentioned the alarming number of abductions in Brazil and Guatemala, as well as similarly worrying news from accession countries such as Hungary and the Czech Republic."
"I called for an integrated Community approach and for the definition both of offences in the trafficking of human organs and tissues and their respective penalties to be harmonised."
"Thirdly and lastly, we must not be afraid to help."
"We have an obligation to help, both on behalf of the humanitarian causes to which we subscribe, and in the interests – which must be common interests – of putting a stop to this unholy trade and of dismantling the existing international networks."
"We therefore say clearly to the Commission and to the Council that we have a duty to help."
"We note the statement on the matter made by Commissioner Nielson at the time, to the effect that our help had not been requested, thus far, by the Mozambican authorities."
"We would therefore like to say to the governments, to the judiciary and to the police forces of the countries concerned that there is nothing to fear from international help to combat these crimes."
"In so doing we are not diluting, but strengthening the instruments and resources to combat this common evil."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are pleased to see that the question that we raised on the trafficking of human beings and children in Mozambique has sparked a broader debate on the illegal trafficking of human organs and tissues, not only in the EU, but on an altogether wider scale."
"There is, indeed, nothing more abominable than tampering with the human form – which should be a finished article in itself and whose integrity and dignity must be protected – and turning it into an object in which you can look for an organ to transplant into another person."
"This practice is so gruesome that the EU should be duly alarmed and we – that is, Parliament, the Commission and the Council – must do all we can to provide ourselves with the means to stop such trafficking from proliferating any further, from becoming any bigger and from making a few unscrupulous people and their criminal networks any richer."
"I should like to speak about Mozambique."
"In Mozambique, mystery surrounds Nampula Province."
"Child trafficking has taken place there; fifty children are known to have disappeared, probably abducted and sacrificed, be this for the purposes of removing organs for witchcraft, magic rituals or satanic rituals, of sex slavery, or of removing organs to sell them on some international network."
"Mystery surrounds the existence or otherwise in Mozambique of an international child-trafficking network for obtaining organs."
"The Mozambican church says that the suspicions are well-founded and that there is a fear that the network is indeed functioning."
"The Mozambican authorities have made contradictory statements on the matter, which range from statements, designed to allay people’s fears, that there is no proof that such trafficking takes place, to suggestions that there are indeed signs that the network exists."
"I should therefore like to ask you, Commissioner, Mr President, to call on the Mozambican authorities to clarify the matter."
"The matter needs to be clarified, and the people of Nampula, and the children of Nampula, and Mozambique as a whole, need to be helped, so that they can live in peace."
"– Madam President, the chilling reports arriving from Mozambique, particularly the Nampula area, where the inexplicable disappearance of children hides an obscene trade in human organs, might seem unbelievable because they are so repugnant to any human being."
"Unfortunately, however, even the Holocaust could seem unbelievable, and yet it happened without disturbing the sleep of those who must have had the means to know or intervene and yet did not do so."
"After such a terrible experience, we must make a commitment today to stop this obscene trade with all the means that the international community has at its disposal."
"We must raise our voices as individuals and Members of this Parliament against those who connive or do not oppose it with sufficient determination and in favour of those who risk or even lose their lives to denounce and try to stop this modern massacre of the innocents."
"It is the members of civil and political society and not only religious society who should take charge of this problem."
"Questions have already been asked, but they are not enough."
"All the prominent people in this world who share the ability to influence the destiny of so many have the ethical responsibility to take practical, urgent steps to guarantee the safety of children and the people who protect them."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the trafficking of human organs is the new piracy of modern times, which is a particularly sordid and brutal form of piracy."
"It can lead to persecution, abduction and even murder."
"At its root is greed, and it knows no scruples."
"Combating this phenomenon must be firm, far-reaching and unflinching."
"Not all cases are the same."
"There are cases in which the authorities turn a blind eye to the trade in organs, whereby a person can sell, say, their own kidney for a fistful of dollars."
"Even in such cases, freedom is illusory and the reality is still a sordid form of piracy that exploits the helplessness of the poor, wretched donors."
"Quite apart from the violence of this unholy trade, which violates human dignity and integrity, it also supports a gruesome market and stimulates highly dangerous criminal activity and the development of international mafia networks."
"As this gruesome market is allowed to operate, when insufficient numbers of organs appear for sale, the criminals then, in cold blood, bridge the gap in supply by abducting, or even killing people."
"The principle of free organ donation for transplants is one of the fundamental principles of civilisation, and a fundamental requirement of people’s dignity and of our security and freedom."
"Where organ donation is not free, we are all, in theory, potential victims of this all-out assault on the human body."
"The EU must apply the principle of free donation across its territory, must make strenuous efforts to enshrine it in law and must ensure that it is complied with throughout the world."
"Where organ donation is not free, the threat of crime may rear its head or the criminals may already be operating."
"The EU must also take the lead in combating this modern scourge at international level, since it is one of the most gruesome manifestations of international crime in modern times."
"The framework decision proposed by the Greek Presidency must be approved without delay, in order to ensure that all Member States can eradicate this trafficking, as suppliers, as receivers or as a field of operation."
"We must react promptly and effectively whenever and wherever in the world such crime comes to light."
"Recent attention has focused on certain regions of Mozambique, in East Africa."
"The facts of the case have yet to be clarified, yet we must, for this very reason, continue to take action until there is complete transparency and until people’s minds can be put at rest."
"We must respond in kind to the courage and tenacity of religious bodies and human rights activists in bringing attention to dozens of unexplained disappearances of children and young people, some of whom have since been found dead, their bodies mutilated."
"We must not allow ourselves to demur on action because of any misplaced concerns, or because of a lack of total transparency."
"It is possible that in Nampula there has been not one but many tragic events, possibly involving the trafficking of human beings and children, or the trafficking of organs for witchcraft or other non-medical uses and the trafficking of human organs to support international networks."
"We do not know, yet we cannot tire in our efforts merely because we are not in possession of the full facts."
"We must work ceaselessly to combat what is, in all its forms, a despicable crime."
"Those authorities faced with such terrible crimes sometimes appear to be embarrassed; they begin to contradict themselves or appear hesitant when cases come to light."
"Nobody likes to see the name of their country associated internationally with this situation."
"We must understand this and must always treat any country involved with respect."
"This is precisely, however, why we must put across, with patience and perseverance, the notion that it is not the embarrassment that is the problem; the problem is the trafficking and the crime."
"Everyone, throughout the world, must collaborate in investigating and combating this perfidious piracy, which has no country of origin."
"The threat is international and affects every one of us."
"Whether it be Israel or South Africa, on the Asian, European or American continents, whether it has its origins in Mozambique or in the poorer regions of Brazil, in Moldova or Albania, in the fragmented Balkans, in the vastness of Africa, in depressed Central Asia or in the poorest outskirts of Asian or Latin American cities, we know where this trafficking is going to attack."
"Like a vulture, this all-out assault on the human body seeks out regions of human poverty, and places where the State’s authority is weak."
"It preys on areas where people and communities are at their weakest; it senses the weakest and poorest members of society and attacks them."
"These are the areas where we must act, in cooperation with the competent authorities, in order to raise awareness, to offer encouragement and practical help, to process and exchange information, to prise out the whole truth, to put people’s minds at ease and to dismantle the networks, wherever they may appear."
"The Commission and the Council must work hard and I should like to see the Council act with the same level of diligence that the Commission has already shown here, whether cases appear in Mozambique or in any other part of the world."
"Madam President, I have been listening to this debate, especially to Minister Roche, and it has been something of a surreal experience."
"I have been increasingly puzzled as it has gone on."
"Mr Roche, you concluded your remarks by saying that this process was at its beginning."
"This rather begs the question: what is the coordination between the presidencies of the European Union?"
"You referred to the framework document produced, in February 2003, by the Greek Government, because it was a Greek initiative."
"I was the rapporteur for this Parliament on the framework document, and the Greek Government was very anxious to get it through during its presidency in the first half of last year."
"The process is far from its beginning; in fact, this time last year we were hoping it was near its end."
"Some governments – perhaps the Italians, the Irish, and certainly some of the Scandinavian ones – were putting a spanner in the works and stalling on this."
"My report was adopted by 420 votes to nil in the European Parliament."
"Are you aware of that report on trafficking in human organs?"
"Have you read it?"
"Mr Coelho referred to it earlier on."
"Certainly, my report would answer some of the problems that you raised."
"I could tell you a great deal about this situation – over 1000 European Union citizens a year, allegedly, going to poorer countries in the world to seek human organs, whether it be India, Pakistan, Albania or some of the other countries that have been referred to."
"There is much information already in the market; we are not starting from scratch."
"What chance is there of real progress?"
"Indeed, what point is there in this debate?"
"What is the research that has gone into your statement, if you have not taken account of all that has gone through this Parliament already, if you have not read in depth the work that has been done and the reports that have gone through this Parliament, in consultation with the Commission and other governments?"
"The danger is that all the good work and good intentions that colleagues have spoken about here will come to nothing if presidency after presidency does not build on what has happened already."
". Madam President, we have had an interesting debate."
"There is not any point in trying to turn a debate in which there has been no disagreement into an adversarial matter."
"I referred to the point that was made in an excellent contribution in the documents that there is still a lot of information needed in this area."
"I do not disagree that excellent work commenced during the Greek presidency."
"My personal view is that it is a pity that more concrete steps have not been taken to date."
"It is an astonishing debate."
"Commissioner Vitorino rightly cited a concern about this particular trade that would exist in any civilised community."
"He outlined in considerable detail the efforts that have been made."
"I was very impressed by Mr Coelho, who demonstrated the need for the Union to act in a coherent way to address a policy."
"Mr Lage and Mr Calò made similar points."
"I agree with the point made by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, when he suggested that we should not allow ourselves to demur on action because of any misplaced concerns."
"At the end of the day, the reality is that the Union has not progressed in this matter."
"It was introduced and put before the Union by the Greek presidency."
"There are reasons why it did not progress any further."
"I am not quite certain that any Member States put 'spanners in the works'."
"If they did, I am sure they may have done so because they felt that there were good and cogent reasons for doing so."
"Nonetheless, with the exception of that final fractious point, this was a good debate."
"It has helped to highlight the need for concerted Union action."
"It illustrates how, if the Union were to act in a concerted manner, it could bring to an end what is clearly an evil trade."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to reiterate that the Commission will continue to monitor closely the cases that have been mentioned, relating to Mozambique and Albania, and to remain vigilant, in close cooperation with the embassies of Member States in both of those countries."
"Secondly, I must point out that, from a legal point of view, Greece’s initiative during its presidency raises certain questions that require political debate."
"Our studies have shown that, in fact, the illegal trafficking of organs has not been criminalised in all Member States."
"The information at our disposal shows significant discrepancies in the appropriate classification of offences."
"Thirdly, there is a certain complexity as regards the enforcement of criminal measures, given that, as we know, the beneficiaries of the transplants of illicitly obtained organs are, more often than not, European, although those transplants are carried out in third countries, which raises the question of criminal punishment based on the principle of the national territory in which the criminal act was committed."
"Consequently, these questions were raised during the presentation and the first debate of the Greek initiative for a framework decision applicable to the illegal trafficking of organs, and a study was carried out within the scope of the Falcone Programme, in order to identify what exactly were the fundamental questions that required legislative treatment at European level."
"As you are aware, and as I have just mentioned, this was not a Commission initiative, and in some ways, the crux of this debate is the lack of continuity of Member States’ initiatives, which enjoy a certain momentum when the country concerned holds the presidency, but which have no guarantee of continuity thereafter."
"For our part, we have put together this study and today we are better equipped to identify, more comprehensively than the Greek initiative was able to, the key areas that must be the subject of any legislative intervention in this area."
"–Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed.(1)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0060/2004) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the protocol amending the fourth protocol laying down the fishery conditions included in the agreement on fisheries between the European Economic Community, on the one hand, and the Danish Government and the Local Government of Greenland, on the other."
". Madam President, with regard to this Fisheries Agreement with Greenland, perhaps the first thing we should remember is that it is the second most expensive agreement signed by the European Union, after the Agreement with Mauritania."
"Furthermore, there is a difference between the two agreements I have mentioned, which we call the difference between the ‘northern agreements’ and the ‘southern agreements’."
"The northern agreements have a whole series of characteristics, which I will explain during my speech, which differentiate them from the southern agreements."
"A lot has been said about this Fisheries Agreement with Greenland, all kinds of things have been said and almost all of it is true."
"For example, the Court of Auditors emphasised that the Fisheries Agreement with Greenland did not respect certain basic budgetary rules, fishing opportunities, for example."
"Of the EUR 42.8 million this agreement costs, just 28 were spent on fishing opportunities and furthermore this included paper fish, so called because they were fish that, although they were paid for, did not exist in Greenland’s waters because they had disappeared long ago."
"As well as the fact that the use of fishing quotas was very low and was far from achieving the value expected for fishing opportunities, only four Member States could and can fish within the framework of this Agreement: the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Denmark."
"The other Member States were and continue to be excluded from these waters."
"It should be pointed out that this exclusion and this non-use of fishing quotas paid for caused and continues to cause a series of distortions such as, for example, the case of certain Member States benefiting from the agreement having tried to re-sell unused quotas, because they are not of interest to the consumer market of that Member State, but they are of interest for consumption in other States."
"In addition to this distortion (the attempt to re-sell something already paid for), there has been and there still is fishing of unused quotas by vessels flying the flags of those Member States, but which in reality are not from those Member States or any other Member State, but which are third-country vessels."
"The fact is that there is a desire to acquire these unused quotas, or at least to begin fishing, though of an experimental nature, on the part of certain Member States which are not included as beneficiaries of this agreement or which were excluded – such as the Iberian fleets: the Spanish and the Portuguese – at the time of our accession to the European Community, despite the fact that we have been fishing in those waters for centuries."
"The Commission recognised all these distortions in its document and proposed a mechanism according to which the Commission could temporarily transfer unused fishing opportunities to another Member State, only during that particular year and without prejudice to the allocation of quotas in future years."
"We thought this was a good mechanism, above all because it was a trial mechanism and it would be possible to verify whether it worked or not as time passed."
"However, in the Committee on Fisheries an amendment was approved, presented by nationals of certain Member States involved, to the effect that the Commission could establish consultation procedures between the Member States, but that it would be the States which had the quotas who could determine or decide on their distribution or allocation to other Member States which are not beneficiaries but which have an interest in fishing in that area."
"I believe that, in reality, the central debate in relation to this issue is whether the Commission only plays a facilitating role or whether, since we are talking about a Community fisheries agreement, it must ensure the best possible level of use of fishing opportunities which, as I have said, have been acquired and paid for from Greenland by the Community, within the framework of this Fisheries Agreement."
"I believe we are talking essentially not about national issues – because, in the fisheries agreements, in general – and those of us who are here are well aware of this – national issues are always very prevalent and they always cause many tensions – but about the principle of good financial management, the Gordian knot of this issue."
"It is a question of defining this principle in relation to principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness, and ensuring compliance, by means of the monitoring of performance indicators, which are established by activity and which furthermore are measurable, so that the results achieved can be observed."
"I say this from the standpoint of somebody who has worked on this Agreement for a long time and who I believe has a thorough knowledge of it."
"Furthermore, Greenland is entirely in favour of the approach I have just expressed here – in fact, it has already reached an agreement with the Commission – and I believe this would be a good signal for us to send to two Community fleets: to let them fish – not everything, but at least a bit – in those waters."
". Madam President, I should like to thank the Member for her report on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol modifying the Fourth Fisheries Protocol between the EU and Greenland."
"I am happy to note that the Member supports this proposal."
"The Greenland Protocol has been subject to serious criticism in the past."
"I believe that the revised version of the Protocol is an important step in the right direction."
"On the basis of the mandate given by the Council on 24 February 2003, the evaluation report done by the Commission services and the report of the European Parliament adopted on 2 September 2003, the Commission initialled the modified Fourth Protocol on 18 June 2003 in Athens."
"I should like to highlight the main new elements,"
"A substantial adjustment of quotas has been carried out in order, among other things, to delete cod 'paper fish' and align the fishing possibilities with scientific advice: no more cod, redfish in Western waters or blue whiting; and, in the European Union fishing capacity, no more 'paper fish'."
"Licence fees have been introduced in order to have burden-sharing between the Community and ship owners."
"This is in line with the reform of the common fisheries policy, aligns the agreement with other third-country agreements and, last but not least, gives the Commission the possibility of monitoring the fishing effort."
"As a response to the lack of transparency, a budgetary support programme has been introduced, and the Greenland Home Rule Government has committed itself to performing a structural reform of its fisheries policies."
"The Greenland authorities have committed themselves to restructuring their fisheries sector towards more privatisation and fewer subsidies."
"They have also committed themselves to increasing substantially the budget of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources so that it can increase its scientific capacity."
"Experimental fisheries are promoted and extended to cephalopods and clams."
"If successful, this may be the answer both to the diversification needed in Greenland fisheries and to the new species to be included in the next European Community – Greenland agreement."
"With regard to the problem of low utilisation of fishing possibilities and the waste of Community funds, the standard transfer clause making it possible for the Commission to reallocate under-utilised fishing possibilities to other non-quota older Member States has been introduced."
"This is in full respect of the principle of relative stability and Article 20(5) of the basic regulation."
"This is a crucial new element which not only gives the Commission the means to ensure the sound financial management of Community funds and optimal use of tax-payers' money, but also brings the Greenland Agreement into line with other third-country agreements with financial compensation."
"– Madam President, the agreement with Greenland is important in several respects."
"We have been told that it is and we can only agree."
"Firstly, as regards catches and financial compensation it is one of the EU’s most important fisheries agreements ever."
"Secondly, it is an excellent example of sustainability and balance in the waters of the North Atlantic."
"Improvements have definitely been made."
"Thirdly, it is also an expression of the special relationship between the former EC member Greenland and the Union."
"I am not of course telling you anything new when I say that the European fisheries policy is a genuine Community policy, with all that entails."
"There are Community legal bases and principles that are binding."
"These include, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, the principle of relative stability which was confirmed only recently as part of the large-scale common fisheries policy reform."
"I find it highly questionable and unhelpful to be seeking an amendment by the back door, as I see it, and to give way to sectional interests as seems to be the manifest intention of many here in this House on the Greenland question."
"The EU fishing nations that are party to the Greenland agreement have committed themselves to sustainable and responsible fishing."
"Otherwise, this agreement would never have come about."
"They have been given quotas which they can use themselves and which they can exchange."
"That cannot be changed. We cannot now withdraw those quotas with coercive measures that impinge upon the Member States’ substantive rights."
"Just imagine if a football team does not use its possibilities for substitution and for that reason is not allowed any substitutes in the next game but is allowed to field a team with twice the number of players."
"In a word, it is absurd."
"It cannot be justified by talking about supposedly economic and fair grounds."
"We do not need imposed redistribution; what we need is partnership and cooperation."
"Everyone involved has repeatedly assured us that they want to make the best possible use of quotas, and we believe them."
"As we have seen, Germany, where I come from, has been exemplary in its cooperation in the past few years – I am pleased to be able to say that – and has transferred parts of its quotas for stocks that are in good condition to other Member States."
"That is the way to have a sustainable fisheries policy."
"For the future I am in favour of closer cooperation over quotas; that is something I can concede, but the Member States’ and Commission’s powers must be preserved."
"I also fully support an improved procedure for consultation between Member States over the exchange of quotas from agreements with third countries."
"I also ask my fellow Members to support that."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the modification of the Fourth Protocol, laying down the conditions for fishing between the EU and Greenland, is a step in the right direction, as its guiding principles are truth, transparency and reciprocity."
"As you say, Commissioner, we no longer have paper fish or virtual fish."
"We can, accordingly, establish a relationship between the EU’s financial contributions and the fish that can actually be caught, because there are fish to be caught."
"I therefore welcome this modification and Mrs Miguélez Ramos’s report, which is appropriate and well structured."
"The words in her intervention were similarly welcome, as they enabled us to focus on the central political issue at stake here."
"I also welcome Commissioner Vitorino’s intervention."
"His knowledge of fisheries does not surprise me, given that his many talents allow him to speak about fisheries with a remarkable breadth of knowledge."
"Here was me thinking that all he knew about fish was what he found on the plate ..."
"Seriously, though, I hope that Commissioner Vitorino can come and teach us about particle physics and molecular biology (); he has the talent and intelligence to do this."
"Returning, however, to the political question raised by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, the removal of the Spanish and Portuguese from the Greenland fishing zones is both unjust and ‘anti-historic’ – now that ‘the destiny of history’ has gone out of fashion, please allow me to use the term ‘anti-historic’."
"If the Spanish and Portuguese were the first to discover fishing routes across the globe, then they must also have discovered the fisheries in Greenland, from where they have now been banned."
"We now have the chance to rectify this injustice, and this opportunity to rectify injustice consists of allowing quotas not taken up by the States holding them to be used by Portugal and Spain."
"This must not mean that these two countries must be subordinate to the authority of the countries holding the quotas."
"This is not some kind of modern-day feudal law invented alongside the quotas that are assigned to one country, which later passes them on or not to the EU Member State that, within the scope of Community policy, wishes to use them."
"I therefore wholeheartedly support the position of Mrs Miguélez Ramos that the European Union and the Commission can assign unused fishing quotas to countries wishing to use them, such as Portugal and Spain."
"Madam President, my Group welcomes some of the changes that have been made in this report insofar as a distinction is now being made between money for fishing rights and money for development."
"This should be applied to all fisheries agreements and not just this one."
"We feel that we need a clear separation with regard to what the money is there for."
"In development, the money would go to surveillance and scientific analysis etc., and there should also be the possibility of an audit of how the money is spent."
"There is a major vacuum here in that European taxpayers' money goes to fund these fisheries agreements without the possibility of looking to see how the money has been spent, particularly when it is in the area of development and surveillance."
"We – and European citizens – would like to see guarantees that this is where this money is going, rather than taking it at face value."
"In many cases I do not believe that we have a guarantee that the money has gone where we expect it to go."
"Most of the access in this agreement is for northern countries, and in the Commission's proposal it says that this may be reallocated."
"Members in the committee wanted the wording 'shall be reallocated'."
"This idea that if it is not being used up then it has to be reallocated to other countries is a bad idea, as we need first of all to look and see how we can try to reduce capacity, and if it is not being utilised, there may be very good valid reasons."
"For example, maybe there is not enough fish."
"So why should we say that it should be reallocated regardless of the reasons for its not being utilised?"
"We should be trying to reduce fishing effort because we know that the oceans do not have the capacity to deal with the pressures that are being put on them by the fishing industry in the European Union and elsewhere."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I regret to have to begin my speech on this occasion without being able to congratulate the rapporteur on her report."
"The Miguélez Ramos report, in the form it is being presented to plenary today, is worse than the Commission’s proposal."
"This is why we voted against it in committee, as did the rapporteur herself."
"I sincerely believe that the Commission’s proposal was good and sufficient, and I believe that it should have been accepted by a majority in the Committee on Fisheries, in which case it would not have been necessary to present amendments to Article 3, since, for the first time, the Commission was responding to a long battle by the PPE-DE Group in this European Parliament and by the Spanish Government for the same criteria to be applied to the Fisheries Agreement with Greenland as to the ‘southern agreements’ and for there not to be fishing opportunities paid for but not used, thereby allowing the Commission directly to re-allocate these unused fishing opportunities to other Member States which request it."
"Mr Vitorino, I would ask you to communicate to Commissioner Fischler that he should go ahead with his proposal, because it is reasonable, fair, equitable and in accordance with the principles of good governance, which the Court of Auditors called for so strongly, favouring the mutual interests of Greenland and the European Union, and, above all, it is a Europeanist proposal, since it protects the common European interest, unlike the current Miguélez Ramos report, which is anti-Community, since it prevents the Commission from directly defending the common interest of all the Member States in re-allocating unused quotas and obliges it to give in to the desire of certain States which do not use those quotas to negotiate bilaterally."
"We therefore believe the report to be a step backwards and we will vote against it again if the new Amendment No 5 is not adopted, since it is better than the Amendment No 2 which appears in the current Miguélez Ramos report."
"Madam President, although I support the first four amendments, I reject Amendment No 5."
"I believe that amendment was originally lost in committee but has been re-tabled."
"My reason for rejecting the amendment is quite simply that it undermines the principle of relative stability."
"That principle is at the heart of the Scottish and British position on fisheries policy and, I believe, that of other northern states."
"Any measures which threaten this principle, or put it at risk, I cannot support."
"The concept of relative stability is vital to the Scottish fleet, as it guarantees historical rights, and Amendment No 5 puts that at risk."
"Amendment No 5 also transfers competence to the Commission over quota swaps, which, I believe, is against the basic CFP regulation."
"Competence should rest with the Member State, allowing new entrants to existing fisheries, leading to pressures to reallocate currently guaranteed quota shares."
"It also ignores the basic differences between southern fisheries agreements, where fishing licences are at stake, and northern agreements where quotas are at stake."
"I find it interesting that some people want the Commission to have more responsibility over fisheries, yet when it comes to certain proposals over which the Commission has responsibility, they want to reject it outright."
"Amendment No 5 is dangerous to northern fishing interests, it goes against the CFP regulation and risks reducing the amount of Greenland quotas that can be used in exchange for quotas for Norway on which the United Kingdom industry relies heavily."
"I am sorry to disagree with the rapporteur on this occasion."
"Madam President, I note that Commissioner Fischler is unable to be with us here today."
"I hope that is because he is extremely busy trying to remedy the problems that have been inflicted upon Scotland by the December Fisheries Council in Brussels."
"On the subject of Greenland, I am sure that many Scots in fishing communities these days would look enviously towards Greenland because it is outwith the CFP."
"However, while in Scotland we are still stuck with the CFP, it is absolutely essential that the founding principle of relative stability is not violated in any way whatsoever."
"This report, and its proposal that quotas should be reallocated to different Member States, and reallocated by the Commission, is totally unacceptable."
"It is a very dangerous precedent that could, and would, be used to undermine relative stability."
"It is not helpful that in December 2002 the UK Government and the Scottish Labour and Liberal Government supported reform of the CFP giving equal access to waters and resources."
"If Commissioner Fischler had been here I would have asked him to comment on how relative stability can live with equal access to waters and resources."
"The two are not compatible, and I just hope that we can get out of the CFP before relative stability is reviewed or revoked."
"Madam President, I had better be careful what I say about Mrs Miguélez Ramos, in case she now becomes the Fisheries Minister in Madrid; so I will be nice to her from now on."
"We in the Committee on Fisheries recently had presentations from an eminent scientist, Dr Chris Reid from the Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation at Plymouth University."
"He was explaining to the Committee on Fisheries that global warming, which has caused a rise in the temperature of the North Sea by a significant amount over the last 20 years, has driven the plankton on which the cod feed northwards."
"It is not surprising, then, that we are witnessing a collapse in cod stocks in the North Sea which has led to the crisis that the Scottish fleet in particular is now confronting, and to the cod recovery plan that the Commission has implemented."
"Nevertheless, when you look at the table of proposed fishing opportunities under the modified Fourth Protocol for the Greenland Agreement, you see a reduction in fishing opportunities; a dramatic reduction in cod for a start, which perhaps gives some question to the science on which Dr Chris Reid was informing our committee."
"It at least indicates that in Greenland waters we do not have the vast abundance of fish that was once indicated."
"The good thing about this modification to the Fourth Protocol is that at least now we have no paper fish: we are paying for genuine fishing opportunities."
"We are relating the money that we pay from the European Union to the actual reality of the fishing opportunities that are there."
"If such fishing opportunities exist, the people who most require to benefit from those opportunities are the beleaguered fleet operating at present in the North Sea."
"For that reason regrettably I have to say, adding my voice and echoing what my colleagues have said this afternoon, that I agree that we cannot support Amendment No 5."
"Not only does that undermine the principle of relative stability, as Mrs Stihler and Mr Hudghton have eloquently explained, but it would also transfer those potential fishing opportunities away from the North Sea fleet and give them to fishing fleets outwith the North Sea, which would not be acceptable to the fishermen in the UK."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Miguélez Ramos’ good report on the modification of the protocol to the fisheries agreement with Greenland shows once again that justified criticisms can be made of its content and application."
"These come not only from the rapporteur of the Committee on Fisheries, but also from the Committee on Budgets."
"I agree with the rapporteur when she calls for the financial expenditure for this agreement to be adapted to the actual situation."
"Her call for a general evaluation report and a cost-benefit analysis also has my full support."
"Parliament has been calling for this for a long time for fisheries agreements with third countries."
"I cannot, however, support the rapporteur’s call for the Commission to reallocate unused fishing opportunities to another Member State on request, even if that allocation were limited to just one fishing campaign."
"In my opinion, this would have a very serious effect on the common fisheries policy principle of relative stability."
"The possibility of transferring or exchanging allocated fishing quotas must continue to be a Member State competence."
"After all, the sustainable use of fish stocks benefits from unused fishing opportunities."
"If parts of allocated quotas go unused because of particular foreseeable circumstances, however, then bilateral contractual arrangements between the Member States are still the appropriate way of dealing with that."
"The Commission may be allowed to intervene here in a regulatory capacity."
"Anything more than that, however, would seriously undermine the basis of the common fisheries policy."
"I therefore ask you to support Amendment No 2 but to vote against Amendment No 5 in tomorrow’s vote."
". Madam President, I wish to begin by making it clear that I have inherited my knowledge on this subject from my colleague, Mr Fischler, who, unfortunately, cannot be here today."
"However, I will gladly take on board what has been said and try to address as far as possible the arguments put forward in this debate."
"Firstly, I shall try to clarify the Commission's position concerning the amendments that have been tabled."
"First of all on Amendment No 1: the financial compensation of the agreement is one single compensation, which corresponds to access to the waters, as well as compensation for the impact caused by the activity of European Union vessels in third-country waters."
"The fact that the third country in the framework of a fisheries sector dialogue accepts to commit a part of the financial compensation to activities in support of a reform of its own fisheries policy, does not constitute an argument for a differentiation in two different financial envelopes."
"The approach of differentiating financial compensation would result in the refusal of the third country to commit itself to reform its fisheries policy."
"Therefore the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 1."
"On Amendment No 2, which, to a certain extent – if I have understood you correctly – is connected with Amendment No 5, considering the fact that the Commission is responsible for the sound financial management of the Community funds, Amendment No 2 cannot be accepted."
"Indeed, the budgetary authority must give the Commission the means and the legal basis to ensure the sound financial management of this agreement."
"Despite some transfers made in 2003 by the quota-holding Member States, experience shows that these have not been sufficient to ensure the optimum utilisation of the fishing possibilities and thus sound financial management."
"With respect to the argument put forward, how can we guarantee that the principle of relative stability and Article 20(5) of the basic regulation are adhered to?"
"I would like to underline that the temporary transfer of fishing possibilities from one Member State to another by the Commission is contrary to the principle of relative stability, because, in accordance with Article 20(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 on the allocation of fishing possibilities among Member States, such a transfer will not have an effect on the allocation of fishing possibilities between the Member States in Greenland waters in the future."
"The allocation continues – and will continue – to be ruled, on the basis of the distribution keys, as before."
"The Member States that benefit from a temporary transfer cannot exploit the catches made for the changing of the basis of the allocation for the future."
"The determination of the fishing possibilities is made on the basis of scientific reports."
"One innovation of this agreement is precisely that all quotas are now subject to an annual revision, if scientific advice so requests."
"Also, I cannot accept the idea that with this mechanism we are creating a precedent."
"The transfer clause exists and is implemented in all other third-country agreements with financial compensation, without any problem."
"The only agreement that does not have this kind of article is precisely the Greenland agreement."
"That is the situation we want to change now."
"I want to say that in 2003 the commercial value of the catches, including the real catches of the transfers made to Norway, Iceland and the Faroes amounted to EUR 50 million."
"Compared to the current financial compensation of EUR 42.82 million, this is not satisfactory."
"In an agreement with financial compensation, it is unacceptable that the Commission does not have the means to ensure that Community funds are not wasted."
"Having said that, the Commission welcomes the last amendment – Amendment No 5."
"We are responsible for ensuring the sound financial management of Community funds."
"Amendment No 5 shows the willingness of the budgetary authority to provide the Commission with the legal basis to ensure such a ground management without prejudice to relative stability, as I have said before."
"On Amendment No 3, we agree with the spirit thereof, but we believe that the Commission already complies with the transmission of this kind of information in line with both the current interinstitutional arrangements and, in particular, with the framework agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Therefore, Amendment No 3 is not necessary."
"Finally, we cannot accept Amendment No 4."
"I recall in this respect the established principle regarding the nature of a protocol to a fisheries agreement."
"In light of the fact that this is an annex to the framework agreement, its periodic renewal does not require a new mandate."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be held tomorrow at 12 noon."
". In 2003, a new Protocol was agreed with Greenland, covering the period from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2006, within the scope of the mid-term review of the Fourth Protocol, which lays down conditions provided for in the Fisheries Agreement between Greenland and the European Community."
"This review introduces a range of adjustments, but does not alter the level of financial compensation, which remains at EUR 42 820 000 per year."
"The review does, however, make a clearer distinction between amounts set aside to compensate fisheries possibilities and support for structural reform."
"We welcome the increase in halibut quotas, which means that national fleets may now catch 800 tonnes of Greenland halibut."
"It should be noted, however, that, at the time of the decision, Portugal was excluded from this agreement, despite its historical fishing rights in the area."
"Given the extent to which quotas are under-used, we must ensure that the principle of good financial management is applied, in other words, that the fisheries possibilities offered by the international fisheries agreements are used effectively, without undermining the principle of relative stability."
"The report and the Commission proposal open up the possibility of redistributing quotas that are not fully used in a given year."
"We feel, however, that the wording of Amendment No 5 is more acceptable, and that this Amendment should, accordingly, be approved in plenary."
"The next item is the report (A5-0211/2004) by Mr Schmitt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Kingdom of Spain with a view to the adoption of a Council directive on the obligation of carriers to communicate passenger data."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for me the report before us today and this agenda item are among the most difficult of the past legislative period."
"Not because the report is so wide ranging, but because the procedure has proved to be extremely difficult."
"Since the Kingdom of Spain’s initiative to oblige carriers to communicate passenger data was presented, that is since the first document appeared early last year, every month has brought unofficial new versions with the promise of another official one shortly."
"That dragged on really until the start of this year and since we are coming to the end of this legislative period, I presented a report at the beginning of February, based on the old proposal."
"Then in the middle of February, the Council suddenly produced a new document as a result of which I then had to prepare a completely new report."
"To the point in hand, my group agrees with the starting point of saying that it may make sense to oblige carriers to communicate data on persons entering the EU from third countries to the competent border control authorities in advance."
"As presented, however, what the Council has produced is technically far from convincing."
"It is true that the Council went on to correct itself in many respects."
"Originally, for example, it wanted airlines to be obliged to report to the authorities anyone who failed to use their return ticket within 48 hours of the planned date."
"That means that any of us could be suspected of staying somewhere we were not entitled simply because we had not used our ticket, at least not at the planned time."
"On some points the Council has recognised that it is on the wrong track, but in my opinion it has still not provided the necessary tool."
"To this day, for example, there has been no dialogue with the carriers concerned as to how this might actually be done technically, what it will cost and who in the end will pay for it."
"I can only point out that if we want to prevent illegal immigration, we are dealing mainly with third countries that are not exactly wealthy."
"Think about those third countries, we also know that checking in there is in many cases still done manually, the boarding card is not printed out by computer, but you are given a pre-printed card and the seat number is stuck on to it."
"In those cases, airlines would be involved in considerable expense."
"I think that if we have such expectations we must first seek a dialogue with the carriers about how that might be jointly organised."
"Secondly, it does not explain at all convincingly whether the border control authorities will really be able to do anything useful with the data provided."
"In other words, will it make controls easier and more effective?"
"This question has not been examined at all, either in committee meetings or in the document."
"Moreover, this document contains no justification at all, the Council initiative is unreasoned, there is neither a general justification nor a detailed justification for the individual articles."
"One very central point for which I have still not been given a satisfactory explanation is the question of whether the data collected really will make for more effective controls in the country of entry."
"That is why my report and the initiative having been rejected in committee, my group will be abstaining in the vote tomorrow, because our position is that basically we find the idea interesting and it may be expedient, but the technical side of it must be cleanly worked."
"So far, this Council initiative has not done that, and that is why I do not believe we should continue any further down this path."
"It is my sincere wish that we should take a final vote on this initiative tomorrow and not refer it back to committee."
"Tomorrow, at any rate, I shall not be proposing that we do this."
"I believe the road we should take together is that the Commission should submit a sound proposal based on the original Council document (it has already suggested as much itself in a committee meeting) and that we should then have an informed discussion and find a sensible solution."
". Madam President, I should like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, for the work put in with a view to producing his report and the draft resolution."
"You said that the expression of the initiative has changed several times and I think that, following my intervention, you are going to say that it has changed once more at the last minute."
"In fact, in order to be quite clear, the Commission shares the objectives of strengthening controls at external frontiers and combating illegal immigration, which are clearly indicated in the text of the Spanish initiative."
"It is a matter of harmonising practices, which are already in place in several Member States, concerning the transmission of APIS type data, which is not to be confused with PNR type data."
"The personal information in question is in fact limited to elements entered in all passengers’ travel documents, which they have to present in any case when crossing external frontiers."
"Furthermore, the level of data protection offered by the text on which the Parliament is being consulted is sufficiently high and has received the approval of the Article 29 Committee. However, at yesterday’s Justice and Internal Affairs Council, the draft directive was subject to a political agreement following the insertion of amendments proposed by the United Kingdom aimed at authorising the retention of data beyond the period of 24 hours initially laid down in the initiative and their use for more extensive purposes."
"These amendments, which change the scope of the directive, gave rise to doubts on the part of the Commission, which were expressed in a statement attached to the final text."
"In this statement, the Commission asserts that the directive should be interpreted in the light of the objectives imposed on it, namely the strengthening of controls at the frontiers and combating illegal immigration."
"Also, in the statement, the Commission regrets that the provisions added at the request of the United Kingdom could not be examined as part of the measures that the Commission has undertaken to present for June 2004."
"These measures concern the protection of data and the exchange of information between law enforcement authorities in the light in particular of the statement adopted by the European Council on the fight against terrorism."
"Moreover, the Commission is sensitive to the worries of carriers asked to take part in this joint effort."
"However, it is essential not to overstate the logistical and financial consequences which might result from the implementation of the measures put forward by this proposal."
"Apart from the fact that the personal data in question are limited to the information mentioned in passengers’ travel documents, which carriers are already obliged to check at the time of boarding, it should be noted that these data will only be transmitted, according to the provisions of the directive, at the request of the competent national authorities."
"In any case, the Commission is willing to enter into dialogue with the carriers on this matter."
"Madam President, at a time when migration flow management and the fight against illegal immigration are becoming ever more complex, it is very difficult for us to accept this Spanish initiative in either substance or form."
"As regards the form, to accept this initiative would be to condone the Council’s working method, which consists in constantly amending texts proposed to Parliament."
"I applaud the work of the rapporteur and his admirable consistency."
"He was in fact given new versions when he had already drafted his report, so that the earlier text became null and void."
"This is quite unacceptable."
"Quite apart from the energy and time that have been wasted, such an attitude betrays a lack of coordination within the Council and contempt for Parliament and the representatives of the people of Europe, which gives us cause for dismay."
"One may then question the result obtained."
"Is it really effective?"
"Reading the last official text of the Spanish initiative, one comes across the words ‘obligation’ and ‘penalty’ in practically every paragraph."
"The objective is clearly defined; it involves the fight against illegal immigration."
"The penalties should, therefore, essentially concern smugglers of clandestine migrants."
"But no!"
"Penalties and obligations apply to the airlines and we cannot accept that the states should abandon their responsibilities, handing them over to private companies in this way and then penalising them if the work is not done properly."
"In fact, obliging private companies to collect data with a view to controlling illegal immigration means requiring the carriers to take over the obligations of the states."
"The objective of reducing illegal immigration is a legitimate one, but how can the proposed text be effective?"
"There has been no demonstration of its actual operational usefulness, and the fact that only the air carriers are concerned has already weakened its objective."
"This text, if accepted as it stands, would completely disrupt the work of the airlines, since the transmission of data, which is obligatory for these companies, represents a considerable burden in terms of costs."
"In some countries, passports are not machine-readable; in other countries, the machines are not yet available: in order to rectify these failings, Member States do not provide for any system of compensation."
"Also, the system of penalties would be terribly onerous and would not take account of the efforts made by the penalised companies with a view to meeting these obligations."
"In conclusion, then, illegal immigration must of course be combated, but there are, in my view, many other ways."
"We therefore, in fact, reject this initiative and we should like the Commission to make us a proposal in the future, a coherent proposal, and one that respects competences and the public’s rights and duties."
"We trust that the Commission will be able to do this."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this House should not withhold its support for the report by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which rejects the outgoing Spanish Government's initiative."
"After all, we have already adopted two important decisions at 12 noon today."
"This House – with good reason – has already clearly rejected any communication of passenger data to the US border protection and security authorities, and, thank God, it has today also rejected collective expulsion through joint European flights."
"Why, may I ask, should a measure raising so many concerns about data protection suddenly become quite unproblematical as soon as it 'only' affects the European Union?"
"Or are all methods now supposed to be acceptable in combating 'illegal' immigration? Do fundamental rights not count any more?"
"The fundamental right to decide for oneself what is done with one’s personal data is a valuable asset, one with which we must not deal lightly."
"It is derived very clearly not only from the Member States' national constitutions but also from Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"The Community's Data Protection Directive sets high standards for the communication of personal data."
"The Spanish initiative, on the other hand, makes combating illegal immigration through stringent surveillance methods the primary goal – and it is unfortunate that the rapporteur supports this."
"Yet, as all experience has shown – and this must be made very clear – illegal immigration is tackled not through police repression but solely by establishing peaceful conditions worthy of human dignity in other parts of Europe and the world."
"The intention to allow airline companies to collect and communicate passenger data is extremely problematical for a variety of reasons."
"Private companies would thus be granted sovereign rights which, until now, have been reserved solely for government agencies in the Member States – for example, in the event of imminent danger or other cases which must be specifically justified."
"I do not think we should have a situation in Europe in which the movements of millions of people are being spied on."
"What happens if the data are misused?"
"Let us not even think about that."
"The claim that this measure is designed to combat illegal immigration also lacks any credibility."
"I think it is patently absurd to assume that the poorest of the poor who come to Europe generally take the plane – the most expensive route."
"The reality is very different: the large numbers of people who drown as they attempt to cross the Mediterranean or border rivers – and this happens every day – tell a very different story."
"I think it is important to call a halt at last to the authorities' data-collecting zeal, which is spiralling out of control. We should not be embarking on a course which, in the USA, is rightly criticised by all civil liberties organisations."
"Europe does not need uninterrupted surveillance of its passengers and borders."
"What Europe needs is genuine protection for the basic rights of every individual who resides here."
"Madam President, Commissioner, it is better to stop half way than to persevere in an error."
"This is the feeling I am left with in this matter."
"Spain’s original proposal, to block illegal immigrants’ path to the mainland, was less fitting than the plan currently proposed."
"There is a similarity however in that the carriers are still subject to tough requirements. Requirements that are unjust."
"It cannot after all be the intention that duties of customs agencies are simply transferred to the carriers without proper debate, without a mandate."
"If that happens, it should happen so that the effort involved and the financial damage are kept to a minimum."
"This was still not the case in the last proposal either."
"Even more important however is the point that carriers have to know where they stand, they have to know with what legislation they have to comply."
"It is the responsibility of the legislator to communicate this clearly and to remove any duplications or contradictions."
"This is a crucial point in the discussion of the requirements the American authorities are imposing on carriers."
"At the moment it seems as though airlines flying to the United States are working in a legal minefield."
"Any step to one side or the other can have undesirable and far-reaching consequences."
"It is not a worthwhile contribution to their position to impose a further set of requirements regarding the passing on of information."
"Which is why we are not sorry about the rejection of Spain’s initiative."
"While this may not necessarily create a clear situation for the airlines, it does prevent an accumulation of different obligations."
"It is up to the responsible agencies to lay down clear and uniform requirements of the information that airlines are to provide in the interest of everyone on this and the other side of the ocean."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be held tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0205/2004) by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 on the gradual abolition of checks at common borders as regards access to the Schengen Information System by the services in the Member States responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehicles."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for his report."
"This proposal for a regulation follows the path laid out in 1999 by the directive on vehicle registration documents, aimed at combating the legal trafficking in stolen vehicles, and must improve the functioning of the internal market, offering the service responsible for registration of vehicles better access to the biggest European database of stolen vehicles, namely the Schengen Information System."
"Very important financial interests are at stake, as we all know, because every year millions of cars are registered in the States of the Union and thousands of these are stolen."
"Furthermore, by introducing more effective mechanisms for combating vehicle theft, the proposal will have an impact on the security of citizens and consequently on the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Specifically, it provides for the possibility, before the registration of the vehicle, for the national services responsible, under certain conditions to consult the SIS database of stolen vehicles and registration documents and check whether the vehicle in question has already been registered in another State party to the Schengen Agreement."
"This information will make it more difficult for thieves to sell stolen vehicles in another ‘Schengen State’ and at the same time will increase the possibility of victims being able to recover their stolen vehicle."
"The authorities currently lack the resources to verify the origin of at least a million vehicles registered every year."
"The proposal currently being debated will allow for systematic access to the database, and therefore search for vehicles and registration documents and, in order to have access to it, a series of common rules on transparency and a series of principles on data protection will have to be adhered to."
"Compliance with those rules will be monitored in a similar way to other searches carried out within the same SIS database."
"For the sake of data protection, it has been proposed to provide different access for public services and for private services responsible for the registration of vehicles."
"Officials of the public services responsible should have the right to directly consult the Schengen database, while, despite carrying out a public administration function, when the services carrying out this activity are private, they will have restricted access to it, via the police, like the other existing vehicle registration services."
"I would like once again to thank the rapporteur and Parliament for the work you have done."
". Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we must fight fraud and the illegal trade in stolen vehicles and this is the purpose of this proposal."
"Car theft in the Member States has increased to one million, two hundred thousand vehicles per year."
"Indeed, this figure has been exceeded in previous years, and considerable losses have been incurred, totalling EUR 15 million."
"It is therefore essential that we fight this type of crime, which causes not only financial loss, but also physical and psychological damage, in view of the various forms of violence associated with car crime."
"Furthermore, as you have just stated, Commissioner, it affects the citizens’ sense of justice and security."
"More than 3 300 vehicles are stolen every day, which corresponds to approximately one theft every 25 seconds."
"Since I began this speech, two vehicles have, in all likelihood, been stolen and I hope that neither of these belongs to any of the Members present."
"The purpose of modifying the Schengen Convention is to allow the public vehicle registration authorities direct access to certain categories of data contained in the Schengen Information System (SIS)."
"Private vehicle registration services may only have the right to indirect access, via an authority with access to the SIS."
"The SIS will thus become an even more important instrument in the fight against crime, enabling the authorities to check, quickly and efficiently, whether the vehicle whose registration has been requested has been stolen, misappropriated or lost."
"The functioning of the internal market will thus be improved, as the principle of free movement of goods is strengthened, and this, in turn, will help towards the progressive establishment of the area of freedom, security and justice and the implementation of the common transport policy."
"Why direct access?"
"In order to prevent, in good time, vehicles stolen in one country from being registered, and thereby legalised, in another."
"It is calculated that 30% to 40% of the vehicles concerned are stolen by criminal organisations, which then transform them and export them to other countries both inside and outside the EU."
"The whole operation usually takes less than 48 hours."
"There are two key arguments in favour, the first of which is efficiency."
"Several million cars are registered in the EU."
"It would be too much for the police to check all these cars systematically in the SIS."
"Some 15 million vehicles per year are presented for registration."
"Direct access, accordingly, makes it quicker and easier to check the legal status of a vehicle, which means greater efficiency."
"The second argument in favour is transparency."
"Currently, Member States have all found some way to ensure that it can be checked at the moment of registration of the car whether it has been stolen."
"The information that they receive is reasonably reliable, yet these methods are relatively opaque and complicated."
"Including an article in the Schengen Convention would confer greater transparency on the entire process."
"What kind of data are we speaking about?"
"Access should only be given to data concerning vehicles with a cylinder capacity above 55 cc, and data concerning trailers and caravans with an unladen weight exceeding 750 kg."
"It is proposed to increase access to data that are not yet covered by the SIS, namely data concerning registration certificates and number plates that have been stolen misappropriated or lost."
"This is the only way in which the desired aims can be achieved."
"The Spanish initiatives, which we welcome here, concerning the SIS’s new functions, in particular in the fight against terrorism, already provided for integrating these data in the SIS, but have yet to be adopted due to a parliamentary reserve by Denmark."
"We trust that those initiatives will be adopted as soon as possible."
"I propose the deletion, however, of the proposal on access to data concerning issued identity papers, in accordance with the advice of the Schengen Joint Supervisory Authority, along with data concerning blank official documents."
"The scope of such a concept would be too wide-ranging and too vague."
"The set of data accessible to vehicle registration authorities is, therefore, clearly defined and limited to what is necessary and appropriate."
"Access to those data deemed too sensitive will thus be removed and will be limited to objects, in other words, the vehicles themselves."
"I should like to call on this House to endorse this initiative and to reject the proposal tabled by the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Pacciotti, of the Socialist Group, which advocates keeping the current system of indirect access in place."
"Should that proposal be adopted, nothing will change and we will not make any headway in combating these crimes."
"I trust that I have set out the case clearly by giving evidence of the numbers involved, which are ample illustration of the need to establish new ways of combating automobile crime."
"The situation, as it stands, must not be allowed to continue."
"Mrs Paccioti fears that by allowing direct access we will increase the risk of the misuse of personal data."
"I have always advocated the most rigorous protection for the fundamental rights of our citizens, including the right to the protection of personal data."
"In view of amendments that I have tabled to the Commission’s original proposal – all of which have been approved by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs – I do not believe that the protection of personal data is jeopardised."
"The access given to the public vehicle registration authorities will be clearly defined and limited to what is necessary and appropriate, in other words, solely concerning objects, in other words, the vehicles themselves, in order to ascertain from the system whether or not the vehicle in question has been stolen."
"Mr President, to reject this step would, to my mind, be a bad decision, as we would remain ineffective in combating this type of crime."
"It would also send out the wrong signal to our citizens, who want to see closer cooperation and greater efficiency in combating crime and in ensuring their security."
"– Mr President, I must thank the Commission representative and the rapporteur, who have been extremely clear in expounding their views."
"It is surely inevitable that, when databases are set up to store a large amount of information, there is then a temptation to use them for a wide variety of purposes."
"This may be useful and legitimate on certain conditions, particularly with regard to the citizens’ fundamental right to the protection of their personal data, as enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"A demand has now arisen for vehicle registration agencies to be able to check whether a vehicle has been stolen and whether an applicant’s documents are genuine by obtaining all the necessary information stored in the Schengen Information System."
"Problems connected with the legal basis would seem to prevent the use of data relating to identity papers, according to the rapporteur, and so the information should be confined to data on motor vehicles."
"The draft regulation remains useful even with these limitations."
"What I cannot agree with is that the information should not be supplied by the police or customs authorities who have responsibility for storing and processing Schengen data, but should be acquired directly by public registration agencies through direct access to the SIS database."
"This access by the huge number of vehicle registration bodies in the 25 Member States would be a serious threat to the protection of personal data stored in the Schengen system."
"The nature of the services responsible for citizens’ security, the rules and controls to which they are subject, and the purposes for which they may use any data that may come to their knowledge are very different from those relating to administrative bodies, in the public sector or otherwise, that take care of vehicle registration."
"Besides, I cannot see what urgent need there is to allow direct access to Schengen data, given that this would not be allowed for any registration bodies that were private rather than public in nature under the rules of different countries."
"This would cause a disparity in rules that would increase confusion rather than make the provision more effective."
"It would be better, then, to regulate the use of Schengen data by vehicle registration agencies by allowing all of them the same indirect access, which would avoid any risk of abuse and would respect the principle of proportionality."
"– Mr President, according to the report, this modest proposal is aimed, of course, at combating fraud and the illegal trade in stolen motor vehicles, and the means to be used is increased access to the Schengen Information System."
"I quote the report: ‘[The proposal] will make the SIS an even more prominent instrument to fight crime and… [promote] work towards the progressive establishment of the area of freedom, security and justice.’"
"Despite this, the legal basis for the proposal is transport policy – to which I am returning – namely Article 71."
"It pains me to say it, Commissioner and Mr Coelho, but this is a legal and juridico-political farce."
"I shall confine my remarks to three points."
"First, regarding the Schengen project in general, which of course constitutes the most extensive system in world history of supervision and political and social control."
"From annual reports and surveys, we know that, in 2001, the Schengen Information System’s database contained more than ten million individual pieces of information."
"This most recently published figure is undoubtedly much larger today."
"Anyone with the slightest sense of justice must pose the following questions: Who may record what?"
"Who may retrieve which information, and how may the information be used?"
"A reading of the texts supplies no certain answers."
"The criteria are so elastic that it really is up to the system’s many users to define the limits; and the many users amount to approximately 125 000 terminals connected to the central database in Strasbourg."
"What, for example, is the meaning of Article 96 where, according to one of the conditions, people’s presence is assumed to constitute a threat to public order."
"Such uncertain criteria require thoroughgoing controls, but the system offers no real controls."
"What is termed the Joint Supervisory Authority has, in several annual reports, expressed its lack of ability to function independently."
"The working conditions are so poor that the Supervisory Authority has declared that its supervision functions as an alibi for the use of police instruments."
"The Supervisory Authority possesses neither the independence nor the resources necessary for the system to function effectively and affords only modest guarantees in connection with the collection and exchange of information that takes place in the SIS and the even more advanced SIRNE system."
"This is the general background to the proposal, which is an extension of Schengen cooperation."
"I turn now to my two supplementary questions to the acting Commissioner."
"The legal basis that I mentioned earlier completes the farce."
"It is Article 71, which deals with transport policy."
"It is absurd, regardless of the legal technicalities referred to by the Commission."
"Finally, in my own little country, Denmark, we have a special regulation pertaining to the extension of Schengen cooperation or the Schengen regulations."
"How does the Danish protocol work in this area, Commissioner?"
"The mysterious legal basis is possibly the explanation of why the Danish Council representative, with whom I talked today, simply declared himself unfamiliar with the proposal."
"No wonder, either, if the proposal is camouflaged as transport policy."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his work in bringing this report before Parliament."
"I am sure that, like me, he is deeply impressed with the vast amount of support he has received from his colleagues in the PPE-DE Group and that side of the House in the list of speakers before us tonight."
"Notwithstanding that, this is an important issue."
"He has told us of the 1.2 million vehicles stolen in the European Union."
"Clearly, in every country there is a percentage of criminals who do not abide by laws and regulations."
"Presumably – and he may know better than I – these thieves have differing motives for their crimes."
"We must remember that a fraction – albeit a very small one – of these car thieves have very serious ulterior motives."
"Whether they are involved in illegal drugs, the supplying of illegal weapons or international terrorism, these are international issues which cross European borders."
"Colleagues have expressed worries about data protection and concerns as to whether there are sufficiently robust safeguards contained in the Schengen Agreement."
"From the United Kingdom's point of view, it means that there will now be access to international data that will help in the fight against international cross-border crime, which we all take very seriously."
"There are also those who are concerned about the idea of direct access to the data and the question as to whether there are sufficient guarantees for the protection of the data and the protection of citizens, and whether we are setting a dangerous precedent here."
"I share and understand those concerns."
"Nevertheless, as responsible citizens and elected representatives of the people, we need to do what we can in the fight against serious crime."
"The theft of vehicles is of course very important, but it is what it leads on to and all other aspects connected with it that must focus our attention."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0144/2004) by Mr Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament entitled ‘Towards more accessible, equitable and managed asylum systems’."
". Mr President, I am aware, as we all are, of the serious problems that currently beset the traditional European system of providing asylum."
"In a world that is becoming ever smaller and better connected by sophisticated methods of communication, a world in which islands of wealth, peace and well-being are surrounded by poverty, war and destitution, considerable migratory pressures from the less-favoured regions are inevitably brought to bear on wealthier parts of the world."
"This vast migratory mass, which is mainly driven by economic motives, is jeopardising the asylum system, as many economic migrants, without any other legal means of entering rich countries, try to take the asylum route to gain access to EU territory."
"I therefore welcome the Commission’s two communications."
"We must establish the asylum system called for at the Tampere European Council."
"New policies, however, must be drawn up to take account of new realities, such as the mixed flows of refugees and economic migrants, substantially greater now than at the time of the Tampere Council."
"Asylum seekers will, of course, continue to arrive in numbers at the EU’s external borders and it is for them that much of the current Tampere system is designed."
"It is, accordingly, essential to maintain what is already in the and to adopt directives still awaiting the Council’s assent, in order to finalise the first part laid down by Tampere on the status of refugees and on asylum procedures, and, in so doing, to move on to the second stage of development."
"The Council must, therefore, be urged to adopt at the earliest opportunity the directives to which I have just alluded, which were repeatedly requested at the Laeken, Seville and Thessaloniki Councils."
"The current system clearly has its shortcomings."
"Many asylum seekers do not actually need asylum."
"In fact, most of those in genuine need remain in their regions of origin or in border areas, where they are subjected to persecution, distress, indignity, hunger and death."
"I therefore endorse the Commission’s position that we must look into new methods of asylum that are better suited to the reality of the situation."
"A new policy must be established to process asylum seekers at the point of arrival in the EU, by means of a Community-wide resettlement scheme and by means of protected entry procedures."
"Asylum and immigration are two distinct, yet intrinsically linked phenomena, which must be addressed together."
"I should like to reiterate our call for economic aid to be increased, with no provisos attached, for the regions of origin of migratory flows, with the aim of reducing those flows and of promoting solidarity with the poorest countries and with the people who are most in need."
"I therefore call on the EU to establish a policy of legal immigration, in which the only means of entering EU territory legally for economic migrants is to ask for asylum, as this is jeopardising the very survival of the system."
"Europe, Mr President, is the land of asylum and the system must be protected if we are to keep up this humanitarian tradition."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank Parliament for this opportunity to discuss these essential issues."
"As you know, in application of the previous communication, the Thessalonica European Council gave the Commission another mandate to explore all the parameters guaranteeing the ordered and managed entry into the European Union of persons needing international protection by means of asylum, and the means and resources for increasing the capacity for protection in the regions of origin, and to present a report to the Council before June 2004."
"There are naturally clear links between the two communications – in relation to asylum, that of 2003, and the next Commission communication – and your report and today's debates will greatly enhance the work we are carrying out within the Commission and which we will present shortly."
"I would like to begin by saying that I am pleased that the report approves the analysis of the deficiencies of the current protection regime of the asylum system, which undermine the credibility and integrity of the institution of asylum and public support for it."
"Within this context, it is essential to reach an agreement on the directive on asylum procedures, which in reality is the only extraordinary measure still outstanding."
"I would like to take this opportunity to stress that the new approach we are exploring in the communication, the subject of your report, indicates a change of focus: to move away from what we can do to reduce numbers of applications but rather to make progress towards what we can do to improve our work, that is to say, in order to better protect a number of refugees – which we suspect will be greater at global level – trying to find new ways to improve accessibility, fairness and management of the international protection system."
"It is also therefore a question of a better use of funds and of the budgets available to us."
"Within this context, I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the rapporteur and the European Parliament for the very constructive role they have played in order to move forward the Aeneas programme, which will contribute to helping third receiving countries, providing them with financial and technical assistance so that they can deal with the pressures they are under when dealing with refugees over long periods of time."
"Nevertheless, financial and technical assistance alone is not enough."
"It is necessary to share burdens and responsibility if the European Union wants to demonstrate that its desire for international protection to become more equitable is a genuine one."
"Within this context, we could offer to relieve some of the pressure on receiving countries, offering places for resettling refugees within the European Union."
"The next communication will go into more detail on the reasoned analysis and the parameters for a possible resettlement plan within the European Union, and it is clear that such considerations must be contained within a global context in which the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) will obviously play an important role, given the links with the current global debates on the strategic use of resettlement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the report produced by Parliament and of course – and I address this in particular to the rapporteur – it will be taken into account in the next Commission communication."
"Mr President, when we talk about asylum, we must point out that we are talking about a right which assists any person with a justified fear of persecution and that international law, Community law and internal legislations legally oblige the European Union and its Member States to respect that right. And it is essential that the institution of the right to asylum is not affected by the crisis currently facing the asylum system, possibly as a result of abuses of its use."
"I would like to congratulate the institutions because, finally, five years after the Tampere European Council, we are tackling the creation of a European asylum system which must involve common standards for reception, the processing of applications and assistance for asylum seekers."
"The European Union should, firstly, adapt the conditions in which asylum seekers are currently received to Europe's own standards in terms of individual rights and guarantees, hygiene and welfare."
"Secondly, we should take this opportunity to adapt to the current reality and include amongst cases granted asylum those of women and children threatened with genital mutilation, child soldiers and the victims of new forms of slavery."
"As draftsman of the opinion for the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I am pleased that the improvement of asylum systems and the possible establishment of a common European system is not being carried out from a policing point of view, but also by taking account of political aspects and the development and human rights problems which are at the root of both asylum applications and the mass economic migration which is sometimes disguised as asylum."
"The Commission's approach should include measures for creating systems of freedoms which respect human rights in the countries of origin, and the establishment of the essential security conditions in neighbouring countries."
"This would reduce the pressure from genuine asylum seekers at European borders."
"For bogus asylum seekers, the tendency for economic migrants to use the institution of asylum can only be stopped if we fund cooperation projects in the countries of origin which offer prospects for development."
"For a long time the Socialist Group has supported co-development measures, in other words, specific development of the places of origin of migration in order to facilitate return and discourage immigration or the abuse of asylum."
"I hope that the next Parliament will have the opportunity to give its opinion on the definitive establishment of a common asylum system."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as the rapporteur, Mr Marinho, pointed out, people have always sought, and continue to seek – and in ever-increasing numbers – better opportunities or protection outside their country or origin, in their attempts to flee persecution, war, human rights violations, or simply poverty and unemployment."
"In accordance with the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice, and in line with the outcome of the Tampere Summit, we have adopted various legal measures and instruments concerning the three categories, namely, asylum seekers, temporarily displaced persons and economic migrants."
"Member States, as the rapporteur has stated, are currently facing a crisis in the asylum system caused by abuses of the various procedures with the increase in mixed flows, a problem that is often exacerbated by the operations of trafficking networks."
"This phenomenon has had terrible consequences, which have been reflected in public unease."
"Consequently, it is essential that we establish a policy that encompasses three key elements: firstly, the application of the Geneva Convention; secondly, the legitimate aspirations of citizens of third countries to seek better living conditions; and thirdly, the capacity of each Member State, and that of the EU as a whole, to welcome refugees."
"At the root of this balanced policy must always be a joint framework of related measures established following detailed examination at Tampere."
"We must also adopt harmonised, transparent, efficient and swift procedures."
"The Commission has drafted proposals and obtained Parliament’s opinion in all the areas of asylum policy referred to in the Tampere conclusions."
"The Council, on the other hand, has missed the deadlines set by the Tampere, Laeken, Seville and Thessaloniki European Councils and, five years on, we still await its decisions."
"The Thessaloniki European Council reminded the Council of the need to ensure that the still-outstanding proposals for directives on minimum standards for asylum and immigration were adopted at the earliest opportunity."
"The Commission was called on to explore all parameters in order to ensure more orderly and managed entry into the EU of persons in need of international protection, and to examine how the regions of origin may better ensure the safety of those persons."
"Today’s debate concerns the report by Mr Marinho, whom I should like to congratulate on the quality of his work."
"The report is based on two Commission communications, which, although they are prompted by different considerations, are, nonetheless, both concerned with the premises and the basics aims of a possible new approach to more accessible, equitable and managed asylum systems, and they explore new paths which will complement the progressive approach established at Tampere."
"In my opinion, Mr President, for a coherent overall approach to be sustained as regards the establishment of a common EU policy on asylum and immigration, the following key elements must be present: the existence of paths of legal immigration, a policy on integration, joint management of migratory flows, more rigorous controls of external borders, a European asylum system, negotiations on readmission agreements and common policy on return, the need to combat human trafficking and illegal immigration effectively and to support the victims of such crimes."
"Mr President, the Marinho report on asylum systems in Europe seems to me to miss the point."
"What in fact was the question asked?"
"It was first and foremost a matter of what response should be given to the report presented by the British Government to the European Council in spring last year entitled ‘New international approaches to asylum processing and protection’."
"This report, which made a good deal of sense, posed the huge question as to the need to regain control of asylum systems which are currently creaking under the pressure of immense migratory flows."
"It was followed by a communication from the Commission making simple questions complex and confusing the issue with the title ‘Towards more accessible, equitable and managed asylum systems’, which utterly twists the meaning of the British report."
"It is remarkable that the European Parliament report being examined today makes frequent reference to the Commission communication, but does not even mention the British Government’s report in its citations."
"Such disdain for a Member State strikes me as scarcely tolerable."
"I shall, therefore, base my remarks on this report."
"It makes four points: one, financial aid to refugees is poorly distributed; two, the current asylum system is of no benefit to the great majority of refugees, the most vulnerable, who are still in place with little protection; three, the very great majority of asylum seekers in the European Union do not meet the criteria needed to obtain the status of refugee or additional protection; four, those denied the right of asylum usually stay here illegally without being sent back to their countries of origin."
"Faced with these challenges, the British report asks in particular for the creation of protection zones in the regions of origin in order to provide accessible refuges and the establishment of transit processing centres outside the EU, where the refugees admitted could be offered access to the participating countries and the others would be sent back to their countries of origin."
"The report submitted to us today is no more than evasive in its response to these questions and proposals."
"In particular, in its paragraph 16, it rejects the idea of protection zones or transit centres outside the EU as not offering sufficient protection, and, in paragraph 8, it proposes, as a response to the multiplication of false applications for asylum, expanding the possibilities for legal immigration, which – as Mr Marinho has just pointed out – would in actual fact be an even worse remedy."
"Overall, Mr President, this report does not seem to have taken account of either the dramatic problem faced by our societies, whose survival is now at stake, or the need for in-depth revision of our asylum procedures and for our efforts to be directed, as a matter of priority, towards the political stabilisation and economic development of the countries from which these people are driven, in their despair, to emigrate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0143/2004) by Mr Scarbonchi, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on budgetisation of the European Development Fund (EDF)."
". Mr President, since 1959, the intergovernmental fund intended to finance cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries, known as the EDF, which covers a period of five years as part of the Cotonou agreements, has operated on the basis of contributions from the states involving cost sharing."
"France and Germany today provide almost 42% of the total financing."
"The fund is managed by the Commission, with delegation to the beneficiary countries."
"For the period 2003-2007, over EUR 15 billion are available for new commitments, more than 10 billion for payments."
"It should be noted, which is scandalous, that a balance of 11 billion euros are available because they have not been used under the terms of the sixth, seventh and eighth EDF."
"After numerous vain attempts on its part, the Commission felt that, as the ninth EDF was due to expire in 2007, when the enlargement of the EU would already have taken place and as the debate on the financial framework after 2006 had started, it was time for another debate on the inclusion of the EDF in the budget."
"The Commission is therefore in line with the constant concern expressed for years by Parliament, mindful of budgetary discipline, about the rapid and effective application of resources and the role of codecision which would be devolved to it by inclusion in the budget, whereas today its role in this area is non-existent and it can quite simply not perform its budgetary control task."
"In view of the current malfunctions, what are the advantages of inclusion in the budget?"
"Firstly, providing democratic legitimacy thanks to parliamentary control over the financing of the EDF."
"Secondly, ending the clumsiness of the procedures, rationalising them, simplifying them, coming closer to the beneficiaries, accelerating the rate of cash withdrawal, improving the effectiveness of the aid."
"Thirdly, introducing transparency."
"The complexity of the current system makes it totally opaque as regards the use of the funds."
"Fourthly, as regards the balance to be liquidated, the EUR 11 billion I mentioned earlier, sensible improvements could be brought in by inclusion in the budget."
"Fifthly, ensuring that all states contribute."
"As you know, if the EDF stays outside the budget, the total value of the tenth EDF risks being limited by the low contributions made by the ten new members of the European Union."
"On the other hand, if the EDF is included in the budget, the contributions of Member States will be set by budgetary rules."
"Sixthly, preventing delays in the entry into force of the EDF owing to the obligation of Member States and the ACP countries to ratify the Cotonou financial protocol."
"If the EDF is included in the budget, ratification disappears, hence a gain in time in the use of the EDF funds."
"Of course, there are risks and the ACP countries, like some Member States of the Union, are particularly sensitive to these risks."
"The risks are: ensuring a fixed level of financing, fearing that the funds reserved for the ACP countries are devoted to other uses or transferred to other applications, as was seen for Iraq or Afghanistan, as could be seen for the reconstruction of a state."
"This worry is real and it will be noted that the budget has technical means of safeguarding the credits allocated to the EDF."
"The financial projections set ceilings for the heads for several years and it would therefore be sufficient to create a sub-head, as there are today for headings 1 and 7, in order to prevent and limit this risk."
"Next, there is the whole problem of multiannual planning."
"The EDF covers five years."
"Over five years, these funds may be used or carried forward."
"The fear of the ACP countries is that, under the terms of inclusion in the budget, after one year, unused funds would be lost."
"This is why we are asking, with the agreement of the Commission, for a regulation to be drawn up establishing the multiannual nature of the EDF and allowing the funds to be used according to technical criteria to be put in place and which are practically already in existence today."
"This is important, because it would make it possible to reassure the ACP countries which are afraid not only that the total amount of the EDF will drop, but also that they will lose a large part of the funds previously allocated to them."
"Next, and this is important psychologically, in human terms, politically and technically, the ACP countries must be involved in the management of these European Development Funds."
"How?"
"We propose in Article 11: quite simply by giving the ACP Parliamentary Assembly and the ACP countries the ability to question, the ability to verify and the ability to protest with regard to the use of these funds, which would be done under the control of the European Parliament and in codecision with the Commission."
"This involves elements that I should like briefly to present to you."
"Everyone knows this dossier well."
"If it is approved tomorrow and above all if it is accepted by Member States in the future, which is going to be a difficult task, as will getting it accepted by the ACP countries, it would be a true revolution, since it would finally mean the third EU policy not included in the budget being incorporated into its framework, something that we consider to be of benefit to us, to the ACP countries and above all to development policy, which certainly needs it."
". Mr President, I would firstly like to say that the Commission values Parliament's report and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Scarbonchi, for the excellent work he has done."
"I would like to say that the budgetisation of the EDF can promote the efficiency and flexibility of our development aid as a contribution to the eradication of poverty."
"It will put an end to the peculiar situation of administrating the aid to these countries by means of two different systems and we will thereby be able to increase the efficiency of the funds."
"Furthermore, it will allow us to establish political and budgetary normality, and simplify and harmonise the procedures, also allowing us to strengthen democratic responsibility, by making it possible for the European Parliament to play its full role as budgetary authority in this important area."
"Budgetisation does not jeopardise the qualitative achievements of the Cotonou Agreement."
"Nevertheless, we understand the concern of the ACP countries about the risks relating to it, in particular with regard to the future level of aid."
"We entirely agree with Parliament that there should be no reduction in the funds intended for cooperation with the ACP countries, and the Commission's communication clearly stipulates that the aid to these countries must be maintained, as a minimum, at its current level, and furthermore evolve in accordance with the whole of the heading and, at least, the European Union's gross domestic product."
"We also agree with Parliament that we should provide the ACP countries with a degree of protection in order to prevent the funds made available to them from being used for other purposes."
"We believe that the best solution to this problem is legislation decided jointly between Parliament and the Council with a reference sum for a period of one year."
"The Commission’s Communication on budgetisation has given rise to an intense debate, within various bodies, with the ACP countries, with the Member States of the Union, in Parliament and in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and has brought cooperation with these countries to the forefront of political debate at a time when the financial perspectives for the period are being debated."
"The Council has not yet adopted a definitive position on the issue and the choice between budgetisation or EDF remains open."
"But it is necessary to reach a Community position on budgetisation during this year, since the negotiations on the revision of the Cotonou Agreement are expected to be held between May 2004 and February 2005."
"I would like once again to thank the rapporteur for his work and guarantee that the Commission believes that the level of aid for ACP countries must be maintained and that if there is new support for other countries or if the Commission's efforts are increased in other geographical areas, other than the ACP countries, it must not be at the expense of the ACP countries, but quite simply the global volume of the funds intended for these extremely important European Union policies will be increased."
". – Mr President, firstly I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur for an excellent report and for the fact that most of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Budgets have been included in it."
"The European Development Fund came from the desire on the part of the Member States to help regions in Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific develop."
"At present all EU Member States participate in the funding, although the way they do differs slightly from how they contribute proportionately to the European Union budget."
"The management of the European Development Fund is confusing."
"The agreement on the fund has to be ratified by all EU countries and two thirds of the recipient countries."
"This generally takes years."
"As a result there have been delays in its implementation and fluctuations in the degree of financing."
"The funds are managed by the Commission, but the authorities in the ACP countries implement the projects."
"One problem is the weak administrative capacities of the recipient countries."
"There is poor parliamentary control."
"The European Parliament grants discharge, but it is difficult to clarify administrative procedures and clear accounts."
"A consequence of this confused system of management is inefficiency."
"Because each development fund is meant to be used in its entirety, the result is that what is left over from previous funds is transferred to subsequent funds."
"At the same time there has been an increase in outstanding commitments, which now stand at EUR 11 billion."
"At the same time the same countries are being granted development aid out of EU budget funds, to the tune of approximately EUR 700 million in 2002, for example."
"These funds are managed in accordance with the EU’s Financial Regulation."
"They are made available during the budget procedure, the Commission is responsible for how they are used, and the financial statements come under scrutiny during the discharge procedure."
"It is important for EU development cooperation and in the interests of the ACP countries that the management of the European Development Fund can be simplified and made to work more efficiently."
"That is why the Commission’s initiative to integrate the EDF into the EU budget is right."
"That way administration would be simplified and made to work more efficiently, the funding procedure would be stabilised, and future financing via the EU would be harmonised as one whole process."
"For that reason, the Committee on Budgets supports the Commission proposal on this matter."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is not the first time that this Parliament has called for integration of the European Development Fund in the EU budget."
"This is an item that has been put on the agenda with clockwork regularity over the past 25 years."
"But given the point at which we now find ourselves, Europe must not and cannot let this go."
"It will not be up to us here in Parliament."
"If the Council adopts the advice of Parliament, the European Union will be another step closer to a really democratic and transparent policy."
"It is out of date for the EDF not to fall within the power of the Budgetary Authority."
"It is also out of date for Parliament not to have any say in the level of the funding, the programming or the allocations for each country, region or sector."
"We are after all talking about half of the total EU development aid budget!"
"Currently the EDF escapes our parliamentary control almost entirely and this lack of control is by no means redressed by the only power that the Parliament does have in respect of the EDF, that of granting discharge."
"Apart from this democratic deficit, there is a second drawback to keeping the EDF outside the budget, which is the duplications that occur in the annual budgets of the Union and the EDF."
"The funding of food aid, humanitarian aid and thematic operations in ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) countries often comes out of the Community budget."
"This duplication means that one monetary flow of aid passes from the same donor to the same beneficiary under two different procedures."
"That really should convince the Council."
"It is also inconsistent with the reforms that began some years ago in the external relations sector of the Commission."
"Budgetisation of the EDF requires a change in the administrative procedures and a change of mentality."
"I expressly seek the guarantee from the European Commission and the Commissioner that this will be carried out with care and that the Cotonou Agreement will remain the framework for the budgetised EDF, so that we do not lose the benefits of the present system, such as reciprocal involvement of the ACP countries and Europe and the multi-annual programming of the budget."
"However, in view of the benefits of integration of the EDF in the budget, this must not be an impediment to seizing this opportunity."
"As regards content, integration of the EDF in the Community budget means that as a Parliament we can really work on achieving the millennium goals."
"I repeat, half of our entire budget is in the EDF."
"It must be stipulated in the budgets of the ACP countries that a minimum of 35% of the funds are to go to social welfare, 20% of which to education and healthcare."
"We must ensure, though, that specific allocations for countries and regions remain the basis and that movement of investments only takes place in consultation with the ACP countries."
"Finally, I would point out that on integration of the EDF in the budget the coherence principle must be strictly maintained, so that aid and hands are put to work combating poverty."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this Commission proposal is eminently suitable for making the overall effort of Europe for the poorest countries, the ACP countries, very much more effective, more serious and more democratically controlled."
"I hope that you, with our support, will be successful in the Council."
"I would expect all countries to see the benefits that I have enumerated here."
"Mr President, Mr Scarbonchi’s report poses a series of good questions."
"For several years, we, the Greens, have been fighting for parliamentary control and transparency, the guarantees of democracy."
"It is normal that the allocation and use of credits should be controlled by a body that is representative and democratic – characteristics that the EDF has not, it is true to say, manifested up to now."
"Inclusion in the budget is one of the ways in which control of this programme may be guaranteed."
"It gives rise, however, to new problems."
"How to prevent the risk of transferring one budget heading to another, if there is no provision for some sort of ring-fencing?"
"How to combine the Parliament’s annual budgetary compartmentalisation with the EDF’s five-year budget?"
"The report does not provide enough solutions; it is a pity, since the flaws will affect the quality of control."
"Furthermore, mention cannot be made of the EDF without referring to other risks of misinterpretation."
"How do we prevent this programme, controlled exclusively by European institutions, from favouring, for example, European enterprises in the ACP countries?"
"How do we prevent the development of large projects favouring powerful states being preferred to the initiatives of less influential states or micro-projects closer to the needs of the population?"
"Worse still, how are we to ensure that it will not be used as a roundabout means of financing armies on the pretext of keeping the peace?"
"All this would divert the EDF from its purpose, which is development."
"Quite to the contrary, it would make more sense to use the EDF for actions aimed at improving public health or environmental protection policies, for example."
"To work for development, in fact, it would be more logical to delegate control to the joint ACP/EU Parliamentary Assembly."
"This would give us a real advance, guaranteeing real democratic control."
"In fact, who is better placed to rule on the allocation and use of credits than the joint Parliamentary Assembly, in terms of both political legitimacy and capability?"
"It still needs to be given the means and the responsibilities."
"All those Members who have spoken have said how dear democratic principles are to them."
"It is for the sake of their defence and their effectiveness that we cannot content ourselves with simple control by Parliament."
"We shall, however, support this report as the symbol of a first step, one that is decisive, but doubtless insufficient."
"Mr President, I regret that this debate is taking place now while the ACP countries are still establishing their position on budgetisation."
"It sends the wrong signal to take the decision to budgetise without a full exchange of views with our partners, specifically because it is not clear how this partnership will be maintained once the EDF is budgetised."
"It is crucial that these concerns are addressed in an open constructive dialogue with our ACP partners and that all options are fully explored before reaching a decision."
"Mr Scarbonchi and the Commission have already mentioned the evident benefits of budgetisation for the EU."
"I am not quite as confident as the Commission about the gains for the ACP countries, for instance concerning the level of funding, the predictability and multiannuality of the funds."
"What is the future of the ACP-EU partnership under budgetisation?"
"Several ways of ring-fencing the Development Fund in the EU budgets have been proposed."
"They all imply special budgetary procedures, revision of EU financial regulations and of budgetary principles."
"How can we ensure that the necessary modifications for the adequate protection of funds will be adopted?"
"Why does the Commission communication make no explicit analysis of the possible impact of budgetisation on future levels of commitments or disbursements?"
"Transfers and reallocation of resources between heading and subheading are possible under Article 274 of the EC Treaty."
"Will the budgetary authority protect the EDF once it is included in the budget, or will it address new emerging EU concerns, such as the new objectives stated in the recent declaration on combating terrorism?"
"These are some of the questions I would like to have answered before I can make up my mind on this important issue."
"As I have said, I would like to have this debate knowing the position of the ACP countries."
"Mr President, my congratulations and thanks to the rapporteur."
"First of all, no-one here this evening should claim that budgetisation is a silver bullet for the ACP for the delivery of the EDF."
"However, at the outset we should say that budgetisation would mean that we would no longer stash away hundreds of millions of euro, as has happened under the EDF – money meant for countries which for various reasons were not efficient spenders."
"It is the case that we should not underestimate, as Mrs Sandbæk has said, the ACP's concerns, but it is wrong for Mrs Sandbæk to say that there is no dialogue on budgetisation."
"It is happening, the ACP are preparing documents and there is clear discussion going on."
"For some of the issues that have been raised, guarantees must be offered that resource levels for the ACP will be maintained and increased, and that means a five-year financial framework has to be jointly agreed with the ACP."
"We can fairly assume now that there is agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the ACP that there has to be ring-fencing over a five-year financial framework."
"The suggestion I made some time ago that we should have a sub-heading has not found favour."
"We might still choose to push that with the Commission, but certainly ring-fencing is something that is agreed."
"I believe that as things stand the ACP can now hold its own in the budgets on the basis that it is by no means the worst-performing region that we deal with under external relations."
"It is quite condescending to presume or to suggest that the ACP could not manage that relationship under the budgets."
"Concerns are raised about multiannual funding of projects."
"Currently under the budget the so-called sunset clause applies and there will undoubtedly be pressure on the ACP to complete over a three-year timescale."
"But I personally have no difficulty with a three-year timescale."
"Very often I have been more worried than I like to say about projects which have ceased to be effective, which needed to be terminated and closed down, so a three-year period is something that we can work with quite easily."
"The ACP is concerned about how co-management will be effective and about the role of the NAOs."
"It seems to me that the main priority for the ACP is not just about how they maintain administration of ACP aid, but how they maintain ownership of their own priorities and their own development strategies."
"There should be no fundamental problem with the Commission delegation signing contracts – why should that be a problem, because that would certainly speed up the process?"
"I have seen far too many NAOs drowning under tenders and contracts."
"Far better for them to have the wherewithal to deal with development priorities."
"Finally, the principles of partnership are at the heart of the Cotonou Agreement."
"We want the ACP to be the centre of the dialogue and, as others have said, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has an important role to play and assists us in focusing the Commission's mind on the views of the ACP and of ACP parliamentarians."
"Mr President, I am pleased to endorse your congratulations and I thank the rapporteur for his report, because integration of the European Development Fund in the budget is a long-cherished wish. Not only because of the lack of transparency, both in the decision-making and in the execution."
"We have to concede that the procedures were particularly cumbersome and we have found that hopeless delays have therefore occurred, to such an extent in fact that a backlog of EUR 11 billion in allocated funds has arisen for which the payments have yet to be made."
"It is especially shocking for public opinion to discover that poverty in the developing countries is increasing all the time and that there is no efficient way of channelling the money and of supporting the necessary projects directly and efficiently."
"We consider this budgetisation highly desirable, although we are aware that it is not a magic wand."
"So far it has been a matter of voluntary contributions and we wonder whether we will secure the guarantees that the funds will be kept up."
"The Commissioner has certainly promised us that this will be the case, but provision still has to be made for the relevant mechanisms."
"Securing the level of the funds is one thing, but the guarantee that we will now really have a say in the assessment that the millennium goals will be taken seriously is another."
"For me it is not at all a question of reducing the autonomy of the ACP countries in this respect."
"Any intervention would after all have to take place on the basis of a jointly agreed Country Strategy Paper and a Community action plan in which we must take the participation of the ACP countries seriously."
"I understand the disquiet of our ACP partners in part, but it would nonetheless be a disappointment if budgetisation were to be to the benefit of transparency but there were to be no efficiency in the spending of the funds."
"I therefore hope that we shall succeed both in maintaining the level and increasing the efficiency and the transparency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been a Member of this House for fifteen years, and for fifteen years, my group has been demanding the budgetisation of the EDF."
"It is an untenable situation that a fund with an overall budget of this level is not subject to any democratic parliamentary control."
"I believe it is essential to establish this control."
"Mr Scarbonchi's report identifies an adequate range of options to safeguard this control without inflicting any damage on the ACP countries, because special consideration must undoubtedly be given to ensuring that no ACP country is put at a disadvantage."
"Until now, the Council has been engaged in a kind of poker game over this issue, which is why the entry into force of the 9th EDF was delayed until 2003."
"It is absolutely essential that Parliament, in partnership and cooperation with the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, should be able to exert its influence."
"Implementing the objectives defined in the Cotonou Agreement must naturally be given priority, but the European Parliament can exercise accountability towards the public as well, which has not happened before."
"Let me sum up some of the demands set out in the report and which are indispensable: firstly, to safeguard the principles of partnership with the ACP countries, which I think is a given; secondly, to establish legal certainty and predictability, especially for the poorest of the poor, by which is meant the least developed countries, who – with some justification – are concerned that they may go away empty-handed."
"The task is to facilitate medium-term financial planning and not cling to the principle of annuality, which would make longer-term development cooperation impossible."
"Above all, of course, as various speakers have said, levels of development funding for ACP countries must be guaranteed."
"Even more important, however, is to prevent these funds being siphoned off to meet needs elsewhere. Instead, the resources must genuinely be committed to, and available to, the ACP countries and their use must be agreed with them on the basis of partnership."
"Provided that these criteria are met, I believe we will also clear up any preconceptions and reservations."
"To this end, we are hoping for support not only from the Commission but also, and above all, from the Council."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0125/2004) by Mrs Maes, on behalf of the European Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the safety of third countries’ aircraft using Community airports."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the conclusion of a directive that has been in progress for years and that has actually always been disaster-driven."
"I hope that this is not the case for the future and the ultimate result."
"It was in 1996 that the Commission first submitted a proposal for a directive designed to improve the safety of aviation in our Community, to include aircraft from third countries."
"At the time the procedure could not be brought to a successful conclusion because of a dispute between the United Kingdom and Spain over Gibraltar."
"It was not therefore until after the disaster of 11 September 2001, when a crisis broke out in aviation, that everyone appreciated the fact that now they did have to set to work to guarantee safety and to reassure citizens."
"We then worked with all possible speed and following the first reading in Parliament on 3 September 2002 the Commission submitted an amended proposal on 26 November, which included 13 of the 19 amendments adopted by Parliament."
"That was not bad."
"The Council adopted its common position on this in June and Parliament concluded its second reading on 9 October with the adoption of five amendments. For example, concerning the requirements for the annual report, the power of the Commission to impose measures imposed by a Member State, such as denial of access to the territory or operational conditions for a company, and to extend them to the whole Community, and the speeding up of the implementation procedures."
"Then there came another disaster which moved things up a gear."
"This time it was the Flash Airlines accident, in which 149 people died at Sharm el-Sheikh."
"We were then very quickly able to hold a trialogue, at which the issue of transparency in particular, which was now also being raised in all circles and by public opinion, was discussed."
"We subsequently adopted a compromise Council proposal on condition that a few further changes would be made."
"Initially the Council was not very keen on this, but we were nonetheless able to bring the process to a successful conclusion and we are happy with that."
"There will be an annual report with aggregated data, which will contain all the information."
"At the insistence of Parliament the report will also be accessible to interested parties."
"It must also be simple and easy to understand and it must be made clear whether there is any question of an increased safety risk for travellers."
"We emphasised this sensitive point strongly."
"I am therefore pleased that the powers of the Commission with regard to States or companies failing to apply international safety standards have been significantly improved."
"According to the common position of the Council, there could however only be a question of recommendation."
"We have now however succeeded in substantially strengthening the powers of the Commission in this regard."
"We are pleased with the procedure that is being followed in this, because it is precisely this procedure that gives us the guarantee that it will be possible to work very clearly, transparently and in public."
"Of course we are not blind to the fact that the whole process is far from complete."
"I would remind the Commissioner of her own words in connection with charter companies."
"Often we do not know who is providing the air travel of travellers who have otherwise been informed of all the details of their journey."
"A further new initiative will be necessary here."
"I also think that we must take account of the comments of the people who are currently carrying out the SAFA procedure."
"I find them in a report on the Belgian aviation inspections according to the SAFA procedures."
"It is said in the report that we must not expect too much of them, because there is really too little time to carry out these inspections with any thoroughness and regularity."
"I therefore think that the further implementation of the procedure and the directive, and also the way in which the public and the persons concerned around the airports are informed and may be able to play a part in raising the alarm, will give rise to further refinement of the procedures."
"I hope that the other directives to be adapted will contain the same guarantees, so that this directive offers the full guarantee that all travellers boarding an aircraft, be it from a third country or from a Member State, have the same guarantees with regard to their safety."
"Political will is needed for this and, I hope, not new disasters."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to thank Mrs Maes for the wonderful work she has done throughout this time, as rapporteur on a Directive which was originally presented in 1997, but which was blocked as a result of the differences between the United Kingdom and Spain with regard to the issue of Gibraltar."
"Mrs Maes, the United Nations has stated very clearly that Gibraltar is a colony."
"It is rather shocking that in Europe, in European territory, we still have a colony, but the United Nations says it, no less."
"Anyway, I mean to say that we must understand the problems which are hidden behind other problems we are faced with on occasions."
"Thanks not to the problem of September 2001, however, but rather to the United Kingdom and Spain once again putting this issue to one side and accepting a formula which does not prejudge anything, either in favour of one country or the other – it simply leaves the dispute between the two countries frozen, despite the progress made within the European Union and the other countries, including those two – we were able to unblock this issue."
"This is an issue which affects not just this proposal, but a whole series of other proposals relating to the air sector."
"When I arrived I found that there were nine or ten, then the whole of the ‘Single Sky’, but in the end, in 2000 we managed to unblock everything and we have been able to bring it forward."
"In fact, on 3 January this issue arose once again in an extremely brutal manner, following the Flash Airlines tragedy which led to numerous deaths."
"Once again, we realised that we should act more quickly."
"But, finally, we have done so."
"At that point we were in the conciliation process, we had made a lot of progress, and unquestionably what it did was facilitate the conciliation and I would like to thank the European Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee as well as the Council for the work they have done and which has allowed us, I believe, to achieve a good conciliation."
"This conciliation will provide inspectors, national authorities and the Commission with the resources needed to identify foreign transporters who do not respect international safety rules and deny them access to Community airports if necessary, as well as overflying of European airspace."
"I would like to say that, before being approved, this Directive is already having an effect."
"Specifically, a few weeks ago, one of the countries of the European Union, within the framework of the SAFA programme, which now exists within the context of the ECAC, detected serious deficiencies in a third country airline and has denied it access to its airports."
"Well, this measure has been communicated to us, to the Agency, to the Commission, and we have also communicated it to the countries of the Union and a further four countries have followed that country in its decision to exclude this air company from its territories."
"I would like to reply to Mrs Maes by saying that, before the end of this Commission’s term of office, before relinquishing my duties, I hope to have presented the modification which clarifies the companies with which charter flights are carried out and, possibly, any change which may provide guarantees and rights for customers."
"I would like to thank the honourable Members and the Council for the work they have done, and I hope that tomorrow you can support the result of this conciliation, the application of which, I will insist, is extremely urgent, not only an informal application as is the case at the moment, since it is already being applied, but in a full sense so that it may have full effect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the good cooperation."
"Safety is the key issue in air travel – as it is in other sectors, but it is particularly so in air travel, not only since the tragic accident at Sharm-el-Sheik."
"As air travel is global, more and more third-country aircraft are using EU airports."
"One black sheep is enough to undermine safety."
"The directive which we will adopt tomorrow is therefore extremely important in the transport policy context and, indeed, in the eyes of the general public."
"We are finally establishing uniform Europe-wide procedures for safety checks on third-country aircraft, thus guaranteeing a high level of safety."
"In my view, the following points are important: firstly, the carrying out of uniform apron checks on aircraft about which a particular suspicion exists, as well as spot-check inspections in the case of aircraft in which defects have already been identified frequently in the past, and on all others; and secondly, the collection and dissemination of all relevant information on safety, as well as on specific incidents and the measures implemented."
"This transparency will result in the existence of black lists or white lists sooner or later."
"Naturally, I would prefer white lists, which is what the French Government once proposed, as a kind of quality seal for the safe airlines and also organisers of package travel, which would benefit all passengers and ensure greater transparency."
"Thirdly, measures adopted at national level, such as flight bans and so on, can be extended to all Member States in line with the relevant procedure."
"In my view, given the ever-increasing volume of air traffic, these efforts to achieve harmonisation come at the right time."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0217/2004), on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 on common rules for the allocation of slots at Community airports (Rapporteur: Mr Stockmann)."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU Transport Ministers finally agreed on a Common Position on the reform of the Slot Regulation at the end of last year."
"I say 'finally' because Parliament had waited for more than one and a half years. Nonetheless, the Common Position takes into account many, although not all, of Parliament's amendments."
"Let me give you some examples."
"Firstly, the coordinator's independence remains untouched."
"In this context, we felt it was important to ensure a separation between coordinators and any individual party, to guarantee coordinators' financial independence, and above all to protect coordinators from claims for damages."
"The Council took up this issue."
"Coordinators are protected from claims for damages, except in cases of gross negligence or wilful misconduct. This ensures their independence and means that they are not susceptible to undue financial pressure."
"At the same time, the coordinators' powers to impose penalties in the event of misuse of slots have been expanded."
"The most important advance for the future is, of course, the Transport Ministers' recognition of the new definition of slots as usage rights."
"This change in the system is essential, in my view, also for the second phase of the future Slot Regulation."
"The Council also followed our decision and has maintained flexibility and planning certainty for airlines."
"For example, the re-timing of grandfather rights continues to be possible, either for operational reasons or if re-timing of a series of slots brings the operator closer into line with the slots originally applied for."
"Here, we believe, the Commission was too restrictive."
"In addition, the range of exemptions to the 'use-it-or-lose-it' rule has been broadened."
"Now, unforeseeable events, such as 11 September, and unavoidable circumstances outside the air carrier's control do not lead to the withdrawal of a slot."
"These few examples show that from Parliament's perspective – from our perspective – we have achieved a great deal."
"We therefore intend to, and should, vote for the Common Position without amendment so that the Regulation can finally be adopted."
"One point is of major importance to me, and that is the famous Article 8a of the Regulation, which deals with slot mobility."
"Here, the Transport Ministers deleted the prohibition of slot trading."
"This means that there is still a black hole in the Regulation into which slots disappear."
"It means that slots will continue to be traded in an untransparent and uneven way – not only at Heathrow. This is an untenable situation for the internal market."
"I therefore urge the Commission to present a new proposal before the end of the year."
"This proposal must set clear and transparent rules for slot trading on a Europe-wide basis."
"Only then will the reform of the slot allocation system genuinely be complete."
"I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their good cooperation."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have made a lot of progress with regard to the proposal to review the current Community rules on the allocation of slots at airports."
"I would also like to say that I have previously expressed my pleasure at the pragmatic approach Parliament has always taken to this issue and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Stockmann, on the excellent work he has done."
"I do not like all the content of the Council's common position either – the honourable Member is well aware of this – and, specifically, I do not like the fact that the Council has not accepted the small elements which had been introduced into the issue of the marketing of slots, which clarified the current situation."
"But if I had not demonstrated this pragmatism as well, we would unfortunately still be deadlocked."
"As the honourable Member has said quite rightly and as we all know, there are very positive elements in the document from a technical point of view, and it is therefore worthwhile ensuring that it goes ahead."
"The most important thing is that we finally know what a slot is, because, until now, we did not know what its legal nature was."
"We were not very sure what it was that has such great value – and we have seen this in the event of the sale, purchase or bankruptcy of air companies."
"They are called Grandfather rights, but what type of rights?"
"Now we know what type of rights we are talking about."
"The clarification of the legal nature of slots will allow us to take the next step, Mr Stockmann, which I hope to have presented before the end of the year."
"And, in this regard, I made a statement to the meeting of the Council when it adopted the common position, which I accepted, to the effect that before the end of the year we will present a legislative proposal providing for the appropriate clarification and regulation of the market, of the exchange and the negotiation of these rights."
"Today we are approving the nature of those rights."
"With this proposal we will be able to establish, as well as the current system, which does not theoretically allow for any type of negotiation of those rights, the clarification of how those rights can be negotiated within a transparent system, bearing in mind that there are public service aspects clearly associated with the use of those slots in different airports."
"In any event, to this end, we have already begun the preparatory work and we are consulting the States of the Union, as well as the different interested parties."
"We did this before making this proposal."
"The responses we received at that time were not the most appropriate."
"I hope that we will receive them now and we will be able to present that document before the end of the year and, in any event, I believe, Mr Stockmann, that the step forward we are taking today is extremely important and that it greatly improves both the legal aspect and a technical aspect."
"We are finally stating what a slot is, which is no small issue given their economic value at the moment."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mrs Maes, Mr Stockmann, Commission staff, ladies and gentlemen, we are indeed a cosy huddle of experts."
"My group endorses the rapporteur's recommendation that the Common Position be adopted."
"We would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work with the Council behind the scenes."
"It is important to bring this matter to a conclusion."
"Commissioner, Madam Vice-President, I think it is essential that in reforming the Slot Regulation, we agree on the new definition of slots as usage rights. A slot only entitles carriers to use airport facilities for takeoffs and landings at specified dates and times."
"These usage rights do not represent any kind of property right, neither to airports, nor to air carriers. Slots are a general good."
"I am most grateful to you, Madam Vice-President, for stating that you will endeavour to present a revised version of the new Regulation by November."
"I personally believe – and here, I follow the line adopted by the rapporteur in his report – that it is essential to make it very clear that slots do not belong to the airport or to airlines, which means that they cannot be traded."
"We can devise all sorts of trading rules and amendments, but let me say this: the British Airways slots at Heathrow are not British Airways property that can be traded for generous sums of money."
"I am most grateful that the Council, Parliament and the Commission have agreed to strengthen the role and independence of coordinators, for the coordinators' role is to ensure the effective use of airports and airspace in the common interest, not to create advantages or disadvantages for the airlines or airports."
"The aim must be to ensure the best possible use of the airports for airlines and passengers in economic and environmental terms."
"I am therefore grateful to Mr Stockmann for concluding this matter successfully before the end of this legislative period. We should all vote in favour of his report tomorrow."
". Mr President, Mr Jarzembowski, we all agree that slots are public assets."
"We are talking about the system for allocating a public asset – what in Spain we call a [concession], a right to use a public asset which is allocated within certain contexts and circumstances."
"Once we have defined what it consists of, perhaps we will be able to establish that the holder negotiates this public asset, or this right, for an undefined or limited period."
"That is what we have."
"In fact, it is a practice which, in a hidden fashion, is currently being employed in some European airports."
"The aim of the next proposal is to introduce transparency into these exchanges, into these negotiations, always maintaining the status of public asset. Since a slot is considered a public asset, the public authority always has prerogatives which are being maintained in all cases."
"These include the power to regulate how these exchanges are carried out, under what conditions etc. That is what we will have to resolve in the next initiative."
"If I am not mistaken, I believe that these two initiatives which we have discussed today – the conciliation on the safety of third party aircraft and the second reading on the proposed common rules for the allocation of slots – are the last two initiatives on the air sector which we will approve during this Parliament."
"Only three of the usual hard-workers of the ‘House’ are here – in the end, it is always the same people who find ourselves in these discussions – but they are three very important people with whom I have worked and collaborated over all these years wonderfully well, to provide enormous impetus for the European air sector, including, amongst other things, the ‘Single Sky’, certain aspects of safety, the Air Safety Agency, the rights of passengers and slots."
"I would like to express my gratitude to them in particular."
"I would like to thank them for the work we have done, their very positive cooperation throughout all this time and I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the services of the Commission for their wonderful work, which has allowed and facilitated this cooperation, and the Council as well, of course, which has allowed us to move forward."
"Meanwhile, before the end of this Parliament's term of office, it is possible that we will have some good news about the negotiations with the United States in the sector of the trans-Atlantic common aviation zone or at least with regard to the first steps."
"I know that the Transport Secretary, Mr Minetta, is going to appear before this Parliament and I believe that that will also help the debates."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon."
"We have come to the end of the agenda."
"You have the floor, Mr Jarzembowski."
"Mr President, in light of the time saved, please allow me to make two comments: firstly, Madam Vice-President, you are quite right."
"It is essential to take grandfather rights into account in relation to slots, but this must not lead to slots being bought and sold."
"Secondly, we are pleased that Mr Minetta is coming and we are pleased that the talks about common airspace are progressing, but I would remind you of the fabled proverb: ‘Beware of Greeks bearing gifts!’"
"It also applies to the Americans."
"As one of the longest-serving Members of this House, let me say that it was a pleasure working with you, especially on the issue of air travel, over such a long period."
"Many thanks, Madam Vice-President."
"Thank you very much, Mr Jarzembowski."
"The next sitting will take place tomorrow, Thursday(1)."
"Next Wednesday is the tenth anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda."
"In memory of the almost one million victims, and to express our hope that we never again see a tragedy of this nature, I would ask you to observe a minute’s silence."
"– Mr President, in Germany, what we term ‘bugging operations’ are used as a means of last resort in combating the most serious forms of organised crime."
"The investigation services are allowed to use them in prosecutions only under stringent legal conditions and subject to constitutional law."
"Our Federal Constitutional Court has recently imposed still further restrictions on their use."
"Late last night, on a German television programme, a Member of this House was able to boast that he had, as a self-appointed investigator, been using this method on his fellow-MEPs for some years, without let or hindrance whatever."
"In the programme, sequences filmed using concealed cameras were used as evidence of the rip-offs that are alleged to go on, particularly at the end of our part-sessions in Strasbourg."
"The programme culminated in the threat that we would see this happen again, for, to quote the very words used: ‘The day after tomorrow is another Strasbourg Friday’."
"Tomorrow, I will have to be here in this House, going about my political duties, and I will be recording my presence in the central register."
"As I would like to be able to do that without fear of being pounced on by cameramen, I would like to know what is being done to ensure that my fellow-Members and I can do what we have to do in the service of the European public without fear."
"How is this House’s security to be restored?"
"Will the European Parliament, which is a constitutional entity, continue to put up with these attempts at coercion?"
"Thank you very much, Mrs Gebhardt."
"I will communicate your request to the President of Parliament.(1)"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0204/2004) by Mr Oostlander, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the 2003 regular report of the Commission on Turkey's progress towards accession."
". – Mr President, since my previous report, the Turkish Government has not been idle and has, with some determination, adopted a number of reforms in legislation. These mainly relate to human rights, freedoms in the areas of culture and media, and the curbing of the army's political role."
"We have been following the negotiations about Cyprus' future with much interest as they play a considerable part in Turkey’s progress towards the European Union."
"Initially, we imagined that it would be Turkish involvement in these negotiations that would cause difficulties, due to the army's opposition to a compromise and due to established administrators in the Turkish Government."
"Unfortunately, we have to note that Greek-Cypriot cooperation in finding a solution to the Cyprus issue is not optimal either, to put it mildly."
"Needless to say, this is not the last we have heard on the matter."
"Negotiations are set to continue, because I cannot imagine the Greek-Cypriot Government risking joining the European Union on such extremely bad terms as these."
"I think it would not live this down for many years."
"Despite all the changes on paper in Turkey and the decision in favour of departments to set civil society free, it appears that implementation of the reforms has been extremely difficult."
"The Government realises this too and has, by introducing a monitoring system, demonstrated that it means business."
"I see this as an important move on its part, because to us, it is mainly the implementation of all those changes that is essential."
"Paper can wait; the future will tell whether they will be realised."
"The obstacles on the road to the European Union can hardly come as a surprise to us."
"The structure and philosophy of the state are reflected in the mentality of the population and government officials."
"If that is the reason why they are on a track that is not reconcilable with the European Union, they cannot expect this to change in the short term."
"The changes we want are revolutionary."
"These observations bear out the report's basic idea."
"The European Union has to be strict in respect of all candidates, or states that want to become candidates, where the rule of law and democracy are concerned."
"That is, primarily, a matter of principle, but it is also about the EU's ability to function as such and about our ability to persuade our own people, whose acceptance of this enlargement will be dependent on our finding a basis for it."
"What matters is that the candidates should fit in with the European Union in terms of the political values they uphold."
"Until such time as they do, they should not consider membership."
"This is not simply about correcting a number of specific abuses, but also about the legal and social basis from which abuses arise."
"For example, it is not simply about the release of Leyla Zana, who has been sentenced to many years' imprisonment for conduct for which she received the Sakharov Prize from this Parliament."
"What is important is that in future, such sentences should be unthinkable."
"If you question the highest courts in Turkey about this, to my astonishment, they are still unable to provide you with any answers."
"The same applies to the cultural rights of minorities."
"It should be unthinkable that these should be obstructed in such a way that they cannot be exercised."
"A real separation of church and state should not give cause to panic, and neither should the freedom of religion for groups who are not specifically mentioned in the Treaty of Lausanne."
"Apparently, this is a very difficult area for Turkey."
"Another complex issue is the position of the army."
"Historically, one can appreciate that the army has enjoyed great trust among a large proportion of the population, but politics will need to regain its self-assurance."
"Although the government is working on changes, it cannot do much more than what circumstances permit."
"Nevertheless, the European Union should stick to the requirement that the army should have no more political influence than is customary in the EU Member States."
"In this light, I would discourage any amendments tending to water down what the European Union requires of Turkey."
"The Copenhagen political criteria must be fulfilled before we can move on to the usual support we offer with regard to the adoption of the ."
"That is a lesson we have learnt from previous enlargement processes and the experience we have had with Romania, for example."
"Moreover, it should also send a message to countries that are considering membership."
"I also think that the Turkish Government needs our pressure as back-up against the opposing forces in society and in parts of the corridors of power."
"Elements of the are non-negotiable."
"This also applies to the values and the application thereof in the European Union."
"There is no room for negotiation."
"They must be embraced; if countries are really intent on becoming Member States, they must simply be adopted."
"I do take the view, though, that the EU must hold on to the prospect of fully-fledged membership for Turkey once the political, economic and other criteria have actually been met."
"While it is understandable that some amendments should call for the close involvement of Parliament, it is just as necessary for us to do our homework in order to be able to assimilate the accession of countries to the European Union."
"That means that the results of the Convention will need to be accepted unreservedly; if they are not, we cannot function."
"The concept of deepening before enlarging still holds good."
"The option of taking part in the Policy of Good Neighbourliness, as worded in Mr Napolitano's report, can also remain in place, but amendments affording Turkey a place outside of the European Union on its own, are not in keeping with the gist of my report."
"The categorical emphasis on the fulfilment of the political criteria is also tied in with the wish to find sufficient support among the people."
"I hope that by accepting the outlines of this report, we will send a clear message to both the Turkish Government and society and to the citizens of the EU."
"This is very much a matter of principle, and no uncertainty can be tolerated."
"I suggest we continue the dialogue with Turkey with the open mind to which the Turkish Government has by now grown accustomed."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate is a very good opportunity to review the interim scoreboard on the progress Turkey has made in its efforts to bring about reform."
"I would like to begin with very warm thanks to Mr Oostlander for a balanced and expert report, with the conclusions of which I can largely agree."
"We can see that the Turkish Government has, in recent years, been very determined in setting in motion changes intended to make Turkey a full democracy under the rule of law, in which human and minority rights are respected."
"I think we may conclude, on the basis of the results from Turkey’s latest elections last Sunday, that this drive towards reform has put down deep roots in Turkish society."
"This is something in which we should rejoice, for without the European Union, this process would not have got off the ground."
"The Helsinki strategy gave Turkey definite prospects."
"The conditions under which it can exercise its membership option are defined in clear and unambiguous terms."
"The Copenhagen criteria apply, unchanged and in full, to Turkey as they do to all the other candidate countries."
"That has made for a lack of ambiguity in our relations with Turkey, and the accession partnerships that we have developed as instruments of cooperation have proved their worth remarkably well in the endeavour to advance the reform process."
"In the progress reports, we have paid tribute to the extent and importance of what has been achieved, but we have also consistently addressed deficiencies and weakness in clear and unmistakeable terms."
"As part of its reform process, Turkey has brought in new legislation to improve the human rights situation, to provide increased protection from torture and mistreatment, to extend freedom of expression and of the press, to reinforce the freedoms of association and of assembly, as well as the right to demonstrate, to extend cultural rights, to underpin the equality of the sexes, entrench democracy and change the relationship between the armed forces and civil society."
"Turkey has also signed several core international conventions, and this clearly indicates that the country is on course for change, as is also shown, above all, by the change in its political climate."
"Turkey’s civil society is gaining in strength and becoming better-organised; non-governmental organisations are consulted when legislation is prepared, one example being the new code of criminal law."
"The reform process has given public debate in Turkey a new mood of openness and freedom."
"Issues such as the role of the armed forces in politics, the use of the Kurdish language, the use of torture and mistreatment, or the role of women in society are now talked about openly."
"When, four years ago, I started working with Turkey, I could not even use the word ‘Kurdish’ in my dialogues with the Turkish Government."
"I mention that as just one small example."
"A public debate is underway on whether or not to endow the country with a modern constitution containing the fundamental values on which the European Union is founded."
"This repositioning of Turkey represents a triumph for our ‘zero tolerance’ policy on matters of democracy, the rule of law and human and minority rights, and it is for that very reason that we have to remind ourselves where we have found deficiencies and weaknesses."
"Let me briefly list the areas to which the Commission referred: the need to strengthen the independence of the judiciary and improve their working practices, the need for an overall framework for the exercise of fundamental rights, which must be clarified in such a way that every relic of the authoritarianism inherited from the past is done away with."
"There is, furthermore, the need to correct relations between the civil and armed forces, and there is concern about the position of the internal exiles in the south-east of the country, and about how they can return to their villages."
"Another very important issue, I think, is that of freedom of religion."
"Amending laws and changing the legal system, though, is not enough."
"We want these changes to be implemented in practice – not merely on an basis, but systematically and effectively."
"Although there has been noticeable progress recently, I have to say that we are constantly receiving reports that demonstrate that the reform process is being only reluctantly accepted in the Turkish corridors of power, and so I urgently appeal to the Turkish Government to do everything possible to get these reforms implemented."
"This leads me to mention the case of Leyla Zana, which is an example of how the spirit of reform has not yet been internalised by all the country’s executive and legislative institutions."
"The case against her does not appear to be in accord with the principles of the presumption of innocence and the right to defence counsel."
"I came here straight from Switzerland, where the negotiations on a final solution to the Cyprus problem came to an end early this morning, and I would like to use this opportunity to bring Parliament, before any other institution, up to date on how things stand."
"As you are aware, we would prefer – as we always have done – to welcome a united Cyprus into membership on 1 May."
"During our time in Switzerland, we have come very, very close to achieving this, and the process has been far from being a failure."
"Two options were provided for from the very outset: either an agreement would be signed right there in Switzerland or, alternatively, the Secretary-General of the United Nations would present a final plan, the decision on which would be taken by both communities in Cyprus in a democratic referendum on 24 April."
"It is the second option that has been chosen, it having emerged that not all the parties were able to sign an agreement."
"I must make it clear, though, that the sides drew together in remarkable ways, and I believe that we have now reached a point at which strong political leadership is called for."
"Here and now, I appeal to the leadership of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots to do all they can to persuade the people on the island that the plan we have now represents the best and fairest solution that can be achieved."
"The choice is not between one plan and another; it is between this plan and no solution at all."
"I do not believe, either, that any new opportunity to address the issue will present itself in the near future."
"One cannot fail to note, with the utmost admiration, the efforts made by the UN Secretary-General, whose proposal takes full account of the European Union’s demands."
"The new state, the new Cyprus, that this is intended to bring to birth, will be a country capable of speaking with one voice and of playing its proper part on the international stage without being obstructive."
"It will be a country with structures strong enough to implement Community law, and one founded upon the same principles as the European Union."
"As regards the need to adapt Kofi Annan’s proposal in line with Community law, it has been agreed that these adjustments are to be made without recourse to permanent derogations from the ."
"All institutions are united in the common desire that there should no longer be any permanent derogations from the , and that we have achieved."
"I therefore believe it would be a good thing if the European Parliament, too, were to make its will perfectly clear, so that the political parties and forces involved might realise that they have a responsibility to accept the offer that is now on the table, that has been the product of very careful, very laborious and very sympathetic discussions."
"Let me again stress that it would be wrong to describe the process as having failed."
"What has in fact happened is that a second option, envisaged from the very start, has been shown to be feasible and preferable."
"We will now get working on making it a reality."
"It has played a very constructive and cooperative role in the negotiations in Switzerland, one to which I very much want to pay tribute. Let me just add that, at the end of this year, a decision will have to be taken as to whether Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen criteria, which are decisive."
"If it is decided that it does, then – as was unanimously decided at the European Council in Copenhagen in December 2002 – negotiations on its accession are to be commenced without delay."
"On this, the Commission will present its report in the autumn, and, like all its predecessors, this report will be fair and objective."
"As Mr Oostlander’s report shows, the process of modernising Turkey’s political system and of bringing it in line with the EU’s standards is far advanced."
"The European Parliament has always played an important part in reminding Turkey of its commitments, as a democratic state, to safeguard fundamental rights and freedoms."
"In the stage that now lies ahead of us, much will depend on Turkey’s own ability to show that it fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria not only in law, but also in practice."
"These criteria, far from being devised for Turkey, apply generally and in the same way to all the candidates there have been to date, and to all that there will be."
"I can assure you that the Commission will, in its autumn report, and just as we have done in past years, put forward a thorough, objective and fair analysis."
"Mr President, the Turkish Government has moved at astonishing speed to fulfil the European Union's political criteria so that the right decision can be taken in December for accession negotiations to be opened."
"We should recognise this and congratulate the Turkish authorities."
"In a very difficult international situation and in spite of terrorist atrocities in Istanbul, there has been a firm commitment to domestic change."
"Yet some might think that every time Turkey makes progress in a particular direction, the goalposts for European Union membership are moved."
"In its report a year ago, Parliament sent out an unduly negative message to Turkey and failed to recognise the scale of positive developments that had taken place in the preceding 12 months."
"This year's report is more balanced, but it still sends a lukewarm message."
"A number of the amendments tabled seek to reverse the decisions firstly of the 1997 Luxembourg European Council confirming that Turkey will be judged on the basis of the same criteria as the other applicant states, and secondly of the Helsinki European Council in 1999, which recognised Turkey's status as a fully-fledged candidate country."
"It is no longer right to speak of Turkey's possible accession to the European Union."
"Turkey's destiny is clear: in due course it will be a member."
"I hope, however, that by that time and by the time many of the young people in the public gallery here – including young people from St Martin's School in Brentwood, in my constituency – are firmly established in their professions, the European Union itself will have moved away from its obsession with political integration, into a somewhat looser community of nation states."
"Many of us are working with that in mind."
"The Cyprus question has been quite correctly mentioned."
"This was made a factor in Turkey's own EU candidacy – some might think wrongly so."
"However, all being well, what was a negative factor will soon have the reverse effect."
"Last night the Secretary-General of the United Nations put forward his final plan for overcoming the divisions of Cyprus."
"For too long international opinion has been distorted on this issue and the Turkish Cypriots have not had a fair hearing."
"The Turkish authorities in particular have worked hard to obtain a just settlement that offers the prospect of peace and security."
"I believe that what is now on the table will be welcomed by the people of Cyprus and I hope that they will give a positive vote in the referendum on 24 April."
"Finally, there is much to be done to bring about reform in Turkey, in particular in terms of human rights."
"However, much of what is being achieved could be thrown into reverse if a negative decision is taken in December."
"Mr Oostlander's message is still profoundly negative."
"I want to send a signal of positive encouragement."
". Mr President, the past few years have proved to be difficult for Turkey as a society and in the field of employment."
"It has suffered a financial crisis, earthquakes, drought and a terrorist attack."
"This has obviously had a knock-on effect on the people's social situation and their prosperity."
"The general level of prosperity in Turkey, expressed in purchasing power, is under 23% of the EU's level."
"Compared to five years ago, the gap has widened, because in 1997, that level was just over 30%."
"Unemployment has increased and fluctuates between 9% and 10%."
"The level of employment is lower than 50%, while this is above 60% in the European Union, although we endeavour to achieve 70%."
"There are two explanations for this drop in employment."
"Women do not work; only one in four women has a job and many semi- and unskilled rural women opt to stay at home given the lack of opportunities to work."
"There is also growing informal employment, partly the result – however paradoxical this may sound – of rigid labour legislation."
"The laws on dismissal are very strict, with the result that employers try to bypass these laws by recruiting illegal workers."
"Child labour also remains high."
"It is estimated that there are still 750 000 working children."
"According to Eurostat, a quarter of the Turkish population has an income below 60% of the average."
"The level of poverty therefore remains high and the indices for the social situation are thus not terrific."
"That does not detract from the fact that Turkey has made huge efforts."
"It has developed labour legislation and has made provision for the unemployed."
"Efforts are thus being made, but it should be noted that these, as a result of the crisis and the lack of investments, have had little impact on the social situation."
"I support Turkey's application to join the European Union on the conditions that were agreed in Copenhagen."
"I therefore hope that we can all help Turkey take that step."
". – Mr President, quite apart from all the general political issues that we in this House have to consider in relation to Turkey, economic feasibility and the compatibility of its society with the European Union are of course not negligible considerations."
"There has indeed been great progress in legislative terms, including in the areas of labour law, equality, health care and other important social protection systems, but I have to say that there are developments in quite the opposite direction that stand in an unfortunate contrast to this."
"Lamentably, nothing good can come of the increase in unemployment, the sharp increase in poverty, particularly in rural areas, the increasing tendency of firms to circumvent rules on health and safety at work by illegally employing short-term workers, the failure to combat the use of child labour, and other things besides."
"Labour law also lacks rules outlawing discrimination, with the consequence that legal action cannot be taken in respect of such things as the violation of the right to respect for human dignity."
"That can be sorted out, but there is still a need for great effort in order to do so."
"Pressure of time will not get these issues dealt with more quickly."
"With these reasons in mind, and nonetheless wanting to smooth the path towards the approval of Turkey’s accession to the EU, I think that, from a democratic point of view, there is no getting away from the need for the EU of 25 to consider this issue again and for Parliament to give its prior consent before negotiations with Turkey on that country’s accession are embarked on."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if a study is made of agriculture in Turkey, it is found not to be very strongly developed."
"There are almost twice the number of farmers in Turkey as there are in all the 15 Member States."
"Almost half of Turkey’s workforce is involved in agriculture."
"When Turkey becomes a member of the EU, it will be a very big task for the EU to contribute to the development of Turkish agriculture."
"The most difficult task will probably be to bring about agricultural development that does not involve creating social problems that might become very great when it becomes necessary for people to leave agriculture and find alternative employment."
"Many positive things have taken place in Turkey in recent years."
"In 2000, for example, a new agricultural policy was introduced, making it easier for Turkey to move closer to the European Union in this area."
"At the same time, we are at an early stage of our discussions regarding EU membership, and it is difficult to make an accurate assessment."
"I should like to say that agriculture is probably not the greatest problem where Turkey is concerned."
"We have similar problems in countries like Romania and Bulgaria."
"There are other issues that constitute greater problems, such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"It is important that we are all agreed that, once the Copenhagen criteria have been met, everything will be in place."
"We shall then start negotiations, and it will be possible for Turkey to become a member."
"Personally, I think it would be useful for a Muslim, but secularised, country to become a member of the Union, as a bridge between the cultures of Europe and the Arab world."
"I realise that there are parties and groups in this Parliament which do not think that Turkey should become a member."
"I think it important that a majority of Parliament states that we welcome Turkey, but we must put pressure on the country so that it carries out the reforms that are necessary before it can become a member."
". – Thank you, Mr President;"
"I would like to start by stressing that the statement that Commissioner Verheugen has just made on the future prospects for the European Union is entirely in accord with the opinions of the majority of the Christian Democrats in this House."
"I find this a valuable observation."
"From the point of view of regional and transport policy, Turkey cannot, in fact, be said to have made any progress whatever."
"What is particularly deserving of criticism in terms of regional policy is that decentralised structures have still not yet been set up."
"We, however, regard such structures as indispensable; we need them in order to be able to ensure the proper and comprehensible distribution of EU funds for regional support or cohesion policy."
"The Turks cannot be serious in constantly asking for more money when the administration is not in a position to disburse these funds in a proper and transparent manner."
"Where everything really is wrong in Turkey is in transport policy."
"In none of the transport sectors is anything being done towards alignment on the EU’s law and standards."
"Everywhere, there are still shocking deficiencies: in safety and air traffic control, on the railways, in the maritime sector, and in road transport."
"One particular deficiency in the road transport sector is in social regulations, one good example being those on driving and rest times, in the training of drivers, and especially, again, in safety."
"That is a pretty critical point; there are, for example, a lot of dangerous goods transported by road, and such deficits in road transport present dangers to transport not only within Turkey, but also, and to an increasing extent, across the European Union."
"There is an urgent need for action here."
"The biggest scandal, though – and it really is one – is the fact that Turkey is on the black list of states lacking any genuine port state control, in other words, that many of the ships that are death-traps and thus a ticking time bomb in our waters, sail under the Turkish flag."
"That is as unworthy of a candidate for accession as it is of any other country in the world, but the situation is particularly intolerable in the case of a candidate for accession to the European Union."
"Until such time as Turkey has in place a national programme to remedy all these defects, we have to have serious doubts about its willingness to start accepting our rules."
"None of these things are, of course, pre-accession criteria, but not one single point of these has been complied with either."
"All these things take time."
"This makes all the more incomprehensible the Turkish insistence, dating back years, on a date for the opening of accession negotiations."
"This does nobody any favours – whether the European Union or Turkey itself."
". Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights, may I start by saying that I consider it positive that Turkey has made an effort recently to improve the position of women in the country."
"However, we note that creating specialist mechanisms at state level is not enough and that, at the same time, they need to be reinforced with a strong legal status and generous funding, so that equal treatment of men and women can be promoted in practice and in daily life."
"All forms of violence, especially domestic violence, and the lack of legal and psychological support mechanisms for victims are still a specific problem."
"It is also abhorrent to note that deeds of violence are committed by the state security services against women, mainly from minority groups such as Kurds."
"As far as the penal code is concerned, Turkey is called upon to abolish the practice of reduced sentences in the case of so-called honour crimes and to abolish the reference in the penal code to women's virginity."
"Customs and tradition cannot take precedence over the rule of law."
"At the same time, a direct increase is needed in spending on health care, which is at unacceptably low levels, thereby obstructing the right of women to access health services."
"I also note that the participation and representation of women in democratic institutions is at unacceptably low levels, as is the participation of women in vocational training and employment."
"Mrs Smet spoke about this at length."
"Finally, we call for the immediate release of the former member of parliament and Sakharov prizewinner, Leyla Zana, who has been in prison together with three other members of parliament since 1994 on purely political grounds."
"The thirteenth hearing, a procedure which started approximately one year ago under pressure from the European Union, will be held in Ankara tomorrow."
"Today, we need to take advantage of today's debate to send a very strong message to Turkey and to call for the immediate release of Leyla Zana as a tiny sign that Turkey is at last moving towards Europe."
"Finally, Commissioner Verheugen, as a Greek, I should like to thank you warmly for your untiring efforts to help bring about a fair and sustainable solution to the Cyprus problem."
"– Mr President, while we consider Turkey’s possible accession to the European Union, the Copenhagen criteria have to be seen in their entirety."
"Arie Oostlander’s excellent report underlines this in a neutral way."
"It is, I think, an impartial appraisal, neither negative nor positive with regard to Turkey’s possible accession."
"It depends on Turkey itself whether it meets the political criteria for candidate countries, and how quickly."
"Whereas, the European Union has to decide if it can absorb a possible enlargement, which is to say if the Union’s economy and own structures will tolerate it."
"Both points of view have to be taken fully into consideration, and no external pressure can or should be allowed to change them."
"I believe I at least speak on behalf of my group’s Finnish delegation when I say that many factors indicate that Turkey may now be on the right path, with accession dimly visible at its end."
"Membership was not promised in Helsinki in 1999, but Turkey was granted candidate status, which obviously raises expectations in that country considerably."
"Today we had better leave any closer assessment of the Union’s capacity for absorption: ten new countries will stretch the Union’s finances to the limit for years to come."
"While at the same time most net contributor countries wish to reduce the budget framework in the Union, Turkey itself has a long way to go to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria."
"I will mention just two points."
"Before we can be absolutely sure that representative democracy commands the armed forces in Turkey in all situations, and not the other way round, one cannot even think of full membership."
"Secondly, it is a fundamental requirement of accession that freedom of religion be established, so that all religions, which only function as religious communities, have the freedom and genuine right to found and build proper churches, just as the EU countries gladly allow non-European religions to do by way of tradition."
"We should congratulate Commissioner Verheugen here, as well as Kofi Annan and the other negotiators, on the fact that the Cyprus problem, which now is even a legal barrier to Turkish accession at present, is being solved."
"We all hope it will now quickly end with the referendum that has been decided on."
"In the long term, however, I believe that if the barriers to Turkey’s accession went away or were removed, it would be in the interests of the Union."
"My Amendment No 1 and Mr Elles’s Amendment No 16 are, to my mind, fully in compliance with the criteria and are not in any way an attempt to thwart Turkey’s aspiration to accession."
"I do, however, think that Amendment No 41 will mean Turkey will be pushed out of accession negotiations."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Oostlander on this very fine and balanced report."
"It is a fact that there are those in this House who believe that Turkey should not be a candidate country."
"It is unfortunate that there is no clear and unambiguous motion to this effect that would enable us to definitely determine what the majority in this House thinks about that."
"I take the view that Turkey should remain the candidate country that it already is."
"It has to be conceded that it is not a candidate country like many others, in which the process can be completed relatively easily and in relatively few years."
"Turkey is in a particular situation."
"I admit that those of its governments that made a clear commitment to the secular state would also concede that. Turkey has, unfortunately, done little over past years to take the progressive actions – including in terms of their practical implementation – that we are again, and quite rightly, calling for today."
"The previous government, however – that formed by the AKP – did show very marked desire for reform and did take definite action to implement it."
"There may be some in this House who, precisely because it is an AKP government that is making progress, believe that Turkey should no longer be a candidate."
"I, though, believe that there are very good reasons why it should remain one, and there are very many good reasons for Europe to insist on the reforms not only being continued but also implemented."
"That is certainly one of the crucial difficulties."
"I ask that the Commission, in its report to the Council – which will take the decision and with which the power to do so must remain – should not limit itself to merely assessing what has been decided, but should also consider what has been implemented."
"I know that Commissioner Verheugen will do that. I, personally, would see it as a very great achievement if visible progress were to be made by the end of this year in implementing the measures that Turkey has adopted."
"If I may turn to the role of the armed forces, then something equally significant has taken place, in that it has clearly been diminished."
"If what Commissioner Verheugen has said is the case, and the Turkish Government takes a positive line on the Cyprus issue, then that has to do with the diminished role of the military, for if there was one decisive point on which the military had previously stonewalled, it was of course the negotiations on Cyprus."
"For the Turks, this is of course about the evidence – or lack of it – of a real reduction in the role of the military."
"Turning to respect for human rights, it is quite apparent that progress has been made, but that there is a need for much more of it."
"I refer here also to the Kurdish issue, which is, I know, still a very thorny one for the Turks, including as it does the issue of respect for the borders of neighbouring countries with a Kurdish population."
"However, this is of course, on the assumption that such Kurdish regions are not used as bases for military or terrorist attacks on Turkey."
"So let me reiterate my belief that we should hold fast to our position and rigorously scrutinise compliance with the criteria, just as we do with all the other countries."
"Let me close by saying something about Cyprus."
"While I hope that a solution will be found, and am very grateful to Commissioner Verheugen for his efforts, it must be clear to us that it must be a solution that does justice to both Cyprus and Europe, so that the European Union will be joined by a country that is capable of participating actively in its decision-making."
"Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party warmly welcomes the plan crafted by Kofi Annan yesterday in Switzerland."
"I congratulate Commissioner Verheugen and his team because they have played a key part in brokering the package."
"It is right and proper that the Commission and the Council have been proactive in seeking to apply the membership terms across the complete island of Cyprus."
"It is not too late for this Parliament to become more supportive of a settlement of the dispute than it has been in the past."
"I would like to ask all the political forces represented in this Parliament to campaign for a positive vote in the referendum."
"Many Cypriots require support to catch the spirit of Europe and to look forward with more self-assurance to being a reunited community."
"Turkey deserves our thanks for making such a vital contribution to the settlement."
"These events and our gratitude are not fully reflected in the Oostlander report, but it will certainly inform Parliament's decision, as we move towards December and the critical decision to open accession negotiations."
"Rightly we are resisting the pre-emption of that decision today."
"Many things will change between now and December: inside the Union we will have reached an IGC settlement that will fully prepare us for further accessions; in Turkey the AKP administration will have consolidated its legitimacy and a new reform package will have progressed through Parliament; social and economic circumstances will have improved and advances will hopefully have been made in the practical implementation of reforms; and Turkey will have continued improving its relations with its neighbours."
"The quiet Turkish revolution will persist, and we in the Liberal family will see the bigger picture and treat Turkey fairly and recognise what a contribution Turkey can make to the future of Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is indeed the case that, in December 2004, the European Union will have to set a date for the opening of negotiations with Turkey on its future accession."
"This is certainly a highly significant step."
"I must say, on behalf of the majority of my group, that Turkey should take its place as a full member of the European Union."
"It is a country whose history and geography make it part of Europe."
"Contrary to what some people have claimed, either openly or behind a veil of spurious pretexts, the problem with Turkey is not its religious identity."
"Certain political elements, moreover, are still trying to exert pressure to have the so-called Judaeo-Christian foundations of Europe enshrined in the draft Constitution in order to make it difficult or even impossible for Turkey to accede to the Union."
"Be that as it may, the problem with Turkey is its political system, dominated by the armed forces and by the national laws and constitution, which are still far from compatible with democratic principles; the problem also lies in its unacceptable treatment of the Kurdish minority, even though that minority accounts for a quarter of the entire population."
"Admittedly, since 2001 Turkey has been pursuing a reform process based on the Copenhagen criteria."
"As this House has observed on several occasions, however, these reforms leave a number of significant restrictions on the full enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms."
"The report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy also endorses this analysis, having incorporated amendments tabled by our group, particularly those concerning Leyla Zana, the Kurdish question and the recognition of the genocide committed against the Armenians."
"It is true that Turkey has not always had a coherent framework enabling it to guarantee political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights."
"Its current constitution was adopted in 1982, under the military regime, and still bears the seal of authoritarianism."
"The armed forces continue to play a predominant role in political, economic and cultural life and in the education system."
"They are the very cornerstone of the state and society and are therefore one of the main obstacles to the development of Turkey towards a democratic and pluralist system of government."
"Change is slow, involving homeopathic remedies and often designed to bring about superficial improvements, and we cannot fail to recognise that there remain some very serious problems."
"Leyla Zana, who won the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, and three other former Members of the Chamber of Deputies of Kurdish origin who were convicted in 1994, remain in prison."
"The appeal process that we helped to initiate is being conducted in appalling conditions, as the European Parliament delegation, on which Feleknas Uca and Luigi Vinci represent my group, has observed at every hearing."
"Leyla Zana and her colleagues even refused to take part in the twelfth hearing in protest against these new proceedings in which their fate is a foregone conclusion."
"The Kurdish HADEP party has been banned, and the DEHAP party is under similar threat."
"Numerous judgments of the European Court of Human Rights are still being disregarded."
"Proceedings have been initiated against people for nothing more than a peaceful expression of their opinion."
"Human-rights activists are subjected by the authorities to harassment and intimidation or criminal investigation."
"The rights of trade unions are not guaranteed."
"Torture and maltreatment are still rife, particularly in police stations and prisons."
"Minorities are victims of discrimination, one example being the Kurds, whose economic, social and cultural rights have yet to be fully recognised."
"I listened carefully, Commissioner, to everything you said, but some questions remain unanswered with regard to Cyprus, particularly in relation to the continuing military occupation of the northern part of the island."
"Lastly, all of these factors prompted our colleague from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to write in his report, and I quote: ‘Meeting the political criteria of Copenhagen is a precondition for opening accession negotiations’."
"For the majority of my group, the democratisation of the Turkish institutions, genuine respect for fundamental rights, recognition of the rights of the Kurdish people, the release of Leyla Zana and the resolution of the Cypriot question are fundamental criteria which must be met if we are to approve the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey."
"Mr President, we have now reached the point in the debate on Turkey on which there is, fortunately, general unanimity about the remaining issues."
"These issues need to be tackled firmly, and implementation – the word has been dropped repeatedly – is necessary more than ever."
"Despite this, the current Oostlander report contains three weaknesses, and I believe that these ought to be eliminated first."
"First of all, let us consider paragraph 8, according to which Turkey's current position in relation to the Cyprus conflict reflects the political power of the army."
"We surely cannot take this seriously."
"What has just happened in Cyprus now is that the army has endorsed the course of events according to the government."
"That is an example of reform and not of stagnation."
"We ought to remove this section from the report, something that Amendment No 10 makes possible."
"Secondly, again in the light of recent events, surely Mr Oostlander cannot be serious when he states that the Greek Cypriots have demonstrated their firm commitment to the Annan plan?"
"They will need to prove this in the next few weeks."
"I believe, then, that a change is needed on that score too."
"Finally, the third weakness; I would be strongly in favour of lowering the voting threshold during the elections and have tabled an amendment to that effect."
"This is something Parliament wants, and we need to convey it to the Turks, because, as I see it, it would be preferable for the Turkish parliament to have a higher level of multiformity than it does at present, where a voting threshold of 10% is possible."
"The main problem of the Oostlander report, however, lies in paragraph 7."
"The rapporteur has recognised, or perhaps had to recognise, that, if the current reforms take place, the Member States will inevitably decide in December to start the negotiations."
"What does paragraph 7 say on this?"
"According to Mr Oostlander's interpretation, negotiations are inevitable, but we will not enter into real negotiations."
"In particular, the 31 chapters of the will not form the subject of negotiations, although these negotiations have taken place with all other candidate Member States."
"What is being proposed in paragraph 7 is that we complete all the political criteria first."
"That sounds good, but what does it mean in practice?"
"Let me give an example; the same paragraph states that the programme should contain the drafting of a new Constitution."
"Mr Oostlander is in favour of this, and so am I. If this is done in a proper manner, it will, I think, take between two and three years; we need only look at how long the European Union is taking."
"To take another example, Mr Oostlander has repeatedly stated that the change in mentality that we want is a lengthy process."
"Does he really believe that this should all be completed before we can discuss the chapters?"
"Surely not."
"Does Parliament think, and does, for example, the Group of the Party of the European Socialists really believe, that we should enter negotiations with Turkey with one arm tied behind our backs, because there are 31 chapters of the that we are not allowed to discuss?"
"My view, expressed in Amendment No 9, is different. I am in favour of doing two things after December."
"Firstly, we ought to continue to underline the importance of the political criteria, if necessary by means of a special monitoring system, because that is important, now and in future, but at the same time, we should start the so-called normal negotiations."
"In my opinion, we cannot say to Turkey in December that we will start negotiations and follow Mr Oostlander's interpretation in this. This interpretation is now enshrined in paragraph 7 and it allows us only to do the groundwork for many years before we can enter the actual negotiations."
"Paragraph 7 is now an imprecise – I would almost say diplomatic – compromise that covers a multitude of sins."
"The alternative is a clear, but balanced, position by Parliament, and to that Turkey is entitled."
"– Mr President, I congratulate Mr Oostlander on the work he has done in this report, in which he raises several politically important questions regarding Turkey’s accession to the European Union."
"I shall highlight two: the first concerns the extent to which the European Union itself is prepared for the future integration of this large Euro-Asian country."
"What impact will its accession have, if it joins?"
"What geopolitical state of affairs will result from the adoption of new external borders for the EU, which will lie not only outside Europe but also on the doorstep of armed conflicts?"
"How should we face the issue of population size that Turkey’s application raises, and the effects that this will have on the existing institutional balances?"
"Will Turkey’s entry strengthen the security of the European Union and make its foreign policy more credible and effective in the region?"
"Will it be possible to maintain the common agricultural policy?"
"If so, in what form?"
"What about the structural funds?"
"These observations do not imply that we have any less regard for the great Turkish nation; far from it."
"They merely mean that, in our view, there has yet to be a public, open, objective debate across Europe on this question, which we believe is absolutely essential."
"That is why we support the rapporteur’s proposal to call on the Commission to produce an exhaustive study on the impact of Turkey’s accession to the EU, which will inform Parliament and the Council of the internal changes that will have to be introduced into the EU, and the need to reform current policy in the various key areas I have mentioned."
"The second question is, in some respects, the converse of the first, and concerns Turkey’s political will to press forward whole-heartedly with the necessary reforms of its structures and its institutional and legal framework in order to comply with the Copenhagen political criteria, much as has occurred in the other candidate countries."
"The rapporteur quite rightly considers that it is now up to Turkey to decide for itself if it is willing or able, as a precondition for opening negotiations, to adopt the political principles and values of the EU as being suited to the Turkish state and Turkish society."
"In this respect we have to recognise that the current government has shown strong political motivation and will to carry out major reforms, which have proved difficult and which are, in many cases, still unfinished, especially in the field of human rights, since they clash with traditions and practices of civil, judicial and military administration that have been consolidated over decades."
"Opting for the so-called ‘legislative harmonisation packages’ has enabled Turkey to bring its legislation into line with EU standards more quickly than would have been the case if it had conducted an across-the-board review of the basic legal codes on which its political, judicial and legislative system is founded. This is a positive step."
"We are aware of the difficulties and the special conditions involved in this kind of process and can conclude that things are taking their course. Turkey may in future see the start of its negotiation process with the EU, provided that it keeps to the path of choosing the European values that it has been adopting of its own free and sovereign will."
"In conclusion, the stage we have now reached should thus be understood as one of mutual preparation for the possible accession of Turkey to the European Union; preparation by the Union, which has to adapt at all levels in order to welcome in the great Turkish nation; and preparation by Turkey, which must continue its efforts to effectively implement the necessary reforms in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria."
"Mr President, the outcome of this process must be the natural result of these efforts of mutual preparation and adaptation, and not the result of any subjective desire that does not take account of the realities that we are faced with on both sides."
"Mr President, entirely consistent with his previous report, Mr Oostlander has once again presented to this House a crystal-clear report on Turkey's very uphill journey in the direction of the European Union."
"The rapporteur is right to state, in paragraph 32, that Turkey still has a different concept of the secular state from that which is usual in the European Union."
"Mr Oostlander also mentions state control over the main religion and discrimination against others."
"I should like to substitute the word state control for promotion, because under the wings of the Presidium for Religious Matters, which falls directly within Prime Minister Erdogan’s remit, the Turkish Republic provides the main religion – Sunni Islam – with generous social development opportunities."
"You only need to visit the Christian churches in Turkey."
"To this day, although they fall within the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, they have to do without the status of legal personality."
"To put it succinctly, Commissioner, there is a great deal to be done, but I do not need to tell you that."
"I also endorse paragraph 10 in the report, in which Mr Oostlander stands up for the independence and the quality of higher education and scientific institutions in Turkey."
"A very topical request, given Mr Erdogan’s continuous attempts at reform, no less, to make the country's academic level subordinate to, and I quote 'the Cabinet's Islamist, conservative, political concepts’."
"This urgent warning, issued by a member of the Turkish Academy of Sciences a month or so ago, was published in the ."
"This is another tell-tale sign for Brussels with regard to the actual state of affairs in Ankara."
"Mr President, as has been amply elucidated here, Turkey has made progress with its reforms."
"Just as well!"
"However, the point is not whether candidate Member States make progress, but whether they meet the criteria in order to be able to join."
"That is clearly not the case."
"Time permitting, I could list here a whole ream of fundamental problems that Turkey is still facing."
"The human rights situation remains precarious, despite the reforms, which are mostly in place only on paper and are not being put into practice."
"On a socio-economic level too, the gap between Turkey and the European Union is so wide that it would be totally irresponsible even to consider Turkey's accession."
"I therefore fail to understand why some speakers state that Turkey will become a Member of the European Union, come what may."
"This attitude sums up perfectly all the things that are going wrong with the European Union."
"An appeal is made for including a non-European and Islamic country in the European Union, without holding a fundamental discussion on this."
"We want to include a country that, in 15 years' time, will be the largest Member State in terms of population and in terms of surface area."
"Moreover, that country will become the largest net recipient by far, but the population in Europe has not been consulted on this at any time; there will be no referendum in the Member States."
"We are even being warned against discussing the Turkey issue during the election campaign."
"In other words, fundamental decisions are being taken without reference to Europe’s citizens."
"That is the democratic deficit all over."
"What it comes down to is that Turkey is not a European country and, as such, does not belong in the European Union."
"Nobody has ever had the courage to say this to the Turks, but one day we will have to."
"Turkey can, and has to, be helped as a friendly country, but that can be done perfectly well with an association agreement and in the framework of the Policy of Good Neighbourliness."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I believe it to be extraordinarily important that Turkey will be closely associated with us."
"This is very much in our own strategic interests."
"It is, secondly, very much in our own interests that Turkey should become democratic and be under the rule of law, and that we should support developments towards this end."
"I do, though, have a number of unanswered questions."
"Looking at the region as a whole, Turkey is the country with the most highly developed democracy and rule of law."
"At the same time, Kemalism is, for a variety of reasons, an obstacle to membership of the European Union."
"Is it not perhaps the case, though, that Kemalism and the influence of the army are the reasons why Turkey manifests some degree of democracy and the rule of law?"
"This is an inherent contradiction and a difficult issue, one that needs to be examined, and one of which we must not lose sight at the present time."
"The second thing I want to say is that I, unlike Mr Lagendijk, take the view that negotiations are indeed dependent on fulfilment of the political criteria."
"That was the line we took with Slovakia; that is why Slovakia was not on board as long ago as 1997, and that is the line we should be taking now."
"If we do, we are not discriminating against Turkey; we are applying the normal rules as we have always done."
"Where fulfilment of the political criteria is concerned, it is not enough for legislators to pass the relevant resolutions; these must be put into practice."
"The rule of law and human rights must not just be decided on in the Grand National Assembly, but must also be accepted and put into practice by district court judges in Eastern Anatolia, and this is where I have my doubts as to whether it will be possible for this to happen by November."
"I have no doubt whatever that the present government wants this, but I do doubt whether it will be possible."
"It is something we will have to examine in the autumn, in exactly the same way, for example, as we will have to examine – as the German Foreign Minister has said – whether Turkey can be regarded as a safe third country for the purposes of the asylum procedure, as Germany accepts more asylum seekers from Turkey than from any other country."
"If, though, someone is recognised as an asylum seeker, then the country from which they come cannot be said to be under the rule of law."
"This issue will have to be addressed, and an answer given."
"It must remain clear to us that the European Union’s integrative capacity has to be reviewed, that we have to consider whether its bonds are strong enough to prevent the occurrence of what Mr Van Orden has just described."
"We must be clear in our own minds about the fact that there are those in this House who seek to use enlargement to wreck the European Union."
"Let me add, though, that there are only a few of them; they are not all those who are in favour of Turkey’s accession, and I do believe that it is not only because of Turkey, but also because of other countries in Europe, that we need options for our relationships with countries that are not full Member States, including a new European Economic Area."
"While these countries, at any rate, should not be full members, at least at first, the option of full membership for Turkey, for the Ukraine, for the countries of the Western Balkans, will create serious problems for us in the coming years, and that is why we should come up with some new ideas."
"Let me conclude, Mr President, by saying what I would like to see done about the Cyprus question. I would like to see this House delay taking up a definite position until such time as we have had sight of the documents we need in order to do so, as we did, for example, with regard to the reunification of Germany, when we went as far as to set up a special committee to consider the issue."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have asked for permission to speak because your President and Conference of Presidents have asked me, as a matter of urgency, to go to them now."
"I find it difficult to be in the plenary and with the Conference of Presidents simultaneously."
"I hope you will understand that this must be my last contribution, and that I must then comply with your President’s request."
"I have four brief comments to make."
"The first is that the adoption of Community law is what accession negotiations are about; it is not a precondition for them taking place."
"That is why many of the rapporteurs were quite right in what they said, and, indeed, our progress reports say the same thing, but that cannot now be used to justify our saying that we cannot start negotiating with Turkey because they have not yet done those things about which we are going to be negotiating."
"That is, unfortunately, an inherent contradiction."
"I also have to point out to Mrs Sommer that it is simply not true to say, as she does, that the Turks are asking for more and more money whilst not taking any action."
"I surely ought to know if Turkey were asking for more money; it is not."
"On the contrary the truth – shameful as it is – is that the European Union was unable to deliver on its financial commitments to Turkey."
"That is the truth of the matter."
"Let me turn to the issue of the possible effects of Turkish accession on the Community system, which is, I would like to say, one of the most important issues of all."
"The idea of conducting a specific study into this is one that I regard as particularly important and interesting."
"I, too, am persuaded that this should be done, and we have already started to give some thought to the possible scope for such a project."
"It is also important, though, that we should know what accession would ultimately mean for the EU by the time any decision is taken on whether or not to start negotiating."
"I cannot do other than agree with all those who have made it abundantly clear that changes have to be reflected in reality."
"I have said the same thing over and over again to the Turkish Prime Minister during the long breaks in negotiations at Bürgenstock in Switzerland over the past few days."
"He is familiar with the problem, and I told him that the implementation of reforms must have reached such a critical mass by the end of this year that we can regard the process of implementation as credible and sustainable."
"If it is not, then we will hardly be able to come to the conclusion that the political criteria have been fulfilled."
"I would also like to highlight what Mr Brok said about perseverance in the reform process, which is the most important thing of all."
"As you will be aware, I favour a debate on the fundamental question of whether or not Turkey’s accession should happen at all – one that, although contentious, would be conducted frankly and without any prejudice whatever."
"All I ask, as I always do, is that, in all that we say and in the way we conduct our debate, we should not undermine what the reformers in Turkey are doing."
"Whatever we think about Turkey, there is one thing on which we must agree, and that is that it is in our fundamental interests that Turkey should become democratic, subject to the rule of law and stable, that it should become a steadfast and reliable partner for the European Union."
"That is true in any case, and that is why the reform process must continue."
"Let me conclude by returning, briefly, to Cyprus: all the issues raised in the Oostlander Report concerning Turkish responsibility for Cyprus will be resolved as soon as the Annan plan is accepted."
"There will then be a solution, and so all the issues will no longer be relevant and will pass away."
"I get the impression that what now counts most of all, in fact, is to persuade the Greek Cypriot community that the plan that has been devised, the latest plan to be on the table – and there will not be another – is in their interests too."
"To do so demands a really high degree of leadership and strength of political will."
"While I am perfectly willing to make available to your House and to its committees all the information that we have, I have to point out that no changes can be made to the plan; all that we can do now is to consider it very carefully and evaluate it for ourselves, but nothing more can be changed."
"That is the answer I wanted to give you."
"I really do apologise for being unable, for once, to be present for the whole debate, but I have told you the reason why, and I ask for your understanding."
"Mr President, I thank our exceptional rapporteur for his and the soberness with which he approached his subject and the open mind with which he accepted our amendments which, contrary to what Mr Van Orden maintains, do not want to take Turkey back to terms which have already been satisfied, but want the reforms to be carried out in practice, rather than just on paper, as a fictitious reality."
"Of course, fictitious reality may suffice for Mr Van Orden, just as it suffices for him for the European Union to be a fictitious reality, from what I have understood, because he is aiming for a relaxed European Union."
"That is not our idea."
"There are those who maintain that a Muslim Turkey cannot be accepted into the European Union."
"We do not agree with this; we want a Turkey which can of course be Muslim and will be, but it must be democratic and pacifist, at least towards its partners in the European Union."
"If Turkey thinks that we shall accept it as a military power and that we shall ratify the militaristic attitude of the leaders of its armed forces within the European Union, it is making a serious mistake."
"Nor is Turkey's stance in Cyprus encouraging and I greatly fear that neither the Secretary General's plan nor the stance of the European Commission are encouraging, because they cannot accept a massive military presence, which is equivalent to the military occupation of part of Cyprus, 18 years after the entry of Cyprus to the European Union, and probably even after the admittance of Turkey to the European Union."
"These are absurd things and may explain the impatience of the Greek side towards the Annan plan."
"I hope and I am in favour of the Greek side's accepting the plan in question, but we must realise that we are asking the Greek side to build a democracy on something which is fundamentally anti-democratic, as the Annan plan is in its present state."
"I hope that we manage this for the good of Cyprus and the European Union, but we need to know what we are asking for."
"As far as Turkey's progress towards satisfying the Copenhagen criteria is concerned, on paper, yes!"
"In reality, it is far from it."
"For example, the Minister for Education is asking for fanatical essays from pupils against other nationalities."
"It is not a question of the reform reaching the depths of the Orient."
"The reform needs to reach the depths of the Ministry of Education first."
"The rector of the University of Istanbul is standing up and talking about 135 000 dead in order to occupy both Cyprus and Greece."
"I am not saying that he is representative of all of public opinion or of the government; but this shows that there is resistance by one part of public opinion at least to certain fundamental changes and they must be taken into account, because the integration of Turkey into the European Union can only come about as and when the attitude within Turkey changes."
"Of course, we have the case of Leyla Zana, who is a constant slap in the face of the European Parliament and I wonder how we still suffer this situation to continue."
"It was posited by the president of Turkish industry two years ago that Turkey will either become Europe or will become Pakistan."
"We want Turkey to become Europe and, in order to achieve this, we must strengthen every progressive trend within Turkey, so that this is achieved from internal procedures, not from being led by the hand from outside because, if it is led by the hand from outside, we cannot hope that there will be change where change is needed in Turkey."
"– Mr President, I regret the Commissioner has had to leave for another meeting and is not present at this discussion within Parliament’s most important body – the plenary."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Oostlander, because I believe he has produced a good report."
"Progress has been made in Turkey, but there remain many shortcomings, above all with regard to the role of the military and respect for the minorities living in that country."
"The European Union must move forward and deepen, which I believe is seen as a risk by those people who want the European Union to be nothing more than a union for free trade and who see enlargement and the incorporation of other countries as way of ensuring that the European Union does not progress towards political union."
"I believe that Turkey must be required to comply fully with the Copenhagen criteria and make progress towards a more democratic society which treats its minorities with greater respect."
"Mr President, the report being debated, while recognising many of the problems faced by Turkey and its people in all sectors and quoting specific examples of blatant violations of fundamental rights, curiously finds at the same time, as Messrs Oostlander and Verheugen have repeated again today, that important, encouraging steps have been made."
"That is how it describes certain individual amendments to the legislative framework, which are not even applied in practice, despite the intentions expressed from time to time by those in government."
"The report even finds that the present government is acutely keen to make revolutionary reforms in all sectors."
"However, these findings are a surprise, given that it is not the first time that the Turkish government of the day has expressed such intentions, which are blatantly refuted in daily practice."
"Indeed, persecutions, arbitrary arrests and torture to the death for political reasons continue."
"The gaols are full of thousands of political prisoners, including Leyla Zana and three members of parliament of Kurdish extraction who, after ten years in prison, are to undergo another fixed trial."
"The Constitutional Court has upheld the ban on the communist party."
"The Dehap is threatened with a new ban, while its leaders are being tried and defenders of human rights are being persecuted and murdered."
"Grass-roots movements campaigning for peace, democracy and workers' rights are being hounded and the army continues to rule in the political and social life of the country."
"As if that were not enough, the report calls for Turkey to receive greater backing in its fight against terrorism, ignoring the fact that it is the prime terrorist in its area."
"As far as the Cyprus problem is concerned, the report considers it constructive that Turkey aims to safeguard as the results of the barbaric invasion and occupation, about which the report says not a word."
"On the contrary, it supports the Annan plan which, in essence, tramples over the UN resolutions and international law in general, legalising the results of the invasion and occupation."
"The report calls coercively on the Cyprus Government to accept it, as did Messrs Oostlander, Verheugen and others today, proving how hypocritical their proclamations are about respect for international law."
"The report is driven by a spirit of imposing the sovereignty of the European Union in all sectors and a spirit of serving its big business."
"That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece shall be voting against the report, taking account of the experience of the Greek people, with feelings of solidarity with the people of Turkey, and considering that the negative elements of the integration procedure and integration itself will far outweigh any individual benefits to them."
"Mr President, I welcome this timely report by Mr Oostlander."
"It contains a number of valuable recommendations."
"On Monday I returned from Turkey, where, with other politicians and trade unionists, I had the opportunity to observe the local elections."
"Paragraph 1 of the recommendations of this report refers to the 'oft-stated commitment' by the Turkish authorities 'to democracy and Europe'."
"I cannot share the same confidence."
"Whilst seeking to observe elections in the primary school of Vali Unal Erkan in Diyarbakir, we were shouted at, threateningly, by the local chief of police and prevented from entering the polling station."
"This was not an isolated incident."
"In polling stations in other parts of the country, members of the governing Turkish party were standing by, watching ballot papers being filled in by Kurdish electors."
"The military were present outside many polling stations within the Kurdish area."
"Speakers of the Kurdish language – spoken by 20 million people in Turkey – continue to face persecution."
"Kurdish-medium schools are banned, the only concession being the belated effort now to allow a few schoolrooms to be open to teach Kurdish as a foreign language for a few hours a week."
"How can we then say, in paragraph 8, that we have confidence that the AKP government will safeguard democratic values?"
"As the report emphasises, the prohibition of political parties such as Hadep/Dehap continues, which is why I would urge colleagues to support Amendment No 11 by Mr Lagendijk on the crucial issue of abolishing the 10% threshold for political parties."
"Until these fundamental matters are addressed and the Turkish Government respects our own Charter of Fundamental Rights, many of us will have grave misgivings before supporting their accession to the European Union."
"– Mr President, firstly, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Oostlander, for a skilfully prepared report with many correct assessments, but also with unrealistic expectations."
"The report states that the basic view is that, insofar as it wishes to do so, Turkey is in a position to transform itself into a first-class EU Member State."
"This seems to me rather like begging the question."
"If Turkey transforms itself, the country will become other than it is, but the question is of course one of whether such a transformation is at all possible."
"If, firstly, we take it for granted that the EU consists of European states, Turkey can never become a member, for the country cannot transform itself into a European state, no matter how much it wishes to do so."
"The admission of countries outside Europe has never seriously been debated, and it is hardly possible or desirable to create such extensive cooperation within the framework of the treaties that constitute the basis of the EU."
"Secondly, there is the whole issue of complying with the Copenhagen criteria or Balladur principles, which are especially relevant here in relation to the occupation of parts of Cyprus. I must say, moreover, that I do not believe in the value of the Annan plan."
"I think Mr Verheugen is mistaken if he thinks that the Greek Cypriots are adherents of this plan."
"I do not believe that the Greek Cypriots will be able to accept a plan that gives Turkey a foothold on the island."
"Finally, there is the Treaty of Lausanne."
"This implies a total change to the Turkish constitution, its penal law, its legislation on marriage, its religious legislation, and so forth."
"Thirdly, there is a sharp difference between Turkey's economic structure and development and those of the EU. Change cannot be brought about merely through economic aid."
"It is a matter of creating a completely different society."
"Finally, the admission of Turkey would lead to massive immigration of Turks into the EU, and even bigger parallel Islamic societies would take shape."
"There has recently been a series of very unsettling reports of threatening, anti-Western attitudes in extensive sections of the Islamic societies within the EU, and unfortunately this applies particularly to young, second-generation Turks."
"Europe simply cannot live with large population groups in the EU rejecting our culture."
"What the adherents of Turkish membership are really requesting is for Turkey to jettison its entire Islamic culture, and I do not see this as realistic."
"It is important not to confuse the attitudes represented by Turkish diplomats and certain intellectuals and politicians with those found in the rest of Turkey’s very class-divided society."
"Turkey is basically an Islamic society, regardless of the formal separation of church and state imposed from above."
"If Turkey were thoroughly democratised, as the EU wishes, the people would, unfortunately, without doubt take a democratic decision to introduce an Islamic state without democracy."
"There is not an Islamic country in the world that meets the Copenhagen criteria, and Turkey is hardly likely to do so either, even if the EU asks it to."
"We should honestly say to Turkey that there can be no question of membership of the EU, and we should not hold out empty promises to the country. On that basis, I should like to support the amendments, tabled by Mr Ferber and others, to integrate Turkey into the EU's new neighbour policy."
"Mr President, we opposed the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, involving the accession of ten new members."
"It is not that we are opposed in principle to these countries’ accession, but my group and I, the French delegation to the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, have been expressing our opposition to an unrealistic integration timetable and to the immediate accession of countries which, like ourselves, are not ready for such a leap into the unknown."
"Our position on Turkish accession is quite different."
"In this case, we are opposed in principle to Turkish accession."
"As General de Gaulle remarked, there is no getting away from the facts."
"Geographically historically and culturally, Turkey is not a European country."
"The fact is that, under Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union, any applicant for membership of the European Union must be a European State."
"I should just like to raise two further points, in addition to the many that have already been made."
"Firstly, in the multipolar world in which we live, Turkey is an Eastern power; it plays a dominant role among the Turkish-speaking peoples of Central Asia and shares lengthy borders with Iran, Iraq and Syria."
"Such an unstable region, in our view, is no place for the European Union."
"Secondly, the political representation of the countries in the European Union is linked to their relative demographic weight."
"In due course, Turkey will be more populous than any European country."
"We do not want a country whose accession arouses such controversy to become a political heavyweight in the European Union."
"After years of procrastination on the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey, the vote on this report is an opportunity to send out a strong political signal."
"Even though we subscribe to the numerous criticisms in the report relating to the country’s lack of preparedness for accession, the report focuses on Turkey’s progression towards accession, and we shall therefore oppose it, because, like a great number of our fellow citizens, we are against Turkish membership of the Union."
"To conclude, let me leave you with one final question: where is the expansion of this Union, this so-called European Union, going to stop?"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with warm thanks to Mr Oostlander, who, in this report and its predecessor, has examined in depth the issue of Turkey and of its development into a democratic state in which the rule of law prevails."
"I do think, though, that the time is coming when Europe will have to answer the question of how we want, in the long term, to organise relations between the European Union and Turkey, and I would like to say that I am greatly saddened by the prevalent opinion that, where Turkey’s relationship with the European Union is concerned, there are only two options, one being that it becomes a Member State and the other that it does not."
"This belief completely disregards the variegated and diverse individual ways in which the European Union and other countries can cooperate."
"I am from a region bordering on Switzerland, a country with which we have concluded a privileged partnership, which has enabled us to join together in resolving problems while each developing in our own way."
"That is precisely what we are thinking of when we talk about Turkey."
"Commissioner Verheugen is of course right to say that we need to stabilise the forces that are working for reform, but is full Member State status the only means of doing so?"
"Is there not another option when it comes to ensuring that Turkey develops economically and as a stable democracy, which is in our interests as Europeans, without accession to the European Union being a necessary consequence of that?"
"That, precisely, is what we should be discussing among ourselves, with great frankness and great honesty."
"I would urge the Commission – or the remnant of it that is still there, as it is currently breaking up – when it puts together its report for presentation to the Heads of State or Government in the autumn, to give in-depth attention to the question of whether or not the political criteria have been fulfilled."
"My own country is still granting asylum to people from Turkey, because they are persecuted by the State there."
"Can we carry on accession negotiations with such a country?"
"I do not believe that we can."
"I would also ask the Council to give this question very serious consideration, because, ultimately, Parliament’s consent will be needed."
"If the Heads of State or Government think they can take fundamental decisions of this kind without reference to the European people, then they deceive themselves."
"They are deluded if they think it would end up all happening automatically, that Parliament and the people would go along with it – for some Member States will hold referendums on whether or not to ratify it."
"What this House has, here and now, is, I think, a great opportunity to give thought to this, and to send the peoples of the European Union the message that, while we are very serious about the concerns and expectations of people in Turkey and in our other neighbouring countries where this European Union of ours is concerned, we do have options open to us other than merely discussing full membership, and we should now explore them together."
"Mr President, Turkey is an important subject on which opinions are very much divided."
"After numerous discussion sessions and amendments in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the resolution proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Oostlander, seems to me to be well enough balanced to be voted through."
"I shall vote in favour of it – provided, of course, that this balance is not upset by the adoption in plenary of new amendments that are unduly harsh on Turkey."
"Not that we need to be soft on Turkey in any way."
"Indeed, it is imperative that we insist on the radical reforms that the Turkish Government must implement if it is eventually to meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"This insistence and these demands, reaffirmed on countless occasions by the European Parliament and the Commission, have actually begun to bear fruit."
"Mr Erdogan’s Government, strengthened by the outcome of the last elections, and the Turkish Grand National Assembly have already adopted laws that move in the right direction."
"It is essential, of course, that these new laws are properly implemented in practice, and there is certainly a need for other laws and a new constitution."
"People’s mindsets, of course, have to be changed too, and that is never easy; in fact, it is the most difficult task of all."
"Progress has already been made, however, and we in Parliament, far from breaking this momentum, must encourage it to grow."
"One of the great merits of this process preparing the way for future Turkish accession to the European Union is that it encourages reforms leading to pluralist democracy, a modern economy and respect for individual rights."
"The last of these calls to mind the case of Leyla Zana, and it is my fervent wish that the reform process will lead quickly to the long-awaited just and equitable resolution of this situation."
"In short, the ongoing reform process has already been of great value in drawing us closer to Turkey and in forging increasingly firm bonds of mutual trust between Turkey and ourselves."
"The fact is that we are in greater need of these bonds."
"Our future, and particularly our security in the wider sense of the term, depends to a great extent on good relations with the great country of Turkey."
"We must therefore continue to cultivate these relations with vigour and conviction against a background of hope in the opening of accession negotiations at the beginning of next year."
"– Mr President, congratulations to Mr Oostlander on his splendid report."
"The European Council decided in Helsinki in 1999 that Turkey is a candidate country."
"That decision is still in force and, therefore, Turkey is to be treated as a candidate country in line with all the other candidate countries."
"The biggest requirement of a candidate country is, as Mr Oostlander said, that it fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria. It is to be a society based on the rule of law with democratic stability and respect for human rights and for minorities, it is to have a well-functioning market economy, and so on."
"Turkey does not at present meet all these conditions, but it is on the way to doing so. We have seen much progress, and we must not, therefore, here and now reject the possibility of Turkey's becoming a member of the EU."
"There is no doubt that it is precisely the EU's demands that have contributed significantly to the democratic progress that has taken place in Turkey, and a signal from the European Parliament that Turkey cannot become a member of the EU, or that Turkey must be given special status would undoubtedly put a stop to this positive development."
"On the basis of the Commission's papers, the Heads of Government are now, in December, to take a decision on accession negotiations with Turkey within a more precise time-scale and on more precise conditions."
"With Mr Oostlander’s thorough, balanced and comprehensive report, the European Parliament must, however, here and now send a signal to the European Council that Turkey is to be treated like all previous candidate countries."
"This is something we owe to our Turkish neighbours, and we must tell the Turks that they are well on the way and that they should continue along the path upon which they have embarked, for the benefit of Turkey, the EU and stability and growth in our part of the world."
"– Mr President, I should like to take the opportunity to draw attention to the Turkish human rights organisation, HRFT."
"Last weekend, the president of the HRFT, Yavuz Önen, received an award at the national congress of the June Movement for his and the organisation's courageous struggle for human rights in Turkey."
"The HRFT is threatened with closure as a result of several court cases against members of its leadership, including Yavuz Önen."
"The HRFT has five centres for the rehabilitation of torture victims, and a thousand active volunteers."
"Its closure might have serious consequences for the treatment of torture victims in Turkey, since no one else can take up the HRFT’s work."
"The many victims of torture would be left in the lurch."
"Torture takes place routinely in Turkish prisons and at Turkish police stations."
"The state and the authorities constantly try to harass the centres in their work on court cases, and doctors are threatened with losing their jobs at the public hospitals if they work for the centres."
"Yes, the centres have, in fact, by no means been made legal, but they have so far won all their cases against the state."
"I call upon Parliament and the Commission carefully to monitor the ability of the Turkish human rights organisation to carry out its very necessary work for human rights in Turkey."
"– Madam President, the Oostlander report wisely concludes that Turkey is not ready to join the European Union because, and I quote, ‘Turkey does not yet meet the Copenhagen political criteria’."
"To tell the truth, when we read the report in detail, it contains precious few points that might honestly be regarded as arguments in favour of accession other than references to the meritorious efforts of the Turkish Government, and even these are by no means sure to have any genuinely profound social impact."
"The values of Turkish society are still far removed from those of the European Union in numerous fundamental areas, such as relations between the state and religious communities, as detailed in paragraphs 32 and 33 of the Oostlander report, which I would urge everyone to think about."
"We can always hope, of course, for more rapid constitutional development in Turkey towards democracy, pluralism, public freedoms and the dismantling of the parallel military state."
"These objectives, however, have yet to be achieved."
"Even if they were achieved, how long would it then take for Turkish society to fall into line?"
"Besides, do we not have reason to fear adverse reactions on the part of certain social groups and undesirable effects which, as Europeans, we would be powerless to control?"
"Accordingly, ladies and gentlemen, it would be irresponsible of us to offer Turkey anything but a privileged partnership designed to support its development without leading the EU down a dangerous path."
"It would be better to say this clearly, and we should have done so long ago. My main criticism of the Oostlander report is that it does not convey this message."
"Madam President, I join with others in thanking the rapporteur for giving us an excellent basis for our debate on this very sensitive subject this morning."
"I would also like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for having come from Switzerland late yesterday evening to inform us of the situation regarding the talks with Cyprus, which is intimately linked with our debate this morning."
"Two weeks ago I attended the EU-Cyprus Joint Parliamentary Committee, and while there was little optimism, there was a real desire for the two communities to be united on 1 May."
"We hope very much that this will take place."
"On Turkish accession to the Union, Mr Verheugen gave us a very detailed analysis of the political and economic reforms that have been made."
"I welcome, as others have, his belief that a clear objective assessment should be made on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria."
"I have a copy of the Copenhagen criteria of 21-22 June 1993 in front of me."
"It states that: 'Membership requires that the candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union.'"
"However, then it states: 'The Union's capacity to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration, is also an important consideration in the general interest of both the Union and the candidate countries.'"
"Much has been said in this debate about the great progress Turkey is making, but very little has been said about the Union's capacity to absorb a country of the size and nature of Turkey."
"Therefore, we need now to look not only at Turkey's ability to join the Union, but also at our ability to absorb it."
"When coming to the question of the big picture – which Mr Duff mentioned – many in my political group believe that this involves the ability of the Union to absorb Turkey on the one side and the Turkish ability to meet those criteria on the other."
"We believe, therefore, that there should be a fundamental assessment of the institutional capacity of the Union to absorb Turkey and that this should be part of the Commission's report in October."
"So we should have the courage to look at the situation in a very clear and reasonable manner."
"Therefore, with 25 Member States from 1 May, 21 languages, no post-2006 financial perspective in view until 2005 at the earliest, and doubts about whether a Constitutional Treaty will be agreed and ratified, the most sensible thing would be to say that there is real uncertainty in the Union's current political situation, and to be extremely cautious before giving Turkey the green light at this stage."
"– Madam President, Helmut Kohl was recently asked on German television what he thought about the accession of Turkey."
"His answer made reference to the Copenhagen criteria."
"Even after the reporter put many more questions to him, he did not say ‘no’ to Turkish accession."
"I think he was right."
"As Turkey has been promised accession for 40 years, anything else would only unsettle the people on the Bosphorus and the overall political climate in Europe as well."
"Parliament should therefore not adopt anything that would constitute an obstacle to the accession option; it follows that several motions that have been tabled should not be allowed to pass."
"Quite clearly, the ball is in the Turkish court."
"The Turks must demonstrate compliance with the Copenhagen criteria."
"We can see that much has been done, but not yet enough."
"There is still a long way to go on the road to democracy, to the rule of law, to freedom, and, as regards the last of these, our express concern has been for Turkey’s minorities, especially the Kurds."
"Much has been set down in black and white, but it is not yet working in practice – in schools, in television, or when it comes to the use of their language."
"I get letters from members of the public, complaining about the arbitrary treatment they receive from the police and the justice system – a grim business to which Turkey must put an end!"
"Their police and justice systems are not democratic; there is much still to be done here."
"I also believe that all power must be in the hands of the civil institutions, and that the armed forces must go where they belong – to their barracks."
"It cannot be acceptable that the armed forces, the National Security Council, should have the upper hand when decisions are taken in Turkey."
"I agree with Commissioner Verheugen’s assessment that Turkey has made a start on a major project of reform."
"For an Islamic country, a constitution based on democratic and liberal principles is also a major experiment, and something that we should support."
"So, instead of saying ‘no’, we should leave the door of opportunity open to further reforms and vote accordingly later on."
"Madam President, the Oostlander report deserves all our respect."
"Many, if not all, speeches have underlined the fundamental problem, which is that of the respect for human rights and principles of freedom on which our Union is founded."
"The question is, does Turkey fulfil the requirements from this point of view?"
"We would answer in the negative."
"In this connection, I would like to report that yesterday something very serious happened in the chamber of the Italian Parliament."
"The leader of the Lega Nord-Padania, Mr Cè, was prevented from speaking because he dared to utter a phrase – ‘(thieving Rome) – which was censored."
"This is a very serious precedent."
"I therefore call on the European Parliament, as the guardian of the freedom of all European peoples, to show solidarity concerning the violated right of the legitimate representatives of the citizens of Padania – who have no fewer rights than the Kurds – to be able to speak freely, in particular in the parliamentary chambers of a founding member of the European Union."
"I would reiterate that this is an extremely serious precedent concerning censorship of a political party that wants independence and federalism and is, therefore, against statism. This seems more typical of Turkish style democracy than that of a country that is undoubtedly democratic and was a founding member of the European Union."
"The phrase does not indicate racism against anyone, least of all the Roman people."
"Being against ‘thieving Rome’ means being against centralism and being against those who oppress our freedom."
"We are against thieving Rome for the same reasons that we say ‘no’ to the accession of Turkey to Europe."
"Down with thieving Rome, down with thieving Rome!"
"Here I can say it freely and no one, thank God, will silence me: down with thieving Rome!"
"Let them hear it in Rome: Padania is against thieving Rome, it is in favour of freedom."
"Long live freedom!"
"Long live the European Union!"
"Long live the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination!"
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in four weeks’ time, the European Union will be experiencing its biggest enlargement so far, an event that will bring about long-term change in Europe, and one that must be a popular success for the European Union."
"There can be no doubt about the fact that the enlarged EU will need time to consolidate."
"The public can scarcely understand that an event of this magnitude does not happen all at once, and that we need, at the same time, to set in motion a process to speed enlargement up."
"It is with these things in mind that the debate on Turkish accession must be conducted."
"I do not suppose that anyone in this House is unaware of Turkey’s geopolitical significance, or does not welcome its steps towards democracy and human rights."
"Nor, though, can there be anyone who would deny that there is a gulf between what legislation presumes and what has actually been implemented with regard to all these issues."
"Reference has already been made to the fact that Turkey is one of the countries producing the most asylum seekers, and Austria, for example, grants asylum to more Turks than to anyone else."
"I nevertheless believe, as does the delegation to which I belong, that, in concentrating on purely political criteria, the report on Turkey takes too narrow a view."
"That is why my delegation and I endorse all the motions aimed at securing a broader basis for this debate."
"There is no reason why the Commission should not produce a study on the effects of Turkish accession on the European Union, whether as part of the report that is due in October or as a separate study."
"Consideration must be given to the repercussions on structural policy, on the common agricultural policy, and on the institutions of the European Union."
"When the report is produced, in October, the options for Turkey should also be set out, and these should not focus solely on accession; we have to offer them alternatives in good time."
"That we owe to ourselves and to them."
"I would like to conclude by extending warm thanks to Mr Oostlander, who has, as rapporteur, been magnanimous enough not to inhibit discussion, and has remained sensitive enough to keep faith with himself."
"What this report on Turkey now presents us with, though, is the opportunity to send an important political signal and to put the debate on a broader basis."
"It is not acceptable that we should limit ourselves to political criteria in the narrowest sense of the word."
"It must also be possible to examine and assess the likely effects on the European Union."
"If that is not done, the voters will never forgive us."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr Oostlander for his wise words to us, as always."
"The fundamental problem with enlargement is that we will see a large expansion of the Union from 1 May, and that will be much more problematic than earlier rounds of enlargement, while at the same time the Union’s ability to receive new members is not as great as it was before."
"The EU is now more demanding and involved, and enlargement is not a machine or an animal: it is the most complex human creation of all – the European Union."
"We must, however, treat Turkey just as fairly as all the other countries seeking accession to the EU despite the fact that our ability to receive them has weakened."
"A lot of progress has been made in Turkey in a short time."
"There are new laws representing civil society and there is democracy."
"The status of women and the Kurds is now being openly debated, although I have no conclusive knowledge of where military power ends and civil power begins."
"The significance of the status of the military is a very big problem."
"The Copenhagen criteria have not been fulfilled, by which I mean the establishment of the rule of law and human rights."
"There is still work to do regarding this."
"The judiciary is not independent and Turkey should sign the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court."
"We face a familiar problem: just laws are passed, and a lot of decisions are taken, but whether or not they are implemented in practice and this implementation is monitored remains a big, murky problem that we have been unable to solve, and this is in the hands of the Turks themselves."
"Can they do it?"
"That is the question this time round, and we will only answer it afterwards."
"Madam President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Oostlander, who managed to produce a report that was approved by both the advocates and the opponents of Turkish accession in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"This is no mean feat and is due to the very reasonable and balanced line of argument he follows from beginning to end – well, almost from beginning to end, but more of that in a moment."
"I should like to say that Mrs Stenzel speaks with the voice of wisdom when she points out that we are not seeing the whole picture if we only assess Turkey’s progress but do not examine the state of readiness of the European Union, in its various fields of political activity, to receive Turkey, and this is no trifling matter."
"The point I should like to pick up, Mr Oostlander, is that of secularism."
"Paragraph 32 of your report seems to me to proceed from a slightly jaundiced view of the secularism which is perhaps the most valuable part of the legacy of Kemal Atatürk."
"The separation of church and state is not an archaic formula but a recipe for the future of our Union."
"The fact that the government of a country whose people are mainly Muslim is trying to put this separation into practice is, I believe, an asset for which Turkey deserves credit, not an obstacle to progress."
"– Madam President, I want to pay tribute to Mr Oostlander’s report and to him for seeking compromises."
"There is absolutely no doubt in this House that Turkey is an important partner and that it will remain one."
"Partnership, however, does not automatically mean full membership of the European Union."
"Mr Leinen mentioned the 1963 Association Agreement."
"This puts it in explicitly negative terms, stating that: ‘the possibility of accession to the European Economic Community at a later date is not excluded’."
"Those – no more and no less – are the words used."
"After two decades of absolute standstill, Turkey has at last got down to the task of changing its laws."
"As it progresses towards more democracy and more human rights, that can surely be seen in a positive light."
"Even though the Turkish Prime Minister has announced his intention of amending another 15 to 20 paragraphs of the constitution in April and May, these changes take no account as yet of important demands made by the European Parliament, for such things as freedom of religion and the repeal of the 10% clause in order to protect political minorities."
"We have therefore tabled motions highlighting the possibility of an alternative to deciding in favour of or against full membership, that alternative being a privileged partnership."
"Let nobody assume that the decision on this will be for the Council alone."
"The next Parliament to be elected – which will sit from 2004 and 2009 – must possess in full the prerogative of saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and of devising alternatives."
"I therefore ask the Members of this House to treat the amendments we have introduced on this subject as the dignity of this Parliament and of our position require."
"Let me say one last thing about the Copenhagen criteria: important though they are, they are not enough."
"The Turks must bear in mind that the criteria cover not only the Cyprus issue, but also the question of whether the European Union is itself in a position to welcome their country into membership."
"We cannot allow ourselves to get involved in a risky undertaking that would test to the utmost the EU’s political and economic capacity to act."
"– Madam President, I would like to thank, very warmly and most sincerely, all those Members of this House who have spoken, most of whom make the same speech in every debate on Turkey, in order to make it plain that they do not want Turkey or Turks in the European Union."
"I am grateful for five years of cooperation and for your having tolerated me, a Turk, in this House."
"I really am very, very grateful."
"Thank you: your great achievement does credit to this House!"
"I came to this Parliament as a German, have worked very hard as a German MEP for five years, but it is as a Turk that I leave it."
"Many of you have made me into a Turk, for I am ashamed of the speeches that really can only be described as hypocritical, of these speeches that really have nothing honest about them."
"Others may take pride in bravely defending the Christian EU against the Turks, and may perhaps find some voters to support them, but I am ashamed; such is not my European Union."
"Madam President, both the Commission's latest interim report and the opinions of the different committees of this Parliament demonstrate that Turkey has made important steps in the direction of the Copenhagen criteria."
"That country has made enormous progress over the past years."
"By way of example, I would mention the abolition of the death penalty and the change in attitude towards the Kurdish minority."
"This is all happening under a Turkish Government of which it was feared at the time that it would turn Turkey into an Islamic state."
"Fortunately, reality is different."
"Without hesitation, the Turkish Government calls for good governance, more transparency and equality between men and women."
"The experiment which the AKP Party is conducting is unique and of worldwide significance."
"As the European Union should not leave these signals without a response, it should offer a concrete prospect of joining as soon as possible; otherwise, we would soon run the risk of having to face the threat of an Islamic-fundamentalist state, no longer open to dialogue, by the back door."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what I want to say about Turkey is that I regard the Copenhagen criteria as a fundamental precondition, and believe that they are indeed, as regards the protection of human and minority rights, not being fulfilled in any sense in which we understand them or should understand them, as a community of values."
"I am thinking here of the Kurds, but also of the religious minorities."
"To Mr Ceyhun, who spoke earlier, I would say that there was much in his speech that I did not understand."
"I am sure that he was not merely tolerated; we enjoyed very good neighbourly relations, being immediate neighbours here in Strasbourg."
"Such neighbourliness can be built on, and I believe that a privileged partnership constitutes a third way between members and non-members of the European Union and those who have a privileged relationship with the European Union and must also have a space for the future."
"We have different conceptions of the future of the European Union; ours is that this Europe, this European Union of ours, must have borders, and that is why we conclude special agreements with our immediate neighbours."
"With this in mind, I believe that Turkey, be it for reasons of history, geography or culture, would not fit in as a direct member of the European Union, and I hope that we will go on along this third way with the courage it deserves."
"Here too, the Commission and the Council should exercise greater imagination, rather than simply pointing out that the way is, in any case, already mapped out."
"Madam President, what have we been able to observe since 1963?"
"Progress, of course, but at the present time it is easier to list the points of divergence than the advances that have been made."
"The constitution, adopted under a military regime, is not a basis on which the rule of law and fundamental rights and freedoms can be guaranteed."
"Another matter that needs to be raised is the recognition of the genocide perpetrated against the Armenian population."
"Let us not forget that the European Parliament affirmed this in a resolution adopted on 18 June 1987 and has subsequently repeated it on several occasions."
"Turkey continues to deny the atrocities committed by the authorities of that time, and the European Parliament has already voiced its concern about the circulars from the Turkish Ministry of National Education enjoining primary and secondary schools to take part in a revisionist campaign to deny the oppression of minorities in the course of Turkish history, especially with regard to the Armenian community."
"It is hard to see how a country that will not face up to its history and its errors can join the European Union."
"We therefore expect Turkey to exercise its memory, and we shall reiterate this at every opportunity."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, over and again, particular concerns are brought to me in my capacity as chairwoman of the European Parliament’s delegation to the countries of the Southern Caucasus, among which Armenia is included."
"First, let me thank Mr Oostlander for his report, which was a very fair one, and also for the way in which he handles Turkey’s problems with its neighbours, particularly with Armenia."
"There are two pre-eminent problems, and the first of them is Turkey’s economic boycott of Armenia."
"The closure of the Turkish-Armenian border has meant that the transport of goods to Armenia is more expensive, and this frustrates the European Union’s economic aid to that country."
"This also constitutes a grave breach of the Balladur Principles, which apply to all present and future candidates for accession, and according to which EU Member States must not be engaged in border disputes with neighbouring states, but must, on the contrary, maintain good relations with them."
"The second problem is that what has historically transpired between Turkey and Armenia has still not been worked through, and this hampers mutual understanding and prevents the development of mutual trust."
"Most recently, and unfortunately, Turkey has ensured that Armenia has had no part in the negotiations on energy transport and on the construction of pipelines from the region around the Caspian Sea, which is rich in natural gas and oil, and that these will not go through Armenia."
"All these things are justified causes for complaint by the Armenian people."
"It has not, so far, been possible to resolve these conflicts, which are obstacles not only to Turkey’s goal of joining the European Union, but also to that of the European Union itself, of stabilising the South Caucasus region."
"Madam President, Turkey is taking great pains over meeting the political criteria and has already taken various reform measures."
"Mr Erdogan’s government is doing its utmost."
"That is positive, but a great deal has yet to be done before the negotiations can be opened after December."
"Torture and the curbing of various civil freedoms remain a problem and the gap between theory and practice remains too wide."
"It is not only we, in the ivory towers of Brussels and Strasbourg, who are concerned about this problem; the ordinary citizens in Europe are too, and we must therefore be absolutely certain that we will be taking the right decision when the time comes."
"I am therefore rather surprised at Mr Lagendijk's comment that he thinks that Turkey should negotiate with one arm tied behind its back if it does not need to meet the political criteria first, and that this can be done parallel to the negotiations about the ."
"That puts everything back to front, and seems to suggest that we are doing something unsavoury when we ask an accession country to meet our fundamental values first."
"In that respect too, we should adhere to what has been agreed."
"Turkey will soon need to be judged fairly on the basis of the political Copenhagen criteria."
"I have heard Commissioner Verheugen use the term ‘zero tolerance’, and I find it an appealing one."
"The Turks deserve this, and so does the population in the European Union."
"In short, the setting of a date for negotiations in December is not yet a ."
"Madam President, I would like to draw attention to something which I believe to be extremely important."
"We are looking at the issue of Turkey from the point of view of fear, the extraordinary fear of a partner coming closer to us, one with a large population, which at the same time is rather different from us."
"Nevertheless, the reality is that, over the last two and a half years, nobody could have imagined the changes Turkey is implementing in order to come closer to Europe."
"Apart from the first revolution in the thirties, which changed the language and created a secular country – if only all the Arab countries had this view of a State in which civil power is separated from religious power – in the face of the increasingly powerful theocracies we have in the Islamic world, it seems incredible that we do not understand that this is a great experiment in democracy."
"Now, we are in the habit of looking at others arrogantly and we do not realise how small we are."
"And why are we small?"
"Because, if we look at the international context and what is going to happen in the future, the great China, the great India, the United States ... all of these will be great powers and Europe will have a very minor role to play; it will be one of the world's small provinces."
"I do not, therefore, see any problem with a country which has a structure of government, a degree of capacity building, which must be developed, but which is greater than other European countries, which has State structures and is therefore capable of doing its duties, as it is doing, progressing under a moderate government which is striving to establish democracy and implement political reforms, I do not see why we cannot give it the opportunity to be a partner which is close to us and which can set an example for the Arab countries."
"Let us look at demography."
"The demography of the Mediterranean, of Turkey, of Azerbaijan and of other countries, stands in contrast to our own."
"Let us think of the future and develop the approaches and analyses we need."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Mr President, I beg leave to speak under Rule 146 of our Rules of Procedure."
"The debate on Turkey has taken up the entire morning, which has meant that the scheduled debate on the European Capitals of Culture could not take place."
"We are not disputing the fact that Turkey is a matter of prime importance."
"Nevertheless, this is the fourth time since I became chairman of the Committee on Culture that the discussion of cultural matters has been postponed, either to the late evening or to a Thursday afternoon, despite the importance of the subject."
"The first consequence of this situation is that we cannot vote on this draft, even though it is on the agenda. The second consequence is that, since we are now preparing for the election campaign, everyone will have left by the time we come to deal with this afternoon’s business."
"I therefore ask that the debate be rescheduled for 20 April, the Tuesday of the next part-session in Strasbourg."
"This request has the approval of my own group – the PPE-DE – and the Verts/ALE Group."
"I apologise for not having had the time to consult the other groups, since we have only known about this for half an hour."
"I put to the vote the proposal to postpone the report on European Capitals of Culture until the April part-session."
"Mr President, last night the Working Group of Parliament set up by the Conference of Presidents voted very narrowly to send two contradictory reports to the Conference of Presidents on the issue of EU funding to the Palestinian Authority."
"Can I please ask the Conference of Presidents to act on these reports?"
"I would also demand a full debate in plenary before the Commission and Council to draw some conclusions from these reports."
"The Conference of Presidents met this morning."
"I do not know if the issue that you raised was discussed. I did, in any case, listen to your speech and your suggestion will be duly assessed."
"Mr President, I agree with Mr Tannock’s request to add to the agenda the debate on the report adopted in the Working Group yesterday on funding to the Palestinian Authority."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
". Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to express the Commission's appreciation and satisfaction with the very good reception given by the European Parliament to our new College member, Mr Dimas."
"The exchange of views that Mr Dimas had last Tuesday with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs took place in a very constructive and cooperative manner."
"The Commission acknowledges the political importance and significance of this exercise, to be placed, as you know, in a different and special context as compared with the interinstitutional procedure defined by the legal provision of Article 215 of the Treaty."
"(1)"
"Mr President, I would ask you to apply Rule 68(3) of the Rules of Procedure in this case, which lays down that, in the event of an initiative being rejected, it should be referred back to committee."
"I am making this request because yesterday in this House Commissioner Vitorino announced two substantial amendments to the initiative, which I believe should be subject to further analysis in committee and, furthermore, this is laid down as an ordinary procedure in the Rule I have mentioned."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am now somewhat surprised at the remarks by Mrs Terrón i Cusí, who yesterday evening said something else entirely."
"I am against a referral and I would like to ask you to allow the vote on the legislative proposal."
"The Council is not present and we cannot, therefore, hear its opinion."
"I put to the vote the rapporteur’s proposal, which consists of putting the proposal for a legislative resolution to the vote."
". Mr President, I would like to express the Commission's disappointment at the position proposed in Mr Lisi's report and voted."
"In fact our proposal implements the political guidelines in the Mediterranean action plan which was welcomed by Parliament and adopted by Council."
"Several of the critical comments made are simply not correct."
"I would like to make a few points here."
"Firstly, the Commission proposal give flexibility to Member State managers when deciding on different options to manage fish stocks in the Mediterranean, so we take into consideration the characteristics of Mediterranean fisheries."
"The proof is that national administrations can establish national management plans and these plans may allow derogations from certain common provisions precisely because of the different situations in different parts of the Mediterranean."
"Secondly, we are well aware that the fisheries sector is opposed to our proposal."
"We have received similar reactions to the recovery plan for cod in the northern waters of the Community."
"The difference here, however, was that both the sector and the European Parliament had been open to dialogue with the Commission and we adopted an acceptable plan in the end."
"And it is precisely this spirit we also need for the southern waters."
"Thirdly, the alleged poor consultation of the sector does not correspond to the truth."
"The sector has been consulted on several occasions before and after we presented our proposal."
"Fourthly, the Commission agrees with Parliament that we need to work with other Mediterranean countries, and that is why we took the initiative for the Venice Conference in November 2003 when the Mediterranean countries, ranging from Morocco to Lebanon and Slovenia, agreed with the European Union that we must agree on common measures in the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean to preserve our fish stocks."
"Finally, I would like to make one thing very clear."
"The disastrous social and economic costs Mr Lisi mentioned in his report will be the result if we do not take prompt and effective action as proposed by us, because the state of many Mediterranean fish stocks is already quite poor."
"We cannot, therefore, accept your request to withdraw our proposal, because there are neither scientific nor political justifications for Parliament's request."
"In short, the Commission upholds its proposal."
"Mr President, I listened carefully to the Commissioner."
"Our Committee feels that this was not a good proposal, we had repeated visits from and consultation with the sector, particularly from Italy and France, where leaders of the fisheries sector explained that the Commission proposal would have destroyed their jobs and would have done little to save fish stocks."
"I would appeal to the Commission in these circumstances to think again."
"We are going into the election period and the Commission would have an ideal opportunity to conduct further consultations with the sector throughout the Mediterranean basin, and come back in the new mandate with a reworked, revised proposal, which this House may then find acceptable."
"It should not endeavour to send the proposal back to our committee, because under the Rules of Procedure, we would then be required to deal with it within a period of two months."
"Clearly, it is impossible for us to comply with those rules, given that the mandate is coming to an end."
"Mr President, the chairman has already spoken about the adequacy of the responses given by the Commission."
"I will not give my opinion, I will just point out that it has confirmed its defensive position and unwillingness to enter into dialogue with the citizens, whom we merely represent. It does not, therefore, want to understand this message that we are continuing to send out: ‘Be reasonable and negotiate.’"
"I merely want to ask, in line with the Rules of Procedure, that is to say with Rule 68(3), that the proposal for a legislative resolution is not voted upon and that this text is referred back to committee."
"Then, in the time that this parliamentary term allows, we will tackle the issue as soon as possible."
"There is in fact no need for a vote because the Rules of Procedure provide for the report to be automatically referred back to committee if the Commission maintains its position."
". Mr President, I would simply like to point out that my report is the last report from the Committee on Fisheries to this House during the present mandate."
"Therefore it is appropriate that it is probably the most important report for fishermen in the last five years."
"Fishermen are finally recognised as valid partners who will in future be consulted on all fisheries matters that directly affect their livelihoods."
"There is no bureaucratic replacement for the knowledge and experience of fishermen."
"Therefore, for their sake, throughout the Community – not least in Ireland – I would invite you to vote massively in favour of the report."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me quickly clarify two points."
"Firstly, there has been no technical correction of recital I, which states that the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has approved the budgetisation of the EDF; this is not the case, because the ACP document is due to be transmitted to us very soon."
"I therefore ask for the deletion of the passage referring to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"Secondly, since the PPE-DE Group was not present at the debate yesterday evening, I should like to point out that I accept Amendment No 1 to paragraph 11, tabled by Mr Deva."
"On the other hand, I am opposed to Mr Deva’s Amendment No 2 to paragraph 39, because it would allow the backlog of eleven billion euros that we owe to the ACP countries from the last three EDFs to vanish without trace."
"This is their money, and the only reason for the accumulation of this residual amount is delay caused by the cumbersome administrative procedures of the European Union."
". Conservative MEPs opposed the confirmation of returning Commissioners from the former disgraced Commission in our election to the European Parliament in 1999."
"We do not doubt the ability of Stavros Dimas as Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs but cannot participate in confirming the appointment of the whole Commission as we are currently obliged to do and therefore we have abstained in the vote."
".– Given the existence of an internal market with free movement of goods and capital, closer cooperation between the Member States is needed to combat smuggling and tax fraud."
"This regulation is part of a package of regulations that aims at strengthening mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States, in this case in the field of excise duties, in which tobacco smuggling is particularly significant."
"The rapporteur regrets, however, that the time is not right to take Community legislation forwards with regard to the harmonisation of indirect taxation, and thus considers cooperation to be a temporary solution."
"I could not disagree more, because cooperation is an effective method of combating tax fraud and organised crime, not only in relation to excise duties but also to VAT and other indirect taxation."
"Above all, it is a method that preserves national sovereignty."
"Harmonisation would result in other economic and tax revenue problems in the Member States."
"The idea of decentralised cooperation is therefore a good solution."
".– The European Parliament’s position on the initiative regarding migratory fish stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean merits my full agreement."
"It gives the green light for the European Union to accede to the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean."
"This convention falls within the objectives of the policy on the conservation and sustainable management of resources, which the EU follows and promotes."
"The Central-Western Pacific area accounts for 60% of world tuna resources, which are of special interest to Community tuna vessels and longliners."
"To enhance the capacity of its fleet and the available resources, the Union has concluded several bilateral agreements with coastal states in the region, thus gaining access to new exclusive economic zones."
"By acceding to this convention, the European Union can play an active role in the regional fisheries organisations (RFOs), the most appropriate multilateral instrument for the effective conservation and management of fish stocks and for combating illicit fishing."
"I support Parliament in urging the European Union to become a member of all the existing RFOs in which the European industry has a legitimate interest, in order to promote responsible fishing and to protect the interests of the fishing industry."
".– The purpose of this proposal for a Council decision is to approve the accession of the European Community to the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean."
"By establishing a Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the convention aims at ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the highly migratory fish stocks in those areas."
"The importance of the zone of competence of the WCPFC to the Community fleet speaks for itself."
"The area covered by this regional fisheries organisation (RFO) accounts for 60% of world tuna resources and five large Community tuna seiners currently operate there, producing an average catch of around 15 000 tonnes per year."
"Moreover, the growing importance of RFOs has often been acknowledged by Parliament, ‘as multilateral fisheries management bodies and ideal forums for settling disputes between parties and ensuring responsible management while combating illicit fishing’."
"Indeed, I agree with the rapporteur that it is in the interests of the Member States for the European Union also to become a full member of this RFO in order to protect the interests of the Community fishing industry in these areas."
".– The Community programme on the conservation of genetic diversity in agriculture expired at the end of 1999."
"The Commission is now putting forward a proposal to set up a new Community programme on the conservation, characterisation, collection and utilisation of genetic resources in agriculture."
"In 2001, Parliament and the Council rejected the previous proposal, which sought the financing of national measures in this area, which was unacceptable and removed the strategic importance of ensuring the maintenance of biodiversity, particularly in view of the Community’s commitments under the various relevant international United Nations conventions."
"This is even more difficult to understand in view of the threat to biodiversity posed by a possible raising of the moratorium on genetically modified organisms."
"The genetic diversity and variety of food crops in Europe have to be preserved, taking account of local and regional differences."
"To this end, local measures are needed to support farmers in preserving their traditional varieties and breeds and bringing products derived from them to local and regional markets."
"I regret that the financial framework proposed for this programme is too limited, in view of the needs already highlighted by the Member States and Parliament itself."
".– I am aware of the political and economic situation in Guinea-Bissau and therefore understand the urgency in approving this amended protocol as a signal in support of the efforts being made by the Guinea-Bissau authorities to stabilise the country."
"I also understand the state of the fish stocks off the Guinea-Bissau coast, due to overfishing and the lack of control measures and resources."
"I thus believe that the objectives of the amendments agreed in May 2003 to the Protocol currently in force, concerning a reduction in fishing effort and support measures for sustainable fishing, are acceptable."
"Without wishing to jeopardise approval for the proposal before us, however, I have strong reservations regarding the fairness of the proposal across our fleets. The fishing opportunities allocated to the Portuguese fleet have been reduced, with its shrimp trawler GRT cut by 65%, well above the overall average cut in GRT."
"In addition, one surface longliner permit has been lost, as only four longliners are covered by the agreement."
"I therefore cannot see what socio-economic impact assessment the Commission carried out for this proposal and what compensation measures it intends to adopt."
"This is something I shall insist on."
". Normally the Verts/ALE Group would vote against an EC Fisheries Agreement for reasons laid out in the past."
"However, we have voted for this agreement for the reasons set out below."
"My report calls for improvements in the fight against illegal fishing in several ways."
"If EU Member States fishing in Guinea do not provide reliable and detailed data on what they catch, Parliament wants the Commission to begin legal proceedings against them and even to revoke their right to fish under the agreement."
"Fishing rights for EU vessels must be re-evaluated according to the most recent scientific analyses conducted by the regional fisheries organisation of west Africa."
"The increase in fishing foreseen in the agreement must also be dependent upon unequivocal and independent scientific justification, which must be made available to the Parliament."
".– I want to express my total support for the European Parliament report on the amendments to the fisheries agreement with Guinea-Bissau."
"The waters of Guinea-Bissau, which used to be abundant in fish and crustaceans, have suffered from overexploitation of their resources."
"Furthermore, the country’s political instability has allowed corruption and a lack of control measures to affect fishermen’s livelihoods."
"In addition to extending the current agreement until 2006, the amendments especially involve reducing the fishing effort of essentially non-Community fleets, making better use of Community funding, and strengthening control measures."
"With these changes, the Guinea-Bissau authorities will finally be able to modernise the fishing industry so as to improve the surveillance and patrolling of the sea and thus put an end to overfishing."
"I join the rapporteur in calling for more information for Parliament on how this bilateral agreement is to be managed, so that a general evaluation can be carried out."
"Finally, I hope this fisheries agreement will be a modest contribution to improving the economic and political situation in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau."
"The European Parliament is thus sending out a positive signal in support of the Guinea-Bissau authorities’ efforts to stabilise the country."
".– I have been following social and political developments in Guinea-Bissau with great concern."
"I recognise that the acting political authorities have tried to adopt measures to improve governance of the country, in contrast to the obvious breakdown that occurred during the presidency of Kumba Yala."
"In this context, and in view of the fact that this is a country with few resources and many needs, the income from fishing is of particular importance and therefore deserves special protection."
"Aid to Guinea-Bissau is essential so that it can modernise the industry to improve the surveillance and patrolling of the sea and put an end to overfishing."
"I share the rapporteur’s understanding of the need for the European Parliament to give out a positive signal in support of the Guinea-Bissau authorities’ efforts to stabilise the situation in the country."
"Despite recent reports of unrest and disturbances because of the current electoral process, I believe that this African nation will be able to recover its stability with European Union support."
"This is my sincere hope."
"I voted in favour of the report, of course."
".– In the wake of the strategy for the sustainable development of European aquaculture presented in September 2002 as part of the reform of the common fisheries policy, the Commission has considered it necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 on the FIFG, which contains specific provisions supporting development of the Community aquaculture sector, in order to clarify the definition of aquaculture, increase Community aid to extensive fish farming, promote techniques reducing environmental impact, fund applied research, and guarantee financial aid for shellfish farmers where harvesting is suspended."
"Although at first sight the proposals seem positive, especially with the improvements introduced by the rapporteur’s amendments, I have serious reservations regarding two issues."
"First, the boost given to the development of aquaculture not as an activity complementary to the fisheries sector but in place of extractive fishing merits serious reservations."
"We should not encourage the erosion and cessation of an activity as a matter of course, for the sake of gradually moving from catching fish to fish production, which creates other problems for the environment, food safety and coastal management."
"Hence the need to invest in research as well."
"Secondly, the Commission could have taken the opportunity to carry out a general review of the regulation and increased the maximum amounts of individual aid payments; this is something that Parliament’s amendments attempt to address, even though they do not go far enough."
"The injustices committed against our fishermen are compounded by the injustice done to our oyster farmers and shellfish breeders in the Thau Basin and Bacarès Pond in the Aude ."
"They are effectively footing the bill for the massive pollution caused during the summer by the thousands upon thousands of camper vans parked there by tourists from Northern Europe, who daily empty their waste water, infested with phosphates and even pathogenic bacteria, into the ponds of the Languedoc and Catalan regions."
"For the Mediterranean and for our fishermen, oyster farmers and shellfish breeders, Europe means restriction and pollution without compensation."
".– Parliament has once again been called upon for its opinion on a strategy for the sustainable development of European aquaculture, as part of the ongoing reform of the common fisheries policy."
"In theory, the objectives sought by the Commission are commendable: protecting the environment, creating long-term employment (in regions dependent on fishing where there is no alternative), giving consumers an assurance that the products are safe, and promoting research."
"In practice, however, this subject is of the utmost importance, since it deals with the procedures and conditions for Community aid to the aquaculture sector."
"Granting aid to shellfish farmers where harvesting is suspended because of toxic algae enjoys my support."
"The Commission denies this aid, however, in cases of recurrent contamination, and thus creates unjustifiable discrimination among producers."
"I also reject the proposal that the minimum length of time for harvesting to be suspended in order to qualify for aid should be six months, even at times when selling is intensive."
"This seems too long to me."
"Finally, I once again regret the fact that representative professional organisations are excluded from work involved in applied research into the industry."
".– In 2003, the Council approved conclusions on a strategy for the sustainable development of European aquaculture, the main objectives of which are to create employment and to make quality products available within the context of environmentally balanced production, particularly through the redirection of FIFG public aid towards measures in the fields of training, monitoring, research into new species and the promotion of clean aquaculture techniques."
"While in general I support the proposal that the Commission has now submitted to Parliament, there are, however, two important proposals that the rapporteur succeeded in including in the report and which helped to confirm the way I would vote."
"One relates to the reduction of the six-month period (proposed by the Commission) for harvesting to be suspended because of toxic algal contamination before shellfish farmers are awarded compensation."
"The second is the fact that this review of the regulation has been used to include an amendment, unrelated to aquaculture, for a 20% increase in the maximum amounts of individual aid payments to fishermen, and removal of the requirement for them to have permanently ceased their activity when recovery plans or emergency measures are adopted."
"Since both were approved, I voted for this report."
".– The strategy for the sustainable development of aquaculture centres on aspects such as protecting the environment; creating long-term employment, particularly in regions dependent on fishing where there is no alternative; giving consumers an assurance that aquaculture products are safe and available while ensuring high animal health and welfare standards; promoting research, in particular by providing for appropriate funding in connection with how aquaculture interacts with the environment and, for instance, with master cultures."
"To take account of, and implement, the recommendations under the strategy, the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) – that is, Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 – has had to be amended."
"Positive aspects include: the clarification of certain definitions; the proposed increase in Community aid for extensive fish farming compared with a reduction in Community aid for intensive fish farming; the funding of applied research; the promotion of techniques reducing environmental impact; and support for traditional aquaculture activities (such as mollusc farming) in order to maintain the social fabric in regions where there are no other alternatives."
"Like the rapporteur, I think the Commission proposals are moving in the direction of more research and technological development and greater respect for the environment, within a framework of sustainability."
"I therefore voted in favour."
".– I agree with the rapporteur when she states that, although allocating money towards improved control is an essential part of the common fisheries policy, it is but one side of the coin, the other being the active involvement of fishermen in the management of fisheries. Without the support of fishermen, huge allocations of money towards improved monitoring will not put an end to serious infringements of the CFP."
"This Commission proposal aims at extending (by two years) and amending the system of Community financial support for establishing control structures (which expired in 2003), until a decision is made on the joint inspection structure, which the Commission expects to be operational in 2006."
"This proposal, however, intends to restrict access to funding just to the new Member States and, even then, with a contribution rate of only 35%."
"Since an increase in the Community contribution for fisheries control heavy equipment is one way to help to strengthen control capacity at sea, we agree with the rapporteur’s Amendments Nos 8 and 12, which aim at extending the measure to all Member States and increasing the contribution rate to 50%."
"It should not be forgotten that Portugal has the most extensive EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone) of all European Union countries and has a large number of vessels to monitor."
".– I have already had occasion to express my concerns to this House regarding the ineffectiveness of fisheries controls."
"Illegal, illicit and undeclared fishing is a daily reality in Portugal."
"This initiative allows Member States to request a Community contribution to the financing of certain projects that aim at improving fishing controls."
"It is just one more brick for constructing a sustainable fisheries policy."
"In this context, I support the establishment of cross-border exchange of information, as this is a simple, useful way of imposing sanctions across the EU that are effective, proportionate and, most of all, dissuasive."
"Moreover, the varying levels of sanctions imposed across the EU for the same infringements are also of great concern."
"The problem is even more serious because there are no indicators for assessing the controls that have been carried out."
"The EU has, in fact, no information on numbers of inspections, infringements detected, infringement procedures opened, etc. I also agree with the rapporteur that monitoring should be performed not only on board vessels but also on land."
"Lastly, Community incentives for Member States to acquire fisheries control heavy equipment should be strengthened."
"At the same time, the initiative to simplify and tighten up the allocation of funding is commendable."
".– The adoption of the regulation on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources broadened the objectives set out in the common fisheries policy and necessarily created new rules for enforcement. These include not only the development and implementation of effective fishing control measures but also occupational training and technical and administrative cooperation among all the sectors and institutions involved."
"The Commission now intends to extend and amend the existing system for two years, so as to strengthen and standardise monitoring and control resources and methods across the enlarged Union and to prepare for the new Community inspection body to start work."
"The problem lies in access to Community funding for control activities requiring the acquisition of ‘heavy equipment’, which the Commission did not wish to consider in its proposal, intending instead to restrict access to the available funds just to the new Member States."
"This is a particularly sensitive matter for Portugal, since it has the most extensive EEZ in the Union and a large number of vessels to monitor. There has to be a chance, therefore, for Portugal not to be excluded from access to this funding, or at least part of this funding."
"As the report addresses this main requirement, I voted for it."
".– Regulation (EC) No 3069/95 establishes that observers should be placed on board all vessels operating in the Northwest Atlantic, regulated by the regional organisation NAFO."
"To date, the Commission has been responsible for implementing this regulation on Community fishing vessels operating in these waters and has, quite rightly, borne all the costs involved with the observers."
"The aim of this proposal, however, is that, as from 1 January 2004, the Member States should themselves be responsible for the observers and bear all the associated costs, which does not strike us as acceptable in any way."
"Although the latest revision of the common fisheries policy establishes that inspection is the responsibility of the Member States, we are talking about inspection within their EEZs, which does not invalidate Community financing of inspection measures."
"I therefore voted against the report."
".– The fact that I voted to approve these regulations must not be confused with the opinions expressed by the rapporteur."
"With regard to the circulation of euro coins, it is essential that the public should be protected against any kind of fraud, in this particular case that arising from confusion with similar medals or tokens."
"Since the euro changeover, there has been a growing number of cases of fraudulent use of fake euro coins in coin-operated machines."
"These regulations define the level of similarity to euro coins that should be banned for medals and tokens."
"This is one more way to combat the counterfeiting of euro coins and notes."
"Although we are all in agreement so far, I utterly reject the rapporteur’s subjective opinions on the success of the single currency or Parliament’s ‘full-hearted’ support for the ‘historic project of Economic and Monetary Union and its single currency’."
"This is not just because practical problems with the introduction of the single currency are beginning to surface as time goes on, such as its inflationary effects and the increase in bank charges and commission. I also reject it because, at the level of economic and monetary policy, a serious assessment is needed of the effects of the euro on economic growth and employment, particularly in the less developed Member States such as Portugal."
".– Two years on from the introduction of the single currency, it is time to assess the state of the euro and to provide solutions to certain problems that have been diagnosed."
"The aim is, above all, to protect the public from any kind of fraud and to safeguard the currency."
"The fact is that there has been a growing number of cases of fraudulent use of fake euro coins in coin-operated machines, and current national and Community law has not proved effective enough to address the problem."
"As the number of Member States in which the euro circulates is set to increase, it is becoming more urgent and necessary to adopt measures in this respect."
"The proposal bans certain levels of similarity in medals and tokens similar to euro coins, and also sets out guidelines for those companies producing such medals or tokens."
"Industry representatives have been widely consulted and are in favour of the proposed regulatory framework."
"At the same time, the scope of the regulation is to be extended to those countries which have concluded agreements with the EU on the use of the euro, such as Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City."
"I voted in favour."
"I concluded my speech on the Marinho report yesterday evening by observing that the draft resolution, like many before it, seems to ignore the acute problems facing our societies because of abuses of the right to asylum and confines itself to proposals for minor adjustments, accompanying them with almost mantra-like repetition of the need for ‘full, comprehensive application of the 1951 Geneva Convention’ (relating to the status of refugees)."
"The fact is that this Convention, drafted in the wake of the Second World War in order to deal with cases of political persecution, is no longer a suitable instrument to deal with today’s refugee problems, caused by the mass migration of populations driven by famine, poverty, disease, chronic insecurity and the absence, in their native countries, of governments worthy of the name."
"What is therefore needed is a radical reassessment of our legal instruments."
"This is at odds, however, with what the European Union seeks to achieve by rendering the provisions of the Geneva Convention sacrosanct by virtue of the reference to the Convention in Article 18 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which it intends to incorporate into the draft European Constitution."
"In my view, this was one more reason to reject the Marinho report, which advocates the constitutional approach."
"On the pretext of trying to simplify asylum rules and procedures, Brussels is in the process of creating a whole legal arsenal designed to overwhelm Europe."
"This draft contains a whole litany of proposals, each more pro-immigration and subversive than the one before."
"They want to make it easier to gain legal access to European Union territory for nationals of non-EU countries for the purposes of employment and family reunification, to make it impossible to authorise collective expulsions, to provide for joint management of migratory flows and for distribution of the (immigration) burden within the European Union, and so on. In other words, we are being asked to allow the Commission to impose immigration quotas on each Member State!"
"We are surely in agreement on one point, namely the need to reform our asylum laws."
"Throughout Europe, the present asylum system is in the throes of a crisis."
"France, Britain, Italy and Germany have been inundated by the mass influx of asylum-seekers fleeing their countries of origin for economic reasons and not because of political persecution, as provided for in the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees."
"The solution does not lie in a broader and more permissive redefinition of the right of asylum; quite the contrary."
"Let us not offer impossible and dangerous dreams to all these unfortunate people who seek a hypothetical El Dorado."
"I wish to clarify a point concerning my support for Mr Marinho’s report regarding more accessible, equitable and managed asylum systems."
"I voted in favour of the report, which contains many good points about the Union’s future asylum policy."
"I am, however, concerned about one item in the report and would gladly have voted against that particular item."
"Item 8 of the report means that Parliament now goes in for an exclusive system, which could, in the worst case, lead to great variations in immigration policy, according to the current labour market situation in the various Member States."
"Although current legal immigration policy is inadequate in the Member States, Parliament shows a lack of consideration in drawing up, as a solution, a tighter and more exclusive policy, the basis of which is not humanitarianism and human rights, but the needs – defined by whom, may I ask? – of each Member State in terms of its labour market policy."
"I also wish to express my hope that the interpretation of Item 9 of the same report will be that abuse within the family should also be included as grounds for seeking asylum."
"Just like the grounds at present specifically mentioned in Item 9, abuse within the family also constitutes grounds for seeking asylum, and these must be fully recognised."
".– I congratulate Mrs Maes on the report she has drawn up, to which I give my support."
"Her work deals with a subject of vital importance: enhancing the safety of third countries’ aircraft using Community airports."
"I therefore welcome the joint text at third reading, which contains three items that I consider essential, namely:"
"- the need for inspection procedures to be implemented uniformly across the EU, thus preventing third-country aircraft from being diverted to Community airports with less rigorous controls;"
"- the importance of public access to information on airlines’ compliance with safety standards;"
"- European authorities must be able to inspect an aircraft and ground it whenever there is reason to suspect that it does not comply with safety rules."
". In its communication on air safety, published last year, the Commission expressed concern at the link between the number of air accidents and the increase in air traffic."
"The Council had already attempted to draw up a directive in this area, but the longstanding conflict over Gibraltar proved to be an obstacle to achieving the desired result."
"Solving this problem allowed substantial progress to be made in this field."
"Whilst fully complying with the SAFA (Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft) procedure, which involves the systematic monitoring of aircraft likely to present risks in terms of air safety, the Commission consequently adopted an initiative in the field of air safety in an attempt to ensure three fundamental aspects: gathering and disseminating more accurate information in the field; on-site inspections of aircrew and aircraft from third countries in Community airports and adopting appropriate measures to remedy any shortcomings found, which could even result in the aircraft being grounded."
"Bearing in mind the tragic events that have occurred in recent years, I believe it is crucial to increase air safety, by means of closer and more effective monitoring of third-country aircraft and so I voted in favour."
". We voted against this report on the funding of the new Regulations for Parliament staff, given that the funding set aside falls in line with the Kinnock reform, which undermines the status of Parliament’s employees."
"There is to be an overall reduction in the number of employees with the status of officials and an increase on fixed-term contracts, not to mention the hundreds of workers already in precarious working conditions, such as sub-contractors and workers forced to work part time."
"New recruits will be on lower salaries and will have a lower status than has until now been the case."
"Pensions will undergo similar cuts – Parliament staff will retire later and receive a lower pension."
"In this respect, Parliament is falling into line with the decrease in levels of social protection in the workplace throughout Europe."
"This is ample evidence of the value of the EU’s declarations of intent on jobs and working conditions."
". This report forms part of the process of adapting the workings of the EP to the increase in the number of official languages, as of 1 May, with the entry of ten countries from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean."
"Whilst stating that the issue is to provide service of equivalent quality to all its Members by using its existing human and budgetary resources to the best advantage, it actually reduces current rights, even though the rapporteur tries to compensate for this to some extent."
"As we have already pointed out, confirming and effectively implementing the principle of establishing all the languages of the EU countries as official and working languages is all the more important because we are now seeing a trend in which some languages – those of the most populous countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Italy – demonstrate a real and ever-growing preponderance, to the detriment of the languages of the other countries that make up the European Union."
"This situation must be countered, by means of ongoing action."
". This report proposes that the EP’s Rules of Procedure should be amended to take account of the arrangements for multilingualism currently in force in order to address the difficulties that are expected to arise as a consequence of enlargement, in terms of recruiting a sufficient number of interpreters for certain languages."
"The solutions proposed are to be welcomed and confirm the obligation for multilingualism established by the Treaties, although it is stipulated that this obligation can only be ‘relaxed’ with the explicit or implicit support of the Members concerned (with regard to some committee or delegation meetings): Article 117(3)(a): ‘At committee and delegation meetings away from the usual places of work interpretation shall be provided from and into the languages of those members who have confirmed that they will attend the meeting."
"By way of exception, these arrangements may be made more flexible by agreement with the members of the committee or delegation’."
"It is only because of its provisional nature – it will expire in December 2006 – that we can accept the insertion of a provision setting out that: ‘Exceptionally, in applying Rule 117, account shall be taken, with regard to the official languages of the countries which will accede to the European Union on 1 May 2004, as of that date and until 31 December 2006, of the availability in real terms and sufficient numbers of the requisite interpreters and translators’."
"For these reasons, I have voted in favour."
". In order to be able to address the difficulties that are expected to arise as a consequence of enlargement, in the field of recruiting a sufficient number of interpreters for certain languages, this report proposes a transitional amendment of the Rules of Procedure as regards the multilingual arrangements in force in the European Parliament."
"The obligation for multilingualism established by the Treaties is confirmed and it is recommended that this obligation could be ‘relaxed’; with the explicit support of the Members concerned and with transitional arrangements for the new Member States while there is a shortage of interpreters."
"This is an extremely delicate matter and no transitional law is really required – a different interpretation would suffice."
"Any derogation to the multilingual approach, even if transitional, represents a risk for the future."
"I voted in favour of the amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which definitively limits the transitional nature of the arrangements and I voted against the report in the final overall vote."
"Despite promising attempts, current fisheries policy still involves the EU buying the right to abuse the natural resources of the poor."
"It is a modern form of colonialism."
"A real reform of fisheries policy and a complete change in view of our relationship with poor countries are necessary."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against the above report."
"I share the criticism made repeatedly by the Portuguese Government on the unevenness and inequality created by this fisheries agreement on the agreements concluded with the ‘countries of the South’. The criticism centres, more specifically, on the disparity between the real fishing opportunities and the level of financial compensation, on the fact that fitting out a vessel is not included in the costs inherent in the workings of the agreement and on the fact that unused quotas cannot be transferred between Member States."
"I therefore welcome the results that have been achieved and the commitment given by the Council to ensure that the relationship between the EU and Greenland, after 2006, based on a broader partnership for sustainable development, includes a specific fisheries agreement, negotiated in accordance with the general rules and the principles that underpin these agreements."
"I voted in favour of the report, since the fundamental political issue concerns the transfer of unused fishing opportunities between Member States, in order to streamline their use and since the report proposes that the Commission can do this by adopting the necessary measures to ensure that the Community fleet makes the planned catches without jeopardising the principle of relative stability between Member States."
". Now that analytical data has been compiled on the fisheries agreements between the European Community and Greenland, it is proposed to amend the Protocol on the fishing conditions that have been provided for."
"An amendment of this nature is fully justified by the poor take-up of the fishing opportunities allocated to the Union, and this holds all the more true because the financial compensation that is paid does not vary according to the take-up rate."
"To this end, it is proposed, specifically, that the following measures, with which I agree, should be adopted: setting fishing quotas in line with the real situation, including new species likely to be caught, stepping up research in the field of fisheries and the possibility of increasing Community fleet fishing opportunities to 50% for new species, if fisheries resources allow."
"I welcome in particular the rapporteur’s suggestion that a solution must be found to the problem of transferring unused quotas between Member States, which would compensate Portugal in particular."
"I voted in favour."
". Τhe horrifying events in Madrid gave the European Council an excuse to speed up the application of anti-democratic measures already legislated and to move even closer to the USA and ΝΑΤΟ."
"Apart from strengthening mechanisms for prosecuting, putting on electronic file and controlling (in other words, hunting) the persecuted seeking refuge on our continent, controls will be carried out on charities, to make sure they are not financing terrorists and, of course, on extreme religious and political persuasions."
"The real causes of terrorism remained outside the interests of the Council, for obvious reasons."
"In the economic sector, having confirmed that capitalist restructuring is not going all that well, they again call on the workers to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the profits of the monopolies."
"The systems of social protection will have to be ‘modernised’, the elderly will have to work, everyone will have to be at the mercy of employers on minimum terms, in insecure, part-time jobs."
"Every country will be controlled and recommendations will be made to any which do not comply."
"Thus we shall acquire ‘more and better jobs’!"
"Knowing that their conclusions will cause a new wave of grass-roots fights, they call on the Member States to ‘build Reform Partnerships involving the social partners’."
"Even if a few bought-out leaders assist, we are certain that grass-roots resistance will strengthen."
"The peoples have the power to ruin their plans."
". Parliament has just welcomed the last European Council’s commitment to reaching an agreement by 17 June on the draft European constitution, giving ‘practical expression to what is a fresh start for our continent’."
"It would indeed be a fresh start, as it would represent a decisive leap towards a super-state, and a move further away from the plurality of sovereign states that has always characterised Europe."
"More precisely, the compromise plans that are circulating at the moment, aimed at reaching a final agreement, suggest that the principle of ‘double majority’ in decision-making at the Council will probably be accepted, which means that a criterion will be introduced that weights the votes of each country according to the size of its population."
"We would thus be moving towards calculating an overall majority without taking account of national borders, as though there were one single unified people in the EU."
"Such a step, which is already to be found in the Thucydides quotation at the top of the draft constitution, negates the pluralism of Europe’s nations."
"It is at the root of people’s feelings of alienation; people do not feel part of the current institutions."
"It is essentially for this reason that I am opposed to the draft Constitution."
". I voted in favour of the motion for a Joint Resolution on the outcome of the European Council of 25-26 March 2004, despite having many doubts as regards the recommendations on the Middle East."
"I did not, therefore, support the general opinion of my group, in particular on items 41 and 43 of the motion."
"In the separate vote, I expressed my disagreement on these points when I had the opportunity to do so."
". Two months away from the elections to the European Parliament, there is perhaps no better proof of the collusion between the Portuguese right wing (in the form of the Social Democratic Party) and social democracy, (in the form of the Socialist Party), than this litany of agreements:"
"- from the blessing given to the so-called ‘European constitution’ which would further subvert Portugal’s sovereignty and independence,"
"- to what is termed the ‘fight against terrorism’ – which involves stepping up security measures and their use to remove powers from States or to militarise international relations;"
"- from the ‘Lisbon Strategy’ – with its umpteenth reaffirmation of the Stability Pact, and of liberalisation (labour, health, pensions), now with the added ‘novelty’ of mechanisms that are binding on States,"
"- to the Middle East – accepting the ‘status quo’ in Iraq and giving it legitimacy through the role of the UN or unjustly holding the Palestinians jointly responsible for the situation in Palestine."
"As to the Intergovernmental Conference, it appears that, in this framework, Spain and Poland will (re)join the group of those ‘in charge’."
"In practice, the major powers are gradually imposing their control, with the other governments playing a subservient role."
"Examples of this are the recent replacement of one Spaniard by another on the Executive Committee of the ECB or the imposition of a Frenchman as the ‘European’ candidate for the presidency of the IMF."
". At the Brussels European Council of 25 and 26 March, in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Madrid, we might have expected fresh democratic and social impetus on the part of the Heads of State or Government, but no such thing was forthcoming."
"Much to the contrary, the Fifteen put the neo-liberal and militaristic draft European Constitution back on the agenda."
"They opted to pursue the Lisbon Strategy, a veritable war machine that makes jobs less secure and privatises public services."
"Finally, in a touching show of unity, the Fifteen re-launched the war on terror and undermined our civil liberties by calling our bluff with the State lies told by Bush, Blair and Aznar."
"At the European Council, we might have expected to hear the whole truth about the illegal and illegitimate war in Iraq."
"The European Union could have demanded the withdrawal of all occupying forces and the transfer of sovereignty back to the Iraqi people. It could, similarly, have called for the construction of the wall between Israel and Palestine to be halted and for the settlements to be dismantled."
"We might have also expected a new social and democratic Europe to be put in place, as a challenge to the hegemony of the markets and of eurocracy."
"This new joint resolution, however, drawn up by the conservatives, the socialists and the liberals, concerning the outcomes of the European Council, serves only to back up the duplicity and hypocrisy of European integration."
"We voted against it."
". I wish first of all to offer my congratulations to the Irish Presidency on the way in which it has managed the issue of adopting the Convention’s Draft Constitution."
"As usually happens, it took the presidency of a small State to demonstrate the necessary intelligence and pro-European approach to attempt to solve such a significant problem."
"I say this despite the fact that, as a Member for a Stateless nation, Galicia, I must disagree with the constitutional text where this still fails to recognise Stateless nations, which are a fundamental part of Europe’s political, historical and cultural diversity."
"Having said this, I wish to focus on the section of the motion on the outcome of the Brussels European Council last week that deals with the terrorist attacks in Madrid."
"As I said in the amendment that I tabled through my group, I wish to express my admiration admiration I know we all share at the exemplary behaviour of the people of Madrid and of Spanish society as a whole following the terrorist attack that took place on 11 March."
"I must highlight the remarkable public-spirited and humanitarian way in which the citizens acted, the efficiency of the rescue services and the assistance given by all the institutions to the victims and their families and I would underline the fact that no xenophobic attitudes or attitudes rejecting any particular religion or country have been expressed."
"The Swedish Christian Democrats want a solution to be found for the planned European Constitution that takes account of the following considerations, among others:"
"1) that the EU not be given the right to tax our incomes and pensions;"
"2) that the rotating Presidency of the Council continue and that a newly established, centralised office such as that of EU President not be created;"
"3) that Europe’s biblical and Judaeo-Christian heritage be recognised in the Preamble as an historical fact concerning our spiritual heritage, in the same way as humanism is specified as the only named philosophical current;"
"4) that Article 51 remain, stating that the EU must conduct a regular dialogue with churches and other religious communities and associations;"
"5) that each Member State be entitled to a Commissioner with full voting rights;"
"6) that, in the future too, defence issues be dealt with on the basis of the principle of unanimity;"
"7) that the ambiguous clauses concerning the passerelle and transitional mechanisms be removed; these, it is proposed, should give Heads of State or Government in the Council the right unanimously to extend the EU’s legislative powers at the national parliaments’ expense and to abandon the right of veto/principle of unanimity in favour of majority decision-making – and this without each country’s parliament being required to give its approval."
". Mr van den Bos (ELDR, D'66) has declared that he has voted against joint resolution Nos B5-0165/2004 B5-0182/2004 B5-0183/2004, in which the Council is once again urged to reconsider the association agreement with Israel."
"Now that Prime Minister Sharon himself calls for withdrawal from the occupied territories and dismantling of settlements, the EU must support fresh policy in this direction."
"A boycott of Israel would further restrict the already minor impact of Europe on that country and seriously hamper communication."
"Additionally, Mr Van den Bos considers the text under No 40 unbalanced, because it does not condemn the terrorist attack on Ashdod, while the assassination of the Hamas leader been condemned."
"The arguments underpinning the proposal to reject this regulation, as expressed in the report, are extremely important, because they could apply in other cases, such as Portugal, which has the largest EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone) of any country in the Community."
"The first argument concerns respect for the specific characteristics of the Mediterranean in all its aspects: the characteristics of its fleet, of its socio-economic fabric and of the types of fishing."
"The second argument hinges on the need to involve fishermen in the decision-making process, making use of their experience and heeding their concerns."
"Lastly, dialogue and cooperation must be enhanced with neighbouring third countries in order to involve them in the commitment to ensure sustainable fishing."
"The proposal for a regulation does not guarantee these conditions which, bearing in mind the international dimension of the Mediterranean, are sound guiding principles for the common fisheries policy."
"Lastly, there is the link between these conditions and the need for a serious evaluation of the current state of fisheries resources and of the appropriate measures to ensure the conservation of these resources, an area in which issues of liberalising access and the underlying contradictions are to a large extent echoed in the situation in Portugal."
". For 20 years now the Commission’s political strategy in the area of fisheries and with regard to our fishermen has been clear; place limits on our boats, on our nets and on our catch."
"The justification appears to make sense; fishery resources, such as cod, are dwindling, so in order for stocks to be saved and for a sustainable recovery to take place, our fishermen have to reduce their fishing effort immediately."
"This has given rise to the measures that we have seen, which place restrictions on net size, on driftnets, on boat power, on building new boats and on total allowable catches (TAC), all of which forms part of the Multi-Annual Guidance Programme (MAGP)."
"Unfortunately, while our fishermen are hamstrung and their vessels in a state of disrepair, factory ships from Japan, Russia and elsewhere are plundering the fishery resource in French waters."
"In the waters off Sète and the coast of Languedoc-Roussillon, vessels smaller than 12 metres have been refused permission to modernise, on the grounds that this would breach the kWh limit, thereby jeopardising their safety."
"Meanwhile, France is buying more than EUR 2 billion worth of fish and seafood that Brussels bans us from fishing."
". As happens with other common policies, in other areas, with other Member States of the European Union, with the common fisheries policy and, in the particular case of fishing in the Mediterranean, the European Commission continues to fail to pay due attention to the specific characteristics of individual cases."
"As regards the specific case of the Mediterranean, the major socio-economic role it plays in many areas and its strategic importance have not been enough, despite the strong calls made by the European Parliament, to ensure that its specific characteristics are respected and that there is an attempt to adopt flexible measures."
"The European Commission’s proposal for a regulation, which is examined in the report now before us, upholds a management approach that is totally at odds with the real situation in the Mediterranean and, furthermore, fails to include any flanking measures that would be capable of offsetting the disastrous socio-economic impact which it would have."
"The rapporteur, therefore, rightly proposes both rejecting the proposal for a regulation and asking the European Commission to submit at the earliest opportunity a new proposal that takes due account of all suggestions and proposals that may emerge from thorough and in-depth consultations with all interested parties."
"Because I fully agree with the rapporteur’s ideas, I voted in favour of the report."
". The rapporteur takes the view that, unlike what was set out in the Green Paper on Reform of the common fisheries policy, this proposal fails to give due consideration to the specific characteristics of the Mediterranean Sea."
"The proposal falls in line with an approach similar to that adopted in the measures that have been implemented to date; measures that have proven to be inadequate and which, given the failure of this management policy, have highlighted the need for a change of direction, as stated in the Green Paper on the CFP."
"Furthermore, and by way of a warning about the importance of involving fishermen to ensure that the rules are observed, the rapporteur suggests that their experience and the problems facing them have been ignored and that, in the type of legal framework that is proposed, this would push them to the outer fringes of the law."
"No attention is given to the countless examples of good practice in recent years, by both fishermen and shipowners which, given the lack of any meaningful contact between the interested parties, does nothing to augur the success of the management policy suggested by the Commission."
"I agree with the rapporteur and voted against the proposal for a regulation and supported referring the matter back to the Parliamentary committee."
"The report confirms a fundamental principle that we have always argued for – the good governance of the common fisheries policy - which ‘requires proper involvement of all the fishing industry’s professionals in the decision-making process for framing and managing the policy’. Furthermore, ‘that involvement should occur as near as possible to the start of the process’."
"We have, therefore, always argued for the need to decentralise the CFP."
"For this reason, the Commission proposal makes a significant contribution by proposing the creation of regional advisory councils."
"We broadly agree with this report, which improves on the Commission’s original proposal."
"It highlights the importance of involving all actors in the sector, particularly share fishermen and small-scale fishermen, through their unions, and coastal fishermen operating in 12-mile territorial waters."
"Creating subcommittees is another interesting proposal, because it seeks to ensure closer cooperation in every area."
"Furthermore, the report proposes that the funding of the spending and workings of these Councils should be more effectively guaranteed."
"Nevertheless, we have reservations about the potential transformation of these regional (and, therefore, supranational) councils into councils with real management powers, which would undermine Member State sovereignty."
". The reform of the CFP contained a proposal to set up RACs, and British Conservative MEPs today voted to support that proposal."
"We nevertheless believe that the EC has already relegated these bodies to the sidelines in respect of fisheries management by starving them of adequate funding and insisting that their role be purely 'advisory'."
"We fear that meaningful stakeholder involvement will therefore be restricted to the role of mere 'talking shops', with Brussels continuing to take all the management decisions."
"This is not good enough, and cannot resolve the problems which have resulted in the failure of the CFP."
"Thus, although we regard the creation of RACs as a tiny step in the right direction, we remain resolute in our view that UK withdrawal from the CFP, returning management to local and national control, remains the only real way to safeguard the future of the UK fisheries sector and fish stocks."
". I have on various occasions repeated the view in this House that fishermen and shipowners should play a more significant role in reforming the common fisheries policy, especially when it comes to drawing up plans for recovering species through bans and restrictions on fishing efforts."
"I believe it is quite unrealistic to seek to impose effective measures to conserve resources without consulting the main players involved because they are precisely the people who are most affected, on a daily basis, by decisions and policies on fisheries management."
"This is precisely the aim of this initiative to create Regional Advisory Councils (RACs), but although there is consensus on setting them up, there are disagreements over their composition and funding."
"It is my view that, without an appropriate budget, this measure will be meaningless and, without the majority representation of the fisheries industry in the RACs, the rights of the main players will suffer."
"Only at the end of a transitional period will the composition and workings of the RACs have to be reassessed."
"Should the experiment prove these bodies to be effective, they must then be given a significant role in managing fisheries resources."
"Lastly, I disagree with the geographical division of RACs proposed by the Commission, which divides up the entire EU territory into only five zones."
"Portuguese waters, both continental and around the islands, are thus included in the ‘South Western Waters’ zone."
". The aim of creating the Regional Advisory Councils (RAC) under the common fisheries policy is to increase the involvement of fishermen and their organisations in the decision-making processes of the CFP for the first time."
"I welcome the excellent work of the rapporteur, who has given voice to the fishermen’s legitimate expectations that these Councils will be set up. These Councils would, in particular, provide an ideal forum in which fishermen and scientists could overcome their traditional differences over the state of fisheries resources."
"The sustainable management of fisheries resources, the social interests of the sector and the economic survival of all coastal communities will depend, to a large extent, on the involvement of representatives of the fisheries sector in developing the CFP."
"We must, therefore, also ensure that these RACs are governed by transparent regulations and are quite independent, perhaps, as the rapporteur suggests, as ‘legally incorporated non-commercial bodies’ registered in a Member State."
"For this reason too, the European Commission must increase the funding it wishes to provide, which the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur consider to be derisory, in order to ensure that the RACs are truly viable."
"These Councils respond to an objective need of the European Union in terms of the value that their will bring to the CFP and to the work of the European Commission, and in terms of preventing problems arising in the future."
"Here it is at last – the long-awaited proposal for a decision establishing Regional Advisory Councils (RACs), which is a response to the framework regulation that provides for new ways of participating in the common fisheries policyWhile it is certainly a response, it also raises further questions."
"The rapporteur rightly points out that without adequate and continued funding this initiative will quickly become an empty shell, which will have helped the Commission to ease its conscience for the minimum outlay."
"My contribution to the report consists of requesting the creation of intermediate structures corresponding to coherent and homogenous geographical sub-units, whose role will be to propose technical recommendations to the RACs at the outset of the decision-making process."
"The social and economic dimension of the CFP will finally be taken into account, provided, again, that adequate funding is made available."
"The effectiveness of the RACs will depend entirely on the extent to which the fishery sector participates, which it will do in a genuine and effective way only if the RACs are guaranteed a certain level of Community funding and of involvement."
"The RACs can then take on a genuinely hands-on managerial role in addressing the economic, social and environmental issues directly affected by the CFP."

". Five years ago, the power of the Serb state over Kosovo, which is mainly populated by Albanians, was broken."
"The predominant memory that the people of Kosovo have of the Serbs is that of soldiers, police, tax collectors, prison wardens, unfriendly officials and unwanted rulers."
"They do not regard the remaining 5% of Serbs as people who will adopt the Albanian language or adapt in other ways."
"In fact, this minority is suspected of wanting its old privileged position back."
"Its position is similar to that of the Turks in Greece and Bulgaria, the Hungarians in Slovakia and Romania and the Russians in the Baltic states, except that the memories in Kosovo are more recent and more bitter."
"The area which was designated the bilingual autonomous province of Kosovo-Metohia within Serbia after the Second World War, has, in practice, fallen apart into a Serb north – a few scattered Serbian villages under military surveillance – and an otherwise purely Albanian country."
"The few contacts between Serbs and Albanians result in violent conflict."
"It should now be about the equality of people and good neighbourly relations."
"I expect that the Albanians intolerant attitude towards the Serbs, Turks and Roma – which is deplorable – will pass away as soon as they are certain that they can take over the running of the country and will never again be dominated by others."
". I voted against the Boumediene-Thiery report on fundamental human rights in the EU, which, I was delighted to see, was narrowly rejected (177 in favour, 184 against)."
"What this report in fact does is to record our sins, at length, and right across the board. It claims that we do not respect human dignity (Chapter I), that we deny people their freedom (II), that we practise discrimination (III), that we neglect solidarity (IV), that we hinder citizens’ rights (V) and that we do not allow access to a fair trial (VI)."
"The thread running though all of these chapters was the situation of immigrants, since, if this text is to be believed, we are not sufficiently open to immigrants and asylum seekers, we do not place sufficient numbers of immigrants on the electoral register and we should give legal immigrants the right to vote."
"Not surprisingly, this report contains a ringing endorsement of the draft European Constitution, the effect of which would be, however, to remove the definition of fundamental human rights from the competence of each nation, and to shift it instead to European level, where no one is in control of anything any more."
"This is an obvious sleight of hand."
"The report was rejected, but sadly the Constitution lives on."
". The report paints a relatively accurate picture of the ΕU, far from its made-up profile as a model of respect for human rights, as it often appears from its propagandists."
"It contains numerous critical references to the situation as regards fundamental rights in the ΕU, treatment of prisoners, slavery and forced labour, protection of personal data, freedom of expression and information, rights of asylum, racism and xenophobia, discrimination based on sex, disability, worker' rights, rights of third country nationals and fair access to justice."
"Nonetheless, this self-criticism is undermined, in that it takes as its criterion compliance with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which still lags behind the provisions of numerous constitutions, including the Greek constitution."
"Our basic objection, however, concerns how fundamental rights, such as the right to work, free health care, education, welfare and so on are addressed. At a time when big business is attacking workers' rights on all fronts, to consider that the problem can be addressed not by fighting but with new EU directives and measures or by applying existing ones is, at best, self-delusion."
"As far as women's rights are concerned, the report ignores the fact that there cannot be equality in social and family life unless the capitalist core is removed from EU policy."
"That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote."
"Fundamental rights within the EU seem even more important now that we shall be reuniting Eastern and Western Europe in just a few weeks’ time."
"A common basis of values for the new, enlarged EU is now even more necessary."
"We want to create a Union, the foundation for which is humanitarianism, tolerance, human dignity and the equal value of human beings."
"We have chosen to abstain in the vote on partnership and rights for heterosexual and homosexual couples when it comes to adoption within the EU."
"The Liberal Party has always pushed for everyone, regardless of sexual orientation or marital status, to be able to apply for adoption."
"All adoption decisions should be made on the basis of what is best for the child."
"We are not, therefore, against the possibility of either heterosexual or homosexual couples being tested for adoption."
"We are, however, doubtful that this is something that should be decided on at EU level."
"We are also of the opinion that the issue of euthanasia is something that each individual Member State should be allowed to resolve on its own."
"We have, however, adopted a position whereby the EU should push for women to have access to safe and legal abortions, essential contraceptives and economically accessible services within reproductive and sexual health and sex education."
". We are all forever deploring the fact that Parliament suffers from an obvious lack of reputation and credibility."
"As if it were not bad enough that there is no such thing as a ‘European people’ and that it is impossible to transpose the Member States’ current parliamentary practice to the European level, the federalist majority insists on burdening us continually with fulminating reports, which – as I have said many times before – do untold damage to the image of this House."
"This is true of the annual reports in the EU on human rights, and the report before us this year is no exception."
"Member States’ police forces are portrayed as ‘militias’ made up of potential torturers; governments are suspected of controlling and manipulating information; there is condemnation of policies aimed at strengthening control of illegal immigration and the inexorable rise of racism and xenophobia. The picture painted by this report is simply astonishing, not to say ridiculous."
"Add in the fact that the report argues in favour of homosexuality and euthanasia, and it is hardly surprising that reports of this nature do such damage to our standing in the eyes of the citizens."
". These reports have, unfortunately, become a ritual in the service of a radical and sectarian ideological agenda."
"They no longer serve the important idea of protecting and valuing human rights in the European Union, to really benefit the citizens."
"This year’s report did not break with this trend."
"It frequently slipped into a maximalist approach."
"It made unfair, frivolous and unfounded assessments of Member States, and this is true of its references to Portugal, all of which were incorrect."
"Having based its approach on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it promptly rode roughshod over this document and distanced itself completely from the charter by proclaiming a ‘right to abortion’ – when no such thing exists (whilst rejecting an amendment that I proposed, in discussions in the parliamentary committee, to protect human life) and by obsessively promoting the homosexual agenda, which contravenes the exclusive competence of the Member States in the field of family law."
"Lastly, it lacked the vigour required for dealing with real threats."
"On the one hand, it completely ignored the fact, lost in the torrent of paragraphs couched in emotive terms, that terrorism is the main threat to human rights today. On the other, the report failed clearly to condemn the French legislation on religious symbols, which is the most disturbing recent sign of discrimination and threatens religious freedom."
"I therefore voted against and welcome the fact that it has been rejected in plenary."
"I hope that lessons will be learnt for the future."
"I have today, together with a majority, voted down this report (184 against, 177 in favour and 13 abstentions)."
"We European Christian Democrats in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have done this on a huge scale because, in our opinion, the report should have concentrated on evaluating how the Member States have respected human rights, taking the EU’s Charter on Fundamental Rights as a starting point."
"This was unfortunately not the case."
"The report is sweeping and poorly formulated, at the same time as diluting and devaluing the concept of human rights. Here is an example: in one and the same item there are references to torture on the one hand, which of course must be condemned outright, and demands for the introduction of euthanasia on the other, which is neither an EU issue nor a human rights issue."
"The report covers a series of subjects that fall outside the area of competence of the EU and are not covered by the Charter, for example, changing national legislation on marriage between men and women, together with the very concept of the family, or including the extinguishing of life in the form of terminations/abortions under the concept of human rights."
"This is something to which, of course, Europe’s Christian Democrats say no."
"Today, the European Parliament voted on a report regarding the state of human rights in Europe."
"The report should have concentrated on evaluating how the Member States have respected human rights, taking the EU’s Charter on Fundamental Rights as a starting point."
"This was unfortunately not the case."
"The report is sweeping and poorly formulated, which is exemplified by the fact that, in one and the same item, there are references to torture on the one hand, which of course must be condemned outright, and euthanasia on the other, which is not an EU issue and does not count as a human right, either."
"The report covers a series of issues that fall outside the area of competence of the EU and are not covered by the Charter."
"The report does, however, cover several important issues such as trafficking in human beings, women’s rights, asylum policy and the rule of law, to which I would like to lend my support."
"The whole assessment of the report will, however, be such that I have chosen to abstain in the final vote."
". The conditions for Croatia’s accession to the EU – and not to Europe, as the resolution states – raise similar problems to the accession of other countries, albeit with some peculiar characteristics."
"As elsewhere, we claim to be applying the Copenhagen criteria, based on the assumption that a viable market economy is being created, whilst in reality the states’ erosion of social protection and their underfunding of social programmes have led to poverty, unemployment and external debt."
"The report, and I quote, draws ‘attention to the need to ensure transparency and speed up the privatisation process’. These forced privatisations, however, have, as everywhere, lacked transparency and their slowness reflects substantial difficulties and legitimacy problems that have never been analysed."
"Croatia’s accession, is, moreover, supposed to encourage the Western Balkans, who were promised future integration by the Thessaloniki Council last June."
"This is breathtaking hypocrisy, given the disastrous state of international policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, as evidenced by the recent violence in Kosovo, in the presence of some 20 000 NATO troops."
"Although we are in favour of European integration that is open to all countries, current debate on enlargement analyses areas that we would prefer to avoid."
"We therefore voted against this resolution."
", . By submitting a request, on 21 February 2003, to join the European Union, this country that was part of the former Yugoslavia became the first country from the Western Balkans to choose to align its destiny with that of the European Union, reinforcing the idea that the European project is still a mobilising factor, even beyond the round of enlargement that will take place on 1 May."
"Given the political and post-war situation in the region, I fully share the rapporteur’s opinion that Croatia can become the driving force for progress in the Western Balkans."
"With its economic strength and the progress it has made on establishing democracy, Croatia’s success can certainly serve as a model and an incentive for the other countries that make up the Western Balkans, in view of their own eventual accession to the EU."
"This would, therefore, be the most desirable scenario for ensuring stability and prosperity in the region."
"If Croatia wishes to have the opportunity to join the Union reasonably quickly, it must nevertheless first solve certain problems relating to the definition of its land and sea borders, which concern Slovenia and Italy."
"The European Union cannot allow such problems within its borders. The rapporteur refers to these problems and calls for a rapid solution to be found."
"I voted in favour of this report."
". Croatia submitted its request for accession to the European Union on 21 February 2003 and was the first country from the Western Balkans to opt firmly for the project of European integration."
"In recent years Croatia has embarked on economic and political reforms aimed at democratising the country and modernising its economy."
"Croatia has also made substantial progress in bringing its legislation into line with that of the European Union in several areas, in accordance with the guidelines laid down for the association and stabilisation process."
"A great deal remains to be done, in particular on the return of refugees, on Croatia’s cooperation with the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia and on the extension of Croatia’s jurisdiction over the Adriatic – considerable perseverance will be needed to ensure that Croatia has the necessary means to ensure that the rule of law and democracy are consolidated."
"I feel, however, that despite these limitations, the example of Croatia could serve as a model for the entire Balkan region and I therefore voted in favour."
"– The June Movement has today chosen to vote in favour of Turkey being treated like other candidate countries and having to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria, particularly where human rights are concerned."
"The June Movement firmly believes that Turkey's possible membership cannot in any way be linked to a need for an EU Constitution or a common security and defence policy."
"The June Movement is fundamentally opposed to an EU Constitution and a common security and defence policy."
".– The Oostlander report assessing ‘Turkey’s progress towards accession’ is compelled to make negative assessments of each area, yet falls short of reaching a negative overall conclusion."
"If we do not wish to redirect Turkey towards privileged partner status, as I proposed in my intervention during the debate, then what is the solution?"
"The Oostlander report tentatively moves in an unexpected direction, namely the internal reform of the policies and institutions of the EU itself (see item G and paragraph 36)."
"This idea is worthy of consideration, particularly as it ties in with a suggestion we ourselves have made in the past, that a variable-geometry Europe would more readily welcome Turkey as a partner, as it would establish free relations between sovereign countries, and would avoid the explosive situation of being subject to a supranational decision-making system in which Turkey would carry very considerable weight."
"Unfortunately, the Oostlander report, having made several steps in this direction, then takes a wrong turn, by proposing, as a solution to all problems, the strengthening of the supranational system by the adoption of the draft Constitution currently on the table."
"The federalists are going round in circles."
". We voted against Amendment No 7, the author of which – with his outdated and chauvinistic ideas – would like to slam the EU’s door shut to Turkey."
"The fact that he hides his stance behind a proposal for a referendum – in which every EU citizen would be asked to voice their opinion on the matter – does not justify that stance."
"Does he propose referendums on questions that really matter to the public, such as the redirection of State arms budgets to schools, hospitals and public transport in the EU?"
"We are not, of course, opposed to Turkey’s accession to the EU. We are, however, opposed to all those who cite religious or ideological reasons for refusing to lower a border on a continent that is already all too divided."
"Nevertheless, we do not accept the reasons why the European ruling classes would like Turkey to be integrated into the framework of the EU, nor do we accept the clean bill of health given to the Turkish Government, especially when basic rights and freedoms are being trampled under foot in Turkey, such as the Kurdish people’s right to enjoy such rights and freedoms, and when political prisoners are still detained."
"We also do not understand why backing should be given to the conditions imposed by the European institutions on Turkey, for which the leaders of the country will undoubtedly make the working classes foot the bill."
"We have therefore abstained from voting on this report."
". The report contains some aspects that I believe to be fair and others with which I disagree, particularly those underlying its main thesis."
"The rapporteur is right to condemn the Turkish authorities’ failure to respect trade union freedom and to criticise the progress of the trial of Leyla Zana and other Turkish MPs of Kurdish origin."
"We must call for prisoners of conscience to be released and condemn political persecution and the ban on the activity of some political parties."
"We must condemn the ongoing torture, mistreatment and persecution faced by human rights’ activists and organisations."
"We must reaffirm the cultural rights of the Kurdish people and a ‘just, viable and functional settlement of the Cyprus problem’, in line with the UN resolutions."
"In order to be consistent, however, and to demonstrate solidarity with the Turkish people, I must criticise some aspects of the report, such as accepting ‘the primacy of EU law over national law’, the need to approve the so-called ‘European Constitution’, using Turkey as a Nato ally, to ‘significantly’ increase the EU’s influence in the region, and even the view that Turkey should ‘put up or shut up’ in negotiations, without the EU making any concessions on imposing its neolioberal economic policies. An example of this is the opinion of Parliament’s Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
". I believe that, whilst it has work to do to comply with the Copenhagen criteria, Turkey belongs in Europe."
"It has helped to mould Europe’s culture and history."
"I have therefore dissociated myself from all amendments that do not target genuine improvement in the democratic process in Turkey, but that endeavour instead to put up fresh barriers and to set traps in order to prevent any decision in favour."
". I voted against the resolution."
"By integrating the whole of Turkey, Europe would be changing not only its geographical dimensions but also its very nature."
"Turkey has no claims – be they geographical, historical or cultural – to be part of the EU’s political project."
"We must, however, connect Turkey with Europe."
"I say ‘no’ to accession, but ‘yes’ to close and privileged cooperation, and to a strong partnership agreement."
"Turkey must, furthermore, confront its past."
"I also voted in favour of the amendment calling on the Turkish authorities to make a public acknowledgement of the genocide against the Armenians."
"I also hope that Parliament’s assent will be sought before negotiations are opened, and not once they have been completed."
". What breathtaking hypocrisy on Parliament’s part to discuss Turkey’s accession today, as though somehow this were not a , although the impending enlargement, with the accession of ten new countries, paves the way for a ‘second wave’, in the shape of the accession of Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey."
"The title of the report says much about what the Commission is cooking up, with the active complicity of the political ‘elites’."
"‘Report on Turkey’s progress towards accession’ – you only have to read the title to be in no doubt that the Community bodies are already planning Turkey’s accession."
"We are expected to wait until December 2004 to know whether or not negotiations on accession can get under way."
"What a charade!"
"All European leaders have expressed their support for this unholy accession, and without so much as consulting their citizens."
"As the first to speak out against an enlargement that is non-European, politically unjustified, economically suicidal and socially devastating, the is the only French political force genuinely opposed to Turkey’s accession to the EU."
". This report makes it clear that Turkey, despite steps in the right direction, still fails to meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"These form the basic conditions for partnership and the European Union."
"It is an illusion to think that these criteria will be met by this autumn, and so it would be premature to mention a date."
"What is essential to us is that there can be no real democracy under the army's guardianship."
"It is equally essential that the Kurds should be able to exercise to the full their rights as a cultural minority."
"A constitutional state is unthinkable without an independent judicial system."
"While we are still not convinced that Turkey's ultimate destiny lies in membership of the EU, or that the European Union can welcome it as a Member State, we do not want to rule this out at this point in time."
"This should also be debated within the European Union."
"A final decision in favour of an association agreement to the exclusion of membership appears to us to be just as premature."
"We do not want to discourage Turkey from continuing on the path towards greater democracy and more human rights, or from giving the Kurds their autonomy in order to enjoy their culture."
". Turkey decided in favour of Europe as long ago as the Atatürk revolution in the early 1920s."
"Moreover, people from Turkey and their descendants have formed a major population group in Western Europe for the past 40 years."
"This has made the discussion about the question whether Turkey belongs to Europe and whether it would not be preferable if it were to sign association agreements with the Middle East, Central Asia or Iran, increasingly more theoretical."
"Those who want to keep Turkey outside the European Union on the grounds that it is largely outside Europe in geographical terms or because it is not founded upon the Judaeo-Christian tradition, lost the argument a long time ago."
"However, this does not mean that those who defend the other extreme are necessarily right either."
"In its current state, Turkey does fit into the authoritarian Europe of the first half of the twentieth century, but not as yet in a European Union of parliamentary democracies."
"Before that can happen, it will need to stop banning political parties, do away with an electoral system that is geared towards exclusion, stop taking political prisoners, and abolish censorship of the press, the oppression of regional languages and the army's political influence."
"Legislative amendments without changes in practice are not enough."
"Anyone who wants Turkey to join for military, economic or idealistic reasons should realise the negative effects that a premature admission could have."
"It would not benefit democracy, human rights, peace and the environment within the European Union."
". My position on this matter has been well known for a long time."
"Everyone knows why I am strongly opposed to Turkey’s accession to the EU."
"It is, consequently, obvious that I would be unable to endorse the conclusions of this new report, which appears to suggest that Turkey’s accession is a foregone conclusion."
"I would also be most surprised if a great nation such as Turkey were to accept such contemptuous treatment at the hands of such European institutions as the Commission and Parliament."
"What gives these bodies, whose legitimacy is more than dubious, the right to treat a sovereign state such as Turkey in this humiliating fashion?"
"Under the pretext of monitoring compliance with the Copenhagen criteria, Parliament calls on the Turkish authorities to adopt a new constitution, to spread federalist propaganda in this famously civil society, and then unscrupulously subjects Turkey to international condemnation for these never-ending breaches of human rights, and so forth."
"Quite apart from the problem of Turkey’s accession, the EU is showing an extremely worrying tendency to interfere."
". This report assesses Turkey’s progress towards its potential accession to the European Union."
"The rapporteur has made a realistic interpretation of the doubts that have been building up in various Member States as regards Turkey’s accession to the European Union, by advocating a realistic policy which, in his view, the Union must adopt towards that country."
"We must not promote the idea that, as a result of the measures that have already been adopted, Turkey is already close to accession. Instead, we should work closely with the current Turkish Government to ensure that it fully meets the Copenhagen political criteria."
"In fact, the Council has, perhaps over-hastily, given Turkey recognition as a candidate for accession and, as the rapporteur states, ‘in this recognition the quality of Turkey as a democratic and constitutional state did not play a dominant role’."
"I support the position adopted by Mr Queiró, which he expressed in plenary, on the need for the Council and the Commission to make a clear and precise assessment of the consequences of Turkey’s accession."
"It is not enough to know whether Turkey is ready to join the Union."
"The important question is whether the Union is prepared for this eventuality and reason dictates that we must ask this question."
"I voted in favour."
"I have abstained in the final vote."
"The report was adopted by 211 votes to 84, with 46 abstentions."
"Turkey must revoke its 30-year occupation of Cyprus and acknowledge the genocide of the Christian minorities of Armenians and Syrian-Assyrian-Chaldeans in 1915-1918, which cost 1.5 million people their lives."
"The EU as a proponent of peace is undermined if Turkey is allowed to enter into negotiations regarding EU membership in a situation in which the country continues to be an occupying power in the northern part of the new EU member, Cyprus."
"EU Member States do not occupy one another."
"Historic blunders must be acknowledged in order to alleviate the suffering and sorrow of the minorities affected."
"Only thus can we embrace a new future."
"Germany would never have been considered a democracy or been able to become an EU member if it had denied the Holocaust, the genocide of the Jews, during the Second World War."
"Turkey has everything to learn from this."
". I voted against the report on Turkey’s progress towards accession, since, quite apart from the report’s position stating that Turkey does not fulfil the required criteria to accede, I am opposed in principle to Turkey joining the EU."
"Turkey does not belong to the continent, geographically speaking, and Europe must establish coherent borders."
"It is for this reason that I welcomed the possibility of proposing a privileged partnership, as envisaged in the future European Constitution."
"While Parliament does not support this approach, I feel that Turkey’s accession would run counter to the construction of a strong and coherent political Europe."
". I remain opposed to integrating the EDF into the EU’s budget, given that States will not agree to contribute an amount that is at least equivalent to current voluntary contributions towards the EU’s development policy, all of which will be on top of the current ceiling of 1.24% of joint GNP."
".– If the EDF system has survived thus far in an unconventional fashion, this is because the relationships forged by some EU Members – by no means all of them – with developing countries, especially in Africa, it is because these relationships are themselves less than conventional."
"Rather than be suspicious of these privileged relationships, the EU should instead welcome their continued existence, in spite of the fact that the Community perspective has, in recent years, due to enlargement, tended to focus its attentions eastwards, at the expense of the south."
"If procedures must be rationalised and simplified, two forms of injustice arise from the reform of the system in favour of the total communitisation and budgetisation of aid: firstly, the fall in overall funding resulting from the removal of the psychological factor, which meant that voluntary contributions tended be the most generous; and secondly, labelling a major part of cooperation policy ‘European’ serves to make action less visible, and, accordingly, reduce the influence of the principal donors in the region in question."
"In conclusion, levelling will, as ever, be downwards, and will serve to offer the shirkers an undeserved smokescreen and to discourage the most generous donors, who will see their efforts masked by unjust and counter-productive anonymity."
". The financing of the European Development Fund (EDF) was originally kept outside the Community budget because, for a long time, development cooperation was viewed, as someone has said, as the ‘national preserve’ of the Member States."
"The main benefit of incorporating the EDF’s financing into the budget would be to facilitate parliamentary control and it would also make it easier to simplify and streamline procedures and to clear up the '' (RAL), which are partly responsible, it is widely believed, for the lack of transparency affecting the entire operation."
"This budgetisation will also enable us to provide more effective responses to one-off situations of the utmost urgency."
"We must, however, at all costs avoid this process automatically resulting in lower contributions to the ACP countries, diverted towards other strategic areas for investment or contributions being reduced as a result of the accession of the new Member States."
"We must also prevent the psychological factor of the visibility of national donations from disappearing completely, as a result of aid being provided at a more centralised level."
"As I have always maintained, Europe has a historical and human responsibility to contribute to the wellbeing of peoples and nations to which we are bound by a deep-rooted sense of fraternity and which, for various reasons, need our consideration and our practical support."
"The results that have been achieved, over many years, by this European form of solidarity, particularly towards the ACP countries, must encourage us to pursue this course of action, which is much needed by these peoples and much desired by the European public."
"Mr President, multilingualism is guaranteed, for better or for worse, in Europe’s legal system, by the founding treaties. In the same way that it applies to every citizen of the EU, it also protects the Members of this House in the way in which they carry out their functions."
"It follows that the Rules of Procedure of this House cannot alone be exempt from an obligation that is established in the Treaty. The Bureau must, therefore, in line with the provisions laid down by common agreement, comply strictly with the obligations that also bind it."
"Mr President, the resolution on the European Council, as you are well aware, is very wide-ranging."
"Once again, it contains approval of the draft European Constitution, which would have led me – as I have not changed my mind in this respect – to vote against it."
"However, it also makes so many other valid points, particularly with regard to terrorism and the appalling attack on Madrid, that I had no choice but to vote in favour of it."
"I am aware of the text of the Council statement, Mr Dehousse."
"If I may take the liberty of making a comment, even if as President I usually only preside, I found it very strange, amongst other things, that, in an official European Council document, the last two paragraphs were dedicated to an internal matter of accommodation."
"I feel that we – as Parliament – should in some way point out to the Council that we found this truly strange."
"Mr President, even though, in my opinion, considerable elements are missing from this resolution, it is largely balanced, and so I voted in favour of it."
"First of all, I believe that no solution to the Kosovo problem can be found without first making clear decisions as to the future of Kosovo."
"If we do not define the status that we want to give it, then the standards cannot be achieved."
"To this end, I believe that the route taken to date is wrong."
"Secondly, I think that the United Nations Transitional Administration has discredited itself so much that it should be replaced there by a European civilian administration, which could be better controlled and which would – if it avoids the mistakes that UNMIK (United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo ) made – enjoy more respect."
"The third and final point that I wanted to raise is that it is being said that Kosovo-Albanian leaders were insufficiently unequivocal in condemning the riots, but they did do so, and emphatically."
"President Rugova declared a day of national mourning for both nationalities, whilst the Serbian Prime Ministermarched at the head of a demonstration in Belgrade where there were calls to ‘kill the Albanians!’"
"Mr President, I welcome the Baltas report as a cautious step towards Croatian membership of the EU, and I must say that we had got even further on this matter, since, with the Brok report, this House clearly argued for candidate status and for Croatia’s accession in the next wave."
"I would like to say that we should continue down this route."
"Although, through no fault of its own, Croatia is in a different league from the Member States that will be joining us on 1 May, it is, in many respects, as ready for accession as some of them are, and I believe that we should give immense support to Croatia so that it is present in the next wave of enlargement."
"Mr President, I should simply like to express my concern at the resounding vote given by this House in favour of Turkey’s progress towards accession."
"Turkey is a great and respectable country, but it is not a European one."
"Turkey’s accession would initiate a process that would, little by little, gradually lead to an overall dilution of the EU as a whole. It would deprive the EU of a genuine ability to make decisions and take action in the future."
"I appreciate that the House has voted in this way as part of the Helsinki decision taken by the Heads of State or Government in 1999. This was, however, a rash decision that was taken without proper debate or consultation and we are now reaping its disastrous consequences."
"I am also astonished – and I will finish on this point – to see some people today opposing the follow-up of the process, even though yesterday, they approved the initiative – involving Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin with particular regard to my own country – which was at the root of the Helsinki decision in 1999."
"Mr President, I acknowledge that Mr Bourlanges is one of the most learned Members of this House."
"Consequently, I am stunned by his bold declaration that Turkey is not a European country."
"To say that, Mr Bourlanges, would be like saying that Byzantium is and has never been European."
"Go on pilgrimage to Ravenna and then we can speak about it."
"This issue has nothing to do with the past, however, and everything to do with the future."
"The question is whether or not we want Turkey to be part of European integration."
"It is not history that will take us forward, but our own will and that of our peoples."
"I share the concerns held by Mr Bourlanges and others."
"I am one of those hoping for serious debates to take place, including in this House, so that we can take decisions based on careful consideration."
"I would say, however, that those who have expressed their views have done so prematurely, and at a time when any reservations we may have about Turkey, be they well-founded or otherwise, undermine the difficult task to which the EU is committed, alongside the UN, that of finding a solution to the Cyprus question."
"This is not the right time, therefore, to be discussing such matters and less still to be taking decisions, which is why I unreservedly endorse the proposal before us."
"Mr President, I voted against the Oostlander report even though it includes many good ideas."
"I would, however, like to clearly associate myself with the line taken by my colleague Mr Bourlanges."
"We want a strong Turkey as a good partner, but we also want a stable European Union that is capable of action."
"Those who turn Turkey into a full Member State of the European Union, destabilise the European Union."
"Those, however, who only lead Turkey to believe that they really have a chance of being a candidate, are ultimately destabilising Turkey because they are, so to speak, luring the Turks in with unattainable promises and then letting them down by imposing ever tighter criteria."
"This is a game I am not prepared to play."
"I am in favour of an honest policy on Turkey, which says that there are limits to everything, even to a Europe that can be integrated."
"Turkey must be our closest partner and as far as Byzantium is concerned, you can say that Saint Augustine came from today’s Algeria, and he was one of the fathers of the West, but even so, I would not incorporate the current Algeria or the future Algeria – even a democratic Algeria – into the European Union."
"The European Union is not the amalgamation of all democratic countries in the world that fulfil the Copenhagen criteria, but rather all European States that fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and wish to join."
"That concludes the vote.(4)"
"(5)"
"Mr President, on a point of order, there was no announcement just now, but as the written declaration on the rights of deaf-blind people has reached the required number of signatures, namely, 320, I would just like to thank everyone here for signing that resolution, of which I was co-author."
"It is great news for deaf-blind people."
"We are not asking for more rights for deaf-blind people in the European Union, but for the same rights as other European citizens have."
"We congratulate you, Mrs Lynne, and we are all very pleased with this important news that the declaration has now received the necessary number of signatures."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0176/2004) on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the communication from the Commission: Towards a thematic strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste."
"Mr President, I too would like to join in the congratulations."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Wallström for the fact that the Commission developed this thematic strategy. I would also like to encourage her to pursue this issue because I believe that we are currently in a phase in Europe where we must consider whether the waste policy can be continued as we have done to date or if it is not the case that we have for a long time had new knowledge and must no longer just tighten up the loose screws, but rather perhaps here and there also change the system."
"As a result, this is the first regulation – that both the Commission and Parliament have had to address – that makes it urgently necessary that we look at the transposal of the law in force in Europe."
"For example, the implementation of the landfill directive is abysmal, to say the least."
"Some countries go over the top but some are not doing anything in this area."
"This is why I believe that, alongside a high level of protection, we must also pay attention here to the transposal of such things."
"The second thing that is very dear to me is that we ensure, in the areas of waste and recycling, that the instruments and regulations that run in parallel, such as for example REACH and IVO, as well as other product policies and the resource strategies – that we should have also included in the debate now – are compatible with this report."
"Otherwise, I think the legislation will not be watertight and loopholes will open up; that we really do not want."
"We warmly welcome the Commission’s approach, which involves developing sustainable waste management whilst giving equal value to the environmental, economic and social aspects and, therefore, to develop sustainable policies."
"We also believe that the entire lifecycle of resources and waste policy too must be considered together; not just a part, but the entire lifecycle must be taken into consideration."
"Commissioner Wallström, I must give my particular support to the approach to set up cost-benefit analyses."
"Without them, I believe that we would be doing Europe no favours as a location for industry."
"I do not want to question the sustainable combination within the waste hierarchy at all, but we must subject this waste hierarchy to a certain degree of transparency and flexibility since prevention, reuse, recycling, energy recovery and environment-friendly waste disposal are the tried and completely trusted instruments."
"The order is also right, but I would once again like to expressly point out the flexibility that we actually need here."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy clearly dealt with the issues where more proposals for harmonisation must be made, and where existing regulations must actually be implemented."
"I am extremely pleased that there will in future also be certain rules and systems concepts for recovery facilities, so that one person does not think one thing and someone else another as regards recovery facilities."
"I hope that the committee and the Commission agree with me that the competitiveness of secondary raw materials as well as of primary raw materials must be guaranteed."
"I think that help from outside is also necessary, probably from the area of taxation, in order to develop an adequate and above all a continual flow of secondary raw materials for the manufacturing industry."
"The issue of the landfill directive is a difficult one and, together with environmentalists, we are looking into whether or not to bring in a landfill tax."
"I do not think much of this idea at all, as it makes Europe more expensive as an industrial location."
"I do, however, believe in ultimately raising landfill standards to a level where they can be compared."
"Raising taxes is basically the easiest thing to do in this sphere but achieving the required equal standards for landfill would also entail harmonising the costs."
"That would be a much more sensible route to take."
"We have, therefore, proposed standardisation and a truly ‘European’ landfill regulation and we have gained a huge majority for it."
"A further important point – this is hard to believe – is this issue of whether to differentiate between recovery and disposal and so on and so forth."
"All these things will in future be regulated under this directive and will be tracked by the Commission and by you in line with the objectives."
"I would like to thank all Members, who were involved in this report and I hope that we will reach a successful conclusion."
". Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Florenz for this important report; as usual he has done a thorough job."
"In the Sixth Environmental Action Programme the European Union set out a vision integrating resource, product and waste policies, and now with the development of the Thematic Strategy on the Prevention and Recycling of Waste we are designing the concrete policy which will take the next step towards turning this vision into reality."
"Allow me to share with you some thoughts on the challenges we are facing."
"The first challenge ahead of us is for waste policy to adapt to enlargement and the increased diversity of the European Union."
"We must set common rules guaranteeing a high level of environmental protection for all facilities in the European waste recovery market."
"We must ensure that our legislation gives the right signals to Member States, whilst allowing them to adapt policies to national issues."
"This means waste legislation must take more of a framework approach."
"The second challenge we are facing lies in defining the environmental objective of waste policy."
"We need to accurately target environmental impacts and look at how waste prevention, re-use and increased recycling can best reduce this impact."
"Finally, the most concrete challenge will be to design cost-effective instruments."
"In the past we have focused on products with particular issues like end-of-life cars and computers."
"However, these wastes represent small fractions of total waste flows, and we have outlined in the communication ways to promote recycling more generally."
"We need to influence the economic attractiveness of recycling and set the scene for materials to re-enter the economy."
"I would like to make a few comments on some key aspects of the report before you."
"It rightly stresses the general objective of reducing environmental impacts of waste and the primary role waste prevention should play."
"However, we must accept that there is no miraculous instrument that can stop waste at source."
"We will have to adopt a flexible approach, enabling Member States to use a wide range of measures."
"I welcome the support given to developing common standards for waste management facilities and promoting the use of economic instruments such as landfill taxes."
"I believe these elements should play a key role."
"Landfill bans can also be useful, but only as part of an overall policy."
"I would like to stress that it will not be possible to increase indefinitely the number of product directives."
"The waste flows covered are too small, and implementation is complex."
"In conclusion, if we are to move forward in the face of changing circumstances we need to get our strategy right."
"We need to focus on the most significant environmental impacts of waste, and adopt framework actions to tackle them."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Commission Communication is a first step towards the thematic strategy which includes both the prevention and the recycling of waste."
"This is recognised in the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, presented by Mr Langen, and I welcome him."
"Our position in this regard is clear."
"We must adopt a flexible approach which takes account of the diversity of geographical, social and economic situations in the various Member States."
"We recognise that it is necessary to reduce the quantity of waste produced and achieve the highest possible levels of reuse of materials, and that all possibilities for dealing with waste are valid, provided that they are sustainable."
"Recycling 100% of waste is highly desirable, but impossible."
"Imposing obligatory objectives, particularly in the case of prevention, and charges and taxes may have effects that are counter-productive for the management of waste."
"There are markets in waste which already function perfectly and which handle great quantities in an efficient manner."
"Therefore, establishing obligatory rules and taxes on waste may have distorting effects, in the opinion of the Committee on Industry."
"Furthermore, industrial waste is often easier to recycle and, therefore, we call on the Commission to take this factor into account and to include in its proposal the separate collection of recyclable material originating from industry."
"We also urge the Commission to produce an evaluation of the consultation procedure carried out on the definition of ‘waste’, publishing its results and presenting a response on the definition of this concept and other parallel concepts, such as waste recycling."
"Commissioner, we impatiently await the thematic strategy on waste and we will always draft our proposals for improvements in accordance with what is best for the environment and for the general public."
"– Mr President, waste has to be prevented both quantitatively and qualitatively, and at the same time there have to be ways of recovering material defined as waste, so that the quantity of waste for disposal is minimised."
"This has been the aim in the Community approach to the problem of waste for a long time now, and this has also been the main thread running through the commendable report by my colleague, Mr Florenz."
"The principles that lie behind waste prevention and its effective treatment and recovery, however, can easily be interpreted as a threat to each other."
"We have organisations that are opposed to the effective recovery of waste because they fear the successful treatment of waste threatens the principle of prevention."
"This is madness and the sort of ideological inflexibility the world can no longer afford."
"Every single means must be used, first prevention, then recovery, and our politicians must be able to find a system in which these objectives do not pose a threat to one another."
"We will be bad politicians unless we can make the system a more rational one."
"This means that the definition of waste will be of central importance."
"Our problem is the differing and often too restricting definitions in the waste sector, as the large number of problem cases before the European Court of Justice shows."
"This problem has to be addressed though the clarification and harmonisation of legislation."
"It will be necessary to define the difference between recovery and disposal quickly when the next parliamentary term starts."
"At the moment it seems that with competition more effective operations really will lead to better efficiency, which in most cases also means eco-efficiency in the use of materials."
"Thus competition in conjunction with Community legislation already implemented is satisfactorily steering towards the prevention of waste."
"The trend is absolutely the right one and only needs to be endorsed."
"The greatest untapped potential still lies in how materials and by-products classified as waste can be recovered so that the use of virgin materials can be reduced and waste disposal made unnecessary."
"Industry accounts for enormous quantities of waste whose precise composition is known and which at source could be treated separately from the rest of the waste flow."
"This would facilitate its recovery with the risks fully under control."
"Europe is acting properly in its aim towards sustainable waste management and there can be no compromise regarding this objective."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, waste prevention, reuse and recycling – all these topics have been in the limelight over the past few years."
"I should like to thank Mr Florenz for his contribution to the debate and for his interesting report."
"The European directives have certainly started the ball rolling."
"We are sorting and collecting our packaging waste, and we make sure our appliances are disposed of effectively."
"All over Europe, there are now recycling installations, and all over Europe, people are committed to processing the waste we are all producing."
"That is heavy and demanding work."
"However, we should do this for the environment and should continue doing this, because the waste mountain is still growing."
"We should therefore not turn a blind eye to a few obstacles in European waste policy."
"First of all, there are large discrepancies among the Member States in the implementation of the directive."
"This is sometimes attributable to indolence, but often to real problems, such as the lack of potential markets."
"These differences in implementation also lead to competitive problems."
"In some countries, it is the governments and taxpayers who collect, and industry contributes little, while in other countries, it is precisely the other way round."
"Secondly, there is the environmental benefit, which is not always clear."
"We think that recycling benefits the environment, but there is a limit."
"For example, in the case of excessive transport distances, the environmental benefit becomes a burden."
"Thirdly, we are still not sufficiently engaging in prevention and reuse."
"Packaging is important to protect the product, but surely a double layer of plastic around a small piece of bread is taking things slightly too far."
"Although the Group of the Party of European Socialists is not a keen advocate of expressing prevention targets in weight, because this stimulates the use of lighter materials, such as plastic, we have to note that, in Belgium for example, reuse targets work very well."
"Germany too offers much inspiration with regard to its deposit system."
"As far as the amendments are concerned, we wholeheartedly back all amendments which stimulate reuse and prevention, except for amendments in which prevention is expressed in a percentage, such as in Amendment No 13."
"As for the definition of waste, I think that we should remind ourselves of the objective that the environmental burden of production and consumption should decrease."
"For this, the whole chain has to be examined, from raw material down to waste."
"It does not seem useful to me to have continual discussions about the definitions of waste and prevention."
"I share Mr Florenz' view that the reduction of waste is an essential element of sustainable waste management."
"The wording is of secondary importance."
"Finally, I should like to comment on the economic and social aspects of waste prevention."
"Our key topic is the environment, but that also encompasses other aspects, particularly in the economic and social areas."
"It is precisely these aspects that have been insufficiently addressed, even if the costs have been regularly mentioned recently in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"In the past, we have called for the introduction of a supercommissioner for sustainable development."
"This may be a good time to repeat this request."
"The Lisbon objective needs a shot in the arm and that should come from a new Parliament and a new Commissioner."
"Mr President, waste is a major problem throughout the European Union."
"If we take municipal waste for example, what we produce is far in excess of the targets set in the Fifth Environmental Action Programme."
"The prevention of waste is one of the ways of tackling it, because the disposal of waste – whether through landfill or incineration – causes health and environmental problems."
"Many people in the European Union are trying to tackle the issue of landfill sites situated near homes or the fact that incinerators are being planned in some countries, including my own to try to deal with the waste problem."
"That is the wrong road to go down."
"The Commission's communication is a first step towards having a strategy that covers prevention and recycling."
"We welcome the fact that the report has included some very important things, such as waste reduction plans."
"It is all very well to say we will have them, but this is meaningless without some effort to ensure that happens, so it is essential that they are compulsory."
"The promotion of re-use is extremely important and particularly respect for the judgment of the European Court of Justice that waste incineration of municipal household waste is disposal and not recovery."
"It was regrettable that the review of the packaging directive did not deal with this properly."
"The judgment was clear in itself, so how could anyone consider that the incineration of household waste was the same as recovery?"
"We regret that we were unable to change the whole pro-incineration approach to a pro-recycling approach."
"This is essential because, by following the road of incineration, any incentive to reduce and look at alternative ways of dealing with the reduction of waste is destroyed."
". Mr President, first a word on waste definition."
"This is often mentioned as being important, which of course it is."
"In its communication the Commission stated that it would consider changes to waste definition if the need for such changes was demonstrated, and also that the alternative proposal guarantees a high level of environmental protection."
"The Commission also stressed that the debate on waste definition should focus on easing the application of the definition of waste."
"This has also been widely supported by stakeholders."
"It would seem useful to mitigate the impact of the definition of waste in some circumstances, and this may involve changes to the Waste Framework Directive."
"Turning to waste prevention, since it has been discussed, and the subject of setting targets for waste prevention. This is a complex issue, and the potential for waste prevention will vary; it depends on economic growth and also the maturity of different industrial production processes."
"Furthermore, specific information and instruments are needed to influence each decision taken at production-process, management, design and consumer levels."
"EU legislation contains the seeds of mandatory waste prevention plans, because under the Waste Framework Directive Member States must draw up waste management plans which promote, , waste prevention."
"On recycling and recovery: in general, but not always, recycling is environmentally more favourable than energy recovery."
"For example, low quality of recycling, a high proportion of recovered energy or highly mixed waste can influence environmental performance."
"In such circumstances, case-by-case assessment may be necessary to determine the best option."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next part-session."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the International Conference on Renewable Energy to take place in Bonn in June."
"Mr President, the plan of implementation agreed in Johannesburg during the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 put a strong emphasis on renewable energy. It stresses the need to substantially increase the share of renewable energy in the total world energy supply."
"In answer to this challenge, the European Community and the Member States launched, during the World Summit in Johannesburg, the so-called 'Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition', inviting all countries of the world to joint it."
"A key milestone in this process is the conference that will take place in Bonn this year."
"The Commission has been involved in its preparation since the very early stages."
"The first preparatory international high-level conference was organised by the Commission."
"It offered the first major stepping-stone towards the Bonn conference, including a clear road map."
"The Commission is also hosting the secretariat of this coalition."
"The coalition has now grown from 66 to 87 members and continues to grow: Ghana joined only this week."
"The Commission intends to present three initiatives at the Bonn conference: first, a communication assessing the state of development of renewable energy in the European Union."
"The communication takes as its starting point the need to address the Union's growing dependence on energy imports – mainly oil and fossil fuels from a few areas of the world – and the need to tackle climate change."
"The promotion of renewable energy has an important part to play in both those areas."
"The communication will evaluate progress made by Member States under the directive on electricity from renewable energy sources. It will report that all Member States have adopted national targets for the share of electricity production from renewable energy sources."
"If Member States achieve their national targets, the share of electricity from renewable energy sources in the EU of 15 should come close to the 22% target of the directive, compared to 14% in 2001."
"However, national policies and measures currently in place will probably achieve only half of the progress necessary, bringing the renewable energy share in electricity production only up to between 18% and 19% in 2010."
"That is a source of concern."
"As regards overall energy consumption, the Union has, since 1997, been working towards the target of a 12% share of renewable energy."
"A couple of years ago the share was only 6%."
"Since that date, in 2001 the Community adopted new legislation in the field of renewable energy and energy efficiency, a directive on electricity from renewable energy sources –covering biofuels, energy performance of buildings, co-generation, etc. The European Parliament and the Council are examining further proposals on eco-design requirements, energy efficiency and energy services."
"However, even if this framework legislation is fully transposed and implemented, the share of renewable energy should still only reach 10% in 2010."
"There will be a need for further action."
"A priority will be the heating sector."
"Through the secretariat of the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition we have launched two key initiatives to support, in particular, the developing country members of the coalition."
"We are developing a global on-line renewable energy policy and measures data base, including reported targets jointly with the renewable energy team of the International Energy Agency."
"To respond to the continuing call for innovative public/private partnerships we are also exploring the feasibility of creating a patient capital fund to encourage participation from international and local financial intermediaries, as well as the international financial institutions."
"The aim is to offer affordable risk capital."
"Both projects will be presented by the Commission at the Bonn conference."
"I should like to clarify some issues about the patient capital initiative, which originates from the commitments made by the European Union to identify and bridge financing gaps and obstacles with respect to renewable energy."
"First of all, it is still only an idea that we are studying."
"A feasibility study has been launched."
"If it is established, that fund would be a type of equity finance that blends public and private sector investment requirements."
"It would provide equity funding in the expectation of a return but on a less demanding basis than pure market private equity capital."
"We are presenting this initiative in a wide range of events and fora and have received positive feedback so far."
"As regards the Bonn conference, the European Preparatory Conference on Renewable Energy was held in January this year."
"That conference considered that the use of overall targets for renewable energy should be extended beyond 2010."
"A number of technical studies suggest that a target of at least 20% of gross domestic consumption from renewable energy in 2020 is economically feasible and achievable for the EU of 25, provided that the right policy environment is created."
"However, it is the view of the Commission that the adoption of an EU target of 2020 is premature at this point in time, as further consultations are necessary."
"Nevertheless my personal opinion is that we should give a clear signal in Bonn that we are ready to set 2020 targets, but that more work is needed on what those targets should be."
"Such a signal is critical if the EU wants to maintain its leadership role within the coalition for renewable energy and in the field of global sustainable development in general."
"The targets set for 2020 are also necessary to give certainty to the fledgling renewable energy industry within the EU and, in particular, to the financial sector. This will help achieve current and future targets."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the International Conference on Renewable Energy and this resolution, which we will vote on next, respond to a need and a general concern to increase energy sources which are clean and sustainable over time."
"The European Union has made considerable progress, but much remains to be done."
"Three years ago, this Parliament approved the Directive on the promotion of renewable electricity sources and, since then, there has been a spectacular increase in the use of such electricity sources."
"The European Union brings together the majority of the world’s installed capacity."
"In 2001, there was 17 000 megawatts of wind power installed."
"Today this figure has doubled."
"This is just one example of a long list of successes which allow us to export innovative technologies respectful of the environment to other countries."
"From now on, we will need to achieve greater efficiency which contributes to better management of energy resources."
"In this regard, I believe that the directives on energy efficiency in buildings and cogeneration will play an important role, as well as the new intelligent energy plan for Europe."
"I would like the 20% referred to in the motion for a resolution to be achieved, but the method that can contribute most to achieving it is unquestionably improving energy efficiency."
"The consumption of fuel for transport generates emissions of polluting gases, the immediate effects of which are suffered in the large urban centres."
"Therefore, the directive for the promotion of biofuels, approved last year, is another of Commissioner de Palacio’s commitments to renewable energies with a view to reducing emissions into the atmosphere."
"We are already seeing some cities incorporating transport systems using biodiesel, bioethanol and hydrogen."
"In some cases they are experimental projects, but in others this technology is a reality within our transport systems."
"These fuels can also be used in mixtures with other conventional fuels in normal cars and, as if this were not enough, hybrid vehicles which operate conventionally and electrically and are the most fuel-efficient are already being marketed."
"The next step must be technology for the large-scale use of hydrogen."
"The Commission has already opened a wide debate on this energy vector which will allow us to use forms of transport without emissions."
"The current legislature is coming to an end, but I am sure that hydrogen will be one of the great subjects of debate in the coming months and all these initiatives can contribute to achieving the most ambitious objectives for renewable energies and, ultimately, for the environment."
"At a time when OPEC has just approved a reduction in oil production, I would like to end today by calling on the Member States to demonstrate sufficient will to promote these renewable technologies which do not pollute and which come from sources which nature provides us with in abundance, since this will benefit everybody."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the International Conference for Renewable Energies is to be held in Bonn at the beginning of June."
"The German Federal Chancellor had announced this conference at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg."
"I regard this conference as a truly important result of this summit, as you yourself, Commissioner, have just said."
"I do think that it was particularly those who had been in Johannesburg who were extremely disappointed by what came out of it with regard to renewable energies."
"Even if, as you just said, we can now welcome the Johannesburg coalition’s first successes, it had not been possible to achieve the goals we had set ourselves there at the time, even though the European Union really did make very serious and very concerted efforts."
"As I see it, this makes it extraordinarily important that this conference in Bonn should be a success."
"You referred, Commissioner, to the European preparatory conference in Berlin, which was held in January, attended by over 650 participants from 45 countries, and made its expectations very clear – not only as regards what it expected of the Bonn conference, but also of the European Union and its policies."
"I think the way in which the European Union has conceived its strategy for the development of renewable energies has been positively exemplary, envisaging the doubling of the share of energy production from renewable sources to 12% – in the case of the electricity sector to 22.1% – by 2010."
"You mentioned our market penetration campaign and our legislation to promote electricity and biofuels."
"It is important to note that we are currently engaged in using the eco-design directive and energy services to build up efficiency, but what is now vital is that we press on with this strategy and step it up."
"I do not actually need to remind you what this is about – the climate change problem, finite resources, the need to reduce our dependence on imports, the creation of jobs in this area."
"I think it is, in the first place, important that we should look beyond 2010 and – although this is where I disagree with you, Commissioner – to set ourselves a new objective."
"The fact is that the Berlin conference did not merely call for a study; it also made it quite plain in its concluding resolutions that 20% was a desirable target for 2020, and you can see that our compromise resolution expects no less than that, namely that the Commission and the Council should have that as their goal and that policies should be framed with it in mind."
"What will in future be important in terms of a more intensive approach will be the devising of new measures to this end."
"Although you have expressed doubts about this, we can see that it is, under certain circumstances, possible to achieve the 22.1% we have set ourselves in the electricity sector; we learn this in particular from the countries with a system of central dispatch."
"It is impossible, or almost impossible, to achieve this in heating and refrigeration, so this is where it will be important to add to EU lawmaking if the overall target of doubling is to be achieved, but also to integrate renewable energies in many of the European Union’s other policy areas, such as structural policy, regional policy, perhaps in the Mediterranean and certainly in development cooperation."
"We know that three billion people around the world are obliged to live without access to electricity, and it is quite crucial in terms of the poverty reduction that we should back something that offers real opportunities of doing this, that being decentralised systems using renewable energies."
"It is for that reason that our resolution makes it very clear that it is necessary to provide for the appropriate measures, and that means that institutions providing funding – such as, among others, the European Investment Bank – must give priority to renewable energies and to energy efficiency."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having only two minutes available to me, I would like to start by saying that I wholeheartedly endorse the arguments that Mrs Rothe has put forward over the last five minutes."
"I will, however, make some observations by way of adding nuances."
"The need to protect the climate and the environment means that renewable energies, which will reduce our dependence on oil and gas, are the form of energy for the twenty-first century; without them, though, even with the development strategy, billions of the world’s people will have no future."
"It is of course a good thing that they will also enable us to create jobs in Europe."
"I have heard this week that Mr Kerry, the Democrat candidate for the American presidency, has announced that the USA, too, intends to derive 20% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020, and this represents a gigantic boom for European industry, as we are the leaders in renewable energy technology, and this will benefit European industry too."
"If the EU is to create security for investment in the energy sector and in others, then it needs long-term climate protection goals, with renewable sources producing at least 60% of energy by 2050 and at least 20% by 2020."
"Today, we have less of a problem with renewable energies themselves – in which we are ahead of the field – than with a strategy for efficiency, in which we lag behind China."
"Yesterday, in the Council, the possibility of coming to an early agreement on the Eco-Design Directive evaporated, as we are no longer able to make ‘win-win’ directives of that sort palatable to the Council, or perhaps also because there is too much lobbying on the part of industry."
"The resolution, which is supported by all the political groups, also makes it plain that the European Investment Bank must play a higher-profile role."
"As things stand today, not even 10% of its loans are made to support renewable energies; as they are the energies of the future, that is another area in which political pressure needs to be exerted."
"– Mr President, it looks very much as if the Kyoto Protocol will not necessarily enter into force."
"Nevertheless, under international law the Kyoto Protocol will be binding on its signatories for several years."
"During this time it cannot be altered, meaning the Kyoto process will remain much too static."
"Climate change, however, is a real threat, and for that reason the action taken to resist it should be seen as tough and dynamic."
"One way is to analyse the EU’s former policies, which in most sectors have already successfully made economic growth independent of any increase in emissions."
"This has come about when the actions have decentralised, forming a variety of effective policies that create a dynamic, and even positive side effects for the environment and society."
"These should now be strengthened and applied to other sectors."
"Above all, this should now be applied globally."
"The Bonn conference will be the first step."
"The United Nations environment programmes should be granted the authority they need and resistance to climate change should be split up into areas of action to promote energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy and clean technology."
"This would also create the dynamic needed for change to take place."
"Such an approach would also give the United States of America and Russia a new opportunity to be involved and participate in action to reduce greenhouse gases."
"Within the framework of the UN clear global structures should be created for the carbon economy and a price for carbon dioxide established, while at the same time there is vigorous promotion of market-based incentives to cut emissions."
"Similarly, the incredible rate at which emissions are increasing in China and India must be cut within the framework of the UN."
"Keeping to the Kyoto targets is vital, but it should be possible to quickly acknowledge the adverse effects of the Kyoto process and control them."
"Otherwise the agreement will go against the aims of sustainable development."
"The EU has shown great courage as a pioneer, but one also has to have courage to admit one’s mistakes, if any have been made."
"With Kyoto it would seem that the biggest mistake concerns carbon leakage, which threatens to come into existence, when production switches to countries unaffected by the Kyoto targets."
"‘The polluter pays’ principle is thus changing to the ‘the polluter is paid’ practice."
"Furthermore, with renewable energy sources there is a danger of slogans going to our heads and of us not being very realistic."
"The investment in research into the promotion of renewables is already excessive, and Parliament is again prepared to increase its minimum share."
"Most renewables still come from large hydroelectric power stations, and people are not ready to add more."
"You cannot push on a cord; you have to pull it, as the Finnish saying goes."
"Investment in research will not help any more, but global demand would."
"That is why we must do our best at Bonn to draw people’s attention to the issue of global demand."
"– Mr President, you may well be surprised to hear me say that, in 25 years’ time, we will be able to derive every bit as much energy from a cubic centimetre of silicon as from a cubic centimetre of uranium, but that is the case – it surprised me, too – and it highlights the enormous potential latent in renewable energies."
"My second comment has to do with the Bonn conference;"
"I would like to suggest that we in this House should also send a delegation to represent us at it, as a whole array of legislatures from around the world will be doing."
"It would be a disgrace for the European Parliament not to have a visible presence there in the shape of a group of MEPs with an official mandate."
"Thirdly, let me say that, in the resolution – to which Mrs Rothe very rightly referred – the term ‘poverty reduction’ occurs twice."
"I see it as extremely important that we should make the connection between climate policy, energy policy and poverty reduction."
"For example, the instrument for doing this – or at least one of those that are suitable – is decentralised energy supply systems using renewable energies and another instrument that we are at present discussing in this House, that is, emissions trading, what is termed the Linking Directive."
"We can be grateful to the Commission for having, some time ago, brought out a very interesting brochure in which it set out the means that could be employed in this way to benefit the renewable energy sector in the Mediterranean region alone."
"The figures quoted in it are extraordinarily high."
"I think this is an instrument of which we could make much more use."
"After all, we have to finance renewable energies, and we all know that they do not come cheap."
"My final observation must be that what rather worries me about renewable energies is that they are currently going through an upward phase."
"They are on everyone’s lips, renewable energies get good write-ups in the press, and rightly so too."
"Who knows, though, what will happen in a couple of years’ time, when the costs go up?"
"Will they be just as acceptable, or will we perhaps come to the conclusion that you can have too much of a good thing, and decide cut back a bit?"
"To do so would be extraordinarily dangerous, for it would inhibit continuity in a sector that forms part of our industrial policy."
"What this boils down to is that we need continuity, and the small- and medium-sized enterprises that have invested in renewable energy sources need security."
"Yes, costs are falling, but they are, nonetheless, relatively high."
"I am perfectly familiar with the debates in my own country about the costs of renewable energies."
"In Germany alone, it is estimated that they will cost us between EUR 4 billion and EUR 5 billion in a couple of years’ time."
"It may well indeed be that many will see this as a pain barrier through which they do not want to go."
"I just want to warn that continuity should be maintained rather than broken if those who invest in them today are to have security."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was present at the meeting in Johannesburg."
"I both experienced and shared the disappointment that the EU delegation, above all, felt about the fact that we did not get further with the establishing a global objective for renewable energy."
"We turned the meeting to as best account as we could achieve at the time."
"I myself have taken a very active interest in bringing together those who wish to work with clear goals and dates in the matter of how to achieve a greater proportion of renewable energy."
"The impending meeting in Bonn will, of course, be of great significance."
"Above all, we will be able to share experience and knowledge there on how we can best support the development of renewable energy by political means."
"During today’s debate we have heard some of the best arguments for why this is necessary, including the argument regarding climate change."
"Mr Turmes listed all our convincing arguments in favour of the need to invest in renewable energy."
"We have discussed some of the most important tools."
"I am the first to admit that, by explaining in Bonn that we are prepared to think slightly more long term, that is to say up to 2020, and that we wish to set such a goal, we should be sending out an important signal."
"In the enlarged European Union, we will, however, need a little more time to discuss in more detail how this goal should be established and at what level it should be set."
"I wish to state that there is a misunderstanding among some of the Members regarding the current situation relating to the Kyoto Protocol."
"The situation is not as a number of people think, that is that we have a complete stalemate."
"All the countries that have now ratified the Kyoto Protocol are in fact doing very important and practical work to implement the Protocol."
"This is because most of these countries, particularly the poor ones, are already affected by climate change."
"They realise that the effects of climate change will only get worse if they do not deal with the problem now."
"Important work has therefore already been got under way."
"We are not alone in taking action."
"All over the world, people have begun to realise that the threat of climate change is so great that we need to take action right away."
"The assertion that renewable energy could become more expensive is wrong."
"On the contrary, it will become cheaper."
"Think of the development regarding fossil fuels."
"We have seen just recently how expensive oil has become."
"It will become more profitable to invest in renewable energy."
"This is especially true if we also take the fossil fuel subsidies out of the equation."
"We should also be completely clear about the fact that the market for renewable energy already represents great economic value."
"It is European companies that are today responsible for 90% of the world market in equipment."
"We are very competitive, a fact that has created thousands of jobs in Europe."
"This development will continue."
"Wind energy alone has increased from 5GW (gigawatts) in 1997 to 27GW in 2003."
"Huge development is taking place in this sector."
"It is not at all the case that this area is standing still, or that not enough is happening."
"An enormous amount is happening, and the potential is fantastic."
"We must make use of these facts as arguments during our meeting in Bonn."
"We must make sure that, in the future too, we are world leaders in the area of renewable energy."
"This is something from which we shall all gain."
"Mr Posselt has the floor for a point of order."
"– Mr President, I will be very brief, but this is important."
"Firstly, I wish to protest against the dropping of today’s debates on matters of topical and urgent importance, Tuesday’s question times and the debate on the cultural capital of Europe, even though enough time was available for them."
"Secondly, I wish to make a personal statement on behalf of what has been called the Friday Club."
"I am grateful to the Members who are present for doing their duty right into the evening."
"They used to do it right through to Friday lunchtime, until that was no longer possible."
"It is monstrous that there should be someone in this House who is attempting to make criminals of these Members, of all people, who are performing their duties in an exemplary manner."
"I will be working here this evening on behalf of those whom I represent, and will be doing so until tomorrow lunchtime."
"That I affirm; I believe it to be our duty."
"I rejoice to see all those here who are doing their duty rather than going about defaming and discrediting this House."
"Thank you very much, Mr Posselt."
"We take very good note of your commitment to parliamentary work and to the electors."
"To end this debate, I have received 5 motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1)."
"The vote will take place in a few minutes time.(2)"
"– Mr President, if you had had to be driven around this week by the so-called car service, I am sure you too would be boiling over with rage."
"What goes on in the depths of this House, particularly in the evenings, is a scandal."
"A group of us had to wait, in gusts of wind, up to 40 minutes for a car from the so-called car service."
"I am not blaming the drivers, who do a quite outstanding job of work, but responsibility for this must surely rest with some official or other, some manager in the administration, who took 17 cars out of service for this week."
"For how much longer are we MEPs supposed to put up with this intolerable humiliation by officials of this House?"
"I ask you to ensure that the service is organised on more MEP-friendly lines without delay."
"If you want an example of a good car service, then let me, as a German Member, advise you to look to Berlin, where the car service really is worthy of the name and provides a service for the Members’ benefit."
"Mr Knolle, we take good note of what you say."
"We will look towards Berlin and, above all, towards this Parliament."
"I can assure you that the Bureau has taken note of these problems and we have no doubt that they will be resolved appropriately."
"We shall proceed to the vote on:"
"(1)"
"Parliament has come to the end of its agenda.(1)"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 1 April 2004."
"It is my sad duty today to mark the cowardly murder at the hands of terrorists in Iraq of the Italian citizen, Mr Fabrizio Quattrocchi."
"I want to say, on behalf of the European Parliament, that we unreservedly condemn this despicable crime and we express our feelings of deepest sympathy and condolence to the family of the victim and to the Italian people and government."
"We appeal from this House to the kidnappers – in so many places now in Iraq – immediately to free all hostages still in captivity."
"This is not serving the ends of handing Iraq back to the Iraqi people in terms sustainable for any of the parties involved."
"I ask you please to observe a minute's silence."
"– Mr President unspecified allegations of misconduct made about me and about some of my colleagues are appearing in the German press."
"This is something we have already discussed in this House."
"Unfortunately, it is not my work to which these reports refer; instead, there are only allegations to the effect that there is something objectionable about my behaviour, but as I am unable to ascertain what I am being accused of, I ask you, Mr President, to investigate further."
"It is also stated in the German media that you are to meet a certain Member this week and that the Member in question will then hand over certain lists to you."
"If this is the case, Mr President, I ask you to find out at once whether there is anything of which my colleagues or I might be accused."
"If there is, then I ask that you forward all the documents, at once, to the European Court of Justice or to the Court of Auditors and to OLAF."
"It would of course be good of you to inform those against whom the media are making what are really very nasty, dirty and unpleasant accusations, of what precisely they are being accused – that is, of whether they have been bad at their jobs or have broken the law."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt, I find it extremely unfortunate that you should have to defend yourself, as someone with very good standing in this House, precisely with regard to what you are elected to do and the leadership you give in your committee and in so many different aspects of the work of this House."
"As you will know from my statement at the last part-session, I have invited a Member of this House, who has been prominent in the German-speaking print and broadcast media, to forward to me whatever specific allegations there are so that I can fulfil my duty of care to this institution and to its Members and their reputation."
"I have as yet received nothing in writing."
"I have had no telephone call, no e-mail, and although I too am informed via the press of various intentions, no one has had the courtesy to inform me personally of what those are."
"You speak of meetings that are not in fact on my work schedule because no one has requested such meetings."
"I regret to say that, in these circumstances, it becomes impossible for the House, and for me in respect of my duty of care both to the House and to its Members, to act in any reasonable or fair way when, as far as I can understand, all we have are significant yet unsubstantiated general allegations concerning the Rules of Procedure, as distinct from allegations concerning persons whose responsibility it is to follow those Rules."
"I would appeal, as I did last month, to those who have evidence of any wrongdoings to provide me with evidence, to release me to do my duty before this House, its Members and the European public."
"Please stop boxing in the shadows: come out into the open and let me deal transparently with substantive and transparent allegations."
"– Mr President, I am very grateful to you for what you have just said."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt spoke on the substance of the allegations of misuse of funds by Members of this House, and then you made your own contribution."
"I just want to remind the House of how these accusations came to be made over the past three years; the Member to whom reference has been made used a concealed camera to spy on Members as they went about their work."
"In so doing, he violated all the rules of honesty, trust and collegiality."
"I cannot see the European Parliament meekly accepting this sort of thing without a word of criticism."
"It is not individuals who suffer, but the House as a whole, when this sort of espionage is used to investigate the work we do."
"I would ask you to condemn this unequivocally in the interests of all Members of this House."
"The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 15 April 2004 has been distributed."
"Are there any comments?(1)"
"Mr President, I refer to the Boogerd-Quaak report for which, moreover, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has been convened today for 7 p.m."
"Before Easter, Mr President, I wrote to you to submit a series of points that, from a procedural and regulatory point of view, do not seem to me to be in line with our Rules of Procedure."
"I cited your responsibility as President, pursuant to Rule 19(2) on checking the conformity of reports with our Rules of Procedure."
"Specifically – and here I am also speaking on behalf of Mr Gemelli, who could not be here today but who I know wrote to you last week – the Committee on Petitions was not even consulted, that is to say it was not asked for an opinion on the report."
"We are clear about the lack of a legal basis and yet we have a genuinely unique situation whereby significant reference is being made, in this report, to a study document drawn up by a third party not authorised according to the standard procedures for our Parliament."
"It is a document which, moreover, claims to be entirely provisional since the situation has only been examined in eight out of 25 countries and since the comparisons that are due to be carried out at the end of June have not been completed."
"This is why, Mr President, I wonder how this report can be debated in this sitting and I ask you, therefore, to refer it back to the competent committee in order that the Committee on Petitions can make its substantial contribution."
"I would like to mention that this is not a responsibility of the House."
"Checking the appropriateness according to the Rules of Procedure is the responsibility of the person presiding over the institution, and is not in any way subject to a majority vote."
"You understand that at the basis of democracy, and even more so for a Parliament that is the ultimate embodiment of democracy, it is inconceivable that obligations provided for by the Rules of Procedure should be avoided by using majority voting."
"Thank you for your comments, Mr Podestà."
"You will be aware from our meeting of the Conference of Presidents last week – which you attended – that I have asked the services to undertake to review your very detailed correspondence with me regarding the Rules of Procedure and their application."
"Since my arrival here today – a journey which always takes some time, in spite of early departure – I have not had the opportunity to see a note on this matter that has been prepared for the meeting of the relevant committee this evening."
"I am not in a position at this moment to give a ruling on admissibility."
"However, the initial advice I have received – before the services have had an opportunity to study your lengthy letter to me in depth – seems to suggest that the report may be admissible, although there are elements that need to be looked at carefully."
"We have asked the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to meet this evening to consider the issues raised by the Rules-related observations you have made, and to consider around 350 amendments."
"I want to make it perfectly clear that under the Rules we do not have time this week to take a report with that number of amendments."
"That is why I for one want the committee to meet and consider the issue."
"If I have understood correctly, you have asked for a referral back to committee and therefore a removal of this item from the agenda."
"If that is indeed your request then I will take one speaker for and one against and we would then have a vote."
"However, Mr Podestà, if you are prepared to wait for the committee to meet this evening to consider the question as it relates to the Rules and admissibility, and to consider the question of the number of amendments, then we could proceed to invite our colleagues on the committee to discuss those issues later today."
"Mr Podestà, do you now wish to make a request to refer back, or are you satisfied that this should be dealt with today in committee?"
"I agree with you, Mr President."
"I believe that it is appropriate for the committee to consider the issue, but above all – and I am also saying this on behalf of my colleague Mr Gemelli – for replies to be given based on your assessment, Mr President, on the strength of the details that the services will provide you with."
"I shall do that in writing once I have received definitive advice."
"I must compliment you on your thorough understanding of our Rules of Procedure: it is so much more thorough than my own knowledge and thus I am badly in need of advice on this matter!"
"Mr President, given that you will have to carry out this important check, my request is that this is done with the utmost respect for the wishes of the competent committee; indeed we have already had huge problems concerning the tabling office, not least over a report – by my colleague Mr Voggenhuber – which is to be debated soon."
"On the issue of discretion and of the admissibility of subjects, I therefore genuinely appeal to you to carefully consider the political will expressed by the committee responsible, after a complicated debate."
"I would also like to say that, as far as the number of amendments is concerned, the great majority of these come from one political group: I therefore wonder whether this political group is resorting to stonewalling, something that we will deal with today."
"Mr President, I have to say that I was, as rapporteur, extremely surprised at the 350 amendments in the plenary meeting, whereas we in the committee had an excellent discussion with far fewer amendments than there are now."
"Nevertheless, I have read the amendments and this evening, we in the relevant committee will see what we can do with them all and make sure that an opinion is brought before Parliament."
"I am, however, extremely taken aback by the fact that we in the plenary meeting appear to be doing the work now that has not been done in the relevant committee."
"I should also like to note that there is Europe-wide support for the content of this report."
"If you feel that there are sections that do not comply with the Rules of Procedure, then I should like to hear from you, in which case we can still, if necessary, withdraw the sections concerned."
"This is, in principle, an excellent report, at least according to its supporters and detractors in the media world."
"I therefore fail to understand why we should withdraw it now for reasons of this kind."
"I should like to have this issue resolved and heard beforehand."
"Several other colleagues have asked to speak but I do not want to replace the work the committee will do on our behalf this evening."
"If any additional points of procedure arise from the committee's work this evening, we will have to deal with them later."
"I would now like to close on this issue and assure the rapporteur and the committee that they will be the first in this House to receive whatever advice is available to me regarding the Rules of Procedure in respect of this matter."
"We will evaluate the advice of the committee as to how we should proceed."
"For now, then, let us refer the work to the committee for its meeting tonight and see what emerges from that."
"Mr Fiori, I thought that we were simply inviting the committee to look again at the Boogerd-Quaak report."
"If, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, you insist formally to refer the report back to committee, I can take one speaker for and one against and we could have a vote."
"Mr President, the claims made by Mr Podestà and Mr Fiori seem to me to be totally unfounded."
"They claim that the Rules of Procedure have been breached because the Committee on Petitions did not give its opinion."
"This is a completely unfounded allegation."
"The same Committee on Petitions sent us the first petition pursuant to Article 7 of the Treaty so that we could look into it."
"The Conference of Presidents authorised the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to draw up this initiative report: it is a political report and not a legislative one."
"We were sent two further petitions for information, but we are not deciding on these."
"We decide independently and the committees to be consulted were determined by the Conference of Presidents, which called on the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to carry out this report."
"It said, ‘Draw up this report and listen to committees x, y and z,’ not the Committee on Petitions."
"At most this will be about withdrawing approval of these petitions that were sent inappropriately but no mistake has been made in terms of the Rules of Procedure; and I believe that the Presidency could assess this without needing to refer anything back to committee."
"The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs was simply appointed, pursuant to Rule 130a of the Rules of Procedure, to check something that is obvious: to see if a tenth of committee Members support each of the 330 amendments tabled with the intention of stonewalling."
"Clearly, since they were tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the amendments will have the support of a tenth of the Members and, therefore, having carried out this check, we will have fulfilled the task given to us by the President."
"Mr Fiori, I have been looking at Rule 144 on referral back to committee."
"Let me explain that you are within your rights to move a referral back to committee, but I should have been notified 24 hours in advance."
"That was not the case, so you have forfeited that right today."
"If you wish, you have the right to move referral back when we come to vote on the report, if indeed we get there this week, and if the committee prepares the way tonight."
"So you do not lose the opportunity to refer the report back, but you have forfeited it at this particular time."
"The committee will meet at 7 p.m. this evening and will hopefully bring some light, as well as some heat, to the matter when we return to it."
"I have received a request from the GUE/NGL Group to include on Tuesday's agenda the report (A5-0274/2004) by Mrs Eriksson, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, on the consequences of the sex industry in the European Union."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I understand that the Conference of Presidents has decided to remove this report, previously considered by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"This was at the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who argued dishonestly that the report should be referred back to committee."
"The committee has had its last meeting and, since I am not standing again, a referral would sound the death knell for this own-initiative report."
"The report deals with the demand side of such issues as trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation."
"If Parliament does not discuss the report and place that aspect in context, I do not see the reason for discussing sexual exploitation at all."
"I therefore call for the report to be returned to the agenda as previously planned pursuant to Rule 111 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I should like to support Mrs Eriksson’s request for three reasons."
"Firstly, as she has said, this is our last chance to examine this report."
"If it does not appear on this session’s agenda, it will lapse."
"The second reason is that it has given rise to a considerable amount of work in committee."
"We are all aware that it has been the subject of many disagreements, but the committee has succeeded in finding a compromise."
"Everything is therefore ready and I think that it is only fair to ensure that all the work which has been done receives a favourable outcome."
"Finally, this is a social issue which is very sensitive in many countries."
"We may be in favour of this report, we may be against it, or we may want to amend it, but I believe that the worst thing we could do would be to give the impression that we are unwilling to deal with this subject."
"That is why, Mr President, I should like to insist, on behalf of our group, even though I am aware that the agenda is relatively crowded, that this question should be included in the agenda for this part-session."
"– Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that, much as we could endorse a lot of what is in it, this report is, as a whole, unbalanced; parts of it make no sense and contradict each other, and everything is repeated time and time again."
"I do ask most earnestly that we should distance ourselves from this report and, in the autumn, get back to the important things it contains, which, I believe, merit really in-depth, serious and proper consideration."
"– I have received a request from the PPE-DE Group for a Commission statement on Eurostat, with motions for resolution, to be included in the joint debate on the 2002 discharges."
"– Mr President, we have, over many weeks and months, been devoting our attention to Eurostat, and you will be well aware that a substantial number of us here in this House even wanted to go as far as to state that it had no confidence in the Commission."
"Although I have always been opposed to a vote of no confidence in the Commission, this House does have a legitimate interest in hearing what the Commission has to say on the subject and how it assesses what went on at Eurostat."
"Our listening to the Commission’s statement, and our discussion of it, is a sign of fairness, openness and transparency."
"– Mr President, politicians are always extremely adept, when elections are in the offing, at finding ways of putting Parliament’s procedures to work in the service of their own election campaigns."
"Let me remind Mr Poettering that we will, as part of tomorrow’s discharge debate, be discussing a report by a member of his group, Mr Bayona de Perogordo, which contains a whole passage on Eurostat."
"I would also like to remind him that all of us in this House do of course expect the Commission to comment on it tomorrow."
"I do not think it makes any sense to impose on Parliament a procedure that is intended solely to promote harmony within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats after the British Tories failed to get enough signatures for a motion of no confidence in the Commission."
"Many of the tricks that are used to provide grist to the mills of the election campaigns are too obvious not to be noticed, and, having noticed them, we have to vote against them."
"(2)"
"I have received a request from the Verts/ALE Group for Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East."
"Mr President, this session is particularly complicated but unfortunately the world is also complicated."
"Our role as the ‘eye of the international community’ means that we must be thereand opine on the bloody events that are taking place in the Middle East, because the European Union, represented by its Member States, is not capable of doing so incisively and forcefully enough."
"We are calling for this statement on the Middle East to be put on the agenda, because we want to know how the Council and the Commission will act in a situation in which – and there is no doubt about this – there are governments that continue to pour oil on the fire in order to influence this conflict."
"I would also like to draw your attention, Mr President, to the fact that we recently adopted a resolution on this matter, and one paragraph in particular in which we call on the Council and the Commission to take into consideration the possibility of acting to enforce Article 2 of the Association Agreement with Israel, if the latter continues to carry out the policy of extrajudicial killings."
"We believe that, at this point in time, it is worth opening a debate in Parliament and making a decision, but above all it is worth hearing what the Commission and Council have to say to us."
"– Mr President, I think this does indeed represent a very significant change in, or clarification of, the American position, and a position of this sort can indeed drive a new wedge between the United States and Europe."
"That is why it is important that the issue should be discussed."
"If it is argued that there is too little time available, then it could, of course, be combined with discussion of trans-Atlantic relations, in which the Middle East presents a major political problem."
"The fact that there are, of course, others is no excuse; if it really comes to it, it could be discussed along with trans-Atlantic relations, although this is an important issue and any statement would have to address it separately."
"As you know, we will have debates on Cyprus and transatlantic relations that day."
"Those debates may run over into Question Time."
"I should like to signal that, because Cyprus needs a space on our agenda."
"Indeed, apart from the Middle East there are many transatlantic issues that also need their space."
"So I point out to you that exceptionally, on this occasion – and I extend my apologies to Mr Posselt in advance, as well as to Mr Puerta, our Vice-President who keeps telling us not to do these things – we may run over into Question Time.(3)"
"On April 14 2004 I received a letter from Mr Gargani, in his role as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in which, at the request of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, he informed me that the Legal Affairs Committee recommends the introduction before the European Court of Justice of a request for an opinion in order for the Court to examine whether the object of an agreement between the European Union and the United States for the treatment and transfer of data – PNR – is compatible with the Treaty, and to establish whether the content of the agreement could put at risk the fundamental right to data protection accorded by the Treaty and by various European directives."
"As you know, the House will discuss the Boogerd-Quaak report on the EC-USA agreement on PNR issues tomorrow evening."
"I do not wish to have that debate now."
"The reason I wish to consult the House at this moment is that our Rules of Procedure are clear: if I follow the advice of the Legal Affairs Committee, I act as a kind of postman through whom the request passes to the Court of Justice."
"It seems to me, given the issues involved, that it would be useful for me to benefit from the advice and guidance of the House."
"Therefore, under the Rules of Procedure, I had thought it better to pause for thought and to raise the matter at the opening of business today to hear a brief statement from the Commission and from the Groups, and then to ask the Groups tomorrow at midday to advise me as to whether to proceed in bringing the matter before the Court."
"I ask Commissioner Bolkestein, who has been waiting here patiently as we arranged our business, to give a brief announcement concerning this aspect of the matter."
". Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor on this much-debated subject."
"The question that has been put to the Commission is a precise one: is the Commission prepared to withdraw its proposal to the Council to conclude an international agreement with the United States of America on the processing and transfer of passenger name record data by air carriers to the US?"
"The context in which this question is asked is also clear."
"If the Commission does not indicate its willingness to follow Parliament's wish expressed in its Resolution of 31 March – namely to replace the present 'light' agreement and adequacy finding with a more substantive international agreement – Parliament will vote to seek an opinion from the European Court of Justice on the legality of the agreement currently before the House."
"The Commission is grateful for this opportunity to state its position in advance of the vote."
"In this context, I understand that Parliament seeks answers from the Commission on two issues."
"Firstly, Parliament wishes to know whether or not the proposed international agreement modifies the Data Protection Directive as far as data exchange with the United States is concerned, and, therefore, whether or not the agreement is well founded as far as both the protection of fundamental rights and the European Parliament's prerogatives are concerned."
"Secondly, Parliament wants the Commission to clarify the situation regarding data transfers by the United States to third country governments."
"On the first point, the Commission does not consider that the international agreement amends the Data Protection Directive and, therefore, there is no ground for basing it on the second subparagraph of Article 300(3) of the Treaty."
"If the agreement had amended the directive, the Commission would have proposed a different legal basis for the agreement and would have sought the assent of Parliament."
"But, I repeat, in our view, the agreement does not amend the directive."
"The agreement leaves the protection afforded by the directive unchanged; in particular the proportionality requirement and the need for personal data to be processed fairly and lawfully."
"However, the international agreement is necessary to ensure a legitimate basis for air carriers and computer reservation systems to process the PNR data as asked for by the United States, insofar as they are covered by the adequacy finding."
"Beyond that, the international agreement contains a number of important guarantees for the European Union; notably US commitments regarding non-discrimination and reciprocity and a joint EU-US review of the implementation of the agreement."
"With regard to the second point concerning transfers to third countries, this is a new issue which came up in our talks with the United States only relatively recently."
"It concerns the safeguards that apply to the sharing by the United States of PNR data with law enforcement authorities in third countries."
"As I drew to the attention of the House in my statement of 29 March, the Commission is still holding discussions with the United States on this point."
"In fact they have been continuing today and will continue further."
"I understand that the House would welcome further information on this point."
"In particular, the rapporteur raised the question of whether the Commission had come to a firm conclusion that there is adequate protection or whether these further talks meant that this question remained open."
"Our discussions with the United States on third country transfers have not yet been concluded."
"As I said earlier, they have been going on today and may continue tomorrow morning."
"Therefore, I cannot inform Parliament at this moment of the outcome in the required detail."
"Currently, Director-General Alex Schaub of the Directorate General for the Internal Market is, with his staff, negotiating this issue with the American side."
"These talks are not designed to bring about any changes in the documents you have seen, but rather to clarify how the undertakings will be applied in the case of the transfer of PNR data to other countries."
"They will seek to ensure, in particular, that the purpose limitation agreed in paragraph 3 of the undertakings is respected, even when data is passed on to third countries."
"Of course, the Commission is pushing the United States for guarantees that are as strong as possible."
"This issue will be discussed at the meeting of the College of Commissioners tomorrow afternoon."
"My colleague Chris Patten will be addressing this House tomorrow evening on the international agreement."
"He will inform the House on the outcome of the discussions with the United States, and of any relevant developments."
"It seems to me, therefore, that it would be best for Mr Patten to inform the House following the Commission meeting tomorrow afternoon and then for the House to decide as it thinks best."
"I would now like to hear the Groups' assessments on the matter of referral to the Court."
"This may well be informed by what the Commissioner has just said, but I should like to remind you that the full debate on PNR will take place tomorrow."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, where this issue of an appeal to the European Court of Justice is concerned, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is being entirely pragmatic in its approach."
"What concerns us is that failure to come to the sort of agreement that the Commissioner has described will lead to a great deal of inconvenience for EU citizens travelling to the USA."
"If the Americans do not get by this route the information they require, they will obtain it by other means, whether this involves questioning at the border, mandatory visas or interviews in Consulates-General."
"Secondly, if we do not get this agreement, our citizens will be in no better a legal position as regards data protection; indeed, they will be in a worse one, because we will have no influence whatever on what the Americans do with the data they obtain."
"With this in mind, we are grateful to the Commission for its efforts, and have, as a group, expressed our opposition to an appeal to the Court of Justice not only in the course of the debate in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, but also in the resolution of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Mr President, for more than a year, a majority in this Parliament – although the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are of the opposite opinion – has claimed that it is a serious violation of the fundamental right of European citizens to data protection to demand that all European airlines are obliged to process European citizens’ data contained in their computerised reservation systems as requested by the United States Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and in line with US legislation."
"On top of that, there is not even any US legislation since no US law exists to protect private data."
"We are therefore obliged to process our data, the data of our citizens, as requested by an administrative body of a third country."
"We therefore want an international agreement that grants rights."
"This controversy has been going on for a year and the Commission, even now, repeatedly says that the directive has not been amended, but on this basis it has been breached."
"This is the opinion of the majority of Parliament."
"This is why we are calling for a preliminary decision by the Court of Justice."
"I do not even believe that we need wait for further news tomorrow because, I reiterate, we have carried on for a year or more."
"The only way to solve the matter – as to if it is true or if it is not true that a right in the Treaty has been breached – is to ask the Court of Justice for a ruling in advance, before signing the agreement, so that we do not end up nullifying an agreement that has already been drawn up, since this would damage relations."
"Mr President, on behalf of the ELDR Group I would like to congratulate the Commission, and Commissioner Bolkestein in particular, on his efforts to try to reach agreement with the United States on such a difficult matter."
"My Group regrets that he has not been more successful in persuading the United States to respect our concerns about data privacy."
"My Group cannot agree on the choice of legal basis."
"While, as Mr Bolkestein says, the agreement does not formally amend our data protection directive, it clearly amends the law as it applies to European Community citizens by making us subject to US law in this area, and the absence of protection in US law is precisely our concern."
"There is a huge democratic deficit when the Commission comes forward with a proposal like this and does not give either the European Parliament or national parliaments the chance to say yes or no."
"Now, as Mr Bolkestein informs us, that the information being passed to the United States' authorities may be passed on to third country authorities, we should be seriously concerned."
"There have been three debates and votes in this House on the matter."
"Three committees have examined it and all recommended a referral to the Court of Justice."
"My Group does not seek a dispute with the Commission."
"We have asked the Commission to withdraw this proposal and to try to negotiate with the Americans and present to us and the US Congress a full-blown international agreement to cover these issues so that we can effectively fight terrorism together while respecting our commitments to data privacy."
"We would prefer the Commission to do that, but if the Commission cannot do it, perhaps at least at its meeting tomorrow the Commission could agree to take the initiative in referring the matter to the Court of Justice to decide whether there is adequacy."
"Mr President, I do not want to repeat all the things that my fellow Members who spoke before me have already expressed very well."
"On many occasions, the Commission has said that this is the best agreement that it could extract from the United States Government, but it must be said that, the more debates we have, the worse the situation gets for European citizens."
"Indeed, today we know that this agreement not only implies a violation of the Treaties, but even the possibility that these data will be transferred to a third country and will be processed by them, which thus made it more difficult to get the debate on the first part of the agreement under way."
"As has already been said, this Parliament has often said that it is against this agreement."
"Of course, it has not specifically voted on resorting to the Court of Justice but this, in my opinion, is a necessary consequence."
"We are therefore calling for Parliament to be able to take the opinion of a third, much respected and authoritative authority, such as the Court of Justice, and thus be able to freely decide whether to say yes or no to this agreement."
"Mr President, I do not wish to repeat what has already been said either, since my group endorses what Mr Watson, Mrs Paciotti and Mr Di Lello Finuoli said."
"We agree that we should continue along our path, because I do not believe that Commissioner Bolkestein’s words are satisfactory and, indeed, I am also a little surprised by his lack of consideration for a vote, so unusual for Parliament, such as the one which took place at the last part-session."
"It is indisputable, Commissioner Bolkestein, that by not entering into a real international agreement with the United States, the Commission has chosen to bypass Parliament’s opinion."
"The fact that you have opted for soft law instead of a real agreement already speaks volumes about the Commission’s intentions to exclude democratic control of this agreement, and I find this particularly worrying."
"We do not seek a dispute with you – if, however, you are determined to force it on us then we will have no option but to fight it – but we believe that it is extremely important to seek the opinion of the Court of Justice."
"Your announcement, Commissioner, was not enough to prevent us doing so and we think that this stand will also be useful for the Commission so that, in the future, it will not commit these mistakes at the expense of the citizens."
". Mr President, I have to say that I am not very happy about the Commissioner’s remark that there is no violation of Regulation 95/46."
"Paragraph 4 of the agreement itself states that all data of European passengers will be processed according to US constitutional requirements."
"One of the laws in the United States that should apply is the Privacy Act, but this Act does not apply to people from third countries, to name but one example."
"Article 6 of the agreement states that there will be reciprocity insofar as feasible and that it shall be strictly applied."
"I do not want to have the debate now, but I can easily give you another ten examples of things that are not right and are, in my view, a violation of our privacy legislation."
"For that reason alone, we should put this matter to the Court."
"In the previous debate, the Commissioner said, with regard to the passing on of data to third parties, that ‘we are still in negotiation with the United States’."
"I heard this correctly last time and also this time round."
"It is surely too crazy for words that I as rapporteur have to submit to this House a report on adequacy finding,while the Commission itself still holds the view that the whole matter was inadequate."
"This is something I really do want to bring in to the debate."
"I should like to thank all those Members who have spoken out in favour of recourse to the Court."
"I think that the question to the Court, as to whether we can conclude international agreements in which both Parliament and the American Congress are placed offside, is a very interesting one indeed."
"In consultations with members of the Congress, I have been given to understand that, should such an agreement be put to the American Congress, it would never agree to it."
"We in this House should now also demonstrate that we know how to stand up for our citizens and not be put under pressure by anybody."
"We are alone in being able to do this."
"I am therefore hopeful that Parliament will follow the line taken by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
". Mr President, we have, of course, already debated in depth all aspects of the agreement with the United States on the treatment of the personal data of passengers travelling to that country from EU territory."
"The request for the prior opinion of the Court of Justice, as Mr Lehne, from my own political group has quite rightly said, will only postpone the signing of the agreement and leave a legal vacuum in place in relation to the treatment of personal data by the US authorities, seriously prejudicing the European public and the air carriers themselves."
"It is not, therefore, necessary to repeat our position, which is already well known."
"We also believe, naturally, that this agreement can be improved but also that the fight against terrorism and cooperation with third countries in the field, with the United States in this case, is a priority for the European Union."
"Furthermore, Mr President, we need the agreement now and, in any event, there will always be the possibility of referring the matter to the Court of Justice at a later date."
"I would also like, Mr President, to take up Commissioner Bolkestein’s proposal that we listen to what Commissioner Patten says to us tomorrow afternoon with regard to the agreement and delay the vote scheduled for tomorrow morning."
"I would ask that this request be considered, since I believe it to be very reasonable, and, in any event, I would ask that the vote we were going to hold tomorrow on prior referral to the Court of Justice be delayed until the day after tomorrow, when we have heard the Commission’s speech."
"I thank all colleagues who have contributed to that exchange of views."
"A number of you have remarked how several different committees and resolutions over recent weeks and months have indicated the probability of going to the Court of Justice, of which I have been aware as I have keenly followed the issue."
"However, the event which triggered the referral to the Court was the letter of last Wednesday afternoon, which I received from Mr Gargani on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"This is the first time I have had the duty and opportunity, as President, to look into the question."
"In light of the exchange of views, I propose that we proceed to the debate in substance tomorrow."
"We will hear what Commissioner Patten has to say, along with the opinions of different colleagues."
"In the light of all the available information, the vote will take place at noon on Wednesday."
"That brings us to within 24 hours of our ultimate deadline in terms of our right to refer to the Court, so we are still working within the time limits that apply here."
"Because of the volume of business this week, we have added an extra sitting tonight."
"I suggest that those colleagues who wish to make a 'one-minute speech' submit what they wanted to say in writing, and I will try to follow up on their comments."
"For anyone who insists on speaking, the Rules provide that the item can be taken later in the sitting."
"I therefore propose to take the item at the end of business this evening, rather than at this stage.(1)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0227/2004) by Johannes Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on respect for and promotion of the values on which the Union is based."
". – Thank you, Mr President; ladies and gentlemen, it may perhaps be said that the earlier debates on Mrs Boogerd-Quaak’s reports on the freedom of the media and the exchange of airline passenger information have dramatically demonstrated how important it is to prepare for crises in good time, how difficult it actually can be to defend our Union’s core values when under great pressure and in crisis situations, and how important it is that we should arrive at common principles and procedures."
"That is why I am glad that the committee accepted by an overwhelming majority the report on respect for, and promotion of, the values on which the Union is based, which I am presenting to you today."
"In doing this, Members belonging to all the political groups signalled their unanimous determination to defend fundamental values and the Union’s principles of democracy and of the rule of law, values against which international terrorism has declared itself to be targeted, but which can lead to conflict in combating that same terrorism, that are also jeopardised by rising xenophobia, by racism and anti-Semitism in Europe, as well as by political extremism."
"It makes no sense to close your eyes to it;"
"I believe instead that the times demand that we prepare ourselves for it."
"I am grateful to the Commission for, by its communication, making an essential contribution to the dialogue between the institutions and to close cooperation between them, which I regard as indispensable where the application of Article 7(1) and (2) is concerned."
"Although the rapporteur and the committee both had criticisms to make of the Commission communication, I do believe that we have, today, been able to make a number of proposals as to how this position might be further developed."
"It appeared both to me and to the committee that a higher level of protection than that proposed by the Commission was indispensable, especially in drawing a distinction between a clear risk under Article 7(1) and a serious breach, as was, in our view, the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Constitution."
"Although the acceptance of this by all the institutions and the governments of the Member States does not make it binding in law, it is binding in a political sense, so that decisions taken by reference to Article 7 are discretionary and political, and can therefore be taken only on the basis of it and in full accord with it."
"The committee was rather disconcerted – as indeed was I myself – by the lack of appreciation of Parliament’s particular responsibilities, which are virtually absent from the Commission communication."
"According to Article 7(1) Parliament possesses the power of initiative, and both paragraphs accord it the right of approval."
"What this means is that whether or not the criteria and principles that Parliament chooses for this procedure are actually recognised by other institutions as well will be a quite essential consideration."
"In my report, I originally proposed an interinstitutional agreement to embed these principles and make them binding on the other institutions, but I wholly accept the committee’s decision to initiate an interinstitutional dialogue on this."
"The report proposes very definite principles, which I hope are also forward-looking, and these are meant to deal with the qualms and misgivings felt by Members of the House, and also by other committees."
"The principle of confidence states that it is for our Member States, through their constitutions and institutions, to take active steps to defend the fundamental rights and values of the Union against breaches and the risk thereof; we are also persuaded that they must also be willing and able to do so."
"This House reiterates and affirms that it has this confidence."
"Secondly, with regard to the principle of plurality of opinion on the basis of democracy and the rule of law, we reaffirm Parliament’s intention that Article 7 must never be used as an instrument of political opposition."
"The principle of equality also applies, despite the widespread misgivings about it, and it is intended that it should be embedded, in other words, that Member States should be treated equally, irrespective of their size, their contribution to the Budget, or the length of time they have been Member States."
"I will conclude by saying that I attach particular importance to the principle of openness."
"Although neither I nor anyone else here wants things to go that far, this procedure will, if it does so, give rise to major tensions."
"The debates at the start of this session showed us how very difficult it will be, in a state of emergency, to implement such a procedure with confidence, wisdom, and fairness."
"It is my belief that, in the event of such a procedure, Parliament would need a great deal of public credibility and so, contrary to what the Commission proposes, it is not a separate procedure that such circumstances require, but the absolute openness of all procedures, which the possibility of sanctions makes all the more necessary."
"That, Mr President, brings me to my conclusion."
"Parliament believes that the sanctions issue must indeed be addressed, and that it cannot be the subject of speculation, so that nowhere – whether outside the EU or within it – can there be even the least doubt about this Union’s determination to use all the means available to it in the defence of fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of law."
". Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report which replies to the Commission's communication on Article 7 of the Treaty on the European Union."
"In that communication, which was addressed to the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission aimed to provide a framework for analysis of the conditions for the application of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union in order to initiate a dialogue with the other two institutions responsible for implementing this important provision."
"The Commission is pleased with the favourable reaction of Parliament to the principle of this Commission initiative."
"Fundamental rights and the rule of law are the foundations of the European Union and a significant departure by any Member State from these values threatens to call into question the common values upon which the Union was built."
"For this reason, the Commission's communication underlined prevention as a means of obviating the need to resort to Article 7 or, in any event, to impose the penalties provided for by this Article."
"Evidently, penalties should still be resorted to if necessary – let us be clear on this particular point."
"As the draft resolution rightly stressed, the Union must first and foremost have confidence in Member States and their own institutions, for example the constitutional courts."
"However, as part of a preventive approach it is undoubtedly necessary, as has in fact been requested by Parliament, for the Union to monitor respect for fundamental rights, and for independent European expertise to be developed in this area."
"As you are aware, we have put in place a network of independent experts which my colleague Mr Vitorino commented on at length at the last part-session during the debate on fundamental rights in the Union."
"Prevention also requires cooperation between institutions and the Member States, dialogue with citizens and information and education of the public."
"A point meriting particular attention, and with which the Commission fully concurs, is the reference to the principles that must be respected when considering whether to enforce Article 7."
"These are the trust that should govern the EU's relationship with its Member States, the respect for pluralism, the principle of the equality of the Member States and the principle of the transparency of the decisions taken under Article 7."
"I note also that the report considers that the role of the Vienna Monitoring Centre could be revised with a view to providing 'independent and objective scrutiny on a broader basis'."
"This is in line with the European Council's decision in December 2003 to extend the Centre's mandate to convert it into an Agency for Fundamental Rights, which is supported by the Commission."
"I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that the Commission is currently studying ways of implementing the preparatory activities of the NGO support programme in the new Member States, in the areas of respect for the law, democracy and fundamental rights, in line with Parliament's wishes."
"This confirms the shared determination of the Commission and Parliament to encourage civil society to take action to support fundamental rights based on a preventive, positive and constructive approach."
"To conclude, the Commission welcomes the recognition of the importance of interinstitutional dialogue regarding the launch of the Article 7 mechanism."
"As I said before, this is in line with the aim of the Commission's communication, which was to institute a dialogue with the two institutions in order to develop a common approach."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and point out that I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and on behalf of a fellow Member who has not been able to speak."
"There can be no question that the PPE-DE Group has always defended the fundamental rights and values that we in the European Union represent."
"The European Union promoted by the founding fathers in the 1950s was not intended to be an economic union, but a union based on certain fundamental values which we must guarantee, as the rapporteur has said."
"My group largely supports his report, although several amendments have been tabled, but we will vote in favour of the proposal the rapporteur has made in this report."
"I am delighted that in Nice some of these values were incorporated into the constitution and that provision was made for establishing a mechanism under the terms of Article 7 in order to guarantee that values are respected within the European Union."
"I come from a country which has been attacked by terrorists over the last 30 years, and which, furthermore, was savagely attacked on 11 March, and, as the rapporteur has said in his speech, terrorism can only be tackled by means of more values, more democracy and more fundamental rights and the European Union must, therefore, be capable of guaranteeing respect for these values within the Union, in order more effectively to combat terrorism, attacks on our values and attacks on European values."
"I would like to say finally – in relation to the rapporteur's report – that we share the principles expressed in it – trust, priority, equality and publicity – which can allow us to make progress on establishing a mechanism which prevents certain States from failing to respect the values which are so important to defend in the European Union, and in this very Parliament more than anywhere else."
"We also support his proposal to establish an interinstitutional mechanism to promote dialogue between Parliament and the Council as from the next legislature."
"– Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on whose behalf I have the honour of speaking, also thanks the rapporteur for a very important report, one that is a key element in making the European Union a democracy capable of defending itself."
"In both Conventions – both that on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and that on the Constitution – our group was very active in contending that the EU is not merely an economic community, but also a community of values, one whose foundations have been laid over centuries, and one that is willing to defend democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law throughout its territory."
"This Union of ours is a great thing, extending from Estonia to Portugal, and we have to ask ourselves what holds it together."
"It certainly is not the market that constitutes Europe, but rather the sense of solidarity derived from our values."
"Such is Europe, such is our identity – and that we must not lose."
"We do of course need a mechanism to guarantee the maintenance of these values."
"The public would find it incomprehensible if a Member State were to get out of hand without the EU doing anything about it."
"We do not, of course, want to interfere in a state’s internal affairs – we are a Union with a great deal of pluralism and much diversity – but, when there is evidence of clear risks and of long-standing breaches of these values and principles, that is the time for the EU to act."
"I am very glad to hear the Commissioner say that such action may even involve sanctions."
"Cutting off funds from Brussels, not to mention withdrawal of the entitlement to participate in decision-making bodies, is of course the sharpest weapon one can use, but we have to make clear our willingness to introduce it if necessary."
"I see Parliament as having a particular role to play in this, and that has been emphasised in the report, for which let me reiterate our thanks to Mr Voggenhuber."
"– Mr President, exactly seven years have passed, and still neither the Council nor the Commission have proved themselves capable of devising a procedure to implement Article 7, an article once trumpeted abroad, at the time of the Treaty of Amsterdam, as a vital policy innovation in the EU Treaty."
"The lack of definite procedural rules, though, means that the paper asserting the values of the EU has to be patient."
"Without such a procedure, the whole article remains a paper tiger."
"Such a situation is not exactly calculated to make the European Union more credible in the eyes of its citizens; you are all aware to what a depth that credibility has fallen in all our Member States."
"Putting it politely, I have to say that I am disturbed by the Commission communication that this report takes as its starting point."
"It is extremely disturbing that the Commission quite obviously does not want to impose penalties on Member States in the event of serious breaches of the Treaties."
"It evidently wants to fool us into believing that everything in our garden is lovely and is going to stay that way."
"What else can it mean when the Commission, on page 14 of its communication, states bluntly – and I quote – that ‘it will not be necessary to apply penalties pursuant to Article 7(3) of the Union Treaty and Article 309 of the EC Treaty’?"
"Such an absolution of responsibility would markedly diminish our own high expectations of our shared values and, ultimately, the standard of protection for fundamental rights and values in the EU."
"It also reminds one of the oft-used repressive phrase to the effect that what is not allowed cannot happen."
"Even more serious is the Commission’s ostrich-like and nonchalant attitude to the protection of fundamental rights in time of war, and this is where the real scandal lies."
"The real scandal is the way in which the Commission virtually serves up fundamental rights in the EU in time of war on a silver platter."
"Let me quote from page 8 of the Commission communication: ‘On the contrary, a serious breach presupposes that the danger should have become a concrete fact.’"
"Purely hypothetically, the adoption of a law abrogating procedural safeguards in time of war would be a clear risk. Actually using such a law, on the other hand, would be a serious breach."
"That really is something to be savoured; the Commission regards a law, in a Member State, abrogating fundamental rights, as no more than a clear risk rather than as a serious breach, without even mentioning the possibility of penalties."
"No, this is not on."
"This represents a point beyond which Parliament cannot allow the Commission to persist in going against the flow of fundamental rights, and so I am glad that Parliament has taken the initiative, in the shape of the Voggenhuber report, so that now, seven years after Amsterdam, something is at last being done."
"In relation to this, I have proposed a number of amendments aimed at making the draft text more precise."
"In particular, these relate to the obligation placed on the EU by the Convention’s draft constitutional treaty, in its Article 3(4) in Part I and in Article 193(1) in Part III, to abide by international law, and I think that the Iraq war, which was contrary to international law, and all the misery inflicted on that country by the occupying forces, is evidence of the need for further tightening up of the report’s motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, the Voggenhuber report and the Commission communication on which it is based demonstrate only too well how Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union can become an infernal machine enabling the Union, in the name of preventing or penalising real or alleged violations of fundamental rights, to subject Member States to greater external supervision."
"In other words we are seeing in outline the development of a central disciplinary system which will be able to impose on national democracies extensive or arbitrary definitions of their obligations."
"Paragraph 3 of the report gives a good example of this when it suggests that States which tolerate, and I quote, ‘a climate or social conditions in which individuals… feel threatened’ could be condemned."
"This sort of definition can go a very long way, particularly since Article 7 applies not only to the rights provided by the Union, which may be increased in future by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also to purely national competences, as the Commission communication clearly explains."
"Paradoxically, therefore, there is a risk that in the name of respecting human rights a highly undemocratic multilateral surveillance system will be set up."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has delivered a very negative opinion on the report and it is right to do so."
"I took a similar line in the minority opinion which I expressed following the vote by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"– Mr President, Mr Voggenhuber has just laid stress on the principle of openness, and I would just like to make a few brief observations on it."
"Let me say, while we are on this subject, that I well recall the arbitrary treatment meted out to my own country, Austria, in relation to what we are talking about."
"The Austrian Socialists, who have for some time now been calling themselves Social Democrats, were fully involved in the underhand manoeuvres that were going on at the time."
"I also have very precise recollections of a telephone call from the then Austrian Chancellor, Viktor Klima, a Socialist, who was fully in the know and told me that all he demanded of me was that nothing should get out."
"Never again must principles of this sort be applied in this fashion, whether in party politics or in affairs of State, for without transparency there is no democracy."
"It is precisely for this reason that tracing the course of these events and making them accessible to the public is so very important."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"- report (A5-0191/2004) by Evelyne Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws ('the regulation on consumer protection cooperation');"
"- second report (A5-0224/2004) by Joachim Wuermeling, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning credit for consumers;"
"and"
"- report (A5-0188/2004) by Fiorella Ghilardotti, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the Internal Market and amending Directives 84/450/EEC, 97/7/EC and 98/27/EC (the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive)."
"."
"Mr President, just a year ago this Parliament adopted its resolution on the Commission's new consumer policy strategy for the next five years."
"We are discussing today three key proposals within the context of that strategy."
"I am particularly pleased that Parliament has decided to discuss them jointly, as all three pursue the objective of boosting consumer confidence in the internal market."
"Consumer purchases represent close to 60% of the EU's GDP."
"A loss of consumer confidence – even by a small amount – can have significant repercussions for our economy and collective wealth."
"Last month, at the spring European Council, the Heads of State and Government took stock of our pursuit of the Lisbon Agenda, which aims to boost the competitiveness of our economy."
"It would be no exaggeration to say that there is definitely room for improvement in this respect."
"Consumer confidence is good for business and would contribute to boosting our competitiveness."
"The European Union has come a long way in eliminating barriers in the single market."
"In tearing down regulatory barriers we must, however, realise that consumers – the demand side of the market – are also confronted with barriers, namely confidence barriers."
"Not addressing these confidence barriers would not only be irresponsible but also very damaging to the interests of consumers and businesses alike."
"It would also put a heavy burden on our ability to meet our competitiveness objectives set out in the Lisbon Agenda."
"The proposals we are discussing today will allow us to maximise the benefits of the single market for consumers."
"I would like to thank the three rapporteurs from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for their hard work on these proposals, as well as the rapporteurs from the committees providing opinions for their time and effort."
"I turn first to the proposed regulation on enforcement cooperation."
"It addresses what has always been the weak point in consumer protection: the effective application of the law."
"In cross-border cases, problems increase because national enforcement mechanisms are not designed to deal with such cases."
"Rogue traders who seek to cheat consumers have spotted this and are more prevalent in cross-border cases than in domestic ones, targeting consumers across borders through the post, by e-mail or via websites."
"To deal with this, the proposed regulation sets up a network of public enforcement authorities, with at least one in each Member State."
"The effect of the proposal will be that national authorities can cooperate quickly and effectively in tracking down rogue traders and stop them from harming consumers and legitimate businesses."
"This regulation will send a strong message to European citizens, telling them that the EU is relevant to their day-to-day concerns and that they can have greater confidence in shopping throughout Europe."
"I would like to thank Mrs Gebhardt and colleagues who worked with her towards a compromise agreement with the Council allowing for the adoption of the proposal in a single reading."
"The compromise that was negotiated between the institutions ensures that enforcement authorities will at last have the necessary tools at their disposal genuinely to cooperate in cross-border cases."
"At the same time, it respects the various traditions that exist among the different Member States, with some relying more on public enforcement and others relying more on private actions."
"I am aware and indeed concerned that some of you would prefer the opinion of the lead committee, which is expressed in Amendment No 29, over the compromise solution contained in Amendment No 76, which has been worked out with the Council."
"Pursuing this approach risks leading to prolonged discussions with the Council and to a second reading, further delaying the creation of an effective enforcement mechanism capable of dealing with rogue traders."
"I see no reason why either our businesses or our consumers would in any way benefit from such a delay."
"The amendments tabled and supported by some in no way enhance the effectiveness of the mechanism, neither do they present a meaningful contribution to safeguarding established national mechanisms and traditions."
"I therefore urge all Members to stick to the compromise."
"This is the last legislative part-session of this Parliament before the elections."
"It is therefore also your final opportunity to ensure that when you have to inform your voters about precisely what you have done to further consumer interests and the enforcement of law, you have a tangible example to show them."
"The second proposal on the table today is the proposed directive on consumer credit."
"There is broad agreement that a new directive on consumer credit is both necessary and desirable."
"The market and the products have evolved considerably since the mid-1980s and the existing directive is no longer adapted to new developments in the area of credit."
"This new directive is necessary to allow the emergence of a real single market in consumer credit."
"It is desirable in order to achieve a high level of consumer protection in line with the consumer policy action plan endorsed by the European Parliament."
"This is the reason why I consider a full harmonisation approach the only means to really create a level playing field for lenders throughout the EU."
"Many of you have called, and will call, for minimum harmonisation, allowing Member States to top up the rules at national level."
"This would, however, mean maintaining differences between national legislations."
"It will continue to ensure that the credit market remains a domestic and local market, depriving consumers of all the advantages a single credit market could offer them."
"It would not improve legal certainty for creditors and consumers contracting across borders."
"It would not help to develop a genuine single market in consumer credit."
"The full harmonisation approach will not lead to a lowering of consumer protection standards, as we have rightly chosen a high common level of protection as the starting point."
"Moreover, I would stress that the harmonisation applies to only those areas actually covered by the directive."
"In areas that fall outside the scope of the directive, Member States remain free to maintain their own national provisions."
"Full harmonisation will improve the overall level of consumer protection in the EU and facilitate the provision of cross-border credit."
"Last, but not least, I come to the framework directive on unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices."
"This proposal aims to put in place a high common level of consumer protection against unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices EU wide."
"In doing so, it will stimulate consumer confidence and ensure that rogue practices can be addressed wherever in the EU they arise."
"Just as importantly, it will reduce the barriers that prevent legitimate businesses from making the most of the internal market and reaching new consumers."
"Both businesses and consumers will benefit from the security of having one set of rules rather than 15 or, from 1 May, 25."
"Both business and consumers will therefore be better placed to take advantage of the enlarged internal market."
"This in turn will have a positive effect on the competitiveness of the EU economy as a whole."
"I will leave it at that for the time being and look forward to hearing your views."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over and over again we hear of the underhand machinations of rapacious businessmen, in whose nets members of the public have been caught, but from which it is often possible to extricate them."
"All the Member States have precautions in place to protect consumers, whether this is done using public authorities such as the UK’s Office of Fair Trading or France’s , or by such bodies as the Dutch or the in Germany."
"All of them help if, for example, a letter lands on your doormat telling you that you have won a prize in a lottery, and that all you have to do to get it is to sign and post the form, so you do and off it goes."
"A week later, you get goods you have not ordered, which you are told you have to pay for."
"Alternatively, you fall for one of the slimming courses that are on offer – particularly frequently in young people’s magazines in recent times – the effectiveness of which is much exaggerated and whose side-effects are glossed over."
"Perhaps you have been enticed by an offer that has turned out to involve ‘modem jacking’, in which a website offers you the chance to download music free of charge, you accept the offer, and, in the course of the process, you, the customer, without being aware of it, are cut off from your usual Internet Service Provider and attached to another one that is much more expensive."
"Only later do you get the bill."
"In most cases of fraud, the national authorities can provide help."
"It is something like 20% of cases that matters become problematic, when the only known address is often a PO Box in a foreign country."
"In such situations, good advice soon becomes invaluable."
"This draft piece of legislation is of great importance in terms of dealing with cases such as these."
"Legislation is also urgently needed, for problems are piling up, and we should not leave the public to their own devices."
"That is why, as your rapporteur, I acceded to the wish of the Irish Presidency of the Council that the legislation should be adopted, if at all possible, in only one reading."
"What is on the table is what has emerged from negotiations."
"I also want to put on the record my thanks to the Commission for its active help in achieving this result."
"This legislation is primarily concerned with mutual assistance in enforcing consumers’ rights, for which every Member State is to set up a public office to function as the point of contact for the authorities in other Member States, although I wish to stress that no Member State will be obliged to set up a new authority."
"It is for the Member States to decide how to allocate the functions described in this Regulation to existing authorities."
"This is not about creating bureaucracy, but about successfully putting a stop to the fraudulent schemes of a few rogue traders, who use cross-border businesses as a front."
"To this end, public agencies can, by mutual agreement, delegate the handling of cases to non-governmental organisations, and this is the traditional practice in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands."
"I am working on the assumption that, in these states the norm will be for tasks to be handed over to time-tested bodies such as consumers’ associations or business self-regulators."
"On that, I believe, depends my recommendation, as rapporteur, to my fellow-Members that they should vote to accept this compromise text."
"The only exceptions I can envisage are where statutory bodies have to exchange particularly sensitive data, but we have made definite arrangements for that in this document."
"By agreeing to this draft legislation, we can redeem a pledge given by all of us as MEPs, our pledge that we would commit ourselves to dealing with the public’s concerns."
"I hope that, tomorrow, we will do so with a resounding yes."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, honoured visitors, I would like to start by thanking most warmly all those who have played their part in drawing up this report, which is a very complex and comprehensive one."
"We were, unfortunately, obliged to consider a Commission proposal that was not entirely consistently thought through, that was sloppily worded and had not taken account, above all, of the serious consequences it would have for consumers, for example on their access to credit."
"We in the committee therefore had to propose extensive changes to this directive, achieving the sad record of 650 amendments to what have to date been 38 articles, but your concentrated collaboration means that it has now been possible to assemble all this into a genuinely consistent whole."
"Nor must I let this opportunity go by without very warmly thanking Parliament’s Bureau and the groups’ secretariat, not to mention my own staff, for the endless hours they devoted to this project."
"I can tell the House that what the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market wishes to do by means of this proposal is to send out three signals."
"One carries the message that the European internal market needs the best possible consumer protection."
"We will achieve this if we combine the European Union’s minimum standards with the legislation of individual states, but if, on the other hand, we were to take the approach of harmonising everything or as much as possible, that would amount to only the minimum of protection for the consumer."
"This is where I want to express my disagreement with what Commissioner Byrne had to say."
"The fact is that I get the impression that what matters most of all to the Commission is that consumer law in this area should be completely centralised, with the European Union alone being entitled to do anything that has to do with consumer protection."
"That would not, however, be objectively reasonable, as the national markets still differ to a large extent, and it is there that there must be a rapid and flexible response when improper business practices crop up."
"Secondly, we are sending the message that financial markets need to be opened up to individual consumers too."
"We want the standards of protection not only to enhance public confidence in commerce and in buying by mail order, but also to encourage the public to seek out offers throughout the internal market in order, eventually, to find credit on favourable terms."
"Thirdly, we are signalling our opposition to over-regulation and bureaucracy, for there is, quite simply, no sense in deluging ordinary customers – responsible adults though they may be – with a flood of information that they cannot read, let alone understand; hence our proposal for clear technical information that will provide consumers with the key facts on their loans at a glance."
"We also made it our concern to maintain access to credit facilities particularly for the man and woman in the street and for the vulnerable members of society."
"It is these sectors of the population who need short-term loans simply to stay on top of day-to-day life."
"The end result of the Commission proposal would have been that the only people who could get credit would be those who had no need of it."
"There are two more specific points I would like to address briefly, and these are still subject to discussion between the groups."
"The first has to do with the entitlement to early repayment."
"One position on this is that this should generally be permitted, and without any additional costs being incurred, whilst the other is that consumers should be allowed to choose between fixed-term loans and those capable of being repaid early."
"In view of the fact that we have still not yet come to an agreement on this, let me draw still closer to the Group of the Party of European Socialists; you will have seen that I have already tabled a compromise amendment, Amendment No 173, in which I propose that, where loans are taken out for a period of over three years, it should be possible to repay them at any time."
"I would now like to add to that by combining it with Amendment No 96 as recommended by the committee, whose effect is to bring about a commensurate reduction in costs in this case."
"Even though there are some points from today’s debate that I wanted to mention, let me bring this speech to a close."
"I see this package of reports – Mrs Gebhardt’s, Mrs Ghilardotti’s, and my own – as the culmination and conclusion of our legislative work in the field of consumer law."
"We have always managed to discharge our responsibilities in a state of tension between the demands of the internal market and those of consumer protection, and what we have put before you I see as being a single piece of mature legislation."
"Whatever our differences about the details, then, I hope that they will receive the general support of the House."
". Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive concerning unfair commercial practices takes over a large part of the Green Paper on consumer protection, referred to by the Commissioner in his report."
"The reasons underlying the directive, which is designed to achieve higher consumer protection, are of an economic nature, and therefore relate to the completion and smooth operation of the internal market."
"In order for these general economic goals to be achieved, it is necessary to have a consumer protection policy to create European consumer confidence and to give a fresh impetus to international and European commercial transactions."
"The benefit of economic growth in the internal market ought to translate into both higher profits for businesses and higher protection and financial benefits for consumers."
"Through a joint policy for consumers and the harmonisation of the internal market it will also be possible to achieve price convergence."
"Conversely, unfair commercial practices lead to irrational financial behaviour in consumers, create distortions of competition and place barriers in the way of the proper functioning of the market."
"To this end, I endorse the Commission's approach, which is based on harmonisation, on the principle of mutual recognition of the country of origin, on a general prohibition on unfair commercial practices, on the identifying of specific criteria and examples and on the fact that the scope of application is limited to a framework directive based on business-consumer relations."
"The creation of a European legislative framework covering unfair commercial practices based on an appropriate level of harmonisation and aimed at clear and effective protection of consumers within the European Union will result in enhanced consumer confidence, an increase in international trade and will allow businesses to compete in a situation of legal clarity."
"While endorsing the basic approach and the main objectives of the directive, Parliament is nevertheless tabling a raft of amendments which, in our opinion, make a series of definitions and options clearer and unequivocal."
"In this regard, we have tabled an amendment concerning the legal basis, that is, a proposal to include, in addition to the legal basis proposed by the Commission in relation to the internal market, a legal basis based on Article 153 concerning consumer protection, so that we can reconcile the objective of harmonisation and mutual recognition of the internal market with the possibility for the Member States to maintain legislation which goes further to protect consumers."
"In this way, I believe that we can respond to the fears of those who think that greater harmonisation could lead to downward levelling of consumer protection or entail a step backwards with regard to existing legislation in many Member States."
"We also feel that it is important – with regard to the definition of consumers – to refer to a particular group of consumers, specifically vulnerable consumers who, as a result of various factors such as age, physical or mental abilities, their level of literacy or disability, need greater protection."
"Again with reference to Article 2, in relation to the definitions, it is important to amend the definition of professional diligence and I will retable an amendment in plenary in this regard."
"In essence, we support the Commission’s approach to the regulation of misleading and aggressive practices but we stress, though, that the information which consumers must receive about unfair commercial practices and codes of conduct is an essential element."
"Similarly we also think, in relation to codes of conduct, that the distinction between national and Community codes is slightly artificial, and we therefore point out the need to provide for appropriate, efficient mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the codes."
"Another important point, which concerns the codes of conduct as a method of regulating and resolving disputes between businesses and consumers, is arbitration, which cannot and should not replace or prevent recourse to administrative bodies, but which could play an important part."
"Therefore, as my fellow Members and Commissioner Byrne also pointed out, adoption of this directive and tomorrow’s report is of the utmost importance both for the development of the internal market and for consumer protection."
"I will conclude by thanking all my fellow Members who sought to improve this document and find a solution with their contributions."
"In particular, I would like to thank Mrs Paciotti, who deputised for me for a time when I was absent owing to ill health, and did an outstanding job on my behalf."
". Mr President, to speak for only one minute on a report which we have been concerned with for such a long time will be difficult."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your proposal; it provides a basis to work on."
"Happily, this Parliament will separate after working on that basis."
"You know that we support the ambitious concept with which you began, that of total harmonisation, but we can see how difficult it will be to push through."
"Perhaps we should do more work around that concept, in order to achieve real consumer protection, which is what we are interested in."
"As for the clarity and efficacy of this text, it seems to us that what Parliament is actually proposing on the subject of harmonised rates is a useful path to follow."
"We retain only one rate, the overall effective annual rate."
"That will make things much simpler for everybody."
"Let us bear in mind, however, that consumer goods are goods for which credit is a particular kind of credit, inasmuch as, as soon as that credit is contracted, the goods are no longer the subject of credit but rather, in a way, of a debt, since the goods lose their value as soon as they are purchased."
"There are two points to which my attention has been drawn in particular, Commissioner, and, of course, these concern the scope of this directive."
"As you are aware, practices and conventions vary within the European Union, so that between mortgage credits, between personal loans, and between credits allocated there are very different balances from one Member State to another, and we have to face up to the reality of the mechanisms and risks of dumping which exist as a result of different national practices."
"Clearly, if you remove mortgage credits from this directive and move them to another directive you will be opening up the field to the banks, which will take advantage of mortgage credits to attack other consumer credit markets."
"I do not think that that is the objective sought by this directive which should, first and foremost, protect all forms of consumer credit."
". Mr President, strengthening consumer confidence is indeed essential to the development of the internal market, as you, Commissioner, have pointed out."
"Yet that confidence is based on consumers’ ability to conclude, without incurring any legal or economic risk, all kinds of commercial transactions, in particular by means of new electronic trading procedures."
"The systems for preventing and penalising infringements of consumer laws currently in force in Member States generally function in the context of national markets, but are unsuitable for use at Community level."
"This deficiency obviously works to the advantage of unscrupulous operators, to the detriment of consumers and honest traders."
"We can, therefore, only welcome the Commission’s initiative, which consists in setting up a network of authorities which are able to cooperate with one another in order to rid the internal market of dubious practices, although I, for one, would have preferred us to opt for a network that would be completely public in nature, along the lines of the committee’s original proposal."
"Bearing in mind the need to take into account the diversity of Community practices and the urgent need to make this instrument available, however, I believe it is reasonable to adopt the compromise which has been achieved, in particular thanks to the work of our rapporteur."
"I would therefore like to express the hope that a real spirit of mutual assistance will prevail in the cooperation between Member States."
". Mr President, I would like to say how pleased we are that Mrs Ghilardotti has recovered and is with us today."
"This is a debate about people and our concerns for them."
"I would like to say, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, that we very much support what the rapporteur has said on unfair commercial practices, that is, that the principle of the vulnerable consumer must be accepted and recognised, that we must take into account disparities between national protection rules, that we must insist on a double legal basis and that the principle of optimum harmonisation should hold good for all three directives."
"In my remaining seconds I would just say that I am very grateful indeed to the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, on the issue of enforcement for accepting that each state should be allowed to decide how the regulation should be implemented by the public authorities, but according to Amendment No 76 it will be implemented by public authorities in alliance with, but not supplanted by, other public interests and by NGOs."
"This is a good day for consumers and, despite the rather stunted debate we have had, we should shout that fact from the rooftops."
"Mr President, the fact that we can complete this part-session with a debate on three important consumer matters is not only symbolic; it also provides us with the opportunity of re-emphasising our genuine desire to reinforce the human character of the internal market, and it also affords us the opportunity of clarifying that the internal market is also there for the consumer and that we want to, and must, boost consumer confidence."
"As far as the framework directive is concerned, our group’s guiding principle is that a high level of consumer protection is a prerequisite for the actual application of the principle of mutual recognition."
"We accept the restriction of the scope in respect of the industry-consumer relation."
"However, in order to clarify the connection between this framework directive and the competition-related aspects to everyone, we would still like to table amendments."
"To our group, the average consumer remains the point of reference."
"We accept that further amendments will be tabled, but these amendments may not go so far as to fundamentally depart from the option."
"In addition, we remain adamant that it should explicitly be stated that the black lists of aggressive and misleading trade practices are exhaustive in character and that the directive’s harmonisation objective may not be undermined."
"If the black lists are amended, we believe this should be done by way of the codecision procedure."
"We also remain convinced that a double legal basis for the framework directive is not justified, not necessary and surplus to requirements."
"We will therefore follow the legal recommendation of our Legal Service and endorse the reasons that we have previously clarified in the various committees."
"During this part-session, as in past ones, we have enacted much fine legislation on consumer protection, and it has only been thanks to Commission proposals that we have been able to do this."
"I would therefore echo everyone who wants to thank the Commissioner today for the proposal we have received, for without the Commission proposals we would not have been able to do the work."
"It is, of course, the case that, no matter how many fine laws we enact, legislation depends entirely on their effective implementation and enforcement."
"That is why I am a great fan of the Commission proposal to develop a network of administrative bodies that are responsible for the application of all those fine consumer directives."
"I very much welcome this Commission proposal."
"I hope that the Members of this House will reconsider the amendments, because I know that there are people in our group who would very much regret it if we were to end up with a regulation that is all too bureaucratic and involving a great deal of red tape."
"We would regard that as indefensible."
"We should therefore ensure that we get a maximum number of votes to approve the proposal for a network."
"We should ask the Council to reconsider the matter."
"After all, it should not always be the case that we adapt to the Council’s position."
"We agree on a great many points."
"We should, for once, ask the Council to adapt to Parliament and respect democracy."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, Mrs McCarthy and I have tabled a total of 25 amendments to the proposal for a Directive on consumer credit, for which Mr Wuermeling is rapporteur."
"As we know, there was an initial stage of indecision, during which the rapporteur thought that the directive was being modified in committee, which led this proposed directive being referred back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, but, fortunately, we managed to resolve the issue and finally the rapporteur decided, in agreement with us, to present it once again with a series of amendments."
"Our problem is lack of time."
"This term of office is coming to an end."
"During this term of office, Parliament has not been able to complete its examination of the proposed directive and we are limited to a first reading so that the next Parliament may have the opportunity to examine it in depth."
"Our concern is naturally not to kill off consumer credit – which, for better or for worse, has become an essential part of our lives – and also to provide a guarantee that credit will not end up being a noose around the consumer’s neck."
"Our amendments are of a different nature."
"Some, for example, relate to the legal basis."
"We believe it is important to introduce Article 153 as an additional legal basis in the field of consumer protection and, furthermore, we also believe it is important to point out certain elements in the definitions."
"In the definitions and above all in the adherence to certain basic principles, such as, for example, the APR – Annual Percentage Rate – which is a concept we have developed here, and we must prevent it from being replaced by other criteria which are much more difficult to understand."
"In conclusion, we hope that tomorrow's vote may lead to a directive which is clearer to the consumer and that on this basis the next Parliament can definitively approve this directive which is so important for all the European Union's consumers."
"Mr President, Commissioners, I should first like to mention the proposal on cooperation between consumer authorities, which is extremely welcome, and I think that the rapporteur has done an exceedingly good job."
"It is both astonishing and depressing how much energy some Members have put into attempts to water this proposal down."
"I cannot conceive of a situation in which everyone but the consumer has rights in the internal market."
"That has been truly depressing, but I welcome this proposal, and hope that a large majority in Parliament will support the compromise proposal drawn up by Mrs Gebhardt."
"On the subject of Mr Wuermeling’s report on credit for consumers, I must say that I welcome the fact that we are having the debate today and that we have managed to make a good deal of progress."
"As previous speakers have said, improvements are needed, however, because otherwise there is a risk of the directives diluting the rights that consumers already have."
"Earlier on, a speaker mentioned the actual annual percentage rate of charge, and in this case, too, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and I should like to see a broader definition."
"The right to earlier repayment must also be improved."
"I do not think that the rapporteur’s compromise proposal goes far enough in this respect."
"As I often do in these debates, I should just like to mention the right to number portability in the telecommunications sector, which has given consumers important rights."
"In my home country, costs have fallen by 7% over the past year, and I think that the right to repayment has been a significant contributory factor."
"I also think that better information on credit cards is needed, and that the exclusions in some amendments are not really desirable."
"Finally, in my opinion, joint and several liability is really needed in order to develop the internal market and afford consumers protection when new products are placed on the market."
"I should also like to mention here something that happened in my home country."
"A new low-cost company went bankrupt, and only those consumers who had paid by credit card had any kind of protection."
"This also goes to show that this aspect is necessary for consumers when markets are developed."
"Mr President, I would like to start from a local perspective."
"Last Friday I visited Blantyre in my constituency to talk to an alliance of Credit Unions in that part of Scotland."
"As the Commissioner will know very well, Credit Unions in some parts of the Union provide cheap and affordable types of safe credit to consumers through voluntary organisations carrying out voluntary effort in a non-profit way."
"They were very concerned early on in the process that they may be caught in some of the technicality of this directive."
"I am extremely grateful to Mr Wuermeling for the way in which, in Amendments Nos 4 and 62, he has sought to create an exemption for that kind of activity."
"It is really very important and my constituents were very grateful to learn just how much had been done in that respect."
"While there may be still issues among us about the exact balance between the consumer and the lender contained in the Wuermeling report, we are all agreed that it is vitally important to make safe the internal market so that there can be much wider trade, but not at the cost of unfairness to consumers."
"I congratulate him genuinely on the work he has done."
"While we will be supporting some amendments against him tomorrow, it will not be at the cost of backing the general project."
"The same goes for Mrs Gebhardt's proposal."
"We are talking about consumer rights."
"No rights without remedies is a good old slogan and I think that the point of the new regulation of which the Commissioner and Mrs Gebhardt have spoken is very much to secure that there are adequate and forceful remedies for rights that we all support."
"Likewise, if I may say to Mrs Ghilardotti, the idea that we should begin to develop a jurist prudence of fair-trading in the European Union is a grand one."
"This will be done, of course, in a negative sense by generating a general duty not to trade unfairly."
"I congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti for all the work she has done."
"There may be one or two points of disagreement in the vote tomorrow, but the point is that we are all piloting the boat in the same direction."
"Mr President, for more than one and a half years, this Parliament has been working on the Commission proposal for the harmonisation of provisions on consumer credit."
"That is, in our view, far too long, not least because the positions of the advisory committee were largely determined as early as before the summer of 2003."
"It very much looks as if the European Commission, which proposes maximum harmonisation, has wrongly evaluated the political feasibility of this."
"My group, on the other hand, endorses minimum harmonisation of consumer credit provisions, so that the acquired rights in the Member States remain in place."
"One of the acquired rights in my country, the Netherlands, is that consumers are allowed to run up a short-term debt with a bank on their current account without any extensive contracts."
"We call this being ‘in the red’."
"It is being proposed, with good reason, to delete paragraph 2c of Article 3 by means of Amendment No 52."
"I should like to hear from the Commissioner whether he will be adopting this amendment."
"Can existing practice of current-account credit remain in place under the new directive without any extra administrative steps?"
"Secondly, I should like to draw attention to the Commission proposal on unfair trade practices."
"Article 4 of this proposal states that traders need only meet the requirements that apply in their home countries."
"Consumers will find that incomprehensible; they want the protection that they enjoy in their own countries."
"This article constitutes a huge stumbling block in terms of effective consumer protection."
"Traders simply need to comply with the requirements applicable in the country where they introduce their products onto the market."
"Our group has for that reason tabled Amendment No 95 to address this problem."
"I hope that this will meet with approval from the House."
"I should like to hear from the Commissioner here whether this amendment could also be adopted."
". Mr President, I believe that this directive is necessary."
"If one thing is clear it is that Directive 87/102/EEC no longer reflects the situation in the credit market."
"We could say that all we Europeans are currently plagued by debt."
"We therefore need a directive which prevents the impression being given, when consumers are offered credit, that we never have to return the money, for two reasons which I believe to be fundamental: firstly, in order to harmonise the conditions in which consumer credit is offered and, above all – and this, incidentally, is a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists – in order to guarantee consumers a high level of protection."
"I regret that I do not have sufficient time to comment to the Commissioner on the amendments we consider essential in order to fulfil these two objectives at least."
"I do hope, however, that some of my fellow Members can do so, because consumers must be protected in an age when it appears that credit is never going to be repaid."
"We citizens do have to repay what we owe, but our debts are more than we can afford."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, consumer protection is an important objective and we need to prevent dishonest traders benefiting from the internal market in order to mislead citizens by offering them defective goods."
"Moreover, dishonest traders take advantage of the new technologies provided by the information society, thereby undermining consumer confidence in -commerce."
"These problems do not only closely concern consumers, but also businesses and the economy as a whole."
"In order to protect consumers, therefore, we have to establish a body of clear, effective rules and also strengthen cooperation between national consumer protection authorities, by promoting information exchange and providing for the possibility for authorities approached by consumers to request the assistance of an authority from another country."
"It is precisely this second, important objective which the proposal for a regulation being discussed and voted on by Parliament this week seeks to secure."
"Current national systems are not capable of preventing and suppressing cross-border exploitation and existing informal networks face obstacles of a legal nature regarding, in particular, difficulties relating to the flow of information from one authority to another and even the lack of public consumer protection authorities in certain Member States."
"Moreover, the regulation lays down precisely the Member States’ obligation to designate a public consumer protection authority, which will be part of a European network."
"The authority of one Member State may request help from other members of the network in order to investigate possible infringements, to receive information and thereby to end exploitation by dishonest traders."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has provided some further guarantees in the proposal for a regulation, in order to avoid possible abuse of power by the national authorities, to protect confidential information held by businesses which is not strictly necessary to the investigation and to ensure that the requests for cooperation are reasonably justified and do not pointlessly impede traders."
"The proposal for a regulation, moreover, provides for procedures which are at times a little cumbersome and onerous for consumers and the public administrations, and risk making the costs far higher than the loss or damage suffered by consumers."
"This is why we oppose certain provisions laid down by the Council and the Commission which would greatly complicate the system, and if we have to adopt the regulation at its reading before enlargement, we shall ensure that it is reviewed, on the basis of experience gained, five years following its entry into force."
"Mr President, research carried out in the UK on consumer credit awareness has demonstrated very clearly that consumers need clear, consistent information to be able to make informed comparisons of the products on offer."
"It is true that, owing to innovation and evolution, many of today's products offer the consumer more choice and flexibility, but many are difficult for consumers to understand: 56% of consumers in the UK did not understand the terms used in credit agreements, 77% find the language in advertising confusing and while 68% are aware that lenders do not calculate APR in the same way, they do not know how the system works and find it difficult to price one loan against another, which makes it difficult for them to shop around for the best deals."
"More importantly, it also means that credit providers are under less pressure to keep their prices and offers competitive."
"If this is the case in just one Member State, imagine what the situation is like across 25."
"This is why the directive must provide maximum levels of consumer protection as regards advertising, information and rules on the calculation of APR and a high level of consumer protection and redress."
"I would like to pinpoint two areas that the Commission should look at more seriously."
"Firstly, joint and several liability."
"In the UK, Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act provides for remedies and redress."
"I understand what the Commissioner is saying: Member States can go further."
"However, I do not want this directive to be used as an excuse for credit providers to opt out of the very high consumer protection that is already offered in other Member States."
"Cooperatives and credit unions were also mentioned."
"I am delighted that the rapporteur has taken on board the amendment drafted by Mr Crowley and myself."
"It is true that credit unions provide a very important service in that they not only offer affordable loans, but also help the poorer elements of the community – the deprived and people on low income – to stay out of the clutches of loan sharks."
"I fear that if the regulations proposed in this directive were to be applied those consumers in poorer areas would end up with no credit unions and no option but to turn to loan sharks."
"The PSE voting list tomorrow will reflect our desire not only to see the opening-up of a consumer credit market in this area but also to achieve the highest possible level of consumer protection for consumers right across Europe."
"Mr President, it seems to me that this joint debate tonight is perhaps a fitting finale to the work of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in this mandate."
"At the beginning of the mandate we also thought that with the advent of the euro and e-commerce these would deliver a double boost to Europe's economy and the internal market."
"Sadly the realities have perhaps been more disappointing, particularly with regard to the participation of consumers in cross-border transactions."
"There was an interesting report from the European Consumer Centres who are very much at the sharp end."
"This report was delivered on European Consumer Day this year."
"Of 114 cross-border transactions only 75 actually resulted in a delivery."
"There were problems with payment and problems with refunds."
"This is hardly the safe, well-functioning market that we had in mind to create, nor have we got the level of confidence that we really need."
"It seems that in various complimentary ways these three measures will help to improve matters."
"The unfair commercial practices legislation should create that high level of consumer protection across the board."
"With the measures it contains by way of codes to help with alternative dispute resolution, combined with proper enforcement through the enforcement directive, perhaps we will get the access to justice across the market that there ought to be for consumers."
"Lastly, with regard to consumer credit, there should be a provision to make sure that consumers are backed up by the credit provider: this provision exists in my own country and others."
"This should be extended across Europe; one of our amendments to this effect was adopted in committee."
"It is aspirational for the future to deliver the consumer confidence that we really need to make the market work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the short time available, I want to speak only on the Gebhardt report."
"I appreciate the efforts that the rapporteur and the Commission have made in their desire to do the right thing in terms of cross-border cooperation."
"Although the usefulness of this is not a matter of doubt, I do wonder whether the proposal put before us by the Irish presidency really does represent an acceptable position and whether we might be creating a bureaucratic monster."
"Firstly, I think it is quite wrong that we should now, for the first time in the history of the European Union’s lawmaking, be seeking to interfere in the Member States’ right to organise the way in which they, within their own borders, transpose regulations and directives."
"In this instance, we prescribe that Member States may not transfer certain functions to private bodies, but that these functions must be performed by the authorities, and so that is precisely what we are doing – tampering with matters that are for the Member States to organise – which may well mean that the whole Regulation contravenes the Treaty."
"My second worry is about the bureaucratic monstrosity of decision-making in the event of dispute."
"This I can describe only as real-life satire."
"The situation is that the Member State delegating the function has to consent to the Member State that accepts it entrusting the performance of the tasks to a private body."
"If neither that, nor the re-examination of the criteria by mutual agreement, is possible, a comitology procedure is set in motion, in which the decision rests with the Commission, so people travel to Brussels from 25 national capitals in order to decide whether or not the matter can, under the directive or a regulation, be referred to private bodies."
"I see that is quite disproportionate to the matter in hand."
"We should respect the Member States’ exercise of their powers and acknowledge the efficient way in which they perform their functions."
"I therefore propose that we should stick to what was decided by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"The Council will do likewise when it has come to its senses."
"Earlier on, Mrs Thyssen pointed out that we have no reason to give way on this; it is the Council that must give way to us, and then this can be adopted quickly, in one reading, but on the basis of the motion for a resolution produced by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market rather than on the compromise proposed by the Irish presidency."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, my point concerns the Wuermeling report, the consumer credit directive."
"I would like to expressly thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and the good cooperation between the committees."
"He had a hard task because the Commission’s draft was, to put it mildly, a bad one."
"The Commission’s proposal starts from false assumptions."
"It plays the interests of consumers against those of the banks and in many cases it actually incites the one against the other, despite the fact that Europe needs more cooperation not recrimination, more seriousness instead of populist superficiality."
"We say a clear yes to consumer protection, yes to greater transparency, yes to reciprocal information, yes to lower and upper limits for the applicability of the directive."
"We say a clear no to more red tape for retail loans, no to making retail loans more expensive and no to the inclusion of overdrafts in this directive."
"I hope that the draft Parliament has produced, based on the rapporteur’s proposals, does justice to the real intentions of this directive, which are to improve consumer protection while cutting bureaucracy, to provide greater transparency and to make for greater trust and mutual consideration, and that it will thereby promote consumer interests and cross-border borrowing."
"I ask you all to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by Parliament and the rapporteur, because that is the only way to increase cooperation rather than conflict."
"Mr President, I would like to restrict my remarks to Mr Wuermeling's report on consumer credit."
"This is his second attempt to reach a compromise on the Consumer Credit Directive, Parliament having opposed many aspects of the proposed directive and referred it back to committee in November 2003."
"This directive aims to harmonise laws, regulations and administrative procedures of the Member States concerning agreements covering credit granted to consumers and surety agreements entered into by consumers."
"Having expressed my opposition to many aspects previously, I will be happy to support Mr Wuermeling's report provided the amendments on so-called 'responsible lending', the compulsory use of credit reference databases and the exemption for mortgages are all adopted, and provided the so-called credit union amendments, 4 and 61, are supported by this House."
"The Credit Union movement in Ireland and the UK is unique."
"Most financial institutions that lend money are in business to maximise profits."
"Credit unions are different as they are owned and run by their members."
"Each member on their boards and principal committees is a volunteer – there are 15 000 of them in my own country – as are the majority of their staff, except in the larger credit unions which have up to 2000 paid employees."
"They are restricted from operating outside their local geographic area and provide mainly small amounts of credit for low-income members and for those in financial difficulty."
"Through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service known as MABS in Ireland, they provide access to credit for individuals who are often seriously in debt and otherwise prey to illegal money lenders providing loans at impossibly high interest rates."
"In my country, where we have less than four million inhabitants, there are 2.5 million members of credit unions with savings in excess of EUR 9 billion."
"37% of loans issued by the credit unions are for EUR 750 or less."
"The average loan is EUR 7000."
"A total of EUR 5 billion is out on loans at the moment."
"Effective leadership for all our credit unions on the island of Ireland is provided by the Irish League of Credit Unions."
"In conclusion, harmonisation is needed and welcomed to the extent that it respects the different range of financial products and the cultural differences in financial services in each Member State."
"We need a balance here in protecting the consumer from the lender and the lender from the consumer."
"Mr President, as a number of colleagues have said as regards consumer credit, good regulation will stimulate the market, encourage consumer confidence and stimulate innovation and development across the single market."
"The Commission's original proposal failed to do almost all these things, and Mr Wuermeling's report, which we warmly welcome, is a significant step in the right direction and a substantial improvement."
"However, as a number of colleagues have said, consumer rights have to have proper enforcement mechanisms."
"The other two proposals being discussed tonight have that link in common."
"We warmly welcome Mrs Gebhardt's to achieve a compromise, which we will support because it is very important."
"We have also made substantial progress in developing a workable proposal on the issue of unfair commercial practices, where enforcement is the key."
"There is no point in having new rights for consumers unless they can be enforced."
"Companies need to know where they stand in relation to their national legislation and they also need to be encouraged to adopt best practice through codes of conduct."
"We have moved substantially in that direction."
"The important proposal of mutual recognition is also absolutely essential to making everything work successfully."
"In conclusion, this package is good for consumers and the internal market, and we will strongly support all three proposals."
". Mr President, I thank you for your valuable interventions on these three issues."
"I know that there is much common ground between Parliament and the Commission."
"Allow me to respond to some of the points that have been made during the course of the debate and to indicate the Commission's position on the key amendments."
"Firstly, enforcement cooperation."
"On this regulation the Commission can accept all the amendments tabled in the plenary by the rapporteur as they reflect the compromise reached with the Council towards a first reading adoption of the regulation."
"Amendments that are not part of the compromise package are not supported by the Commission."
"Prolonging discussions beyond the compromise reached with the Council will not bring material improvements to our capacity to better enforce consumer protection rules."
"It would, however, provide rogue traders with more time to exploit the absence of effective cooperation between the enforcement authorities in the Member States."
"The compromise represents a reasonable balance between the enforcement traditions of the Member States."
"The most important question in these discussions has been the public nature of the network proposed."
"The thinking behind the Commission's proposal was that only public authorities can deliver adequate guarantees on effectiveness and confidentiality."
"In a minority of Member States effective enforcement is fulfilled by financing private consumer organisations to take action on behalf of the public interest."
"Amendment No 76 successfully reconciles both traditions."
"Those Member States with a strong tradition of private consumer bodies would be able to delegate a fair number of cross-border cases to them."
"In the cases which involve confidential information or which require significant investigation, in other words the most serious rogues, a public authority will be lacking."
"The reference to comitology was inserted at the request of those MEPs who support delegation by Member States."
"For a Member State prevented by another Member State from delegating to a private body, it provides a useful opportunity to air grievances."
"Amendment No 29, removing 8(2)(b) and 8(2)(c), will be completely unacceptable to Council and the Commission."
"Both have argued that 8(2) is a package and cannot be touched."
"I therefore commend that particular approach to the House."
"I am happy to be debating the Consumer Credit Directive here today."
"It is now a little over 19 months since the Commission sent this proposal to Parliament, just a few weeks less than the gestation period of the elephant, and I suppose it is not surprising therefore that we have this weighty tome from the rapporteur."
"I am sure the rapporteur will understand if I do not accept all of his amendments, although I am trying to adopt a compromise approach to his position and to his report."
"Many of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and discussed today can be accepted by the Commission."
"Some can be accepted partially or with limited changes."
"I also note that more than 200 amendments were tabled for this plenary sitting which, together with the comments from the various speakers, demonstrates that opinions are very divided."
"This reflects the divide in approach to consumer credit throughout the European Union."
"I am nevertheless heartened by the fact that on the two principal objectives, namely ensuring a high level of protection and the creation of a genuine single market for consumer credit, there is a broad consensus."
"Given the number of technical issues that have been raised, it would lead me too far astray to comment on all of them."
"I will therefore focus on some of the main issues."
"I wish to reiterate that full harmonisation will not lead to a reduction in the level of consumer protection."
"Full harmonisation will apply to the areas for which the directive provides for such harmonisation, namely those areas most relevant to the operation of the single market."
"The Commission is willing to consider excluding areas from the scope of the proposal that would not affect the single market."
"For these areas, Member States can maintain their national provisions."
"Credit intermediaries should only be submitted to national supervision."
"Registration requirements would no longer be foreseen."
"Provisions already covered by existing legislation can in general be deleted; for instance, provisions on door-step selling."
"The same applies to matters covered by national civil law, such as the provisions on repossession and sanctions."
"However, as I said before, this directive also aims at guaranteeing a high level of protection for consumers in the area of credit."
"I cannot, therefore, accept amendments that would lead to a reduction in the level of consumer protection."
"Regarding small loans or overdrafts, it is possible to submit credit unions to a lighter regime principally based on the provision of information."
"I am always interested to hear Sir Neil MacCormick tell the stories of his constituents and his recent experience in his constituency."
"I am sure he would be happy to hear that I have been invited to my own home town of Monasterevin in County Kildare, a small country town, to open a credit union within the next couple of weeks, where I will be emphasising these points."
"On mortgages, the Commission recognises that there are a number of important practical and legal problems, principally related to the fact that such loans are secured by a mortgage on immovable property."
"We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that increasingly consumer spending and consumer credit arrangements are financed through loans secured by a mortgage on immovable property through so-called equity release mechanisms."
"The legal issues surrounding such contracts are indeed complicated, but the risks associated with consumers putting up their family home as collateral for consumer spending merit the attention of regulators and consumer protection provisions are warranted."
"Questions surrounding mortgage-backed credit are being discussed in the forum group on mortgage credit which is due to present a preliminary report in June 2004."
"The Commission will also take account of the discussions of this group in formulating its revised proposal."
"In this respect I also wish to note that the Commission is ready to accept the ceiling proposed."
"Credits for amounts above this ceiling would fall outside the scope of the directive."
"Typically, credits for such amounts typically are secured by a mortgage."
"Concerns have been expressed about the fact that the Commission's proposed regime on joint and several liability will lead to a significant reduction of protection in a number of Member States."
"The Commission confirms that this is not the intention and believes the directive should not undermine the relevant national regimes."
"Regarding the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices, I am pleased to say that the Commission can accept many of the amendments proposed in Mrs Ghilardotti's report, subject to minor changes in some cases."
"I will therefore focus on the areas where the main difficulties arise."
"Under the proposal any practice which is misleading or aggressive automatically meets the criteria for unfair practice under the general prohibition."
"The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendment No 32 because this would require the tests of the general prohibition to be reapplied to misleading or aggressive practices."
"This would reduce legal certainty."
"Amendment No 58 is also not acceptable because it will break the connection between the Article on aggressive practices and the tests in the general prohibition."
"The Commission is prepared to adjust the specification of the benchmark consumer which would be used to assess the impact of commercial practices."
"Following our consultation we have taken a measured approach to the disclosure of information."
"The proposal focuses on the essential information which, if not given to consumers, or apparent from the context, is likely to mislead."
"While some of the proposed adjustments are acceptable, others would upset this balance either by removing key information or by adding extra requirements which would impose costs without bringing any real benefits to consumers."
"Amendments Nos 46 and 49 to 57 are therefore not acceptable."
"The measures in the Annex have been selected because they are not in all circumstances unfair and so can be prohibited up front."
"But they are arrived at by applying the tests of the general clause and must fall within the scope of the proposal."
"I am also against the idea of a double legal base which some people have proposed."
"I know that some speakers hope for the inclusion of Article 153."
"However Article 153(1), makes a cross-reference to Article 95, which is the legal base for this piece of legislation, and Article 153(4) refers to legislation which can only be used in areas where you have minimum harmonisation."
"That is not our ambition."
"I therefore urge Parliament to follow the draft and to follow the advice of Parliament's Legal Service which, I understand, is of the same view as me."
"In conclusion, I only referred to a number of specific amendments or themes."
"A full listing of the Commission's position on each of the amendments on the three reports discussed in this joint debate is being made available to Parliament's secretariat and I trust this will be included in the verbatim report of proceedings for the joint debate.(1)"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0260/2004) by Mr Robert William Sturdy, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on maximum residue levels of pesticides in products of plant and animal origin (COM(2003) 117 – C5-0108/2003 – 2003/0052(COD))."
". Mr President,I am very happy to have the opportunity to discuss this proposal with you and I would like to thank the rapporteurs – Mrs Redondo Jiménez in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and Mr Sturdy in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy – for the time and effort they have put into forging agreements on the text."
"This proposal concerns the setting of MRLs: maximum residue levels for pesticides in food and feed."
"It is a delicate subject, since I do not know of anybody who actively wishes to have pesticides residues in their food."
"However, in modern agriculture they are an unavoidable by-product of agricultural production methods."
"Our duty here is to set out a legal and administrative framework whereby consumers are protected from unacceptable levels of residues whilst at the same time permitting trade in agricultural commodities."
"It is important to note that this legislation is not designed to regulate the use of pesticides and I do not wish to enter into discussions on the broader subject of pesticide use here today. That is covered by Council Directive 91/414/EEC on the marketing and use of pesticides, on which the Commission will be bringing forward amendment proposals at the end of this year."
"Let us look, rather, at the proposal before us."
"This proposal has several objectives."
"First, it aims to simplify."
"It went through a SLIM exercise with stakeholders in 2000 and 2001, and it consolidates and replaces four existing directives and replaces them with a single regulation."
"Second, it aims to achieve, at a stroke, harmonisation of MRLs across the Community."
"We have been setting MRLs at Community level since 1976, and have still not even reached the halfway stage."
"This means that for most substances and commodities, 15 and soon 25 different national sets of rules apply."
"This is hardly compatible with the single market."
"By introducing the possibility of temporary Community MRLs, we can harmonise everything in a short time, pending the outcomes of evaluations of active substances under Directive 91/414/EEC."
"Third, we will introduce a role for the European Food Safety Authority in the risk assessment of MRLs."
"Fourth, we will introduce clear and transparent procedures for all interested parties in the setting or modification of MRLs."
"Fifth, by introducing the concept of a default 'zero tolerance' MRL, we propose a solution for residues of the 400 substances we have already taken off the market, of which we do not want to see any residues in food."
"Some of these are unacceptable substances; many are substances which industry did not want to support in the 91/414/EEC evaluation programme and for which we have no information one way or the other."
"Finally, we aim to strengthen provisions on monitoring and control measures."
"These are the main objectives covered by the proposal, which I hope can enter into force by 2006, 30 years after our first efforts in this area, during which we have seen major changes in science, in trade, in politics and in consumer protection."
"I commend this proposal to you as a major advance in consumer protection and I look forward to the forthcoming discussion."
". Mr President, the Commissioner has beaten me to it and said virtually everything I had planned to say."
"He and I are very much in agreement on this matter."
"Before I start, I wish to add to what the Commissioner said about the Food Safety Authority, which is of fundamental importance."
"It is a plea to this Parliament and to the Commission and everyone concerned that there should be sufficient funding to ensure that the Food Safety Authority can do its job."
"The committee felt very strongly about that."
"I fully welcome the proposals on harmonisation of maximum residue levels in foodstuffs throughout the European Union."
"For too long there have been variations from country to country."
"As the Commissioner said, it is very important that a product consumed in one country should be just as safe in another country."
"It is to this end that I have worked closely with the Commission and the Council."
"I would also like to add my thanks to Mr El Khadraoui, the Socialist shadow rapporteur, because we managed to table a number of compromise amendments which, with his help and help from other Groups, have alleviated some of the problems, because there were a number of disagreements."
"As I said, my aim was to produce something that would not only lead to safety, but would also be workable and sets workable standards."
"As the Commissioner said, I have taken a lot from Directive 91/414/EEC, which covers plant protection products, and I wish to add to that."
"I am sure that the committee will – as far as possible, as we resubmit amendments – feel that they are important for the functioning of this legislation."
"I said that we are resubmitting some: we are not resubmitting all the amendments that failed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, because it was rather pointless."
"I will now go through the amendments we are resubmitting so that colleagues will understand why we are resubmitting them."
"Amendments Nos 74 to 78, which deal with temporary MRLs, bring the legislation more into line with Directive 91/414/EEC."
"I feel certain that we have managed to do this in a way that does not compromise public health, because public health is the precise aim of this piece of legislation."
"Amendment No 74 explains why temporary MRLs are needed."
"Producers have four years from inclusion of full product dossiers for re-registration."
"Amendment No 77 deals with the practicalities; the four-year procedure will be used only when Member States request it, and then it will depend upon them showing the necessary research on the product."
"This amendment fell by three votes in committee, but, if Parliament were to adopt it, it would really add something to the legislation."
"Regarding amendments resubmitted by colleagues, Amendment No 67, concerning the setting of MRLs, covers vulnerable groups."
"We are all aware that vulnerable groups need protecting, but again existing legislation covers that and therefore there is little point in agreeing on that amendment, even though I am sure my colleagues will disagree with that."
"At no time would Parliament ever take out legislation that supported that."
"Amendment No 69 concerns integrated pest management."
"There is no such thing as a set of standards on integrated pest management."
"There are, however, different types of farming, and therefore it would be misleading to say that it favours non-chemical methods, because agriculture is agriculture."
"No farmer – and I speak as a farmer – wants to use chemicals unnecessarily."
"I would add one last point that is of particular importance."
"One of the amendments tabled by Mr Lannoye concerns import tolerances."
"This is of particular importance because my brain tells me that we should not accept this amendment."
"My farmer's heart, however, tells me that we should, because it is a legal way of stopping imports into the European Union."
"I shall use my common sense and recommend that we vote against Mr Lannoye's amendment."
"My final point is addressed to the Commissioner: for those who have food, there are many problems; for those who do not, there is only one."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Sturdy for the good cooperation, which has enabled us to reach important compromises on a number of crucial points."
"Much as I welcome harmonised, simpler and more uniform legislation in the field of pesticide residues, it would be even better if we could seize the opportunity to increase consumer protection."
"Half of our fresh food contains pesticide residues, and there are increasingly more cases of various residues – up to 14 no less – in one product."
"That is why, when MRLs are laid down, more account is taken of vulnerable groups by introducing additional safety factors and by introducing aggregated parameters for additives or synergetic effects."
"In this connection, we have asked that MRLs be stipulated on the basis of best agricultural practices, particularly integrated agricultural methods involving the lowest possible dosage and spray frequencies."
"Not only should MRLs be laid down in a different way, but also more and better residue research should be carried out."
"Financial penalties when MRLs are exceeded should make their enforcement more effective."
"Finally, I think that consumers are entitled to information about ingredients, and so they are entitled to know to how many pesticide residues they are exposed."
"Measures of this kind contribute to healthier food of a higher quality for everyone."
"Mr President, I should also like to congratulate Mr Sturdy on his report."
"We have made a good few improvements: we have stronger rules for residue and we have better definitions of good agricultural practices."
"It was interesting to hear what the Commission said in relation to modern agriculture that these residues are an unavoidable factor."
"However, looking at what has been proposed, we are saying that priority should be given to non-chemical crop management, which everybody should welcome."
"With regard to aggregate MRLs, if, for example, there are two or three different pesticides, but they are all below the MRLs, the combination should say that they should not be on the market."
"That is the same logic that we have been pushing for years in relation to drinking water."
"We are glad to see that this has now been accepted."
"There are lots of pesticides, but no proper analysis is available."
"If there is no valid lab analysis and no detection methods available then the pesticides have to be taken off the market."
"Authorisation must be withdrawn on these."
"If new scientific evidence reveals a risk, the same should apply."
"Some of the amendments we tabled in committee asked for zero tolerance for imported products."
"These were rejected as the majority thought it was necessary to give specific MRLs for imported products that are not grown in the EU, such as tropical fruits."
"We have tabled this amendment again."
"I say to Mr Sturdy that the purpose of this amendment from Mr Lannoye is not about stopping imports but about protecting consumers."
"With regard to the amendment asking for temporary MRLs to be set at the lowest level of those suggested, it was not voted on in committee because it was supposed to be included in the compromise."
"We have tabled some amendments again."
"We hope we can get support for them because they would improve the overall end result."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to express my appreciation for Mr Sturdy, for his work and for his willingness to compromise."
"Permitted residue levels for crop protection products differ to a considerable degree from one Member State to another, and that is why it is a good idea to lay down maximum residue levels."
"To us, however, the amendments to the text are essential indeed."
"The Commission proposal focuses far too little on the protection of consumers and far too much on that of agricultural interests."
"I should like to bring three things to your particular attention."
"First of all, maximum values for residues must be kept as low as possible."
"Public health and best agricultural practices should be normative in this respect."
"I should like to say right now, Commissioner, that non-chemical control should take precedence over chemical control."
"Secondly, children are particularly vulnerable because their livers are not yet fully developed."
"Research in the Emma Children’s Hospital in Amsterdam has shown that certain residues can seriously hamper children’s development."
"It is therefore of the utmost importance for children to be adequately protected, and so I would ask you all to support Amendment No 67."
"Thirdly, clear and strict regulations would eliminate the current distortions of competition when crop protection products are allowed to be used."
"That would be a welcome development."
". Mr President, thank you for the broad support on the Commission proposal in this important area."
"May I express my thanks once again to Mr Sturdy, the rapporteur, and the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts in bringing this to a conclusion."
"I am heartened that we share a common understanding of the objectives to be achieved by this proposal: simplification, consumer protection and the achievement of the single market through harmonisation."
"I would also note that Parliament's deliberations and discussions echo many of the themes and issues raised in the Council discussions."
"As far as the Council is concerned, I understand that a political agreement will be sought next week and a common position before the summer break."
"Given the consistency in views between Parliament and the Council – views shared by the Commission – I am confident that we can now move forward rapidly towards early adoption of this proposal."
"We have made good progress in setting out the legal and administrative framework whereby consumers will be protected from unacceptable levels of residues whilst at the same time ensuring that there is a single market by permitting trade in agricultural commodities."
"There are seven specific topics that arose in the discussions on which I would like to focus."
"The first of these is the notion of a default limit-of-determination MRL."
"This is very important."
"By accepting the concept of a default 'zero tolerance' MRL, we have found a solution for residues of the 400 substances we took off the market in 2003 for which the remaining residues should have moved out of the food chain by 2005."
"This means that, if we do not set a specific Community MRL, we do not expect to see any residues."
"This should help to avoid nasty surprises in future and give us a legal tool to help fight misuse of pesticides."
"The application of a default MRL, however, raises a problem – what to do with all the national MRLs that we already have and that are not yet harmonised."
"Here we are introducing the concept of temporary MRLs."
"I recognise that the issue of temporary MRLs raises some anxieties, but can assure you that the European Food Safety Authority will be involved in this process."
"It does not mean that we are suddenly increasing consumer exposure to residues."
"On a positive note, the setting of temporary MRLs will finally achieve harmonisation and will centralise the MRL process, ensuring that high standards are established and maintained in future."
"Also on the positive side, our proposal aims to screen these temporary MRLs and to remove those that are clearly unacceptable whilst permitting the existing situation to continue, pending the detailed evaluations undertaken under Directive 91/414/EEC."
"Please remember that we are not changing any agricultural practices here."
"Whatever residues that have been circulating over the past ten or twenty years will still be circulating tomorrow at the same or at lower levels, but not at higher levels."
"In relation to agricultural practices, I recognise the desire that there should be a preference for non-chemical methods of agricultural production over chemical methods."
"However, this is not the appropriate text to regulate that issue."
"Directive 91/414/EEC on the marketing and use of pesticides governs agricultural production and I intend to bring forward proposals to amend it later this year."
"These proposals will be submitted as part of a package together with our proposals on the sustainable use of pesticides."
"I am sure that there will be ample opportunity at that stage to discuss the broader issue of chemical and non-chemical methods."
"It is also important to recognise the new role of the European Food Safety Authority."
"I am sure that this will improve consumer protection and the scientific basis underpinning decisions taken."
"I know what Mr Sturdy said about the support, financial and otherwise, for the European Food Safety Authority."
"The Authority should also have an important role in risk communication and provide a reasoned voice in relation to the acceptability of any risks involved."
"Not only will consumers be protected; they will be seen to be protected."
"EFSA will also be deeply involved in scientific issues."
"Immunotoxicity, endocrine disruption, cumulative risk assessments: these are emerging issues where the regulatory science is still trying to catch up with the latest advances in research."
"We will be looking to the Authority to help us make progress in this sphere, not just in the context of setting MRLs but also in the scientific data that we will be requiring in the dossiers that industry should be submitting to us under Directive 91/414/EEC."
"I have already referred to the setting of temporary MRLs as leading finally to the achievement of the single market in this area."
"However, let us not forget the global aspect."
"The Community is one of the biggest importers of food in the world."
"Consequently we also import a lot of residues."
"This proposal will set up for the first time a clear procedure for import tolerances, for assessing those residues and for ensuring that only those that are deemed acceptable will be allowed."
"This is an important obligation in relation to the WTO: any decisions taken on the acceptability or otherwise of imports will be based on clear procedures and a sound scientific risk assessment."
"Finally, the strengthened provisions on monitoring and control measures should boost confidence among all parties and ensure that we have the tools available to justify and to maintain that confidence."
"A full listing of the Commission’s position on each of the amendments is being provided to Parliament. I trust that this will be included in the verbatim report of proceedings for this sitting.(1)"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the report (Α5-0253/2004) by Mrs Ghilardotti, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament: Modernising company law and enhancing corporate governance in the European Union – a plan to move forward (CΟΜ(2003) 284 – C5-0378/2003 – 2003/2150(ΙΝΙ))."
". – Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission presented the communication on modernising company law and enhancing corporate governance in the European Union to theCouncil and the European Parliament."
"This communication responds to the report of 4 November 2002 of the High Level Group of Company Law Experts, which Commissioner Bolkestein appointed for the purpose of, precisely, recommending a modern regulatory framework for company law in Europe."
"The communication sets out the major political objectives that should guide all our future initiatives."
"It includes an action plan which lays down a timescale for a series of instruments, regulatory or otherwise, intended to be set up in the short, medium and long term, together with a grid indicating the priority of the measures themselves."
"In this proposal, the Commission has taken into account the need to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, basing its own regulatory approach on gradual application, without however, losing sight of regulatory developments at international level."
"There are two fundamental objectives sought by the Commission by reforming company law in Europe: strengthening shareholders’ rights and third parties’ protection; fostering efficiency and competitiveness of businesses."
"The main grounds underlying this initiative can be distinguished as the establishment of a more homogenous reference framework for company law in order to facilitate cross-border establishment and restructuring; the creation of conditions to prevent a repetition of recent corporate scandals – among which the scandal in my country stands out owing to its size – the consequences of which have severely affected millions of people’s livelihoods, pensions, jobs, savings and investments; making the most of the advantages offered by the internal market."
"In order to realise the first objective proposed by the action plan, it is essential to provide an effective, up-to-date system to protect shareholders and their rights."
"We must also take into due consideration the position of certain third parties, who are particularly qualified in terms of their interests: creditors and workers."
"From this point of view, the Commission’s approach to the issue of governance seems simplistic and inadequate."
"Corporate governance is presented as a problem confined solely to relations between shareholders and management, as if a business were a body solely concerned with shareholders’ interests."
"In this way it is describing a virtual company, without giving due importance to workers and without more general responsibilities towards other categories of parties with an interest in the life of the company itself such as, for example, creditors and other stakeholders."
"With regard to the second objective, competitiveness of businesses may be fostered by various elements, including the inevitable existence of an appropriate regulatory framework for company law, firmly balanced between national and Community measures. I believe that the challenge that we must meet today is to aim to bring out the distinctive, characteristic features of European capitalism in the age of globalisation."
"In other words, we need to ascertain whether there is a true European model, which differs significantly from the North American model, not because it corresponds with and emerges from a framework of challenges and issues other than those which concern everyone in a context of economic globalisation, but because it considers social consequences and implications, making it more balanced and more human: a model, therefore, which seeks to conceive of the essential core of the corporate model, represented by a company’s interests, not just as the common interest of members and shareholders but as the interest of the company itself, a company which, as an independent economic operator, is also responsible for the specific interests of all parties outside and within the company itself."
"These include employees, customers, suppliers, creditors, the public administration, in its capacity as distributor of welfare and tax revenue, and the entire civil society, which is structurally connected, by means of the general and common interest, to the company’s prosperity and continuity."
"One final comment of a general nature: we need to obtain the correct balance between self-regulation and legislative regulation when the European governance framework is formulated."
"Today there is a widespread tendency to fill regulatory gaps with self-regulation codes."
"This is positive but it does not go far enough."
"We need to maintain a system of legally binding rules, equipped with effective sanctions, applied by public bodies entrusted with the tasks of guidance and monitoring."
"The aim must be precisely to globalise governance rules and to place the public supervisory authorities into a network."
"On this basis, we have focused our attention on certain key points, which I will just mention: transparency and shareholders’ rights, role of institutional investors, promotion of the role of independent directors, the specific issue of corporate pyramids, rights of workers as particularly qualified creditors of the company and the centrality of a system of public oversight of audits."
"C. Mr President, the Commission very much welcomes this debate on company law and corporate governance and the action plan connected therewith – an action plan adopted by the Commission almost one year ago."
"We broadly support the content of the resolution which has been submitted to Parliament."
"We very much thank Mrs Ghilardotti for the quality of her report."
"This action plan is based on the firm belief that a self-regulatory market approach, based solely on non-binding recommendations, is clearly not always sufficient to guarantee the adoption of sound corporate governance practices."
"Only if there a number of tailored rules will markets play their disciplining role and ensure diligent business conduct."
"This is why, in view of the growing integration of European capital markets, a common approach should be adopted at EU level, laying down a few essential rules and adequate coordination of corporate governance codes."
"Recent scandals have therefore strengthened the Commission's determination to implement its action plan."
"My services are actively working in five areas to have proposals ready, where possible, later this year."
"The five areas are as follows: first, the role of non-executive directors; second, the remuneration of directors; third, the responsibility of directors for company accounts; fourth, the full disclosure of intra-group relations and transactions with related parties, including transparency in the company accounts of offshore special purpose vehicles; and fifth, the disclosure of corporate governance practices."
"The aim is therefore not to re-examine or reconsider the action plan in the light of recent developments, as requested in the motion for resolution; rather, it is to learn from those developments and to take due account of them when preparing the various initiatives that it contains."
"When implementing the action plan, the Commission will also take due account of the interests of the various stakeholders – to which Mrs Ghilardotti made reference – and, where appropriate, distinguish between listed and non-listed companies and large and small shareholders, as is also requested in the motion for resolution."
"It is of the utmost importance that we restore trust and confidence in the audit function."
"I am therefore pleased to see that the rapporteur agrees with the main elements of the reform which I have set out in the proposal for an eighth directive on statutory audit."
"That should allow us to proceed quickly and, I hope, reach an agreement between the Council and Parliament in a single reading."
"I know that the issue of non-audit services delivered to the audited entity is particularly delicate."
"The Commission has published a recommendation on auditor independence which sets out the conditions under which such services are still allowed."
"We need to see how this recommendation is applied in practice."
"Many Member States are in the process of transposing this recommendation into their national law."
"It would therefore not be appropriate, at this stage, to fundamentally change our approach in that area."
"However, in our communication of May 2003, we announced our intention to carry out a study that will examine whether further changes in that area are needed."
"The results of the study will be available next year."
"At that time, we shall decide whether new initiatives are necessary."
"In Europe, investors need to be better organised and more vocal advocates of corporate change."
"However, a sound corporate governance framework will not be achieved by the markets simply acting on their own, nor by the introduction of an overly prescriptive legal infrastructure."
"The challenge we are all facing here is to find the right balance between regulatory and market-based incentives and penalties."
"We therefore support the broad thrust of this resolution and we are working resolutely along those lines."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I should first of all like to thank our rapporteur, because I believe that we have here a good proposal for the position of Parliament."
"I admit that we are only at the communication stage at present."
"This is a start, but the hard part will come later."
"Perhaps people’s positions will harden then."
"However, this is a good starting position, and gives us the green light for our negotiations on this subject."
"I agree with you, Commissioner, when you say that self-regulation has demonstrated its limitations."
"Self-regulation is not enough to define the new balance that is necessary in order to organise countervailing power within the undertaking, because it cannot be the shareholders themselves who organise that countervailing power."
"In order to organise real countervailing power, you need to take all the partners into account."
"That is the thinking behind the position which our rapporteur is proposing to Parliament and which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will support with great determination."
"It seems to me that the only difficulty here is first of all ensuring that there is a willingness to organise countervailing power by achieving a balance between the various partners, but there also has to be a willingness to preserve what could be a corporate model which corresponds to the balance that has been achieved as a result of our European experience, without necessarily copying other models."
"Finally, we are moving forward here, on legislation which will be very complicated to implement, at a time when these same issues are under discussion in every Member State."
"That, I believe, is the real difficulty on which you or your successor will have to take a decision."
"How can we make our rates of progress coincide, so that what is decided in Brussels is not immediately rendered obsolete by what the Member States themselves have implemented in the context of their national legislation?"
". Mr President, the opinion given by the Committee on Industry emphasises the need for the principles of corporate governance to be dynamic and flexible."
"The subsidiarity principle should be followed in order to leave scope for distinctive national features and traditions in the area, and we must avoid central corporate governance as far as possible."
"We must not strive for harmonisation of different codes of corporate governance."
"The share of voting power for different types of share is another example of what should not be decided at EU level, as this would cause problems for small- and medium-sized enterprises, or future companies, in some EU countries."
"Instead, what European industry needs is even greater openness and transparency in governance and accounting."
"This will improve the future flow of capital and market position."
"I note that some of the rapporteur’s views conflict with the committee’s opinion, but I wish to point out that there was a broad consensus on the adoption of the opinion and that it accords well with the Commission communication."
". Mr President, successful corporate governance is bound up with a reduction in security in cross-border investments and an increase in the mobility of capital."
"For the Europe of the 25 members, this imposes the need for us to impart an overall identity to business through which its international influence will be exerted."
"This identity for Europe cannot be divorced from practices which are sensitive to social and environmental issues."
"That is why I particularly regret that my fellow members in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats rejected my proposed amendment to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in which I submitted that all directives on company law should include an obligation to inform and consult with the workers' representatives whenever important decisions are to be taken which affect the continuing existence of companies and jobs."
"It is a pity that, whenever we try to join forces with the productive system and employment interests, there is a rallying against such proposals, as if they represented a mortal danger."
"Similarly, as far as protecting shareholders is concerned, I think that, without doubt, the protection of their rights should be strengthened."
"However, and I am pleased that the Commissioner admitted this, we must in all cases accept the distinction between large and small shareholders, especially with regard to the use of modern technology in the exercise of shareholders' voting rights, given that small shareholders are more exposed to risk."
"I am delighted that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market accepted the amendment in question."
"Finally, for the same reasons, special care must be taken to address methods which result in shareholders' being cheated out of their votes, as happens with arrangements which allow for the informal organisation of systems for the representation of shareholders by large anonymous groups."
"To close, I should like to thank the rapporteur, whose basic positions I agree with."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Ghilardotti for her excellent work in committee in writing this report."
"At the same time, I would like to thank Mr Winter’s committee and the European Commission for this most excellent action plan."
"It is a very moderate and purposeful document, which quite deliberately does not try to do too much."
"I do not think we need any European corporate governance codes, it is quite sufficient if activities are sensibly coordinated and harmonised in the Member States."
"It is obvious that our systems of company law differ greatly and that harmonisation has not progressed very far as yet."
"A number of very important directives, like the fifth, have been filed away by the Council and never seen the light of day again."
"Against this background, it is of course right not to want to go ahead with a European corporate governance code, because it will not work without a common, harmonised system of company law."
"That is why I believe, and the Ghilardotti report confirms it, that the Commission has presented a very good paper here and a good action plan over all."
"There were of course some differences of opinion between the political groups in the internal debate in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"I want to make clear, however, that these were not differences of principle, but differences over how things are formulated and the amount of detail gone into."
"For example, Mrs Ghilardotti made a number of proposals, in particular for including trade union staff and social rights in the report."
"My group took the view that we should not do so in detail, because this is a paper about the company law action plan and not a social report or a social paper."
"That is why, in our group, we quite deliberately confined ourselves to a general statement on the social reasons for restricting property rights, and we believe that is sufficient and that there is no need for other social aspects to be mentioned in this report."
"In all other respects, we believe this is a good report."
"With one amendment, we as a group will be voting for this report as it emerged from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Mr President, I should explain that I am the non-executive chairman of a medium-sized regional media group in the United Kingdom."
"I will start by briefly stating what I think corporate governance will not do."
"It will not necessarily make companies perform better or more profitably, and it will not necessarily cut out criminal or unethical behaviour, but it will set down a series of criteria for corporate behaviour that are likely to enhance transparency, accountability and systems of business conduct, which in turn give the wider world, shareholders, stakeholders and others an idea of what is going on."
"That is politically essential for 20th century European capitalism, set in a social market economy."
"It is interesting how company law in the various Member States has created companies that differ qualitatively from one other."
"European company law can either legislate to harmonise this, or do nothing and let the inevitable process of convergence be driven by the market, providing no particular model is discriminated against."
"I would add that I am conscious of some of the waspish remarks made about what happens in my country."
"Against this background, the principle of 'comply or explain' is the right point to start from."
"Finally, we must not forget that in the global marketplace currently being created by the World Trade Organization, uncompetitiveness is a certain precursor of economic failure."
"If we fail to grasp this essential point we shall destroy ourselves, disinherit our children and betray Europe and our own countries."
". Mr President, there is just one point I should like to stress at the end of this debate: the matter of stakeholders and corporate social responsibility."
"The Commission's action plan is part of an overall strategy to foster the efficiency and competitiveness of businesses and to strengthen shareholders' rights and the protection of third parties."
"However, there are also related initiatives which are part of that overall strategy. They include the Commission's activities on corporate social responsibility and in particular the work of the European Multi-stakeholder Forum, set up at the initiative of my former colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou."
"It would therefore have been inappropriate to introduce under this action plan another policy framework concerning corporate social responsibility."
"What matters more is to do what Mrs Berès has asked the Commission to do, which is to take due and full account of the interests of all stakeholders in the measures the Commission will adopt."
"The action plan clearly recognises this need and the Commission is therefore committed to acting accordingly."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the report (Α5-0192/2004) by Mr Radwan, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a legal framework for a single payment area (2003/2101(ΙΝΙ))."
"Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, the European Parliament and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs fully support the aim of creating a single payment area in the European Union."
"There continue to be very significant national barriers in the form of different national regulations, national legislation and national supervision; even today, these make it difficult to create a single internal market for bulk payments, which would ultimately benefit the citizen."
"We took the first steps in this direction some time ago with cross-border transfer fees."
"That, too, required an initiative at European level."
"We also support, for example, the introduction of a single direct debit system, which has not so far been possible."
"Imagine, it is now possible for a citizen to travel to another state, but he still cannot have payments debited at home, but he has to choose a national bank to do it."
"The question is, how do we achieve this objective?"
"I am a strong advocate of the approach of incremental legislation in line with the principle of subsidiarity, with self-regulation in first place, that is self-regulation by the banks."
"We have the European Payments Council – which can, should, and indeed must set the parameters for the creation of the technical interfaces for cross-border activity, for example."
"Then, also with subsidiarity in mind, I would prefer the next steps to be taken in directives and only enact in regulations what is really necessary to do uniformly."
"I would also like to sound a warning to the industry here, since it is itself always talking about self-regulation: these requirements will also have to be complied with and corresponding standards created without undue delay."
"Consumer protection presents a greater problem in this Commission document."
"It contains some ideas which in my view go far beyond our objective, and I have the impression that there are some people in the Commission – let me make clear that I do not mean you, Commissioner Bolkestein – who have lost sight of the idea of citizens taking responsibility for themselves."
"They suggest that the bank should in future be liable for a basic transaction."
"For example, if customers buy something over the Internet and the purchase is void, they want their money back, and if they cannot turn to the supplier, they should be able to turn to the bank, which had nothing to do with the basic transaction."
"I am sure things like that can be settled by the market – and you are an advocate of the market, after all – by having products that provide safeguards; a fundamental liability of the banks in such cases should be rejected, however, as should the proposal that cardholder’s liability be limited to EUR 150 when the card is lost, regardless of how they have behaved."
"If they go away on holiday, discover on setting out that they have lost their card, and report it three weeks later, the cardholder’s liability will still be limited to EUR 150."
"I think we should give a little more protection to people who act responsibly than to those who act irresponsibly."
"I am, however, pleased to welcome the fact that the Commission has taken up the idea of establishing a single EU-wide telephone number that can be called if a card is lost – a short number that is easy to remember and that the citizens can dial quickly."
"I would also like to stress that the creation of a single payment area should not result in national structures that are working well and efficiently being made less economic."
"We must not go about it in a way that is detrimental to operational national systems."
"Coming back to consumer protection, however, may I appeal to you, Mr Bolkestein, in the ongoing discussions within the Commission, to speak up for mature and responsible citizens and see that responsibility is left with them."
"The Lisbon objectives of becoming the most innovative and fastest-growing region in the world are held up to us repeatedly."
"Everyone is brandishing the slogan ‘less bureaucracy’."
"Mr Bolkestein, the text we have before us should be judged by whether it creates more bureaucracy or makes life easier for banks and citizens in the single European Union."
". Mr President, this is the third time that I have come to a plenary session to address the issue of payments."
"An efficient and secure payment system is an essential complement to the free movement of goods and services in the European Union."
"Let me give you one figure to illustrate this."
"Every EU citizen carries out, on average, 138 non-cash payment transactions each year."
"An efficient system must be based on a robust and dynamic regulatory framework that ensures competition, consumer protection and safety in payment transactions."
"Pan-European trade needs an effective underlying payment system if it is to expand."
"The regulation on cross-border payments adopted in 2001 has made it easier and cheaper to perform many types of payments in euro within the internal market."
"However, we are not yet where we want to be and need to be."
"Significant obstacles remain, as are highlighted in our communication."
"To deliver an improved regulatory environment for payments, remaining legal and technical barriers to intra-EU payments should be identified and removed."
"In other words, the whole internal market ought to be transformed into one efficient domestic payment area."
"That is our main purpose."
"EU legislation in this field is necessary."
"But for certain issues, self- or co-regulation could be the best approach."
"That also satisfies Mr Radwan's desire for more subsidiarity."
"As always, the solution should be proportionate to the problem it is intended to solve."
"The four guiding principles for the Commission’s future regulatory proposal should be as follows."
"Firstly, to modernise the existing EU legislation on payments."
"Secondly, to inject more competition into this market for the ultimate benefit of our citizens."
"The basic idea is that the provision of payment services should be open to all appropriate providers, but without sacrificing consumer protection."
"We must therefore design an appropriate supervisory framework matching all types of payment service providers."
"The guiding principle here must be: 'same business, same risks, same rules'."
"Thirdly, we need to develop a trustworthy pan-European payment area in which consumers feel that they have the same protection, no matter where they are and what kind of payment instrument they use."
"A single and balanced set of rules should be defined on parties' rights and obligations regarding, for example, misuse of a payment instrument and revocability of payment orders."
"Fourthly, we need to incorporate the relevant Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, special recommendations into EU legislation to combat the financing of criminal activities."
"Let me stress that given their decisive contribution to the competitiveness of our economy, payments are high on the Commission’s agenda."
"We shall need the strong support of this Parliament, and in this respect I am encouraged by the terms of the resolution which has been put forward by Mr Radwan."
"I welcome all amendments submitted by Members of this House."
"I shall wind up by thanking Mr Radwan for the report which he has submitted and I assure him that, just as he wishes to have less bureaucracy, that is precisely what this Commissioner and the Commission as a whole also want."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the previous legislature, the Euro was established as scriptural (non-cash) money."
"It has now, in the current legislature, become the currency of twelve countries of the European Union."
"The creation of the single currency does not, however, automatically mean that there is a single payment area, in which the same rules apply across the board."
"This is one of the major tasks facing the European Union in the next legislature."
"The Commission waited until the last possible moment for the banking system to establish self-regulation following the creation of the single currency."
"After the Euro’s inception in 1999, however, two markets were established for the purposes of payments – a national market and an international market."
"There was no internal market governed by domestic rules regulating payments in the new currency, which, although a single currency, functioned as a foreign currency, subject to commission and other foreign exchange charges."
"This situation was partially solved by Regulation No 2560 of December 2001 concerning electronic transfers and payments."
"Since then, self-regulation still does not appear to have worked; the directives have not worked either, as they must be transposed into the law of each country, and this has not been carried out at the same time or in the same manner."
"This is an area that requires rigorous rules to be applied simultaneously and uniformly throughout the internal market."
"It is therefore my opinion that only by establishing regulations can we give the citizens and companies the security that a payment system requires."
"Mr President, it is a pity that the debates on consumer credit and on the single payment area were not combined, because the same issue is at stake in both of them: do we want to construct a European market in retail financial services?"
"Up to now, priority has been given to the wholesale market and to investment services."
"During this legislative period, the only initiative of any note – though it is an important one – has been the one on the rules for setting rates for cross-border payment transactions within the euro zone."
"This debate is, therefore, important and I believe that we must now set a clear political objective."
"That, I believe, is what the Commission wants."
"The euro cannot be a complete success unless we construct the euro zone as an internal area for payment methods."
"In order to do that, it is vital that we should achieve interbanking in the infrastructure."
"The activity of supplying payment services presupposes, admittedly, the removal of national obstacles, but at the same time it also requires prudential supervision."
"It is on that basis that the internal retail banking market, and in particular the consumer credit market, will be able to develop, and that in turn will allow European banking operators to emerge."
"Of course, within that integrated area it will be necessary to take into account the diversity of the operators involved, and in particular the special nature of savings banks and mutual societies."
"What, though, is the best way to proceed?"
"The application of the ‘country of origin’ rule with minimum harmonisation seems to us to be negative, both as regards consumer protection and from the point of view of fair competition."
"Mr Radwan’s report, which leans in that direction, gives far too much preference to self-regulation."
"On the other hand, however, maximum harmonisation would leave no room for diversity and would, therefore, also cause a problem."
"That is why I believe that the best solution is to agree on the common principles of general interest, the common concepts, particularly with regard to universal access to payment methods with a high level of security, services which are inexpensive but in which there is great confidence."
"The rules governing cross-border transactions must be precise, and intense cooperation is necessary between national regulators."
"With that in mind, there are several points in Mr Radwan’s report which in my opinion require adjustment."
"Thus in paragraph 17 the rule recommended by the Commission should be reinstated, that is, the rule restricting customers’ liability to EUR 150 in the event of unauthorised transactions where they have not given notification."
"As for pan-European direct debit, account-holders must be able to refuse a payment before it is debited from their account."
"If there is a substantial modification in rates, it must be possible to close or move an account, at no cost, at the request of the customer."
"It is also necessary to re-establish the liability of the payment service providers over the whole of the payment chain."
"Finally, it is also necessary to have stronger Community rules to combat the funding of terrorism."
"The system of complete information must, therefore, also apply to payment transfers outside the Community as well as those within the Community."
". Mr President, the Commission is grateful for the general support it has received in this debate."
"I see no further reason why I should ask more time of Parliament than I have already done."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"– A5-0213/2004 by Mr Mombaur, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on amendment of the legal basis and on the ‘general orientation’ of the Council with a view to adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply;"
"– A5-0254/2004 by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on conditions for access to the gas transmission networks."
". Mr President, ladies and gentleman, the regulation which is the subject of Mr Seppänen’s report is a most important element of European legislation aimed at completing the task of creating a fully operational competitive European market in natural gas."
"It is an essential supplementary instrument to the second directive on the internal market in gas. This is because it lays down the minimum requirements for the key aspect of the approach to liberalisation of the energy market, namely access to the networks for third parties."
"I am fully aware the draft regulation on conditions of access to gas transmission networks has given rise to a series of interesting debates over the last few weeks."
"I should therefore like to take advantage of this opportunity to clarify some issues where I believe further explanation is still required."
"It is important to reflect firstly on what the draft regulation is designed to achieve, and secondly, on why is it needed and what significance it has?"
"Clearly, the regulation supplements the directive on the internal market and fills the gap remaining."
"Indeed, both the second directive on the internal market in gas and the proposed regulation are based on the principles of non-discrimination, transparency and competition."
"Clearly, both legislative acts recognise the fundamental importance of access to the network by third parties."
"The directive, however, only defines the objectives, whereas the regulation lays down a series of minimum requirements to be met with regard to the crucial issue of access to the network by third parties."
"Obviously, a number of conditions will have to be met in order to comply with the provisions and objectives contained in the directive, as there are qualitative implications to opening up the market in addition to quantitative ones."
"These conditions are also needed to ensure the market is competitive and can be exploited in full."
"This discussion concerns drawing on the experience gained during liberalisation of the gas markets. Experience has shown that failure to meet such requirements will mean that conditions of access to the European market will not meet the needs of opening up the market in gas."
"All this has been the subject of debate at the Madrid Forum for a year. Essentially, the participants in that forum laid down the requirements."
"The latter amount to minimum conditions agreed by all those involved in the Madrid Forum. The aim is to create and guarantee a level playing field for access to this market."
"To summarise, if this regulation comes into force, in the version proposed by the Commission, there can be every confidence that the means and systems are in place to allow it to become operational."
"I must remind the House that our common aim is to create an internal market in gas within the European Union. Gas should be able to flow freely across all the networks in the Union."
"This means gas will be able to cross borders unrestricted."
"It also means that no restrictions can be placed either on its movement within the various Member States of the Union."
"This is the reason why it has been stated specifically that all transport networks are covered by the proposed regulation, not simply cross-border networks."
"Turning to the role of the gas sector in the years to come, there can be no doubt that close cooperation between the sector and the Commission will be essential."
"This should be borne in mind when it comes to defining the general standards for the gas market in the future."
"For obvious reasons, the Commission proposed the committee procedure. The latter will have no influence in this regard, however."
"It is not aimed at restricting the role of the sector and certainly not at excluding it from the drafting of future measures."
"Quite the opposite is the case. The Commission is open to proposals emphasising the role of the sector here and now and in the future."
"I should now like to turn to Mr Mombaur’s report. I shall focus on those parts of it concerning measures to ensure the security of natural gas supply."
"You will recall that last December, the Council unanimously adopted a political guideline."
"The Council also amended the legal basis for the Commission’s proposal. Article 100 is now the legal basis instead of Article 95."
"The European Parliament report we are today debating also supports the change in the legal basis."
"The House will be aware that the Commission does not endorse such a change of legal basis."
"On the occasion of the Council held on 15 December 2003, the Commission issued a statement reserving its position on the change of legal basis."
"We shall stand by our statement and position when the Council finally adopts the text of the directive in question."
"Please allow me to outline the reasons for maintaining our position."
"I shall be brief."
"We appreciate that part of the text of the draft directive refers to the security of supply."
"The text also contains references to the operation of the internal market, however."
"The Commission believes that the references to the internal market carry most weight, and that therefore they should determine the legal basis of the directive."
"In addition, the Commission is of the opinion that the text adopted by the Council contains a series of standards aimed at bringing a degree of harmonisation to a competitive European internal natural gas market."
"The Member States are charged with defining a policy to ensure the security of gas supply."
"It is also for the Member States to define the functions and responsibilities of the participants in the gas market regarding the security of supply. In addition, the Member States are responsible for introducing certain minimum standards."
"Each country will define its own standards."
"Nonetheless, a degree of harmonisation will exist, as the standards relate to certain specific criteria for gas."
"By contrast, the provisions aimed entirely at security of supply are designed mainly to deal with situations we hope will never arise. I have in mind situations such as a serious political crisis or long-term uncertainty surrounding gas supply."
"In the light of all this, the Commission remains convinced that Article 95 is the correct legal basis. The Commission therefore regrets that the Council saw fit to come to a different conclusion, and that it now appears Parliament will do likewise."
"Mr President, I should like to conclude by thanking Mr Seppänen and Mr Mombaur for all the work and effort they have put into these two reports."
"Following on from the various amendments and speeches, I shall say more on a key issue, namely access to the networks."
"In the Commission’s view, there can be no question of threatening the profitability and future investment in a most crucial element for the development of the market in gas."
"I refer to the construction and maintenance of gas networks across the Community."
"This is borne out by the proposal for trans-European energy networks. A number of the main projects for the future already adopted relate to gas networks."
"In the context of the first proposal being discussed in the run up to enlargement, the Commission endorses and supports several projects involving major interconnections between gas networks."
"Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the proposal for a regulation on access to gas transmission networks."
"It is important to have reliable rules for access to networks."
"We found that with the gas directive last year."
"My group believes the proposal should be further discussed together with the amendments tabled by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"Commissioner, there are four points I would like to recommend you consider in greater detail in the Council debate."
"Firstly, investment incentives."
"We can talk about markets here for a long time."
"If we have no investors, then in the end we have no market either."
"The Commission has often referred to the great risks carried by investors in the gas sector – exploration, pipeline construction."
"There is competition in pipelines; there already was when the monopolies existed."
"That is how the market came into being and it must remain clear that tariffs based on costs alone may deter investments."
"My second remark is please will you consider whether more weight can be given to cross-border gas transport."
"Thirdly, comitology."
"The problem is not comitology itself, but the question is whether Article 9 is in a correct relationship to Articles 3 to 8, that is whether the most important points really are in Articles 3 to 8."
"This can perhaps be improved when it is discussed in the Council."
"My fourth comment, Commissioner de Palacio, is that of course everyone who has anything to say about the market is important, regulators, network operators and above all investors, and it is absolutely clear that you talk to them before you make proposals to Parliament and Council; you always have done."
"Now they would all like to be mentioned in the legislation."
"Personally, I do not see why they should be, because I believe the Commission knows how to do its job, but if it would give those I have just named pleasure to be mentioned in a recital, then I do not really mind."
"Then I would like to say something about the other report on security of natural gas supply."
"It is correct that we depend very much on imports."
"It is therefore right that we should be concerned with this and oblige the Member States to introduce a suitable policy."
"Now Parliament has adopted at first reading a different text than the one the Commission presented and the Council has backed Parliament in the matter."
"We are therefore now speaking about a different text than the Commission originally presented and in our view this text no longer contains any rules for the internal market."
"This means that the European Union has only one way of justifying it at all, namely Article 100 of the Treaty, and, on the basis of the vote of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the committee therefore recommends that Parliament follow the Council’s lead on this."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission has made a draft Regulation on the codecision procedure for Parliament and the Council, the aim of which is to guarantee free access to the gas transmission networks throughout the EU."
"Some Member States have had problems implementing earlier decisions, and the Commission has therefore used a strategic weapon, which is to say a regulation, to guarantee access to gas networks in all countries, especially when transporting gas across borders from one country to another, but also within countries."
"The draft Regulation is mainly based on the work of the Madrid Forum, which was attended by different market participants."
"They thought they were drafting a recommendation there that would guarantee access to the gas transmission markets on a voluntary basis."
"Some of those that participated might feel let down, as a voluntary commitment was altered to a compulsory regulation in the Commission’s reading."
"There was not enough time at the Madrid Forum to discuss all the details regarding access to the networks, and new laws are to be drafted in the future under the comitology procedure without any consultation procedure involving the participants at the Madrid Forum."
"It is therefore understandable if some market participants are worried about how their interests are to be taken into account in the future."
"During the committee discussions the Commission representatives said it was the Commission’s intention that the participants at the Madrid Forum would also be heard in the future when the detailed regulations for implementing the Regulation were being drafted."
"As the Madrid Forum is not a legal body, it is the opinion of the Commission that consultations with it cannot be recorded in the text of the Regulation."
"As rapporteur, however, I think it would be appropriate if this undertaking to consult the various parties were also recorded in the minutes of Parliament’s plenary session."
"I would expect this to be done when the Commissioner makes her next speech or before the final votes."
"After a number of votes on the matter our committee adopted the position that there are good arguments in favour of establishing the Regulation and that the Commission proposal should furthermore be adopted in principle by this Parliament."
"In the votes more than 40 amendments were accepted as a basis for first reading, and Parliament wishes to hold talks on them with representatives of the Commission and the Council some time in the future when the draft Regulation is being finally agreed."
"I wish to thank everyone for their excellent levels of cooperation whilst the item for debate was being prepared."
"Although we were in disagreement with one another and had our different interests to consider, I think we managed to work very objectively and achieve an excellent end result."
"I await the Commissioner’s speech, which will hopefully reconfirm the Commission’s commitment to include consultation with the participants of the Madrid Forum in the future."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on bringing together into his report the different strands of opinion that were expressed in the debate."
"It is significant that after much debate in committee only one additional amendment has been tabled over and above those adopted in committee."
"I am one of those who accepted the argument for the need for a regulation to give effect to and make binding the voluntary code on guidelines for good practice agreed at the Madrid forum, and I and my Group therefore support this proposal for a regulation."
"The rapporteur states the case very well in his explanatory statement and I can do no more than commend his analysis to colleagues and make a recommendation to adopt."
"We must recognise that the industry was not of one view on this matter, with the incumbent network or transmission system operators resisting change, while most of the other operators, be they upstream or downstream, strongly endorsed the underlying principle embodied in the Commission proposal."
"This measure should assist new entrants."
"In order for competition to flourish and for benefits to flow from it in terms of better service to consumers, greater efficiency as regards both energy and market forces, enhanced security of supply, greater flexibility and increased innovation, there must be a clear regulatory framework."
"This measure takes us a long way towards genuine and full liberalisation and I congratulate the rapporteur and the Commissioner on their efforts in this regard."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin where Mr Chichester left off, that is that we cannot proceed fast enough with opening the energy markets."
"I believe we in this Parliament have been united on that for quite some time."
"May I remind you that last year, after more than two years’ intensive work, we adopted directives to accelerate the opening of both the electricity and the gas markets in Europe."
"I must say, however, that I and a few others, too, were then rather surprised at how quickly this follow-up proposal for a regulation concerning gas transmission networks has come."
"We are surprised because the time allowed for the Member States to implement the directive has not yet expired – it will do so in a few weeks’ time – and also because we have set a very ambitious timetable for the Commission to submit an evaluation report on the application and implementation of the directive; it was to happen in 2006."
"So much for the background."
"I want to raise three points which, I fully admit, have left me rather sceptical."
"Firstly, the compatibility between this regulation and the directive we adopted."
"Secondly, the justification the Commission has given, which I have not exactly found in the text, namely that the emphasis should be placed on cross-border trade."
"The third point that has made me rather sceptical was the proposal for a very wide-ranging comitology procedure."
"Now, after a long discussion, as the rapporteur said, we have agreed to continue working on the Commission’s approach."
"We have therefore proposed a number of amendments in the three areas I have just mentioned."
"So far as my group is concerned, the outcome is that we support the package as a whole."
"That is not the end of my group’s work, however."
"We are waiting to see what the Council does and then there will be the second reading, but we shall continue to back here in plenary these 42 amendments that were adopted in committee, and we hope that this will bring us a little further forwards in the opening of the energy markets."
"Madam President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Mombaur for his work as rapporteur on this difficult issue."
"When the legal basis of a proposal is unreliable, when the rights of the Member States are infringed in the process, and where the actual text leaves something to be desired, it is not easy to draft a sound report."
"It is gratifying to note that the Council has reached a political agreement after all, in which Parliament’s reservations have been duly incorporated."
"Last year, during the discussion of the issue of safeguard security of gas supplies, I was the draftsman of the opinion on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I then indicated why the Commission proposal was unsatisfactory on a number of scores."
"It is satisfying to see that the Council has adopted the most important recommendations to have been made during the debates."
"A first recommendation concerned the legal basis of the Commission proposal."
"The Commission took Article 95 – internal market – as its basis."
"At the time, we talked about the fact that it would be preferable to use Article 100, which deals with crisis measures."
"I think the Commission is wrong in its view that Article 100 applies only to economic and monetary policy; in a wider context, economic policy can also include energy policy."
"You stated, Commissioner, that the Commission fails to see eye to eye with the Council and Parliament."
"Do you intend to go to the Court of Justice again?"
"My second recommendation is this."
"In the Council, Commission and Parliament, the gas directive, in respect of which the Council’s common position was determined, was circulated last year."
"The proposal concerning security of supply does not appear to be in keeping with this."
"On the contrary, the proposal seems to contravene the gas directive."
"It was surprising that pending the procedure with the gas directive, a proposal was submitted to Parliament on safeguarding security of gas supplies."
"I should like to hear from the Commissioner whether the amended proposal on safeguarding security of gas supplies has been based on the gas directive."
"If so, in what way was that done?"
"– Madam President, you have to consider two things where natural gas is concerned."
"The first is availability and the second is price."
"In my opinion, we are right to take Article 100 as the basis now, even if Mr Blokland is right in saying we will have to take a very broad interpretation of it."
"Whenever security of supply is discussed, there is always the temptation really to mean that it is an opportunity to introduce indirect price controls."
"I believe that on the whole we will fail in that, because it will not work and the perspective taken is far too short-term."
"Basically, we must not forget, either, that gas is dependent on price, which is in turn tied to the price of oil, and that we may perhaps be greatly deceiving ourselves about its availability."
"The best form of security of supply is surely to have our own supplies, and we must therefore welcome the fact that work is gradually being done (a) to produce high-quality gas ourselves inside the European Union and (b) to feed that gas into our own available networks."
"Madam President, after almost 25 years in this Parliament I am standing down at the elections."
"This may well be my last speech in the Chamber."
"As a former mining engineer, energy policy has been one of my prime interests, so I am happy to be making my swan-song on an energy subject."
"I hope that Parliament will strongly support this proposal because it will play an important role in the completion of the internal energy market."
"Its purpose is to ensure fair access to networks for all market players and a genuinely competitive market for traded gas in the EU."
"The third-party access guidelines in the Annex have been agreed by Member States, regulators, TSOs and system users."
"It is therefore appropriate that the text of the regulation agreed in committee should be as close as possible to the guidelines agreed at the Madrid Forum."
"Consultation with all actors in the industry is vital if the regulation is to be effective."
"That is why they must all be consulted on the establishment of further guidelines."
"National regulators will have a vital role to play in enforcing the guidelines at Member State level, as envisaged by the Gas Directive."
"This proposed gas regulation deals with similar issues to the electricity regulation agreed by the Council and Parliament last year."
"It is appropriate that the same institutional arrangements and procedures should apply."
"I very much urge the House to approve this measure."
"Madam President, Commissioner De Palacio, Mr Mombaur, Mr Seppänen, last June the European Union adopted, with difficulty and well behind time in relation to consumers’ and European companies’ needs, Directive 2003/55/EC which takes decisive steps towards the completion of the liberalisation of the gas market."
"In order to overcome the remaining obstacles to the completion of the internal market, the Member States established a system of informal coordination between, on the one hand, Community and national institutions, and on the other, companies and regulatory authorities in the gas sector, seeking to lay down guidelines on third party access to transmission networks."
"Nevertheless, this informal coordination has proved to be inadequate to address the severe delays which have built up until now; indeed, the interests in undertakings of various countries and the privileges of position which many gas supply undertakings continue to gain from, have seriously jeopardised the possibility of completing a single market in the gas supply sector."
"We should therefore welcome the Commission’s initiative proposing the regulation which we must debate today, which makes the operating rules clearer and binding and responds to consumers’ and companies’ needs for certainty and rapidity."
"The text put forward by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy further strengthens this proposal and I therefore believe that it should be supported as it stands."
"It is in the interest of certain countries – Italy in particular – with a high consumption of natural gas, insufficient national production and a strong, growing dependence on imports, which require several countries to be crossed, to have certain rules which signify, in operational terms, a real opportunity to have a market and, consequently, a system of liberalised networks which make gas available to companies and consumers in the required amounts, with freedom of choice."
"– Madam President, I would be interested to know how we, or those who come after us, will speak about this problem in ten years’ time, whether we will have become wiser or not."
"I cannot answer that question today."
"One thing is certain: security of supply will be improved by more competition; we have always been clear about that."
"Even competition cannot do that without supply, however, which means, I believe, that security of supply, of natural gas in particular, will depend very much on a European foreign policy for energy, in other words diversification and security of supply through access to gas."
"Like many others, too, I also advocate proceeding gradually."
"I believe that, as with oil, the responsibility rests in the first instance with the companies."
"I imagine that in two years’ time there may be a review and we may be rethinking the present situation."
"I do not believe we are under any pressure of time."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, competition will of course be distorted if, for example, there is access to the electricity market but not to the gas market."
"And it will be distorted still more if we protect monopolies that then buy smaller companies elsewhere in other countries."
"We need common rules and the barriers to competition have to be eliminated, which obviously applies to all Member States."
"I also support Mr Seppänen’s request that the participants at Madrid should be consulted."
"I also think that the correct legal basis is indeed Article 95, as stated in the Commission’s proposal."
"I am astonished at this switch to Article 100, which I consider to be just an extra problem, and I hope we will go back to Article 95."
". Madam President, I stand by my earlier statement regarding the legal basis."
"Consequently, I shall focus on the various views expressed and on the amendments to Mr Seppänen’s report."
"I should like to begin by thanking the House for the discussion that evolved on a matter of such vital importance, and for the calibre of the 43 amendments. This does not mean that we will be able to endorse all 43, however."
"Thanks are also due to Mr Mombaur, who has already left the House. I do not share his views on changing the legal basis, but he certainly has worked in a most constructive manner also."
"I have to say that the Commission cannot support the amendments restricting the scope of the draft regulation to cross-border trade only. That would amount to scaling down the aim of this proposal significantly."
"The same would be true of its possibilities."
"There would be no difficulty in trading gas from one country to another, but internal competition would definitely be restricted. In a number of States, including several new Member States, gas flows along many networks."
"Some of the latter do not link into a specific point of importation. Consequently, they do not link into a cross-border point either."
"All these transport networks and the relevant companies would be excluded from the scope of implementation of the proposed regulation. This would hinder and prejudice the smooth operation of the internal market."
"In addition, the scope of implementation is that envisaged in the transit directive and in the second directive relating to the internal market in gas."
"What is at issue is facilitating competition, not only competition between the various countries but also within them."
"Restricting the scope of implementation of this regulation would entail limiting its aim significantly and also limiting the possibility of actually achieving a competitive European gas market."
"It must also be taken into account, however, that several speakers, and in particular Mr Mombaur, have raised the issue of guaranteeing a degree of profitability that would make the allocation of funds to the creation, construction and maintenance of the gas networks an attractive proposition."
"In this connection, I can say that we are able to accept Amendment No 12. We believe it clarifies our text and improves its quality."
"We feel the amendment takes account of competition between the various networks. There was no specific provision for this in our text."
"We are therefore of the opinion that the amendment helps to allay the fears of those concerned about the lack of profitability. Consequently it also allays concerns about future difficulties relating to new investment."
"I must point out that the minimum standards for access to transport networks are absolutely crucial."
"They are essential in order to facilitate access to new competitors, and therefore also to creating a genuine internal market in gas."
"I cannot emphasise this enough."
"The subject of the Madrid Forum has also been raised."
"It has been suggested that we should move somewhat further ahead."
"Furthermore, concern has been expressed as to whether, in future, the comitology procedure will result in sidelining the Forum, or sidelining the sector, that is, its protagonists."
"The House must be aware that over the years I have always stressed the need to listen to the main stakeholders on a regular basis and we are, therefore, prepared to consider a solution guaranteeing that the sector will be consulted at the Madrid Forum, together with all other interested parties."
"Amendment No 3 could prove helpful in this regard. However things eventually turn out, we have no intention of excluding the sector."
"On the contrary, we hope it will remain involved. Looking to the future, we intend to support the Madrid Forum."
"Nonetheless, we do believe that one of the proposals put to the Forum by Eurogas, relating to the ‘use it or lose it’ principle, is essential in the field of contracts. Otherwise, contracts could result in outright prevention of genuine access to third parties."
"This would mean restricting competition. Future user contracts must therefore be based also on the ‘use it or lose it’principle."
"This is the only way of ensuring they are genuine contracts and not contracts aimed solely at using or saturating available capacity. By creating artificial congestion in the networks such contracts would prevent access by third parties."
"In general, the draft regulation is in line with the Madrid Forum guidelines, as you have pointed out and recognised, ladies and gentlemen."
"The amendments that clarify or support the provisions of this draft regulation are acceptable, at least in part or if their text is adjusted."
"This is true of Amendments Nos 1 and 22, and of many others I shall not mention individually."
"A detailed list will be provided."
"Concerning certain technical issues such as those dealt with in Amendments Nos 14 and 16, these are matters dealt with by the European Association for Gas Exchange. The latter was set up at the request of the Madrid Forum."
"I have to say that given the very specific, complex and technical nature of these issues, we shall continue to leave them to the aforementioned organisation to deal with."
"It has already made significant progress, and is reporting regularly to the Madrid Forum."
"We believe this is the best way to deal with such matters."
"There are practical and legal reasons why amendments such as Amendments Nos 8, 17, 22, 27, 30, 35, 37 or 42 are not acceptable. Finally, we cannot agree to the presentation of new guidelines on the remaining issues dealt with in the draft regulation in a predetermined time period."
"Some of these issues may require studies to be undertaken. Discussions and negotiations on others may take longer than anticipated."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the last debate on fundamental issues concerning energy to take place in this Parliament. There will of course be a debate on Eco-design later."
"To some extent, however, that is a side issue, bringing together industry and energy."
"It tends to be always the same people taking part in these debates, and we have come to know each other fairly well. I should like to congratulate Mr Seppänen, the rapporteur, and also to thank all the honourable Members present for their input and support over the years."
"Their contributions were most welcome and have been incorporated into many of the proposals drafted during this period."
"I feel Parliament’s constructive attitude and the helpful interchange of ideas have resulted in considerable improvement to most of the proposals brought before the House."
"Personally, I have valued your help, ladies and gentlemen, and also the Commission’s constant support."
"It is worth remembering that, thanks to this constructive attitude, it has been possible to make spectacular progress during these last years. The Commission’s adoption of the Green Paper marked a turning point."
"Parliament’s report on the Green Paper was of the utmost importance too, as were the conclusions it led to."
"I could mention the gas and electricity liberalisation packages. There were also the crucial accompanying measures, such as access to the networks."
"Work on the latter is just drawing to a close. As Mr Linkohr, Mr Rapkay and several other speakers have mentioned, we would have liked to wrap up earlier on this."
"Nevertheless, our goal is in sight and we are moving slowly but surely towards it."
"Along with the liberalisation of gas and electricity, the proposal concerning trans-European networks is essential in order for the European internal market in energy to become a reality as far as infrastructures are concerned."
"The relevant measures dealing with the current Union have been adopted already. Work on similar arrangements for the enlarged Union is well advanced."
"We have worked as never before to debate and promote matters relating to energy and the environment."
"In the past, in other parliaments, the tendency had been simply to set goals for this key area."
"Many good intentions were expressed, but there was a lack of specific proposals aimed at attaining the objectives."
"We have succeeded in translating those pious statements and good intentions into texts, obligations and responsibilities."
"By way of example, I could mention the promotion of renewable energies, energy efficiency in buildings, issues related to biofuels, the creation of intelligent energy, Eco-design and energy efficiency."
"Community policy has come into play too."
"This has been most important."
"Good progress has been made concerning Community policy on nuclear safety. The work is not yet complete, but much has been achieved."
"A further issue related to the European energy market on which substantial progress has been made concerns the adoption of a European objective with regard to the security of energy supply."
"Mr Linkohr referred to this when he took the floor. Furthermore, the importance of ensuring security of internal supply within the Union has been recognised also."
"We have worked well together. Madam President, I am bound to thank the House once again for its cooperation, for all the effort it has made and for its valuable contributions."
"In particular, honourable Members are to be commended on the intellectual skills and depth of knowledge they displayed in tackling the texts, which have sometimes been extremely complicated and technical. They demonstrated an excellent grasp of the issues, and I believe congratulations are in order."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"You were kind enough to say how much you appreciated the excellent collaboration with the European Parliament and especially with the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"I think I can say, on behalf of the members of that committee and on behalf of the European Parliament as a whole, how much we too have appreciated being able to work with you in the field of energy and in other fields."
"Your feelings, I believe, are reciprocated by the Members of this House."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0171/2004) by Mrs Thors, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a framework for the setting of Eco-design requirements for Energy-Using Products and amending Council Directive 92/42/EEC."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft directive establishing a framework for setting out the environmentally-friendly requirements applicable to energy-using products is somewhat innovative. I should like to thank Mrs Thors and Mr Turmes for their excellent work within their respective committees, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the Committee on Industry External Trade, Research and Energy."
"The aim is to find the right balance between two elements."
"On the one hand, there is competitiveness, environmental protection and consumer protection, within the context of sustainable development."
"On the other, the various environmental issues related to products."
"It is important to guard against passing problems from one area to the other."
"There must be an integrated approach to the issue."
"All the Community institutions must work together too."
"That is the way to ensure the co-legislators can agree to mandating the Commission with regard to the adoption of measures to be applied to specific products."
"I should like to highlight the main features of this proposal. As its title indicates, the proposal is aimed at improving the environmental behaviour, what could be termed the Eco-design, of energy-using products."
"The free movement of products meeting the requirements, the protection of the interests of consumers and the competitiveness of our economy are essential, however."
"We appreciate that the correct implementation of these proposals could prove extremely beneficial to all parties."
"There are a number of reasons why this could be the case."
"Industry will be motivated to improve the environmental characteristics of products with a significant capacity for self-regulation."
"Thanks to the large market in investment and design improvement, fragmentation of the market will be avoided and investment will pay off."
"Further, the measures will be aimed at swift compensation for the consumers and will take account of the nature of the market in the enlarged Union."
"This is probably the first time that a proposal provides a consistent global legislative framework thus avoiding thematic legislation. The latter can sometimes prove contradictory."
"Integrated product policy aims to avoid risks of this kind."
"Energy consumption is one of the main ways in which products interact with the environment. I am glad this has been emphasised in the discussions in the various committees charged with considering the proposal."
"I have in mind for example rapidly-changing technologies and arrangements for consulting stakeholders. I could also mention the development of self-regulatory alternatives for a range of products that is, in our view, too wide to be dealt with through codecision."
"It would be too slow and therefore less efficient to attempt to do so."
"I shall comment in detail later on the amendments the House is to table. At this point, however, I should like to say how very constructive I feel the debates in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy proved."
"Particular congratulations are due to Mrs Thors, to Mr Turmes and to all the rapporteurs, for trying to reach agreement at first reading."
"Madam President, Commissioners, it seems to be ladies’ night here this evening."
"The aim of eco-design is to integrate technical possibilities when they are at their greatest."
"More than 80% of environmental damage is determined at the manufacturing stage of a product."
"We learnt this whilst considering this Directive."
"We also know that the EU has adopted many rules to eradicate dangerous substances."
"We have rules on waste management with quantitative targets for recovery and reuse."
"It was a relatively natural course of action, then, for the committee to lay a certain emphasis on energy consumption, in particular, in its consideration of the proposal."
"I should like to make a point of this, as strong criticism seems to have been levelled at our work, stressing the energy aspect."
"This is against a background in which energy consumption has continued to increase substantially in most parts of Europe, and many Member States are having difficulty meeting the Kyoto objectives."
"New tools for saving energy are important, therefore."
"Latest reports in my home country indicate that it is set to exceed the CO2 emissions quota for the 2005-2007 period by 14%."
"Criticism has also been levelled at the ‘top-runner’ approach that we have used here."
"I believe, however, that there is a great deal of misunderstanding about what we mean by this."
"We want the leading and best technology as a yardstick for future implementing measures."
"This forms a framework for decisions, but does not exclude anyone from the market."
"On the contrary, I think that we have a system that leaves scope for continuous improvement."
"The report is also criticised for not having heeded the three pillars of sustainable development."
"It is said that we have given priority to the environment at the expense of social and economic issues."
"That criticism is wrong, and I think that this is self-evident if one studies what we say about the life-cycle approach and our support for small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"We are aware of the economic issues, the social issues and the possibilities, but also the risks."
"When all is said and done, early attention to environmental issues, as the Commissioner also said, is more economical than many other methods of environmental governance, for instance subsidies, and also labelling, unfortunately."
"It has become apparent that we obtain very little value for money from subsidies at the intervention stage."
"I should also like to point out that, just as we did when we were considering the Green Paper on Integrated Product Policy, we have given our support here to measures applicable to SMEs."
"We also call on the Commission to establish a database in order to facilitate the incorporation of the life-cycle approach and eco-design into the activities of all enterprises."
"This is an innovative concept."
"The scope is broad, but in actual fact what we have here is an organised regulatory framework for how to proceed, how to choose what is important and how to set requirements in the future: the prototype for good governance, in other words."
"There have been no objections here in Parliament to the fact that the European Parliament will not in future be determining how much energy a product should consume."
"On the contrary, we are saying that this will be determined where there is the expertise."
"In my opinion, what we are proposing is an important simplification."
"Self-regulation also has a role to play, in Parliament’s view, but only if it produces better, faster results than would the regulated procedure."
"Unfortunately, although I did not quite catch what the Commissioner said at the end, I do not think that this Parliament will at any rate be able to reach agreement with the Council at this reading, and that means we lose a fair amount of time."
"We had wanted to make faster progress, and we want the Directive to define a work plan, including for the products that are responsible for 40% of carbon dioxide emissions."
"We want to proceed quickly, as it is our opinion that much time has been lost."
"I wish to thank my fellow Members for their constructive cooperation on the preparation of this report."
"I should like to express my thanks for your understanding when I took over from Mrs Ries, who became Belgian State Secretary for European Affairs."
"I should also like to thank the Commission for its goodwill in wishing to reach a speedy agreement with the Council."
"I also think that we have been very united, and that has been a great strength."
"Our views still differ on a number of small points, for instance with regard to the legal basis and conformity assessment, but we shall not let the details obscure the fact that we have been united."
"Parliament wants rapid progress and wants to implement the necessary measures promptly."
"I hope that the Council, and Parliament with the new Members elected after us, will be able to reach swift agreement on this so that there is no further delay to these important measures."
". Madam President, the design of appliances, IT systems and industrial motors is crucial not only for climate change and security of supply but also for the overall economy in Europe."
"This offers the single largest potential in respect of climate change, and also the most immediate potential because turnover times for such appliances are sometimes two to three years and at most ten to fifteen years, which is much quicker than for energy infrastructures."
"It also represents the cheapest potential, because the additional money spent on upgrading a design is more than compensated for by reduced electricity costs during its life cycle."
"Unfortunately, the European Union is lagging behind other economies, such as Australia, the US and Japan."
"Even China now performs better on standard-setting than the EU."
"We are pleased, therefore, that the EU Commission has come forward with this proposal and that Parliament was able to strengthen the proposal."
"A good eco-design directive is important not only for Europe but also for the world."
"There will soon be between 500 and 700 million new middle-class citizens in India, China and other such countries, so the single biggest challenge for the world economy is to be able to offer efficient demand-side products, such as appliances and computers."
"Otherwise we can simply forget about climate change."
"This also constitutes a huge opportunity for European industry because it will open up an enormous market."
"Unfortunately, sections of European industry have been lobbying for a weak directive."
"Why?"
"These are the same industries that want to delocalise production to India, China and similar countries."
"This shows that the same industrialists who do not care about the global environment also do not care about creating added value and jobs in Europe."
"I hope the Council will not give in to these lobbyists."
"– Madam President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, cutting the amount of energy used by appliances is to everyone’s benefit."
"It benefits the environment, enabling us to meet our Kyoto targets faster and more cheaply, and it benefits the consumer, because he saves on his electricity and energy bills."
"It is also an opportunity for industry to put innovative products on the market, especially if we have uniform standards here all across Europe."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats therefore greatly welcomes the European Commission’s proposal and we expressly thank Commissioner de Palacio, for her commitment."
"Like the other groups, however, we would like a few changes to the Commission’s proposal."
"We want greater clarity about what the Commission will actually do with these powers in the next few years."
"For that reason, we would like a list of products that will be subject to implementing measures in the first few years if there are no voluntary agreements to achieve the same objective faster."
"We want the text to contain fewer vague legal terms, and above all we want very strict supervision of the market; that is a priority for the PPE-DE Group."
"We cannot have a situation, with this or other matters, where honest people eventually lose out, where a person who only applies the EC mark when he really keeps to the rules is punished because others stick the mark on without complying with anything."
"That is why there must be extremely severe penalties."
"We must have better controls and the requirements must be such that they actually can be controlled."
"We must be ambitious, because only then will there be no motivation for individual Member States to go beyond the minimum standards."
"That is why we are being flexible in the matter in voting for the two legal bases tomorrow if the aim is ambitious, and the Council’s reaction discourages me a little here."
"I am very disappointed that the Irish Presidency and the Council as a whole are being so hesitant."
"It will encourage individual countries to go it alone."
"I do not think that is a good thing."
"We need common European standards, and I must personally say that in my ten years’ work in the European Parliament I have seldom seen the Council behave so destructively or a presidency handle a matter so badly."
"I appeal to the Council and above all to the Irish presidency, which unfortunately is not represented here today, but perhaps someone can pass the message on, to be guided by Parliament’s amendments, at least when working on the common position in June."
"If they do not do that, if the Council simply ignores these amendments, then we will have a rag bag of national rules, we will miss the Kyoto targets and consumers will continue to waste money unnecessarily on power and energy."
"Then the Irish presidency will have failed on this point."
"Its last chance is to really follow Parliament and I strongly appeal to it to do so."
"– Madam President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer the rapporteur my most sincere congratulations and also my thanks."
"She has taken on a very difficult and highly complex dossier at relatively short notice."
"Coordination in the European Parliament has not suffered at all as a result."
"We have already heard a large number of good arguments this evening for why it is so important for our environment and for the creation of incentives for industry that we should adopt this directive quickly."
"I therefore share my fellow Members’ disappointment that no agreement was reached with the Council at first reading."
"I understand that it is of course a very difficult dossier for the Member States, too, but we in the European Parliament have shown that, despite starting from very different positions, it is possible to come closer on very important issues."
"One point on which we have not been able to agree and where tomorrow’s vote will show what the European Parliament’s position is, is the question of the legal basis."
"For me, it is quite clear from the title of this directive that environmental protection is one of its priorities."
"That is why I do not find it satisfactory to take only Article 95, the internal market article, as the legal basis."
"If we want a good environment and energy policy, it makes no sense to put Member States that are more advanced or have stricter requirements in a particular matter on a leash and shackle them."
"I know that the debate between those present has already been closed, but I would like to underline once again here that I and my group think it is very important to have two legal bases if there is to be a better environment and energy policy in the Member States."
"Madam President, industry complains about regulation and interference from Brussels."
"I can hardly think of legislation more likely to cause concern to some manufacturers than that which indicates in such detail how they will make their products and what minimum standards of energy they must achieve, with lots of detailed specifications still to come, appliance-by-appliance, determined by the comitology procedure and very much out of the public gaze."
"How do we justify interference in the private market on such a scale – interference and the setting of standards that go far beyond health and safety requirements?"
"I believe that the potential benefits of energy-saving, of making more efficient products and of reducing carbon dioxide emissions speak for themselves."
"I am concerned that in an attempt to reconcile the different requirements of Member States – between hot countries and cold countries – the Commission may come up with compromises that set standards well below the best that can be achieved."
"I urge the Commission to be ambitious."
"This is a positive move."
"In selling it to citizens and consumers alike, there is a simple message: by cutting energy use we can help them save money and we can all contribute to do our bit to save the planet."
"Madam President, I would like to focus on one specific issue."
"We have talked in broad terms of the importance of this report and the importance of the global effects it might have."
"But let us look at one small issue and how this report could affect it: let us take a look at ink-jet printer cartridges, probably one of the most widely used products in the world."
"The reality is that all the large manufacturers are using every trick in the book to prevent consumers getting a fair deal, at the same time undermining the need to improve energy efficiency, which is a crucial element in protecting the environment."
"The manufacturers need this legislation to make them do the right thing."
"There is big money at stake here."
"On average a refill cartridge can be sold for about half the price of a new product, and the consumer should have the change to reap the benefits."
"We need amendments in this report to ensure that those cartridges are refilled."
"Research carried out by organisations such as the Consumers' Association has highlighted the kinds of tactics adopted by some of these big-name companies."
"For example, the installation of microchips which suggest that cartridges are empty and even in some cases stop printers working, when in fact they have plenty of ink left."
"This is a waste of resources and a waste of energy."
"Surveys demonstrate quite clearly a variety of different costs of different printer operating systems, all brought about by operators using these methods which oblige the consumer to buy printer cartridges over and over again, instead of reusing and refilling."
"If we can build into the new eco-design legislation a requirement that cartridges must be refillable and recyclable, it will be a major step forward in both protecting the rights of the consumer and benefiting the environment."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to reiterate my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Thors. Congratulations are also due to Mr Turmes, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"I certainly believe that what we are concerned with here is a major initiative. It could have a real impact on the aim of decoupling growth from increased energy consumption."
"Significant savings in energy consumption can be made. I agree with the honourable Members who pointed out that presenting an overview of the whole process is the best way to avoid deluding ourselves."
"After all, there is no point in economising in part of the process of creating a product or in part of its useful life if the end result is a negative overall balance."
"A detailed list of the Commission’s position on the various amendments will be forwarded to the Presidency(1). Nonetheless, I should like to say a few words on some of the issues raised and discussed in the course of the debate."
"I would like to make it clear to the House that I had hoped this text would be agreed with the Council, and I did my best to ensure agreement, as this would have enabled the text to be adopted at first reading. The fact is that when it came down to it, the Irish Presidency encountered serious obstacles to achieving our objective the first time round."
"Nonetheless, I feel it is very likely that this text will be adopted at second reading, should it prove impossible to adopt it at first reading. As many honourable Members have pointed out, the matter is urgent."
"It is essential to put this new Community regulation in place once and for all. In addition, comitology procedure must be launched."
"The procedure needs to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to subsequent change and technological development. It must also be able to provide an appropriate response on more specific matters."
"On the subject of comitology and lack of control by Parliament, I should like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that we are party to global generic agreements concerning good legislation and the institutions’ capacity to forge links between themselves. I believe these agreements provide sufficient assurance that there will be no deviation or real difficulties regarding the implementation of these measures."
"As to the legal basis, Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has confirmed that Article 95 of the Treaty is the only appropriate legal basis for this proposal."
"I endorse this view, and hope you will too."
"These are the key issues I wished to mention. I must emphasise the urgency of adopting this measure."
"I very much hope that by the time we meet again in June, the Council’s common position will be as close as possible to the proposal put forward by Parliament itself. Adoption of the text at second reading should then be fairly straightforward, always supposing it is not adopted at first reading."
"I hope adoption will be possible as soon as the new Parliament assembles. The text certainly needs to be adopted before the end of this year."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.(2)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0154/2004) by Mr de Roo, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending the Directive establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community, in respect of the Kyoto Protocol's project mechanisms."
". Madam President, first I should like to thank the European Parliament and especially the rapporteur, Mr de Roo, for the work on the report and, in particular, the very constructive attitude in the negotiations on the compromise package, which should allow us to reach a first-reading agreement on this important proposal."
"A first-reading agreement on what is termed a 'linking' directive will have been reached within a mere 10 months, confirming the European Union's strong continuing commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and its flexible mechanisms."
"A first-reading agreement reaffirms the high priority that the European Union gives to taking concrete action to tackle climate change."
"It will provide an important signal to our partners, in particular developing countries and economies in transition, including Russia, of our continuing support for the Kyoto Protocol and our firm intention to tackle climate change multilaterally."
"It will assist our partners in their sustainable development through the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and know-how."
"The compromise package before Parliament will give an important boost to the Kyoto Protocol and its project mechanisms: Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism."
"It will create a demand for credits from JI and CDM projects by allowing around 12 000 companies across Europe to use Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism credits for compliance with their obligations under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme."
"By doing so it will enhance the cost-efficiency of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme in a way that also benefits developing countries and economies in transition."
"I want to emphasise that the agreement being discussed today is fully consistent with the Kyoto Protocol's implementing provisions, which are usually referred to as the Marrakech Accords."
"As you know, the Kyoto Protocol contains no provisions on how companies can use JI and CDM credits."
"This directive now clarifies how this will be implemented by the European Union."
"The compromise package before you is very delicately balanced."
"It addresses Parliament's concerns by providing a careful balance between the quality and quantity of the Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism credits to be used in the EU trading scheme while at the same time keeping it robust and simple."
"The Commission would now ask you to support this compromise package and, in doing so, take another determined step in strengthening the European Union's response to the challenge of climate change."
". Madam President, I should like to start by thanking my fellow shadow rapporteurs: Mr Davies of the Liberals, Mr Bowe of the Socialists, Mrs Garcia-Orcoyen Tormo of the Christian Democrats and Mr Blokland of the EDD Group."
"I am indebted to them for the unanimity and support."
"I would thank the Irish Presidency for its constructive way of negotiating."
"I also wish to thank the Commission, which has cooperated well, although it is not formally obliged to do so."
"I am also indebted to Commissioner Wallström."
"We have reached an agreement at first reading."
"I will list nine points."
"In my view, the result is sound."
"Point 1: this linking directive enters into effect as soon as 2005."
"Companies can start now; they are given legal certainty now."
"Point 2: this linking directive is independent of the coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol, as is the law on emission trading."
"For us in Europe, Kyoto is starting to take effect now."
"We will not wait until Russia ratifies Kyoto."
"One hundred and twenty countries, two-thirds of the world population, have already ratified Kyoto."
"Point 3: energy companies and large firms can now earn emission allowance by investing in the switch from Chinese coal-fired power stations to gas, in making coal-fired power stations more effective, in solar power stations in Indonesia, in wind farms on the coastlines of developing countries or in retrieving spent gas from rubbish tips."
"There are many more possible ways to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gases."
"Point 4: we have followed the Kyoto Protocol in deciding that the construction of nuclear power stations is not permitted."
"Point 5: carbon sinks are out of the question because – or so this House sees it – growing trees are only an interim solution."
"Trees fall over or burn down."
"Even if trees die a natural death, they expel all the carbon absorbed."
"Biomass or bio-fuels, however, are very much an option."
"Governments can also gain experience with sinks."
"Point 6: large hydro-electric power stations are only possible if the criteria of the World Commission on Dams are observed."
"Although hydropower actually helps in the fight against climate change, ecological and social criteria should also be taken into consideration."
"On this score too, we are stricter than the Kyoto Protocol."
"Point 7: the agreement that the Member States have to make half of their Kyoto efforts in their own countries and half abroad, has been re-confirmed."
"Agreements only to commit industry to the ceiling make no sense, because this leads to governments, at least some governments, making 50% of their investments abroad, with industry making a further 25% of the countries' investments abroad."
"Ultimately, only 25% will be invested at home and 75% abroad."
"By acting in this way, we would put our ecological credibility on the line."
"Point 8: outside Europe, there is a great deal of interest in our system of emission trading and in this linking directive."
"Fifteen states in the United States and four provinces in Australia intend to set up comparable emission trading systems."
"The Commission will be examining whether they can plug into our European system."
"The same applies to Canada and, hopefully in future, also to Japan."
"In that way, a start is being made on the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol before it enters into effect officially."
"Point 9: we will need to extend the scope of the emission trading system to include aviation and subsequently also road transport."
"This is preferable to opting in favour of domestic Joint Implementation Projects, as is being suggested by some."
"Finally, the French Government and French industry have no faith in this linking directive."
"Neither has Greenpeace."
"This is old-fashioned dogmatism."
"I am pleased that all political groups, the Council of Ministers and the Commission have more insight and are prepared to support this compromise."
"Climate change is deteriorating by the day; we must act in unison."
"For climate change, it makes no difference where the greenhouse gas is produced."
"Armed with this linking directive, we will now enter upon the worldwide struggle to solve the climate issue."
"Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and I hope that one reading will suffice."
"I would like to concentrate on just one thing, namely sinks."
"I disagree on this point."
"I have just returned from a trip to South America as part of an official delegation."
"Surprisingly enough, they have been looking very closely at this Linking Directive, at any rate in some of the ministries, and I was repeatedly told how important it is for them that sinks, in other words forestry, should be included."
"I can see why."
"If we included forestry, it would be an extraordinarily great help not least in fighting poverty in those countries, or in creating alternatives to drugs in places where they are cultivated."
"I would also like to mention that just under a year ago France concluded an agreement with Colombia which did include forestry; there is therefore a conflict between Parliament and the Council of Ministers that we will not survive in the long term."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now some two years since the Emissions Trading Directive opened up a new way forward for the most polluting sectors of industry. These sectors were to become involved in the struggle to reduce emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere."
"This represented a complex first step that was only taken recently. It was certainly necessary if the European Union is to make progress towards meeting its commitments on climate change."
"It is true, however, that a climate of fear and misgiving developed with regard to practical implementation."
"This is why the changes contained in this linking directive are so significant."
"The present linking directive allows the implementation of clean development projects. It also provides for the recognition of emission reduction certificates."
"The linking directive sends out an important political signal from the European Union to the developing countries, indicating that, by way of these projects, developing countries are likely to obtain far more substantial aid than they probably do at present for environmentally friendly development. A message is also being sent to the sectors concerned making it clear that the European Union really does intend to implement the means to facilitate involvement in trading in emissions rights."
"In addition, he conducted excellent negotiations with the Council. I trust all this will bear fruit tomorrow and that a majority of the House will vote in favour at first reading."
"Consequently, the flexible mechanism is not as flexible as it ought to be. The rapporteur is aware of this, as we have discussed it together."
"I have in mind firstly domestic or national projects, implementation of which has been restricted to rail networks."
"I feel it could have been possible to accept a far wider range of situations without detriment to the spirit of this directive."
"I also feel excessive caution was exercised when deliberating on the admissibility and implementation of hydro-electric projects."
"I believe such projects are needed in these countries, and that they are adequately provided for in the Marrakesh agreements."
"Further, I agree with Mr Linkohr that sinks are called for in these countries too, and that excessive caution has been exercised in this regard also."
"One of these is the solution of the problem of supplementarity. I could also mention the capacity of the Member States to organise themselves, share common objectives and determine the best mix of appropriate policies in order to achieve them."
"I believe this is an excellent result, and would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again."
"Madam President, I welcome this agreement."
"It is absolutely essential to ensure the workability of the emissions trading system when it starts in January 2005."
"I want to congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done."
"I have seen a lot of rapporteurs and he really has done a very good job."
"He has secured an agreement with the Council which is a practical compromise and which will reap considerable environmental rewards whilst providing for industry a great deal more certainty than the original proposal."
"I am happy that we have been able to retain the cap on the number of credits issued."
"It is a sensible solution allowing Member States to monitor and control the market and make sure it is not flooded."
"On specific issues, I believe we have been able to persuade the Council of the need for greater reflection on whether to include domestic projects."
"The guidelines we have laid down there are useful."
"As regards 'sinks' I feel we have the best possible deal: a prohibition on companies using credits from land-use projects and carbon forest sinks until at least 2008."
"We will find this is a very difficult thing to calculate and we need time to look at it more closely."
"Concerning big hydro and nuclear projects, it seems disappointing if we wanted the allowances for such projects excluded permanently from the scheme, but in reality Parliament has been able to ensure that the projects and the take-up within the European scheme are at least in line with Kyoto and the World Commission on Dams and the Marrakech Accords."
"It is not really a bad result."
"Our message to EU governments is clear: real, environmental improvement through emissions reductions must be brought about by long-term, sustainable effort at home and not by cheap, ill-advised and potentially detrimental projects in the poorer countries."
"Member States: we will be watching you!"
"Madam President, no sooner had agreement been reached with the Council, than Greenpeace, the WWF and the RSPB were denouncing it as inadequate and calling on Members to throw it out."
"Some Members may vote against it when the time comes, but they will probably come from amongst those who tend to put the interests of industry before those of the environment."
"I am not really sure whether WWF counts them amongst its friends."
"I took a certain malevolent delight, especially with the election approaching, in our Green rapporteur having been denounced by Greenpeace for his work, but personally I congratulate him."
"He has done a great job in keeping all sides of this House together."
"Of course the agreement is weak, but we have to start somewhere."
"The reality is that we know there was resistance, even amongst some Member States, towards the implementation of these measures."
"I am glad that the EU is still trying to lead the world on the whole issue of climate change."
"However, the real issue is, firstly, that we have to get some sort of agreement up and running and, secondly, that we have to move forward."
"I am concerned about what will happen if the Kyoto Protocol does not come into force."
"That is the key question that the Commissioner is seeking to address this week with colleagues."
"Can we persuade Russia – the crucial element in the equation – to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol and bring it into force?"
"I do not like having to give in to ransom demands. However, for once, it might be a price worth paying."
"Madam President, last year, Mr Moreira da Silva, who was at the time a Member of this House, concluded an agreement with the Council on the trade in greenhouse gases."
"That was not easy, because the agreements that had already been reached in a number of countries with industry to reduce greenhouse gases had to be incorporated in European policy."
"Today, or in actual fact, tomorrow after the vote, what I see as a fresh agreement will have been reached and new arrangements will be in place by means of which emission trading will be extended to include third countries."
"I am proud that we, the European Union, have demonstrated that we are serious about Kyoto and that we not only conclude agreements but also live by them."
"We, in Europe, have adopted defensive policy in the environmental field for too long."
"With the new CDM – Clean Development Mechanism – instrument and joint implementation, we can once again take the lead on the world stage."
"Thanks to the development and export of clean technology, we are creating a new market for cleaner production processes."
"Our European industry stands to benefit from this."
"However, I expect the transfer of environmentally-friendly techniques also to help developing countries to introduce sustainability and it will also bring them more prosperity."
"The exchange projects that can now be implemented with the developed countries or with countries in the process of moving towards a market economy, expand the market on which emission is being traded and thus reduce the costs per reduced tonne of greenhouse gas – a high environmental yield at the lowest possible costs."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also in discussions involving the rapporteur, much has been said about the risks which placing the reductions outside of one’s own Member State can entail."
"Since we have now agreed at European level that joint implementation and CDM are all too supplementary, we have to settle for the review that has been arranged."
"What matters now is that industry takes what is now available."
"Mr de Roo has done his level best, on which I should like to congratulate him warmly."
"He has made sound negotiations possible, for which I should like to thank him."
"– Madam President, Commissioner Wallström, before turning to the de Roo report I would like to say a word about emissions trading in general, about the Moreira da Silva report, which Mrs Oomen-Ruijten also mentioned."
"In the Moreira da Silva report, Parliament proposed introducing an upper limit, a cap, for the national allocation plan, and we wanted every country’s national allocation plans to set the same limits."
"Unfortunately, the Council rejected the amendment at the time."
"That is one of the reasons why we are now faced with a situation where we have a hotchpotch of national allocation plans which are not really compatible with each other."
"Many Member States had still not notified a plan by 31 March at all, and some have submitted plans that are far from ambitious."
"I would like to expressly support you, Commissioner Wallström, in your commitment to encourage the Member States to implement the spirit and content of this directive, and if necessary bring proceedings before the European Court of Justice to oblige them to do so."
"Even though Parliament’s amendment was not adopted verbatim, the requirements of Annex III do not in fact allow industry to be granted generous increases in emissions."
"It is therefore very important that you keep your eyes open here."
"We have also written a letter to that effect to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi."
"We cannot allow industry in those Member States that are relatively ambitious to suffer because a few Member States continue to believe they need not do anything at all; something must also be done at home, important as Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism are."
"This brings me to the de Roo report."
"I believe the de Roo report is an important step forward in international climate policy."
"We are strengthening the Kyoto process and we have also shown that there are certain limits here."
"Unlike Mr Linkohr, however, I believe we were right to stick to the position of not including sinks."
"You are almost always right, Mr Linkohr, but I believe you have miscalculated here, even if you are a physicist."
"In emissions trading itself we have an emission factor of zero for biomass, which means you do not need certificates at all if you burn biomass."
"Biomass burning gains a great deal from that."
"If we now also pay money for planting trees, we have deceived ourselves and are not protecting the climate."
". Madam President, firstly – and you have heard me say this before – we will have to live with the issue of climate change for a very long time – maybe for generations."
"It will pose a challenge to humanity for generations to come."
"It is important that the European Union should continue to show leadership on this issue."
"We should continue to demonstrate that we are willing to take action at home and internationally, that we believe that a truly global problem also requires a global solution."
"We will also have to be cost-efficient."
"To be credible, we will have to look at the most cost-efficient solutions; this is part of that process, and in doing so we will be able to mobilise all the various groups of stakeholders."
"This will help us to do so."
"My thanks for this again go both to the rapporteur and to the whole European Parliament."
"I would like to comment on two points mentioned during the debate."
"First of all, Russia."
"As has been mentioned, a team of Commissioners will be going to Russia later this week in order to discuss a number of issues, including many areas of cooperation with Russia."
"We should not wait for Russia – that is true – but the 120 countries that have ratified are not waiting; they are actually carrying out actions on the issue of climate change already."
"However, we should of course keep up the pressure on Russia and make it clear to the Russians that they hold the key to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, that what they do is important, and that we are counting on them."
"Therefore we will continue to work on that."
"The other issue is an important one: the argument about sinks and our position on sinks."
"Again, I am satisfied that our position on sinks is consistent, since in all the negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol we have remained rather sceptical on sinks – at least until such time as we can monitor and control sinks and count them reliably."
"That is one of the arguments, the other being the temporary nature of sinks and emission reductions from them."
"We have also pursued our line in this proposal and I welcome that."
"These are the arguments."
"We still have too many uncertainties, and we have to clarify those; but of course they are in the Kyoto Protocol, and one day I hope that this will also be another opportunity for Brazil and other countries."
"However, as long as we do not have full knowledge, we should be careful."
"This will be another effective instrument within our climate change policy."
"Thank you, Commissioner Wallström."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Madam President, there are more than 63 of us who, as Members of the European Parliament, have tabled a motion of censure on the Commission, not because we lack confidence in all the Commissioners but because it is the only means we have of attributing responsibility for the Eurostat scandal."
"We ask the Commission to attribute responsibility itself and, if it will not do so, we are obliged to table our motion of censure covering everyone."
"There are two further signatures verified by the services, and there are two that the services are declining to verify and in connection with which we have delivered written confirmations. There should now, therefore, in any case be 64 signatures with the services, and the Bureau thus has no other choice than to note that a motion of censure has been tabled with 63 signatures, in other words the necessary number of signatures."
"I hope that the President is in a position to note that the 63 signatures have now been obtained and that the services are not interpreting the Rules of Procedure properly by trying to get people to withdraw their signatures."
"We have noted what you say."
"We shall of course look more closely at the issue, check the names and come back to the matter tomorrow."
"The next item is a report (A5-0265/2004) by Mr Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on batteries and accumulators and spent batteries and accumulators."
". Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for his report."
"The Commission proposal for a new battery directive seeks to extend the scope of the existing Community legislation on batteries and accumulators containing certain dangerous substances to all batteries and accumulators placed on the Community market."
"Today the existing legislation covers only 7% of all the portable batteries sold each year in the European Union."
"This has hindered the setting up of efficient national collection and recycling schemes."
"Consumers have also been confused as to what is to be collected, and what not, and have therefore not participated effectively in the national collection schemes."
"Consequently, today many batteries still end up in the environment."
"In 2002, for example, approximately 45% of the total volume of portable batteries sold in the 15-member EU was landfilled or incinerated."
"The current proposal aims to achieve a high level of environmental protection while at the same time contributing to proper functioning of the internal market for batteries."
"In this respect the Commission's proposal has two main goals: creating a closed loop system for all batteries and accumulators, and introducing a producer responsibility scheme."
"The proposed closed loop system requires Member States to take all necessary measures to prevent final disposal of spent batteries and achieve a high level of battery collection and recycling."
"I am confident that the proposed collection targets for portable batteries, in combination with the proposed high recycling targets, will protect our environment against the risks involved in the disposal of those batteries."
"Moreover, the proposal addresses the issue of the uncontrolled disposal of hazardous batteries containing mercury, cadmium or lead."
"In this respect, in addition to the existing restrictions on the use of those substances, established by the end-of-life vehicles directive, the following additional measures would be introduced: a ban on landfilling and incineration of all industrial and automotive batteries, which covers most batteries containing lead or cadmium, and an additional collection target for portable nickel-cadmium batteries, which requires monitoring of the waste stream to determine the volume of discarded portable NiCad batteries."
"The extended impact assessment has identified the proposed policy options as the most sustainable from an economic, social and environmental viewpoint."
"I turn now to the introduction of a producer responsibility scheme."
"The application of the producer responsibility principle is an important step towards incorporating the external environmental costs into the production phase and, at the same time, towards encouraging producers to market more environmentally friendly products."
"All batteries and accumulators should be diverted from the waste stream and recycled in order to avoid environmental damage and recover the various metals they contain."
"To achieve this goal, we need to create a closed-loop system and make battery producers responsible for the products they make."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I should like to elucidate my report on batteries and accumulators."
"At the European Parliament’s emphatic insistence, there is at long last a proposal by the European Commission."
"A number of points of the Commission proposal can be seen in a positive light."
"First of all, all batteries fall within the scope of the directive."
"Secondly, there are binding collection targets."
"Thirdly, recycling percentages and recycling efficiencies are binding, and fourthly, producer responsibility plays a major role in the financing mechanisms."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we have held an extensive debate on batteries."
"More specifically, we discussed the avoidance of the use of heavy metals and collection targets."
"Agreement has been reached with all groups on most points in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Even about the collection targets for batteries, we have reached a broadly supported compromise."
"Since the sales figures for batteries differ quite considerably from one Member State to another, certainly after 1 May, a decision has been made in favour of proposing a percentage of the sales as the collection target."
"As far as the avoidance of the use of heavy metals is concerned, developments have been underway for years."
"EU legislation now stipulates that the heavy metals mercury, lead and cadmium are prohibited in materials and parts of vehicles which are brought onto the market after 1 July 2003, as well as in new electrical and electronic appliances which are brought onto the market after 1 July 2006."
"The key problem involving batteries and accumulators is precisely the presence of mercury, lead and cadmium, which are heavy metals."
"On pages 9 to 12 of the explanatory note to the Commission’s proposal, the harmful environmental and health effects of mercury, cadmium and lead are clearly described."
"For that reason, most batteries containing mercury were already banned in 1998."
"The guiding principle underlying drafts of the Commission’s revised battery directive has always been a ban on nickel-cadmium batteries."
"Surprisingly, the present Commission proposal has not opted for a ban on these, but for a so-called closed-loop system for cadmium."
"However, there does not appear to be a closed-loop system since only 80% of portable nickel-cadmium batteries need to be collected."
"Consequently, 20% of portable nickel-cadmium batteries end up as landfill or in an incinerator."
"Since cadmium is a volatile metal, it will, in the case of waste incineration, inevitably end up in the atmosphere."
"That is why the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has introduced a ban on mercury, cadmium and lead."
"In addition, we have included an extensive list with exceptions for cases in which no effective substitutes are available."
"This includes batteries for hearing aids, emergency lighting, industrial batteries, lead accumulators and cordless power tools."
"Although I personally do not think the last exception to be necessary, I have added it nonetheless in order to accommodate objections from a number of Members."
"The substitute for nickel-cadmium batteries, namely nickel-metal-hydride batteries, operate at a temperature of -20° Celsius to +60° Celsius."
"As such, I can assume that these batteries can be used across the entire European Union."
"Finally, I should like to react to the comic strip of the European Portable Battery Association, in which it is suggested incorrectly that all kinds of applications would no longer be permitted if the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy were to be adopted."
"I have an old – four and a half years old – mobile telephone."
"This old telephone contains a lithium-ion battery."
"I am almost certain that the batteries in all your mobile telephones are nickel-metal-hydride or lithium-ion."
"In short, if nickel-cadmium batteries are prohibited for these applications, there is no problem whatsoever."
"Another example from the comic strip is that of lead accumulators in cars, which are not prohibited in the directive on end-of-life vehicles."
"Neither are they prohibited in the framework of the battery directive, because, as you heard a moment ago, they are included in the list of exceptions."
"The same applies to button cells in hearing aids and watches, cordless power tools, emergency lighting and all industrial applications."
"Even the European consumers’ organisation BEUC is in favour of a ban on nickel-cadmium batteries for consumer applications."
"Although, as you are aware, there are plenty of alternatives, I noticed that industry is, in principle, against a ban, to such an extent that they are opposed to it to this day, even though all the exceptions they required have been made."
"I take the view that such arguments should not play a role in the decision-making."
"I suspect there is a dangerous tactic behind this."
"In this respect, it is worthy of note that industry, which is so very much resistant to a ban on nickel-cadmium batteries, is promoting alternatives for these on their own websites."
"We should therefore also promote these alternatives, namely by excluding harmful heavy metals from batteries as much as possible."
"– Madam President, I have to admit that before I entered the European Parliament I was involved with nickel-cadmium batteries for ten years."
"We even built a factory and I took out a number of patents, which have now expired."
"I therefore have no economic interests to register."
"I also have to admit that at the time we did not give much thought to what was to be done with the things later."
"I therefore believe we are right to be looking at how such batteries can be recycled."
"I would advise you not to ban things, however, but to introduce alternatives more quickly, and such alternatives exist in theory."
"Small fuel cells may easily come on the market this year or next and they contain no heavy metals."
"They also come from the same firms as make nickel-cadmium batteries, at any rate many have experience with them, and that would be my recommendation, instead of rushing straight to a ban."
"Madam President, batteries form part of our everyday lives."
"In fact it is fair to say that the development of portable electric power, particularly rechargeable electric power, has revolutionised our lives."
"Each one of us is probably carrying two or three batteries – in our phones, in our watches, in our car key fobs and maybe there are even one or two heart pacemakers in this Chamber."
"Batteries have made a contribution to safety."
"Cordless power tools have made building sites much safer and often in the case of power failure we rely on batteries for back-up lighting or emergency power."
"Recently I was at a nuclear power station where they have a battery the size of a building which provides the back-up power in the event of a power cut."
"I would like to congratulate the Commission on its proposal which is balanced and in proportion to the problem."
"In particular, I congratulate the Commission on the way it addresses the problem of waste."
"Some countries like Belgium have successfully removed batteries from the waste stream."
"We should take care to look at the cost of this."
"In Belgium it costs at least twice as much to collect the batteries as the actual value of the batteries themselves."
"We need to have a market-led solution so that we do not find we are collecting things just for the sake of it."
"As with most waste issues in my country, the United Kingdom's record is pathetic."
"When adopted, I hope that the targets set by the Commission will be met and we do not repeat the situation we had with old fridges when the directive gathered dust on the shelf until it was too late to implement it in time."
"I also hope that the UK government will correctly fund the local authorities which are charged with the task of collecting these batteries."
"I support some of the amendments."
"In particular, my Group supports the move not to set recovery targets based on an arbitrary number of grams – 160 grams for every country."
"Such a one-size-fits-all policy would be bizarre in countries such as the Baltic States where the battery market is not even half of 160 grams."
"To set the recovery targets based on a percentage is a much more sensible approach."
"However, my Group will not support the amendments to Article 4 with regard to the bans on heavy metal."
"Firstly, the alternatives are not developed in every single sector."
"In the case of power tools in particular the alternative batteries have not performed as well and we would see tools having a much shorter life and being thrown away sooner than at present."
"Secondly, in the United Kingdom we have had a number of studies on pollution looking at landfill and incineration."
"Although we have cadmium in the environment, the source of cadmium from batteries is not significant."
"If we wanted to cut back we would need to look at fossil fuels, fertilisers and the metallurgical industries."
"Lastly, the timescale."
"Batteries which are sold now will not come into the waste stream for more than 16 years."
"Therefore the heavy metal ban does not solve the problem in the short term."
"– Madam President, Commissioner Wallström, we are indeed using more batteries, and that is causing us problems."
"Firstly, we want to make batteries environmentally friendly to use, and secondly we do not want them to make our waste problem worse than it is."
"This in fact means that we need a strategy that ensures that as few batteries as possible are landfilled, and secondly we must see to it that innovations are made in battery production."
"I therefore also support the Commission’s approach of including all batteries in the legislation and of ensuring there is producer responsibility in battery production."
"I also agree with the many compromises we have reached together with the aim of making the collection and recycling of batteries better organised so that our waste problem will actually be reduced."
"There are a variety of opinions in the House about how to encourage innovation and avoid heavy metals."
"The important thing is that we send the signal that we want batteries that do not harm the environment, do not contain heavy metals and are easy to recycle."
"Parliament must send this signal clearly so that the battery industry will innovate."
"That can of course also be done using various deposit schemes, with a higher deposit charged on hazardous battery systems than on the others."
"In the end, however, the consumer must also play his part."
"Madam President, despite the threat of a no-confidence motion, I hope that the Commissioner will not cancel her airline tickets to Moscow."
"Lobbying has been intensive and persuasive over this issue."
"I must admit that my views on points of detail have changed many times, but I have come to the conclusion that, while backing a closed-loop recycling system for cadmium batteries in the medium term, we should be looking in the long term for the replacement of such batteries because of their toxicity."
"The many exemptions I shall be supporting show that I consider this approach to be a measured and balanced one."
"We must be careful not to set a level of lead so low that it will effectively prohibit the use of batteries containing even trace elements of lead for important purposes, notably in hearing aids."
"I have no doubt that we will, in practice, be able to resolve these questions as we consider the legislation further."
"I should like to touch upon the issue of collection targets for portable batteries."
"I am deeply cynical about these."
"I have been lobbied by the British Local Government Association, which wants me to support proposals for much higher targets – this from an association representing local authorities that currently only collect 12% of household waste."
"It all seems ridiculous."
"As we know, Member States all too often agree to what should be legally-binding targets in the certain knowledge that the pathetically cumbersome enforcement procedures that the Commission has at its disposal will mean that they never actually have to meet those targets within anything like the timescales proposed."
"As I have been saying for the last five years, we have to find better ways of getting ministers who sign up to these agreements to keep to their word."
"Madam President, cadmium is extremely toxic."
"In the water framework directive, we, that is the Council, Parliament and Commission, have decided to impose a gradual ban on cadmium."
"Why do we not do the same here?"
"The Commission has proposed a closed-loop system, but the rapporteur has already pointed out that only 80% is being recovered, which means that 20% must be disappearing into the environment."
"The Commission proposal is flawed in another way, namely the extraction of cadmium – a tiny amount of it – from the waste stream, which is huge; that is an extremely inefficient way of working, and so it is better to work on a ban and introduce a few derogations later."
"Lithium-ion and nickel-hydride batteries are already on the market."
"In future, fuel cells will become available too."
"The alternative is thus in place."
"What is more, the market share of the alternative is already growing."
"That is why it is very regrettable that the Commission has succumbed to the pressure from part of the industry."
"European politics should reward the pioneers in industry and not those lagging behind, as the Commission is doing."
"Unfortunately, rewarding those lagging behind is exactly what the Christian Democrats and the Commission are doing."
"I hope that the majority in this House will know better."
"Madam President, cadmium is a dangerous chemical."
"It is carcinogenic and can cause serious damage to the nervous system."
"It also bioaccumulates, which means that it stays in the body and builds up over time."
"High exposure can cause severe lung, prostate and kidney cancer."
"The use of cadmium should therefore be banned."
"At the very least a ban on cadmium in household batteries would help to reduce cadmium levels and promote the use of alternatives in batteries over time."
"These alternatives to cadmium are what we really need, and they already exist."
"Cadmium pollution of the environment carries very high health and economic costs, including water purification costs."
"These costs – or more correctly these potential savings – must be taken into account when considering the cost of a ban on cadmium batteries."
"If one looks at the dangers of cadmium one realises that we must seek out alternatives."
"There are alternatives and the only way we will achieve them is to impose a ban."
"In the long run this is the right approach to take for the sake of public health, consumer protection and the environment."
"The propaganda we have heard, which is completely simplistic and totally inaccurate, does nothing to help the debate, wastes the money of those who are trying to promote the opposite approach, and will not work."
"I hope that the Members of this Parliament will not be swayed by this simplistic rubbish."
". Madam President, I have distributed a list to the secretariat indicating which amendments are acceptable to the Commission(1)."
"I will limit myself to commenting on two issues that have been raised during the debate and explain once more why the Commission did not propose a ban."
"As you know, the Commission carried out an extended impact assessment in preparing this proposal. It has assessed the sustainability of different policy options, including a substance ban."
"It is important to recall that in this proposal the Commission has maintained a general restriction on the use of mercury in batteries, in line with the existing Battery Directive."
"The restrictions in the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive also continue to apply, so the provisions are there."
"However, on the basis of this impact assessment, a substance ban for other batteries was not chosen for the following reasons: a substance ban can only be considered if viable substitutes exist."
"At the moment, these substitutes do not exist for all applications."
"A ban would always be limited in scope and would never be able to cover all hazardous batteries."
"As we have already heard, a substance ban might not cover cordless power tools, emergency lighting and industrial applications."
"In fact, a ban would only represent around 16% of the total nickel cadmium battery market and less than 6% of the total lead battery market."
"A large percentage of these hazardous batteries are currently in use or stored at home."
"It is estimated that 60% of rechargeable portable batteries are 'hoarded' or stored at home."
"They would not be covered by the ban and would still risk ending up in the environment."
"For cadmium batteries, the substitutes have a shorter lifespan and are more expensive, so that would create more waste and extra costs for consumers."
"These are the main arguments as to why we chose a closed-loop solution."
"We have proposed this closed-loop system for all batteries."
"That should ensure that batteries no longer end up in the waste stream but are collected and recycled instead."
"For industrial NiCad batteries the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the proposed ban on landfill and incineration."
"Those are our main arguments."
"I suppose that this will be debated from now on, but we all seem to agree that it is important to monitor what is going on and find the best solution to make sure that these hazardous substances and batteries do not end up in the waste stream."
"They must be taken care of."
"I thank you for your work on this report and for the debate."
"Thank you, Commissioner Wallström."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is a report (A5-0261/2004) by Mr Wijkman, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on Integrated Product Policy – Building on Environmental Life-Cycle Thinking."
"Madam President, Commissioner Wallström, environmental policy has so far been relatively successful in dealing with point source emissions from factories, power stations etc. It is a different matter where non-point source emissions are concerned, that is to say the effects of the consumption of goods and services."
"The problem we face is that total pollution in society, especially due to our habits of consumption, is increasing all the time."
"The European Environmental Agency has recently shown that the volume of waste in the fifteen Member States has increased by 15% since 1990."
"In spite of the fact that we have reduced pollution and are using energy and materials more efficiently, the gains are quickly being eroded by increased growth."
"Because the world’s gross domestic product is expected to increase by three or four times in the next 30 to 40 years, we must do something radical if we are not literally to be buried beneath an ever higher mountain of waste and pollution."
"The Integrated Product Policy we are debating in this House today offers excellent opportunities for creating a framework of incentives to get us to move away from production and consumption models characterised by a consumerist approach to linear resource flows and, instead, to embrace resource efficiency, waste minimisation, controlled use of hazardous substances and expansion of the stocks of natural capital."
"If this is to happen, the Integrated Product Policy must, however, be based upon a long-term vision of how we are to change our industrial production model."
"I think that what we have learned is that it is not sufficient to pollute a little less."
"We must strive to achieve patterns of production and consumption that are clean in themselves."
"The advantage of an Integrated Product Policy is that it involves a comprehensive approach, that is to say it tackles the whole product chain from the extraction of natural resources via product design and the production phase itself to the stage at which the product’s useful life is over."
"The Commission’s proposal has a number of good features, but is still not sufficiently proactive."
"It seems as if the Commission has partly rejected the Integrated Product Policy in favour of the thematic strategies."
"I see it not as an either/or but as a both/and."
"We need the thematic strategies, but we also need a framework for the Integrated Product Policy in order to hold the policy together and to be a driving force in its actual implementation."
"In general, environmental policy and also energy policy must become far more coherent and consistent."
"We now have an abundance of directives and regulations, but too little attention is given to the bigger picture."
"In its proposal, the Commission talks about using voluntary methods as far as possible."
"EMAS and ISO are obviously constructive, but research shows that they are not enough."
"On the Commission’s model, voluntariness is also linked to market forces, that is to say to working with the market."
"Because it is extremely rare for environmental costs to be factored into the prices, the market does not, however, operate satisfactorily."
"Companies must be given direct incentives, that is to say be able to earn money from developing environmentally adapted products."
"That is rarely the case at present, in which case how is the market supposed to be able to help?"
"In its communication, the Commission talks about improving information for consumers."
"That is good, but it is naïve to believe that better labelling and better environmental information will solve this problem."
"I myself have been involved in developing environmental labelling in Scandinavia, and I know how difficult it is to implement it on a broad front."
"As I see it, we need to place the Integrated Product Policy within a dynamic framework that supplies guidelines for policy in general and provides support for the thematic strategies."
"This framework should be characterised by a clear vision, based partly on the following principles."
"Firstly, a systems-based approach, of which life-cycle thinking is the very core."
"Secondly, an enhanced understanding of how natural systems and the eco-system work so that companies’ product and business models might be adapted along biological lines."
"Thirdly, the optimisation of the product design process by the selection of materials that have as little environmental impact as possible."
"Fourthly, the principle that products whose useful life is over must be broken down into their component parts and either re-used or, if they consist of biologically degradable materials, progressively integrated into natural cycles."
"Finally, much more thorough use must be made of the increase in information in order to promote greater efficiency when it comes to the use of energy, materials and dematerialisation."
"It is especially important to note the opportunities presented through learning from, and copying, nature."
"I do not have time to go into this now, but there are a number of examples where companies now make use of these principles, bring about perfectly clean solutions and, moreover, earn money from doing so."
"Madam President, during the discussion in the committee, the Commission’s representative pointed out that sights are not set primarily upon a framework directive."
"I regret that."
"I am convinced that a framework directive is needed, and I hope that, under Commissioner Wallström’s leadership, the Commission will think the matter over and realise that it is important in the long term to bring about a horizontal, political framework that is of help in environmental work overall."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament’s draft report supports life-cycle thinking and provides sound guidance on how the Commission should further develop the Integrated Product Policy over the next few years."
"We have put a lot of effort into finding a better name that will tell the uninitiated something of what this is about, if only that it is an important task."
"I really do appreciate the efforts that have gone into this report, particularly the work done by the rapporteur, Mr Wijkman."
"In the Commission communication, we emphasise that it was necessary to show how the Integrated Product Policy can operate in practice, and we have also said that we wish to use two methods to do this."
"Firstly, we wish to carry out a couple of pilot projects that bring together different actors to discuss, and preferably also to implement, measures that reduce these special products’ environmental effects."
"Secondly, we are in the process of drawing up a European inventory of those products that have the greatest potential for improving the environment."
"Such an inventory can help us direct our efforts at the most important products."
"The report contains many interesting insights."
"Allow me to comment on a couple of important ones that show the link between the thematic strategies and this proposal, also mentioned by the rapporteur."
"I should also like to describe how I see the link between the Integrated Product Policy and other initiatives mentioned in the report, particularly the two thematic strategies: the strategy on the sustainable use of natural resources and the strategy for waste prevention and recycling."
"My long-term vision for these three areas is really quite uncomplicated."
"I believe that the strategy on natural resources should include the general problems linked to the issue of how we are to break the link between economic growth and environmental damage."
"The strategy must state what is to be done to break this link and establish general objectives concerning the way in which natural resources are to be protected against over-exploitation and pollution."
"The Integrated Product Policy must then transform these resource-focused objectives – do not forget that natural resources provide us with minerals, food, water and clean air – into practical measures for reducing products’ and services’ effects upon the environment, at the same time as creating business opportunities."
"It is of no consequence that we are beginning to prepare an Integrated Product Policy even before the resource strategy is ready."
"As we said in our proposal, we can do a lot right now."
"I also believe that the strategy on waste and recycling should be more clearly focused upon the environmental and market problems that arise in that part of the life-cycle."
"This does not mean ignoring the products’ whole life-cycles."
"On the contrary, the measures taken here must take account of environmental effects throughout the life-cycle, with the Integrated Product Policy being applied."
"Nor, therefore, do I think that the Integrated Product Policy should embrace resource-based objectives."
"I think that these are better placed within the resource strategy. Nor do I believe that the Integrated Product Policy should advocate the use of certain materials, irrespective of whether they are bio-based materials, composite materials or other materials, because there is then a danger of ignoring the life-cycle dimension."
"Secondly, I wish to emphasise that I do not believe that this is the right moment to prepare a framework directive on the Integrated Product Policy."
"Alongside the issue of what, realistically, can be part of such a directive – it should cover a very large number of tools and concepts, as well as its being possible to monitor compliance – I believe quite simply that it is too early to decide whether such a framework directive is necessary."
"However impatient we may be, I believe that we must wait a little and see how different actors apply the Integrated Product Policy in practice."
"That applies to industry, governments and consumers."
"If they do not make use of the opportunities it offers, we can consider a strategy with less of a voluntary basis, but I believe it is too early to draw conclusions about this at present."
"In 2007, the Commission will review the two points I have mentioned, as well as the whole of the Integrated Product Policy."
"If it appears necessary, we shall make changes."
"For example, we might place greater emphasis upon services, recommend a framework directive or change the Integrated Product Policy as a result of the discussions concerning the thematic strategies."
"Moreover, I believe that the rapporteur’s contribution contains many important points which should definitely do more to direct our overall thinking as we face the future."
"– Madam President, Commissioner Wallström, I strongly support Mr Wijkman."
"If we really want to enforce sustainable production, we must think in life cycles and not in individual products."
"That is why, Commissioner Wallström, we also need a structural framework for the building site."
"If you look at it now, what we have is a building site with the various building blocks scattered on the ground."
"We have EMAS, we have eco-labels, and for batteries we have decided on eco-labels again."
"Then we have limits, then for cars we have enhanced environment-friendly vehicles."
"We have the public procurement system, but nothing dovetails."
"Consequently, businessmen and consumers are of course not exactly clear how this integrated production is supposed to benefit them; that is why I can only strongly support Mr Wijkman."
"We need a framework for the building site so that these building blocks will fit together and a sensible structure will result."
"Only then, I believe, will we be able to persuade manufacturers to change their production methods and finally have environmentally friendly, sustainable production."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is a recommendation for second reading (A5-0234/2004) by Mrs Lambert, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation on the coordination of social security systems."
"Madam President, I regret the late hour for the debate on this topic which is actually going to affect the lives of many of our citizens, but the core group of the 'friends of Regulation 1408' are still here and recognise its importance."
"This piece of work on the coordination – not harmonisation, as some of my colleagues would like us to believe – of social security systems has been lengthy."
"It started life in the previous Parliament and then changed to codecision and unanimity in Council in 1999."
"I trust that this simplification and modernisation of the much-amended regulation in the past will provide a useful and very constructive framework in a further enlarged European Union."
"I wish to thank sincerely all the shadow rapporteurs and other Members for their serious work and ultimately constructive approach to this regulation."
"I also want to record my thanks to the Commission for its willingness to support our work with time, information and explanation."
"In Council, too, we have seen an increasing willingness to approach this reform with some spirit, which I know was not shared by all Members back in 1999 when I first met with representatives and Member States in Helsinki."
"I would remind Members that Council informed the chairman and members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – in writing in a letter dated 31 March and indeed verbally after that – of its agreement to the amendments here proposed to the common position and to the Council statement on taxation to be entered in the Council minutes should agreement be reached on the adoption of the regulation."
"I trust that tomorrow we will confirm the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at its last meeting."
"As we know, the restrictions concerning this regulation have caused us some problems: the fact that tax cannot be tackled within it raises particular problems for some cross-border workers, especially as we see tax and social protection systems increasingly interlocking in some Member States."
"The fact that we cannot build bridges between systems means that some people will still feel that free movement is not sufficiently supported and that will mean at least more work for the Committee on Petitions."
"However, mutual recognition, whether for family status or status as a person with disabilities, for example, will also continue to be an issue."
"We also recognise in Parliament that we have not achieved the full flexibility we had hoped for with regard to access to benefits in kind for frontier workers and their families."
"While we realise that the fact that Member States must now explicitly register in Annex 3 if they do not wish to provide such a service demonstrates that this is a deviation from the norm, we view such refusals with concern."
"I am sure that this is an issue which will be taken up in the next Parliament when we see the Commission's proposals for the currently empty Annexes 2, 10 and 11, and for the implementing regulation."
"We trust that work will progress as speedily as possible so that the full revised proposal may come into force within the next two years."
"However, we believe that the common position as amended in committee is a positive step forward."
"There has been no regression on the status quo: all persons covered by social security schemes are now included – not just paid workers."
"The positive steps taken for third country nationals – Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report – are also there and were in the original Commission proposal."
"There is greater clarity concerning cross-border healthcare, and the European Court of Justice decisions on the criteria concerning medical necessity are there."
"The adoption of the assimilation of facts and events will be of benefit to frontier workers in particular and the number of derogations and exceptions has been reduced, despite our concern about the future development of the Annexes."
"There are clear criteria now concerning special non-contributory cash benefits."
"The principle of good administration has also been introduced."
"This is a complex but necessary piece of work and it helps to answer the question of what the European Parliament does to benefit people."
"Despite certain reservations, which many of us in the House feel, I commend the common position, as amended, to the House and wish future rapporteurs on the subject the same degree of support and interest that has been offered to me as your rapporteur."
"In conclusion, in a strange sort of way, I found this challenging and interesting experience quite fun at times."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am most satisfied with the substantial progress which has been made on the present proposal, both in the Council and in Parliament, and with the fact that we are now coming to the final stage in its approval."
"Achieving the objective of official approval by the Council and by Parliament before the 1 May is of the greatest importance, for numerous reasons."
"The most important is that it will send out a clear message to the citizens in both the present and in the new Member States, demonstrating that the European Union is both willing and able to set appropriate conditions for the real free movement of persons, the cornerstone of which is the coordination of social security systems."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lambert, on her truly excellent report on such a technically difficult issue as the coordination of social security systems."
"I should also like to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for its work."
"As you know, the European Commission, in the amended proposal which it submitted last October, took account in full or in part of most of the amendments approved by Parliament at first reading."
"As regards the two amendments within the framework of the second reading, they clearly improve the quality of the text and the Commission can therefore accept them in full."
"In addition, I can assure you that the Commission is also in a position to accept some of the remaining concerns and considerations expressed by certain members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at second reading, within the framework of the proposal for a new executive regulation which the Commission will submit by the end of this year."
"I hope, as Mrs Lambert also said, that both the regulation and the three annexes will be approved by 2006."
"The common position of the Council responds to the main objectives of the Commission proposal, which entail simplifying and improving the coordination of social security systems, for the benefit of European citizens moving around within the Union."
"The simplification and modernisation of the present regulation are the basic to the promotion of the mobility of labour in the Union."
"They are therefore closely connected with the general objective of competitiveness, of more and better jobs and of social cohesion."
"It is a fact that the present regulation provides protection in the social security sector for persons moving for any reason – personal or professional – from one Member State to another."
"It is therefore important to the overwhelming majority of European citizens."
"I do not intend to enumerate all the improvements which the new rules will bring about compared with the present regulation, but we can focus our attention very briefly on three issues."
"The new rules will apply to all citizens in the European Union covered by a Member State's social security system."
"The application of the coordination rules to all insured persons will satisfy the need for Regulation No 1408 to be brought into line with developments in the freedom of movement within the European Union, which is not just a right for workers, but is also a reality for all European citizens."
"The new rules will strengthen the principle of equal treatment of nationals of the European Union by introducing a provision governing the cross-border recognition of facts and incidents."
"This provision is particularly important for cross-border workers."
"The current regulation does not contain clear provisions on good administration."
"The new rules remedy this shortcoming."
"These rules in fact require increased cooperation and mutual assistance between the agencies in the Member States for the benefit of citizens."
"In addition, agencies will be required to reply within a reasonable period of time to all questions and to provide citizens with any information requested in order to exercise their rights."
"Finally, I should like to say that this was indeed a long and difficult procedure which is coming to a successful end and I must thank you once again for bringing such a laborious task to a speedy conclusion in your capacity as joint legislator."
"Madam President, I reluctantly agree with what is now on the table."
"I wanted more and better proposals on a number of scores."
"Nevertheless, I have noticed that a number of important achievements have been made, and I would thank Commissioner Dimas for his responses."
"The regulation that is before us applies to all EU citizens."
"That is progress."
"I have noticed that it has not only been expanded in terms of scope, it has also been simplified."
"That too is progress."
"I gather that on paper, a clear distinction has been drawn between the exportability and non-exportability of cash benefits."
"Furthermore, I think that problems could well occur when the annexes are further detailed."
"I still regret the way in which, last time, Mrs Gillig and her Socialist colleagues refused even to bring this point to a vote in a democratic manner."
"I therefore fear that we will have problems when the annexes are fleshed out."
"There are major improvements in this regulation for frontier workers."
"I can see the legal implications of what has now been established."
"For example, certain events in a Member State must be treated in the same way by the country of residence as similar events that have taken place on their own territory."
"That is progress."
"I have also noticed that the position of the family members of frontier workers has, in fact, been turned round and that they now have rights too."
"In an annex, however, those self-same rights are being nullified, so the progress made in the regulation is invalidated in the annex."
"I have the feeling that we could have achieved more had we consulted all protocols, for example, in the field of tax levies and social premium levies."
"I know that the Council is against it, but we could have kept this all together."
"I can see that, in a number of respects, the Court of Justice’s judgments have been much more clearly incorporated into this regulation."
"I also gather that the Court’s health-care decrees have been assimilated effectively."
"I do have a problem, though, with the way in which outpatient care has been treated, in contrast with what the Court states."
"In addition, unemployment has been better highlighted, although to a lesser extent than I had expected."
"Third-country citizens are now included, but my report had already proposed that."
"I have recommended that my group should vote in favour, on the condition that I am given every opportunity of introducing improvements where possible when the introductory regulation is fleshed out and also in the annexes."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly."
"Madam President, this simplification and modernisation has proved to be an arduous task."
"I should like to congratulate all those involved, particularly Parliament’s rapporteur, Mr Cornelissen and his team, the Irish Presidency and a number of previous presidencies on this achievement."
"My group considers this to be a sound basis, and also sets great store by the fact that it is ensured that the first step will be ready, as a matter of priority, by 1 May."
"Needless to say, we are not completely ready, nor are we 100% satisfied."
"During the new legislative period too, with 25 Member States, it will still be of the utmost importance that we should cast a critical eye on the way in which the annexes are fleshed out, as well as the development of the implementing regulation."
"In this respect, we should not only examine the system, for which the basis has now been laid, but also the consequences of the changes which ensue from it, because some people can be seriously let down by this."
"We need to seek out solutions to these problems."
"In addition, there are problems that cannot be solved in the regulation itself, some of which have already been mentioned, including the linking of taxes to social security systems or systems with which social security systems are complemented through collective labour agreements in private-sector industry."
"These are points mainly affecting frontier workers."
"On various occasions, we in this House have called for a frontier work test, for changes in national rules and for a much better, structured cooperation between Member States where frontier work is a frequent occurrence."
"Accordingly, I should like to urge the Dutch Presidency at this stage to set to work in this respect in the next half year, as soon as the review is complete."
"The Netherlands, along with its neighbouring countries Germany and Belgium, should set an example for the other Member States in areas in which a great deal of bilateral negotiation is yet to take place, and the Netherlands should, if possible, also produce more ambitious cooperation agreements for the 25 Member States, because it is to be expected that labour migration will intensify."
"Pressure of time prevents me from repeating all the points, but I should in any case like to suggest that cooperation between Parliament, Council and Commission should continue, on the same footing and in a constructive manner."
"This could quite possibly be in the context of a special working party, the name of which Mrs Lambert has already suggested: The Friends of 1408."
"Madam President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on his new appointment."
"I hope that he shares our view that mobility in the Member States is more than necessary if we want to implement the Lisbon agenda."
"The Lambert report and Regulation 1408/71, on which the report is based, are, of course, important instruments in this respect."
"I am extremely anxious about the wariness displayed by Member States with regard to the implications in terms of their own tax and social security systems."
"Here, I think, it is worth giving them a push in the right direction in future."
"That does not necessarily mean that you need to get Parliament’s backing, but mainly that you do need it from the Member States."
"I should nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and all those involved."
"Tomorrow, my group will be voting in favour of the Lambert report."
"I have to say that I have a great deal of admiration for Mrs Lambert."
"This regulation contains some valid points."
"The definition of frontier workers has been adopted; there are improvements in the field of pensions and also the families of frontier workers have not been overlooked."
"However, that is not all."
"For example, my country, the Netherlands, has yet again asked for an opt-out in certain sections, one being the medical treatment of frontier workers’ families."
"We have provided for this in the regulation, but the Netherlands has still asked for an opt-out."
"I see that as being unacceptable."
"I think that you should always be the first one to tell your country that it is acting unwisely."
"That, of course, also applies to other countries that are extremely anxious that, upon the EU’s imminent enlargement, a heavy burden will be placed on their social security."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I hope that we can, together, realise the ideal of mobility among Member States being promoted, and that first-generation frontier workers will be compensated accordingly and do not always have to fight for their rights."
"I gather that the President considers I have exceeded my speaking time, but I should very much like to have a good long talk with the new Commissioner about how we could bring this subject into the open more effectively."
"In my view, this needs a permanent monitoring committee."
"Madam President, I should like to join my colleagues in congratulating Mrs Lambert on her tremendous work on what was a very difficult brief."
"One thing this highlights is that great results can be achieved when the EU institutions pool their collective intelligence."
"The rapporteur has shown great tenacity in steering a very difficult course between many different viewpoints, and has arrived the best possible solution."
"I hope all Members will support this report tomorrow, along with the two amendments in it, as we need a majority vote."
"In presenting this regulation to the public we should also highlight that this is probably the single most important piece of social legislation to come out of this Parliament and one that makes a real difference to people's lives in that it reflects the realities in which the modern-day European Union citizen is working."
"People are moving across borders to take up jobs, some people are retiring to other areas and an increasing number of people are working for periods in other Member States."
"We need to ensure that the rights of such people can be carried across borders."
"Great credit is due to the Council for taking on board so many of the amendments Parliament sought to bring forward after first reading."
"To be parochial, I wish to thank the Irish Permanent Representation for their tremendous work."
"A number of those colleagues, who are sitting on the far side of this House, are a credit to Ireland and their to department for all the work they have done on this."
"There are one or two points of concern."
"Some of them have been dealt with, but I would like to re-emphasise them."
"The issue of taxation is an issue for Member States alone."
"It is not an issue that we should link with other matters because that merely diverts attention away from where the real work can be done."
"I agree with the rapporteur that this report is not about harmonisation; it is about better coordination of the social security systems in Member States."
"This regulation represents a huge change."
"Where previous regulations applied only to those who were economically active, this one applies to all benefit holders."
"It also constitutes an improvement as regards strengthening the equal treatment of all EU nationals."
"There remains the issue of the 'empty Annexes'."
"We insist that the Commission and Council come forward in the near future with a proposal concerning the implemented regulation to ensure that the legitimate and genuine concerns raised by my colleagues – and in particular by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten – are taken on board and dealt with."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten brought forward issues that relate not to abstract numbers or abstract individuals, but to real people who encounter this kind of discrimination every day."
"It is now up to the Commission and Council, on the basis of the good faith we will show tomorrow, to keep their part of the bargain and bring forward a proposal in this regard."
"They must be as good as their word and ensure that those empty Annexes are filled."
"Madam President, Commissioner, like other Members, I am delighted this evening to see how much progress has been made on the task of modernising Regulation No 1408/71 on social security, which obviously improves the position of EU nationals who have to travel across borders, essentially in the context of their work."
"This is something that we can be pleased about, even though I do share the reservations which other Members have expressed."
"This is a technical and complex issue."
"Dealing with it has required a great deal of time, and the task is not finished even now."
"We have just been reminded that the annexes are empty, and we still have some work ahead of us."
"However, I should like to thank, also on behalf of my colleague, first of all, the rapporteur, Mrs Lambert, for her perseverance and determination."
"I should also like to pay tribute to all those who have assisted with this work, whether in the Commission or in the Council."
"Although, overall, we can feel satisfied, we ought nonetheless to admit that margins for improvement are both possible and necessary on this subject."
"I should like to concentrate on the issue of the tools at our disposal for dealing with this matter."
"We need to go beyond the reservations and attitudes of those Member States who seek to preserve prerogatives which, in this context, look very much like protectionism."
"I hope that the coordination principle, which basically restricts and constrains us, and does not allow us to respond to the questions put by Members, will soon give way to real harmonisation on social protection, which is one of the essential components of the European social model."
"I am convinced, Madam President, that the demand expressed by European citizens for a real social Europe, which we shall all be hearing a lot about in the near future, requires significant institutional change."
"The progress which has been made is to be welcomed. It is considerable, but it is still modest in comparison with what is at stake."
"Finally, and above all, it must not be allowed to mask the existing disparity, which is to be condemned, between the very effective procedures which we have at our disposal with regard to economic matters, and the much weaker procedures which are used in the social sphere."
"Social convergence criteria are essential in order to deal correctly with the subject of social protection linked to mobility in Europe, a subject which, to the citizens of Europe, forms the basis of the credibility of European integration."
". Madam President, the Commission can take on board the concerns of some members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in the framework of the proposal for the new implementing regulation."
"For both of the Commission's proposals, for the new implementing regulation and for the content of the three Annexes, the Parliament will play its role as a co-legislator."
"Thank you, Commissioner Dimas."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(1)"
". I would like to draw Parliament's attention to the situation of Mordechai Vanunu, who is being released from an Israeli jail this week after 18 years' imprisonment for revealing details of Israeli nuclear weapons programmes."
"He is now subject to emergency regulations, which constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment, even though he has served his sentence – incidentally for revealing details of the kind of weapons that the US is seeking to discover in Iraq."
"The emergency regulations prevent him from leaving the country for six months or from being in contact with any foreign person – even by email or phone – otherwise he will be rearrested."
"He cannot talk to journalists and he is also barred from going within 100 metres of foreign embassies."
"This should be condemned by Parliament as contrary to the rule of law."
".– The President of the European Parliament, in his interview in the Cypriot newspaper , appears to have commented on the Cypriot leaders by saying that he personally was disappointed by what he considered to be a failure in the fields of the imagination and courageous leadership which needed to be demonstrated at this time."
"He concluded by calling on the Cypriot people to seize the opportunity."
"I consider it unacceptable and inadmissible that the President of the European Parliament, even at a personal level, should throw all his weight behind and add to the unbearable pressure, coercion and threats to which the Cypriot people are subject from the UN Secretary General and his entourage, from the US Government, from the European Commission and Council, from Turkey and from numerous others, including the political forces in Greece."
"His intervention is an insult and, if I may say so, is unseemly towards the political forces of Cyprus and the Cypriot people as a whole, who do not need lessons in good behaviour from the President of the European Parliament or anyone else."
"In addition, his comments contradict what he says at the beginning of the interview about the choice of the communities of Cyprus in the two referenda being a choice by free and sovereign peoples."
"Do the President and others perhaps consider that the only free choice which the Cypriot people have in the referendum is to say 'yes'?"
"Madam President, in the next couple of days, ceremonies will be held in various places around the world to commemorate the Turkish genocide against the Armenian people, which claimed the lives of more than one million people."
"Between 1915 and 1918, the Turkish army evacuated almost all Armenian villages within the Ottoman Empire."
"This involved the immediate execution of hundreds of thousands of citizens, while others died later, under horrendous circumstances, during hunger marches to Syria."
"This was the first genocide of the twentieth century."
"To this day, however, Turkey refuses to acknowledge this genocide."
"This is quite a serious blemish on a candidate Member State."
"It illustrates the way in which today’s Turkish Government views human rights."
"I would remind you of the resolution adopted by our own Parliament in 1987, which clearly stipulates that Turkey has no claim to EU membership as long as it does not recognise the Armenian genocide."
"I would insist that this same resolution, which is still valid, be brought to the attention of the Commission and the Council."
"It is the feast of Saint Vicent Ferrer, which is cause for much celebration in my home region of Valencia. It so happens that today is the day I take up office as a Member of this House representing the Valencian Nationalist Bloc."
"I should like to seize this opportunity to highlight a serious problem affecting the production of oranges and other citrus fruits in the region of Valencia."
"The European Union has failed to adopt precautionary plant health measures to prevent possible attack by pests and diseases due to the import of citrus fruits from third countries such as Argentina or Brazil. This is a particularly serious situation."
"In the past, it led to the introduction of pests such as the citrus leaf miner. In the near future, it could have serious implications for the cultivation of citrus fruits in the region of Valencia, and across Europe."
"Clauses of a different nature would be appropriate for other sectors, such as the textile sector. The aim should be to prevent the entry of pests and diseases into a sector that is so important to the economy of Valencia and therefore to the economy of Europe as a whole."
". – Madam President, a few weeks after the murder of the Hamas leader Sheik Yassin, the Sharon Government murdered its new leader Abdel Ratissi, not only demonstrating that it does not wish the peace process to proceed and for there to be an independent Palestinian state, but also adding fuel to the fire and deliberately creating tension."
"The ΕU, as is clear from its attitude to date, is basically following the US line, in that it has confined itself merely to expressions of protest about these murders and the attacks by Israel, while at the same time talking – through Mr Solana – about Israel's right to protect itself and examining Sharon's policy to clear the Gaza Strip."
"It is therefore making a victim out of the attacker."
"We members of the Communist Party of Greece condemn the crimes by the Sharon Government and the hypocritical, complicit, policy of the ΕU."
"We express our active solidarity with the Palestinian people and call on the European Parliament to demand that the ΕU stop arming Israel and freeze the association agreement with it."
"Madam President, again today, at your invitation, the European Parliament observed one minute's silence for the young Italian paramilitary executed in Iraq, but it has never requested the same for the thousands of victims of the invasions of Afghanistan, Iraq and, previously, of Yugoslavia."
"As the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have repeatedly requested this of you, could you tell us when you intend to do this?"
". –Madam President, I asked for the floor in order to inform the House that the Pakistani authorities have allowed the crew of the to return to their homes in Greece and the Philippines."
"Following attempts over several months by the Greek Government, with the then Minister for Foreign Affairs Georgos Papandreos, which of course have continued up to today, and the provision of guarantees by it, following the reaction by the European Parliament, which passed a resolution on the subject, and following action by the troika and by Commissioner Chris Patten and the visit to Pakistan, the desired result has been achieved."
"Having noted, therefore, how action by the institutions of the European Union and its Member States can be successful when properly coordinated, let us thank those responsible for handling this issue."
".– Madam President, I should like to bring the House's attention to and ask for your immediate intervention in an extremely important issue."
"It concerns the survival of Greek farmers, who are literally on the brink of disaster."
"The bitterly cold weather which hit Greece a few months ago caused extensive damage to farm assets (plants, land and so on) throughout the country."
"The farmers affected are having serious trouble surviving and will face bankruptcy unless specific measures are taken at once."
"I am calling, Madam President, for your intervention in order to speed up the time-consuming Community procedures for approving the payment of compensation and financial aid to Greek farmers, as was the case with France, Italy and Malta, in order to prevent bankruptcy and enable the farmers affected to continue their productive activity."
"– Alzheimer’s disease and other neuro-degenerative diseases are seriously affecting the population of Europe."
"According to current estimates, they affect 5% of those aged between 50 and 60, 8 to 10% of those between 60 and 70, and 10 to 20% of those between 70 and 80."
"These diseases which affect the brain occupy third place in the tragic hit parade of diseases, after cardio-vascular diseases in first place and cancer in second place."
"Alzheimer’s and related diseases affect millions of European citizens who, in time, become incapable of coping with their lives, not to mention their families who, when they assume responsibility for the care of such patients, have to reduce considerably or even give up their professional activities."
"These diseases are having disastrous human, economic and social consequences for our society."
"In addition to the mental suffering caused by these diseases, there are almost no specialised care homes available, and those which do exist are often too expensive for the patient or his family, and are not covered by the social security system or by medical insurance."
"There is therefore an urgent need to develop, on all fronts, a real plan for the organised control of this scourge, which affects all of us either directly or indirectly."
"The economic and social burden of diseases of the brain represents 35% of the cost of all diseases in Europe, and this figure is expected to rise in the next ten to twenty years."
"This finding must lead to a redefinition of the policies to be pursued regarding research, education, healthcare, prevention and social protection."
"Since a third of the total cost of all diseases is attributable to diseases of the brain, the following measures are necessary: a substantial part of the funding for research into the life sciences should be devoted to the brain and its diseases, in particular Alzheimer’s disease, and the Seventh Framework Programme currently being negotiated should take this into account; a substantial share of spending on healthcare (prevention, diagnosis and treatment) should be devoted to these diseases; medical study programmes should be proportionately targeted against these diseases; a system of social protection should be set up, making it possible to give material support (care homes) and financial support to patients suffering from this disability and their families; and finally a European brain disease monitoring centre should be set up."
"This scourge is so widespread, and its impact on our society so severe, that it is the duty of the various European institutions, the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, and of the Member States, to take all appropriate measures within their power to combat, control and prevent these neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, and to help those who suffer from them."
"The Commission position reflects the compromise agreed between the Council and the rapporteur in order to reach agreement at first reading."

"(1)"
"–The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has already approved Mrs Hazan's report on this subject."
"– Mr President, we have already expressed our views."
"We reject the request for urgent procedure."
"–We shall now vote on the request for urgent procedure."
"– Mr President, we are a group of MEPs who wish to attribute responsibility for the Eurostat affair."
"We have asked the Commission to do so itself, but it has still not acted, and we have therefore tabled a motion of censure because that is the only means at our disposal."
"We have done so not because we want a head on a plate, but because we quite simply wish to attribute responsibility for the affair. Nothing more nor less."
"The Bureau now has 67 signatures. Two more have just been submitted and, since yesterday, there have been more than 63 verified signatures."
"Since yesterday evening, the Bureau therefore owes it to us to give official notice that a motion of censure has been tabled, and this must therefore be scheduled for debate within 24 hours."
"I should be dreadfully annoyed if the date were to be put back, because that would lead to our having the vote during the May part-session, which should be a time for celebrating the accession of the new Member States."
"It is not our wish to hold the vote at that time. We are very sorry that the services have delayed this matter, and we insist that the President now give notice that it is on the agenda."
"Mr Bonde, I wish to inform you that the services of Parliament are currently verifying the signatures, because, as you know, in the process of sending the signatures, some were added and others withdrawn."
"As soon as this verification process is completed this morning, the President of Parliament will be informed in order to take a decision on the matter."
"– The next item is the report (Α5-0257/2004) by Mr Sterckx, on behalf of the Temporary Committee on improving safety at sea, on improving safety at sea. (2003/2235(INI)."
". – Mr President, it all started in November 2001 when the sank and tens of thousands of tonnes of oil ended up in the sea off the Galician, Spanish and French coasts, with residues of it staining even the British and Belgian coasts."
"It was a true European tragedy and once again, a tragedy that we needed like a hole in the head."
"The European Parliament appointed Dirk Sterckx as rapporteur, but due to circumstances in his own country, he has asked me to replace him."
"I shall therefore replace him on behalf of the Liberals and say a few words."
"Parliament is deeply disappointed, because after the disaster involving the , we had already worked with the Commission constructively in order to tighten up policy."
"The upshot was two packages, but another disaster had to happen first."
"In September 2003, Parliament approved an initial report by Mr Sterckx, which gave a detailed account of events and made a few recommendations."
"Its salient points were: first of all, tightening up the regime of ports of refuge and the request to organise a compensation system and secondly, the setting up of a temporary committee."
"The Temporary Committee on improving safety at sea (MARE) was set up in November 2003 and its brief was firstly, to look into recent shipping disasters, particularly the and the ; secondly, to analyse the social and economic implications; thirdly, to evaluate existing European and international rules; fourthly, to examine how the recommendations from the first resolution have been acted upon and finally, to formulate additional proposals, if necessary."
"After six months of hard work, we now have a balanced report."
"It was not always easy to take a rational view of the situation, but fortunately, everyone pulled together and has adopted a constructive stance so far."
"As such, approval of this report will hopefully constitute an important step in the direction of a safer sea, because that was the key motivation behind the work of these past six months."
"Maritime safety is in everyone's interests, because another or sinking off any coast does not bear thinking about."
"On behalf of Mr Sterckx, I should in any case like to thank Mr Jarzembowski, chairman of the MARE Committee, the people who we interviewed, including the master of the , who received a delegation of the committee, all coordinators and all fellow MEPs."
"Mr Sterckx deeply regrets that local issues prevent him from being here today."
"Let me now turn to the report."
"Firstly, the clearing of the wreck."
"According to the Spanish authorities, 43 000 tonnes of crude oil have been recovered."
"Repsol, the company that will be removing the remaining oil from the wreck, states that the wreck holds another 14 000 tonnes."
"As indicated in the report, there are therefore still 20 000 tonnes unaccounted for that still constitute a threat."
"The cleared oil is being stored somewhere but is yet to be processed."
"Secondly, the meeting with the master has exposed the contrasting statements, on the one hand, by the Spanish authorities who claimed that right at the outset 10 000 tonnes of oil ended up in the sea, and, on the other, by the master that on the first day, only 2 000 to 3 000 tonnes were lost via one of both openings."
"Moreover, the master's treatment does not exactly inspire people to work in shipping."
"It is quite a responsibility and it is very tough when you are personally put under pressure in this manner."
"This also applies to a huge number of colleagues of his. In this respect, the is not alone, unfortunately; witness what has happened to other crew members in shipping disasters."
"We are still awaiting a report on the by the flag state, the Bahamas."
"That is unfortunate and actually very unsportsmanlike when you consider the efforts we have all made to contribute to the activities."
"I should like to comment on another few proposals."
"First of all, compliance with existing law remains a priority."
"We must first and foremost apply what already exists."
"We are delighted to be able to conclude that the Member States have caught up with regard to the directive on port state control and the classification bureaus."
"That is why we would suggest updating the text of paragraph 7 and rejecting the second part, because evidently, that issue has been resolved."
"A sound compromise has been reached in the committee on the European coastguard service."
"I have noticed that the final section of the compromise creates confusion and is at odds with our request for an independent decision-making and command structure at Member State level capable of enforcing the necessary decisions."
"The visit by the Englishman, Robert Middleton, to our committee was very instructive."
"I would therefore suggest removing the contradiction in Amendment No 26 and bringing paragraph 13 into line with paragraph 10."
"I would like to finish off by saying something about labelling and tracing of loading units containing dangerous goods."
"This aspect has been included in the report, but I think that a quick scan from the Commission is required to indicate the level of transmitters we would need to deploy."
"We would probably need passive, but possibly also active, transmitters for heavy cargo."
"I would like to ask Mrs Palacio to look into this matter again."
"There are very simple, cheap transmitters, which can be attached to any cargo."
"These could be introduced tomorrow; the market is ready for them."
"I think, though, that it is important to look into these matters at greater length."
"I am looking forward to your response."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mr Sterckx, the Chairman of the Temporary Committee on improving safety at sea, Mr Jarzembowski, and the whole committee for the magnificent work that they have done to increase maritime safety."
"I am convinced that this work and the report being presented today will make a valuable contribution towards continuing to improve safety at sea in Europe and doing as much as possible to prevent further environmental catastrophes."
"I would like to say that now that we are reaching the end of the legislature, we can be proud that, among other things, it has been the legislature of safety at sea."
"There have been other terrible incidents like the or the in the past, but the appropriate steps were simply not taken, practically no measures were adopted to prevent, alleviate or correct them or to safeguard against them happening again."
"In this case that was not what happened."
"In this case we have adopted measures and the Member States are acting, albeit not always in a satisfactory manner."
"As I stated in my speech to the MARE Committee on 22 January 2004 as a result of the entry into force of the Directive establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system on 5 February, the Commission has already begun the appropriate violation proceedings for failure to inform it of transposition measures for this Directive."
"I must point out that to date only Germany, Denmark, Spain and Ireland have informed the Commission of the measures they have adopted to incorporate this text, which is fundamental for sea traffic, into national law."
"The situation is, however, more satisfactory with regard to port State control and classification societies, as only one Member State of the Union of Fifteen has still failed to comply by communicating the measures it has taken to transpose the Directive on port State control."
"The new Member States must have incorporated all Community legislation on safety at sea into their respective legal systems by 1 May."
"We are going to be absolutely firm on this point, because safety at sea is an important matter."
"I am well aware of your concerns regarding compliance with international and Community regulations by Cyprus and Malta and I want to tell you that we are being especially vigilant."
"Following my last speech to the Temporary Committee, the Commission services conducted on-site inspections in those countries and we were able to verify considerable progress in incorporating Community law, although it must be said that we cannot yet say that the required objectives have been achieved."
"We need to continue to strengthen the administrative capacity of these countries."
"We will continue to monitor this in the near future."
"In the context of the application of the legislation in force you have highlighted three points."
"I will spend a few moments on one of them."
"With regard to places of refuge, the evaluation of plans for providing refuge for ships in distress conducted by the Commission in cooperation with the European Maritime Safety Agency has now been completed."
"In addition, last month the Agency organised a day’s workshop on this subject with the national maritime authorities, which enabled the Member States to exchange experiences on the application of Article 20 of the Directive establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system."
"Currently the results of the evaluation process are being analysed in detail and, as promised, the Commission will be able to provide Parliament with a report that will include the conclusions of that evaluation and also the results of a study that the Agency was charged with on compensation for damage caused by the use of a place of refuge by a ship."
"Based on this information, and also taking into account what is raised in the conclusions of your report, we will assess any possible amendments or improvements to the texts adopted."
"With regard to anti-pollution measures, I would like to inform you that the amendments made to the Regulation Establishing the European Maritime Safety Agency, which extend its powers to combating sea pollution, have been finally approved."
"The Commission will make the necessary amendments to the budget resulting from this change."
"I therefore call on the European Parliament to support the Commission’s requests to provide the Agency with the necessary resources in the debates on the budget for 2005."
"We also believe that the publication of the black list of vessels that are banned from entering Union ports is an essential deterrent against this type of vessel approaching or travelling along European coastlines."
"As a preventive measure we are currently looking at reinforcing this concept."
"With regard to the legislation currently being debated, I first of all wish to thank you for your support for the proposal for a directive establishing effective criminal sanctions for those responsible for sea pollution incidents."
"The Commission joins you in calling on the Council to take a decision on this matter."
"Regarding the adoption of the Regulation on the International Safety Management Code, which seeks to promote a culture of safety and prevention of pollution, the Commission would like to thank you for the support that you gave in the plenary in February, and I trust that at its meeting in June the Council will adopt common positions on both subjects."
"Regarding the future prospects for maritime legislation I will say that I gave you a few clues in January, which the Commission is currently considering."
"I welcome the fact that the report that we are discussing today shows that our approaches are in line with each other and I particularly note its ideas on investigations following accidents at sea, increasing traffic monitoring in Community waters, stepping up port State control and applying minimum criteria for flag states in the Union."
"Some of these ideas, such as, for example, increasing the obligations of the Member States to pass on information on traffic or the role of the Agency in responses to incidents at sea are part of the plans that you have outlined for the creation of a coastguard service."
"I have explained the Commission’s position on this on various occasions."
"You stress, with strong arguments, the human factor and the correct application of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers."
"This Convention was partially incorporated into Community law in 2001, with the adoption of the Directive on the minimum level of training of seafarers."
"The entry into force of the amendment to the Regulation establishing the Agency gives it powers to evaluate training for sailors provided in third countries."
"I wish to finish my speech by highlighting the role that the Commission plays in terms of international relations."
"This week, during our visit to Russia for the European Union/Russia Summit, as part of the Association and Cooperation agreement, we have the firm intention of pointing out that in order for the International Maritime Organisation to adopt the amendment of the MARPOL Convention, which includes an accelerated phasing out of single-hulled vessels by April 2005, Russia has undertaken to provide for early phasing out and therefore to require that it be carried out."
"I would like to point out that, as has been accepted among charterers, accelerating the phasing out of single-hulled oil tankers and replacing them with double-hulled tankers is not resulting in any increase in chartering costs or in a shortage of transport capacity."
"This shows that the Commission did a good job and proposed schedules that were ambitious but realistic."
"The Commission is closely monitoring the work being done on the IOPC regarding the modification of the international compensation system for oil pollution."
"Once again we regret the Council’s delay – and I use those words quite clearly – in requiring the Member States to ratify these agreements that have been adopted, which is going to delay the availability of the compensation if an accident occurs."
"Summer is coming."
"I hope that we will not have to deal with any tragedies of this nature in the next few months, but imagine the scandal if anything did happen and the Member States had not ratified the recent agreements on the level of compensation."
"I would like to point out that in the meeting of the Marine Environment Protection Committee held in London last week, the IMO designated the Baltic, the Canary Islands and the Galapagos Islands as Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas."
"In my opinion, this is a great achievement not only for the Commission, but also for the whole of the European Union, as the adoption of a series of international regulations in this field increases the protection of the interests of coastal States against the risk of pollution."
"We are aware of the significance of the work done in the International Maritime Organisation and I therefore wish to reiterate my thanks to the European Parliament for its support for the Community’s membership of the IMO."
"In order to promote the application of satisfactory maritime regulations, the Commission actively supports and promotes the work of the International Labour Office in the process of consolidating all the agreements on international maritime regulations, with a view to adopting a single agreement to which I believe the Community should be a contracting party."
"Finally, we are working in close cooperation with the International Maritime Organisation to increase the responsibility of the flag state through inspection systems, in other words to combat flags of convenience."
"Once again, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has shown how much importance it attaches to the Commission’s work."
"Following the accident more than four years ago, during your mandate I wished to help drastically improve safety at sea, and I wish to particularly thank your for the support that you have given me and say, as I said at the start of my speech, that this legislature has been the legislature of safety at sea; the legislature in which, finally, the European Union has had the ambition and the decisiveness to genuinely protect its coasts and also to work at international level with determination, will and rigour to ensure that this protection is not only applied to our coasts and our seas but to all the seas in the world."
"As I have always said, the sea belongs to everyone, it is our heritage and treasure, both for humanity now and for future generations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for the information you have given us, and sincere congratulations on your excellent work during this legislature. We agree with your description of it as the legislature of safety at sea, and you have played the leading role in this."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Vermeer, I am glad that you are here with us today, although we regret that Mr Sterckx cannot be with us to defend his report."
"On behalf of my group, please pass on our congratulations to him for the commendable and honest work he has been doing in order to be able to present to this House today the most objective and comprehensive report possible with the greatest possible consensus, on a sensitive and difficult matter."
"I would also like to congratulate Mr Jarzembowski on his excellent work as Chair."
"It is in this spirit of objectivity and consensus that I also wished to tackle this issue on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, both in committee and in plenary."
"My group, therefore, did not table many amendments, but those amendments were key as we believe that they affect significant points and, although we disagree on some approaches and would like others to be better thought through, I will only highlight those that I consider to be essential."
"First of all, our two amendments aim to correct statements in the report regarding fisheries in Galicia that are inaccurate and made rashly, without any basis, and could do a great deal of damage in the future."
"My obligation here is, without a doubt, to help increase safety at sea, but also to defend the truth and the fishing and shellfishing interests of Galicia, and to ensure that there is not a shadow of a doubt regarding the situation and quality of world famous products, which were managed and preserved before, during and after the in an exemplary manner."
"The fishing areas were closed during the accident and were opened as soon as the excellent Galician biologists, health professionals and technical staff advised that they should be, having carried out the strict tests required by Community standards."
"No one foresees that this will mean any future risk or undermine their profitability, as is being demonstrated by the market and by the research being conducted by the prestigious Spanish Oceanography Institute, with experiments being carried out on their own scientific vessels."
"Galicia’s fisheries management system is a model for many others in the world and we cannot allow a document from a Community institution – which is not specifically on fisheries but on safety at sea – to question it with no basis and to accuse us of overusing our resources or overfishing."
"We do not, therefore, understand how other Galician MEPs from other political groups have been able to support this absolute nonsense with their vote in committee, which I hope they will now correct in plenary. I also hope that they will support our second amendment, which clarifies the current paragraph 51, as the reduction in extractive activity due to the closure of fishing grounds for preventive reasons is not linked to the ultimate decrease in resources, as can be verified on the website of the Fisheries and Maritime Affairs Board of the Regional Government of Galicia, , which gives all the updated fisheries statistics for the whole of 2003 by species, and shows that some species that have decreased are fished in international waters and not along the coast of Galicia, which makes it difficult for them to be affected by the accident."
"This is the rigour and accuracy that we want to see throughout the Sterckx report, defending the real situation of fisheries in order to support it, which you are aware that we want to do."
"Finally, paragraph 39 is also incorrect."
"The decision of various Member States of the European Union to ban ‘substandard’, or in other words ‘garbage’ vessels from their exclusive economic zones, may be controversial but has of course been the most effective one since the Until international law is revised, as we ask in our amendment, now paragraph 40 (which is something that is going to take a long time) to amend, among other things, the so-called ‘inoffensive passage’ for these ‘floating bombs’, citizens want us to provide effective measures and there are few measures more effective than those taken by the French and Spanish Governments, supported by Portugal, Italy, Germany and the Council of Ministers of the European Union."
"These measures do not make it difficult to assist the ‘garbage’ vessel or its crew as they are escorted by naval ships, which provides them with the best possible means of assistance."
"Mr President, I should first like to thank Mr Sterckx, who has done a remarkable job as rapporteur, even if there might be doubts that this committee has got to the bottom of things."
"It is obvious that, in spite of irrational and last-ditch opposition by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to try to minimise the responsibility of the Spanish State, particularly in management of the wreck, the truth has become clear."
"We now know that we are, in fact, faced not simply with problems of prevention regarding safety at sea, but also with problems concerning the management of wrecks."
"I must say, for myself personally, how sorry I am that the document we are presenting to you does not go into these matters in sufficient depth."
"We also have two questions to settle."
"Firstly, that of the fate of Captain Mangouras who, it seems to me, is clearly being made the scapegoat – there always has to be one in such a case – and whose treatment is not worthy of a great democracy."
"I hope that the political change in Spain will allow the relaxation of the judicial control to which he is subject and that he will at last be allowed to return home."
"He will have suffered the lot, detention as well as having to lodge a very substantial security."
"Secondly, in Amendment No 11 and Recital 15, on which we expect to be defeated, we express our wish that the wreckage should be dealt with."
"We cannot accept that causes of long-term pollution should remain while people gradually turn away from them, trying to avoid the responsibilities of the Spanish State in this area."
"I think therefore that the Group of the Party of European Socialists will be very clear."
"Finally, we of course hope that the proposals for the future made in this report will be adopted."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that future packages will not all be called , but that there will be a package to emphasise the fact that we have drawn the conclusions from this wreck and from this disaster."
"There are several questions at issue here, in particular the question of how responsibility is assumed."
"There are two schools of thought regarding these problems; those who want duties on polluting and those who want insurance."
"We are among those who think that the insurance arrangements must be strengthened and, in particular, extended to cover the degree of danger presented by the cargoes and not only their value."
"I would have had many other things to say, but in two minutes I cannot go any further."
"I simply hope, Commissioner, that, as in the past, you would draw positively all the conclusions from this report so that we strengthen further the requirements of the European Union regarding safety at sea, particularly within the IMO."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as the Commissioner said, it is really time we brought to an end the protracted work we have been doing together on improving safety at sea."
"We have you to thank for this, but we also owe thanks to our fellow Member Mr Sterckx for his excellent report."
"With a view to the future, I have a feeling that it would be a very good thing if the Commission were to order a study into where the holes in the acquis communautaire lie."
"I had this feeling following the package."
"We noticed that there were new holes – like those in Emmental cheese – that had been exploited."
"I sometimes have the feeling that we think we are making progress, but new holes are springing up."
"I should like us to look at these holes before another disaster occurs."
"We have tried to do this to some extent in the report, but I think that we are in need of additional expertise in this field."
"I am glad that you mentioned enlargement and Russia, and I think that this report is a historic one from the point of view of the Baltic Sea."
"The Baltic has never had as much mention in a report by the European Parliament as it has in this report."
"My thanks to all my fellow Members for this."
"The international dimension emerges strongly and, in your speech, Mrs de Palacio, you point out what you are intending to do."
"I noted with interest that single hulls are to be phased out in Russia by 1 May 2005 at the latest."
"I should like you to elaborate a little on what you said on that point."
"I do not think that sufficient attention has been paid to the work being done by the working group that is considering changes to the international compensation regime."
"We know that the working group is going to meet in May, and that Spain, France and the Commission have presented a proposal."
"I think that the proposal to remedy the flaws in liability insurance and in liability throughout the maritime chain merits more attention here in Parliament."
"I should like us to think a little more carefully about whether we want the European system we are calling for, or if we should give more thought to this working group in the IOPC context in order to see what can be done there."
"Finally, I hope that we shall work together on tangible rules for success with the Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas (PSSA) that have been designated."
"The creation of the new PSSA in London was a success, but we need to specify what is meant by these."
"At the same time, when the Commission evaluates the plans for dealing with places of refuge in other respects, I should like it to decide, with respect to item 14 in the report, whether or not places of refuge should be made public."
"The Member States need guidance, because this matter has been the subject of much debate."
"Mr President, I must also thank Mr Sterckx for producing such an excellent report following the work done in the last few months in committee, with the help of experts from the various countries."
"The work in the MARE Committee has enabled us to look in depth at the disaster and its environmental consequences, and the need to make progress on safety at sea."
"My colleague Mr Sterckx has produced an excellent report following discussions with experts and the meeting with the captain."
"It is clear that the decision to move the away was an error, so we urgently need to create a network of ports of refuge on European coastlines, and progress has already been made on this, as the Commissioner has said."
"As the report says, we need to provide this network with financial compensation for problems, including environmental problems, due to providing refuge for vessels carrying dangerous cargo."
"The Commission needs to be quicker and stricter in applying its Directives on safety at sea to the Member States and it needs to create the right conditions in cooperation at international level."
"Although it is a positive report, our group abstained in the vote in committee because it does not include some matters that are fundamental for the safety of the environment and of seafarers."
"An environmental principle is amongst the content that we think should be adopted as part of the report: ‘the polluter pays’."
"It should therefore be incorporated into Amendment No 3 by the GUE/NGL and a new paragraph be added stating: ‘Decisions need to be adopted to ensure that those responsible for disasters pay the full costs of them: owners, charterers, owners of the cargo and classification societies, and in the interests of security, to ban flags of convenience in European waters’."
"The amendment on dignity for seafarers, their pay and valuing their work should also be supported."
"Measures cannot be taken without reviewing the situation of seafarers and considering exploitation and we cannot make one hundred percent progress on safety if we do not establish the situation of seafarers and their welfare in the report."
"The GUE/NGL Group considers these amendments to be fundamental in order for such a positive report to be one hundred percent positive."
"Mr President, the Sterckx report is a positive one, for which special thanks are due to the rapporteur. For this reason, we voted for it in committee."
"It is still not what we wanted, however, and we therefore hope that the amendments we have tabled will be adopted."
"The report should be firmer and more unequivocal in condemning the behaviour and the culpable omissions of the Spanish Government and the Galician authorities with regard to the disaster, and also in criticising the lack of European Union institutional, technical and economic resources for avoiding and responding to accidents at sea."
"The report should highlight the indifference and the neglect displayed by the Commission and by many Member States in the face of calls for effective measures to improve safety at sea and to help countries affected by disasters."
"It should also call, as a matter of urgency, for the International Maritime Organisation to recognise the culpability of the institutional system and of those capitalist companies – which I would brand as guilty – which govern maritime traffic, as well as demanding the measures needed to protect both life and maritime and coastal resources."
"In any case, given the temptation for those with vested interests to forget the disaster, we need to stress that the is not a historical issue, but that it can teach us lessons for the future, especially for Galicia, which of all the countries in the world has suffered the greatest number of such accidents over the last thirty years."
"The reaction of civil society in Galicia meant that the disaster became a political issue there, and for the European Union also, giving rise to a democratic movement that was intensified by the democratic struggle for peace and against the war in Iraq. This set in train the events that led to a democratic change of government in Spain, which was of momentous importance for everyone, including the European Union."
"I remember the date very well: it was 13 November, the day on which my third grandson was born."
"Nevertheless, the threat of accidents like the disaster is still hanging over us."
"This is very much the time for the European Union to spell out its willingness to make good the impact of a disaster which affected 2 000 kilometres of our coastline, from the Minho to Brittany."
"There is a particular need to support and strengthen the Galicia Plan, which is an undertaking on the part of the state to remedy the consequences of the disaster, an undertaking which the European Union and the new Spanish Government must fulfil without prevaricating, and which they must treat as an urgent priority."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to thank Mr Sterckx for the excellent work put into his report."
"I hope that nothing, and certainly not a disaster, will happen to temper the Commissioner’s optimism and that neither the Mediterranean nor any other landlocked sea will be the arena for a tragedy of such proportions."
"The hearings of the temporary committee on improving safety at sea have been most instructive."
"It has been revealed, for example, that the human element plays a role in 80% of accidents."
"It is therefore essential for crews to be given good training in safety matters. This must provide for efficient and coordinated emergency plans in the event of a disaster at sea."
"In addition, steps should be taken to ensure that crews have good conditions in which to work, in this way helping at an early stage to provide rapid and appropriate responses to extreme situations."
"In the case of the , we can only deplore the decision taken by the Spanish Government to tow away the vessel and wonder at the statements made at that time by its representative."
"Moreover, I welcome the somewhat belated transposition, by virtually all Member States, of the directives relating to classification societies and to port state control, to which the Commissioner referred, while waiting for a more positive attitude from Finland."
"The worrying situation of certain new Member States as regards the implementation of international and European laws on maritime safety seems to me to lend itself to the creation of a rapid and complete body of expertise, especially since we may wonder at the relative inaction of the Council regarding criminal-law penalties for pollution of the sea."
"Without the introduction of such penalties, the hooligans of the sea will go unpunished and will continue to pollute the sea without scruple."
"In the interests of the ‘polluter pays’ principle, the polluters must be severely punished and, beyond that, each party involved in the transport of goods must be made aware of their responsibilities."
"To conclude, therefore, I should point out the equally important need for maritime safety to be accompanied by a genuine policy of prevention and punishment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the report resulting from the work of the Temporary Committee is ultimately rather unconvincing."
"What was surely needed was to carry out an exhaustive and rigorous review of the many weak links remaining in the chain of maritime safety, one that would be capable of producing operational guidelines linked together according to the different areas of competence, including the intermediate European level."
"Certainly, many good intentions are expressed."
"The report, as amended, thus favours preventive action and calls for the joint construction of large anti-pollution vessels and the permanent equipping of fishing fleets with fuel recovery trawls."
"These are good guidelines."
"I should point out that a tonne of fuel recovered at sea represents ten tonnes of waste fewer to be treated."
"The report also favours the setting up of particularly sensitive sea areas under the auspices of the IMO, which is what France wants."
"It is opposed to flags of convenience that do not meet the vessel inspection and safety standards."
"This is certainly a very sound reminder at a time when the European Union is itself becoming the world’s leading host for flags of convenience."
"Very soon, however, the report cannot stop itself drifting off towards a series of federalist fads."
"For example, when it aims to encourage replacing Member States with the European Union at the IMO or to develop the inspection and restraint powers of the European Maritime Safety Agency, to the point of transforming it into a veritable federal authority; or again when it advocates the establishment of an integrated European coastguard system, while being very careful not to specify who would finance it and who would be in charge of it, but which would nevertheless have numerous functions, including, in no particular order, ensuring maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment, fisheries surveillance, protection against terrorism or even the assignment of emergency moorings and ports in the event of an accident at sea."
"Finally, the icing on the cake is paragraph 39 at the heart of the report, which by the way completely contradicts paragraph 40, and which condemns the only measure of immediate application taken following the shipwreck, that is very strict control of high-risk vessels, which could result in their expulsion outside the 200-mile zone, decided on jointly by France and Spain in Malaga."
"This device has nevertheless produced very good results."
"Of more than sixty in-depth checks carried out so far by the French, one vessel made a gallant last stand, and sixteen were expelled."
"The prospect of being ordered to make very expensive detours is clearly an effective deterrent to the use of dangerous vessels."
"Vessels in distress are obviously not covered by this procedure, as this report nevertheless pretends to believe."
"In the final analysis, therefore, the Sterckx report leaves a strange feeling."
"What credibility should be given to it when, instead of advocating, as one might logically have expected, the widespread application of measures proven in practice to be the most effective against the hooligans of the seas and the greatest deterrent to them, it condemns them on the basis of the other inaccurate considerations, on the pretext that they do not come from European institutions but are the result of close cooperation between Member States directly concerned?"
"Ideology does indeed make you blind."
"On the pretext of increasing safety, here we have a suggestion to decrease safety by challenging the right of the Member States most directly affected by maritime risks to provide effective protection for their coasts and their coastal populations."
"Instead of being encouraged to continue, they are being discouraged from doing it."
"Instead of good practices being applied more generally, they are – I quote – ‘rejected’, a quite paradoxical result, Mr President, for a committee set up for the purpose of proposing measures to improve safety at sea."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to thank Mr Sterckx, even if he is not here, for the remarkable job he has done."
"I should also like to thank you, Commissioner, because I believe that, in the course of this legislative period, we have succeeded in establishing a close working relationship between Parliament and the Commission in order to try and put the finishing touches to the legislation on safety at sea."
"We have lived through the disasters of the and the , from both of which we have been able to draw conclusions regarding bad management and we must make use of them."
"This has been shown clearly by the discussions of our committee."
"We must first turn our attention to all forms of pollution because, while there are maritime disasters, there are also, unfortunately, continuing instances of pollution, in particular those caused by the daily degassing."
"Under the ‘polluter pays’ principle, we must tackle this problem and adopt measures which are applicable from day to day."
"Hence the unannounced inspections of vessels, the establishment of a European coastguard service, which must be operational and have human and technical resources at its disposal equal to the tasks assigned to it, and then, of course, the need to monitor the quality of crews so that they can take the right decisions at the right time."
"The measures adopted then have to be implemented."
"A short while ago, the Commissioner noted that Member States have been very slow in implementing the directives and regulations."
"On this matter, I think that good information on the successes and failures is important, not in order to denounce one or other Member State but rather to encourage them to outdo each other in achieving the objectives set."
"As far as ports of refuge are concerned, it is true that there are many questions remaining and that States are not rushing to give a list of such ports."
"In the face of the concerns and questions of inhabitants who do not want to see shipwrecks turning up outside their windows, I wonder whether we should not proceed differently and perhaps, quite simply, fit out major ports situated along our coasts with adequate technology and equipment, so that such technology and equipment can be made available at any time that a disaster or accident occurs."
"Finally, it is also important to note that European authorities, whether national or local, must continue their partnership with the people working in maritime transport."
"It is not sufficient to state systematically that the people working in this sector are not reliable."
"Some are, whereas others really are seagoing hooligans."
"We must – and I think the Commission has a role to play in this respect – support the moves by those who would clearly like to change the image of their industry."
"From this moment, they are taking responsibility in efforts to modernise their fleet and, of course, to train their seagoing personnel."
"Be that as it may, I believe that we in this House must remain vigilant so that the work done here really can bear fruit."
"Mr President, the European Parliament proved its worth by establishing a temporary committee to assess the causes and consequences of the oil tanker disaster and to make proposals to increase safety at sea."
"The institution thus carried out its responsibility for political monitoring of what was and continues to be a European disaster that goes beyond the limits of a single Member State and took on board the consequences by promoting the sea traffic policy, which is the responsibility of Community and international bodies, although the decisions to implement it are left in the hands of the leaders of the Member States."
"Talking of the Member States, Parliament has had to put up with hijacking manoeuvres and a lack of cooperation on the part of those who were then in charge of the Spanish Government."
"It is usual practice in Parliament’s temporary committees for ministers to give their points of view."
"This was not the case and the majority of the groups feel that between 13 and 19 November 2001 hasty and badly thought out decisions were taken which resulted in an accident turning into the greatest environmental disaster in Europe of the last few decades."
"After five months of hearings we are still wondering what made the Spanish authorities in charge order that the vessel be removed to the high seas."
"As the European Parliament stated in its resolution last year, this decision considerably increased the proportions of the disaster."
"My group is tabling several amendments, but following on from Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna’s speech, I would like to say that, while we think that Amendment No 2 from the PPE-DE Group is entirely superfluous and we are neither in favour or against it, we, and myself in particular, as a Galician and vice-chair of the Committee on Fisheries, think that Amendment No 1 is irrelevant and, what is more, dangerous, because no one has questioned the rigour of the scientific testing or the healthiness of the food chain."
"We would not have opposed an amendment to remove the word overfishing – if the honourable Member thinks it is so serious – although we still believe that the original wording of paragraph 50 is entirely inoffensive, as it only mentions the risk and the possibility of overfishing and in no way claims that it is already the case."
"I will say once again, however, that we are not entirely in favour, and we will therefore vote against, because we think it is quite dangerous to bring back the ghost now and question the rigour of the scientific tests and the healthiness of the food chain."
"Mr President, Mr Sterckx’ sound report does in fact take into account the important data confirmed during the months of work by the Temporary Committee."
"Among other things, the report incorporates the necessary criticism of the Spanish authorities regarding management of the tragic disaster of the ."
"It deplores the fact that it has been made impossible for the master of the vessel to leave Spain during his trial."
"It asks the essential questions concerning the amount of fuel still on board and the dangers that remain as a result."
"It emphasises strict monitoring of adherence to shipping routes and the coordination of measures to be taken in the event of an accident; it recommends that the Maritime Safety Agency should have more power."
"Finally, the report would like to see better protection for the Baltic, a better instrument for tracing dangerous vessels in order to locate them in the event of a disaster."
"It also formulates a number of requirements concerning international legislation."
"Although all these proposed measures are positive, they do not, even so, seem to me to go far enough compared to the measures already proposed in the and packages, even though the measures in these packages are indeed important and must be welcomed."
"Much was expected of this report from the Temporary Committee, and, indeed, it still is."
"I am sorry that the amendments calling for better cooperation and coordination of national actions have not been accepted in favour of a European coastguard service, which my group does not support."
"Before the vote just now, following the example of Mrs Bergaz, I am going to stress a number of proposals which we wish to have taken into account in the report and which can be found in the amendments proposed by my group and others."
"Safety at sea will not be improved without a review of the conditions under which seafarers work, without an end to the overexploitation that is to be found on many vessels, and without offering worthwhile pay with harmonisation at European level."
"Stronger measures against flags of convenience are essential."
"It is also necessary to look seriously at how to make the main parties responsible, shipowners, charterers, owners of cargoes and classification societies pay."
"What is more, the question of full compensation for the victims of the still remains unresolved."
"I myself truly believe that the report is worthy of our support, but I am anxious to say that my group will look carefully at how its proposals are taken into account in the vote on the amendments in order to decide on its final vote."
"Mr President, Commissioner, having followed the information given to the public during the crisis and the speeches in the parliamentary information committee, I believe that the vessel sank for two reasons: firstly due to its terrible seaworthiness, and secondly, due to the bad decision by Mr Aznar’s Spanish Government authorities, which, rather than seeking a place of refuge, chose to send the damaged vessel to areas with rough seas, with waves more than six metres high, until it broke up and sank, causing the biggest ever oil slick in Europe."
"I think that the fact that the vessel was sailing in an unsuitable condition was the responsibility of the owner, the captain, the oil company that owned the cargo, but above all, it was the responsibility of the classification society ABS, whose inspection conducted in the port of Dubai four months before it sank had not been correctly carried out according to the audit subsequently conducted by the International Association of Classification Societies."
"ABS also inspected the ship that exploded in Porto Torres, Sardinia on 1 January this year."
"I have therefore already tabled an amendment urging the Commission to carry out more effective monitoring and to audit classification societies and their inspectors regarding the quality of their work."
"It also urges the Commission to put a stop to any collusion or conflict of interests that there may be with owners, charterers, oil companies, etc. There needs to be greater transparency in this and also in the International Maritime Organisation, which receives a large proportion of its budget from States that are known as flag of convenience States, but where the real control is in the hands of other States, some of which are European."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the interpreters for their patience and kindness for the unforgivable suffering I have imposed on everybody since my first speech in September 1999."
"At that time I announced that I would speak neither French nor Spanish in plenary while the Basque language did not enjoy full recognition in the Basque country."
"Now, five years on, the rights of Basque speakers are still being ignored."
"I would therefore ask – in the English language, of course – my French and Spanish colleagues to act immediately."
"I join with other speakers in their positive response to the important work produced by the committee, chaired by Mr Jarzembowski, and to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx."
"The Commissioner said that a new report on the future of maritime safety will soon be presented."
"I hope that this time the Commission will emphasise the need for immediate and accurate information in the event of maritime disasters."
"That was not the case with the , where the interests of the public and in particular of the victims in Galicia and the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula, including the Basque country, were completely ignored."
"As a demonstration of linguistic solidarity, I am opting today to speak the language of farmers and seafarers, for the language of Castelão, a defender of true individual and collective freedom, taking the specific as my starting point and moving on to universal truths."
"I would like everyone to be aware that the disaster represented an exceptional time of dignity and strength, which was vital in understanding not just the Galicians but also all those oppressed men and women who want a fairer world."
"Even today, Castelão is a universal reference for peoples subjected to oppression in other states, and for all those nations whose existence is denied."
"Thank you, Galicians."
"Those will probably be my last words in this House because I will not be able to stand for re-election in June."
"I will be the only Member of this Parliament who will not have this opportunity because my political party has been outlawed by the Kingdom of Spain."
"I thank you all."
"Castelão is a universal reference for all peoples subject to the oppression of states that deny their existence."
"'Thank you, Galicians' will probably my last words in this Parliament because I will not be able to stand for re-election next June."
"I will be the only Member of this Parliament who will not have that possibility because our political party has been outlawed by the Kingdom of Spain."
"Thank you all the same. ."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, as the chairman of the non-standing committee for the improvement of safety at sea, I would like to extend warm thanks to the members of the committee and to the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, for the extraordinarily sensible way in which they conducted their deliberations and for their excellent report."
"The committee worked consistently in an excellent atmosphere, and everyone attempted to resolve the problems in a sensible manner."
"Many thanks."
"My special thanks, obviously, go to the staff of the secretariat, under the leadership of Mr Darmis, without whose extremely professional administrative support the rapid but, at the same time, careful work of the committee, including the important trip to Barcelona, would not have been possible."
"The hearing of numerous experts with various backgrounds, representatives of the Commission, the European Agency for Maritime Safety, the Irish presidency of the Council, the General Secretary of the IMO and, not least, the acting Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, in my opinion provided the committee with a broad foundation for its recommendations and assessments."
"We once again investigated maritime accidents subsequent to those involving the and the and mainly concentrated on the statutory measures introduced since then at European level to improve safety at sea and their implementation in the Member States."
"Of the 56 conclusions, I would like to emphasise four of a general nature."
"I will not go into the details."
"I believe, however, that four conclusions are so important that they should be emphasised."
"The Spanish authorities have successfully stopped the leak of oil from the wreck of the and submitted a timetable for the further pumping away of the oil out of it, so that additional harm to the environment and fishing should be avoided."
"We still have the problem that the waste extracted from the sea in the last few months and in the last few years must be carefully recycled, but that is a special problem."
"Secondly, in our opinion, the Spanish courts should urgently bring forward the judicial proceedings in respect of the accident and change the conditions applicable to the captain, so that he can return home until they start."
"Thirdly, the new regulations resolved on with the ‘Erika I’ and ‘Erika II’ packages of legislation are essentially the right ones for achieving a substantial improvement in safety at sea."
"Fourthly – and this is the key point – there is still inadequate transposition of the safety regulations into the national law of some Member States, and therefore into reality."
"Accordingly, Madam Vice-President, we support the Commission in its investigations into the implementation measures, in particular with regard to the question of the provision of emergency resting places and crisis response places."
"Commissioner, stick to it, put pressure on the Member States, and this House will support you!"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was part of the mission which my party sent to Galicia immediately after the accident and I remember how shocked we were by the sight of the beaches and by the despair of the residents of the area."
"I therefore wish, from this position and in the time available to me, to express my surprise at the blunt statement by the representative of the Spanish Government of the time that, in the event of a similar accident to the , they would again decide to remove the ship from the shore."
"I would also emphasise the findings in the report on the treatment of the master of the and the fact that this sort of treatment was also seen later, in Pakistan, with the crew of the , a matter on which Parliament passed a resolution. These seamen have already been released and returned home."
"Pakistan is ahead on this count of a Member State of the European Union!"
"I further wish to denounce a distortion, no my mistake, a clearly deliberate misrepresentation in the translation into Greek – and only Greek – of the discussion with Captain Mangouras referred to in the report. The translator, by adding a phrase which does not exist in Mr Sterckx's text, presents the master as maintaining exactly the opposite of what he actually maintained and agreeing with the action taken by the Spanish authorities."
"I would remind you that the matter of the shipwreck of the and the setting up and operation of the MARE committee were given broad coverage in the Greek media, which of course obtain their information from Greek texts."
"It would therefore appear that the translator wanted to exonerate the Spanish Government and its Greek supporters, come what may."
"I call on every person in a position of responsibility to examine my accusation, which concerns the last paragraph of the text entitled 'exchange of views with the master' in the explanatory report, and to crush the translation mafia in the European Parliament."
"To close, I wish to express my faith in what I would call absolute cooperation with the ΙΜΟ."
"– Mr President, the paradox in the European Union when we discuss safety at sea is that the Member States call for measures following disasters and then fail to apply them."
"What usually happens is that industry is incriminated, the crew is incriminated, the states tend to shirk all responsibility and it is obvious that this is not true."
"If only things were that simple, because we would have resolved the problem."
"The problem with safety at sea is obviously not Mr Mangouras, the Greek master, who should have had better treatment from the Spanish authorities, as the Sterckx report rightly notes, nor is the problem purely and simply single-hull tankers."
"It is also the maintenance of ships, as demonstrated by the recent shipwreck of the double-hull cargo vessel, the ,off the coast of Norway, it is that we do not have ports of refuge, in violation of Community legislation, it is that we do not conduct proper port controls, again in violation of Community legislation."
"It is overall, if I may say so, that the Member States do not apply what is generally speaking the good Community legislation which we have in the European Union."
"The first thing, therefore, that we need to do is to apply Community legislation and then we also need to look at the measures proposed in the Sterckx report, select certain basic priorities and take additional measures, such as creating a European coastguard."
"I would also point out that, obviously, as shipping is an international problem, international measures are also required, which is why cooperation with the International Maritime Organisation is always required."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Sterckx on his sterling report."
"It contains many sound recommendations, and it is to be hoped that they will be followed, so that we will be able to prevent unacceptable accidents involving oil tankers even more effectively, something by which we have been confronted on a number of occasions during the past term."
"What matters most now is to deliver on what has been agreed. This can be done, above all, by investing considerably more in monitoring existing measures."
"We must invest in global cooperation, also in order to tackle international maritime safety problems that fall outside of the European Union."
"Another point of crucial importance is consultation with, and the tackling of, flag states that take safety measures rather lightly."
"I think that what we all want is for so much to happen in the next few years that we will never have to hold a debate of this nature in Parliament again and that the risk of accidents of this nature will go down considerably, partly as a result of what we in the European Union are doing."
"Needless to say, coordination and cooperation among Member States is of key importance."
"The report contains many proposals to that effect."
"We must learn from each other and we must try to apply the same procedures."
"Reference was made a moment ago to the experiences of, and the meeting with, the English coordinator."
"From that, it transpired that the United Kingdom has adopted a very clear line of command in the case of accidents."
"This must also be done at European level."
"As such, we support the proposal on the setting up of a European coastguard service."
"That is a fair objective."
"However, it is important for us to examine first how this can be done via research, projects and experiments."
"We are all in favour of giving the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), the new institution, an important role during the further development of policy in this field, including controls and suchlike."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the chairman of the committee and also the rapporteur in spite of his absence."
"I am especially grateful to him for his work because, seeing the title and the aim of this Temporary Committee on improving safety at sea and some of the numerous amendments proposed, one gets an impression of the difficulty of his work as rapporteur, as well as the impression that the political opponents of the party in government of the Autonomous Community of Galicia and also in the Spanish Government were more interested in the partisan and party debate and in trying to erode and wear down the governing party politically than in looking forward and trying to efficiently and effectively improve the various aspects of safety at sea: social, economic, fisheries, tourism, environmental and health."
"It could seem as though we are living in different countries since, with some exceptions, some of which existed right at the start, as an inhabitant of the region most directly affected I think it can be asserted that the activity in the fisheries sector was initiated at the right time and with all possible guarantees, in accordance with the technical and health reports."
"It can also be asserted that, according to the opinion of a large majority of the professionals in this sector, the catches have not suffered; that neighbours and tourists who have come to Galicia in great numbers over the recent Easter week, possibly with some specific problems, which there always are, found our beaches to be clean, and that help and assistance have arrived punctually and, furthermore, that we can all be proud of our civic solidarity, in the knowledge that the peoples of Europe are resolved to overcome their former divisions and to shape a common destiny, as called for in the preamble of the future Constitution."
"Finally, I will refer to the purely social aspect, since maritime activity is a human activity, and every professional maritime worker also has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity and also requires measures intended to raise the prestige of maritime occupations in order to make them more attractive to young people in general and young Europeans in particular."
"Thank you for this, Mr President, and thank you, Commissioner, for all the progress we have made under your drive and direction."
"Just a note, Mr President, to say that the situation of Captain Mangouras corresponds to a legal decision and legal decisions must be respected whether you agree with them or not."
"Mr Savary, if political change affects the independence of the judiciary it would be very serious, because the separation of powers continues to be a fundamental pillar of democracy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am sorry that Mr Sterckx is not present in the House, and I am sure that he has pressing reasons for this, but I would like Mr Vermeer to pass on to him that this committee is making progress as a result of the disaster and that, as of this moment, we have an excellent Commission proposal and an excellent report by Mr Sterckx on safety at sea."
"Is Parliament really asking Mr Sterckx for an own-initiative report on safety at sea in this situation?"
"This would not be very logical."
"Everyone is aware that what Parliament is asking for is an investigatory committee on the , precisely in order to clarify what has happened and to avoid repetition, in order to establish that seriously damaged vessels should not be sent to the open seas to sink, but that ports of refuge should be provided."
"This committee should have made it very clear that this should not be repeated, that we cannot get away with pollution and that not everything can be resolved through commercial relations and political dependencies."
"None of this appears in Mr Sterckx’s report."
"The experts have been ignored, not to say scoffed at, and I am sorry that Mr Sterckx has reneged on the pact that he made with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in order to have, at this time, the President of the House that we have."
"I must, however, give Mr Sterckx some bad news: in his investiture report, the President of the Spanish Government has decided to create a monitoring committee on the ."
"We will be able to continue clarifying and providing information in spite of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as other Members have already said, we can be pleased with the work the rapporteur has done."
"I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating Mr Sterckx on his work on maritime safety."
"This compliment also applies to the Commissioner."
"The report that is now before us is succinct and clear and has avoided duplication in respect of the September resolution."
"I have tabled a few amendments in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and all of them have either been approved or included in the rapporteur's compromise amendments."
"I should now like to turn to my concerns."
"First of all, the European coastguard service."
"A majority in this Parliament is – quite rightly – in favour of a far-reaching form of cooperation between the different coastguard services, with the establishment of a common European coastguard service as the ultimate goal, if necessary."
"For this coastguard service, as well as for the existing European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), it is of major importance to have sufficient powers to be able to carry out the work in the field of maritime safety effectively."
"In my view, far more attention should be paid to the maintenance and state of the ships."
"Accordingly, a poorly maintained double-hulled tanker will constitute a greater risk than a well-maintained single-hulled tanker."
"I have also expressed my misgivings about the registration labelling of containers and vessels containing dangerous chemicals and substances."
"This is further to the loss of very toxic cargo from the in the North Sea, in which apparently, the substance in question did not correspond to the description on the bills of lading."
"I am also anxious about the increase in the export of Russian oil via the Baltic Sea along the EU coastline, because very often, this involves the cheapest substandard tonnage."
"Since my own report concerning the introduction of criminal sanctions has run aground in the Council, I am delighted to see that a few Members, including the rapporteur, are calling on the Council to reach a decision in this matter as soon as possible."
"Internationally, there are plenty of options in legislation to tackle the situation."
"The problem, though, is that the Member States do not enforce the rules to which they have committed themselves through treaties."
"It is precisely those Member States that reject controls by means of Community legislation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of one minute I should like to point out to you six paths to be worked on during the next legislative period."
"Firstly, the European coastguards."
"Secondly, seafarers’ living and working conditions, which must be as good as possible on board."
"Thirdly, flags of convenience, making every effort to drive them out, and strengthening our position within the International Maritime Organisation."
"Fourthly, implementation of the regulations relating to port reception facilities."
"Fifthly, work on the concept of freedom of the seas, which is an old concept about which seafarers care but which will have to be studied carefully."
"We no longer transport wood, wine and stones but much more dangerous materials."
"Sixthly, ensure greater traceability of petroleum products."
"You know that the techniques for doing this exist, a sort of petroleum DNA, and when degassing is carried out or ballast tanks are emptied, this is a new lead for detecting the culprits."
"There, Commissioner, you have a number of points on which it must be possible to work during the legislative period that is about to start."
"Mr President, Commissioner, anyone who travelled at the time with the delegation of the committee to Galicia will never forget the inexhaustible assistants in their initially white, but soon oil-stained overalls, above all how they attempted stone by stone to wash away every trace of oil from the coast."
"It is, sadly, the case that in particular it took so serious an accident as that of the tanker finally to improve safety in maritime traffic."
"Today, however, I would like to emphasise that we will have succeeded in doing that, if we implement the measures indicated in the report and follow them up."
"This needs a maritime network rather than another bureaucratic skyscraper in the big city of the European Union."
"Effective protection of the coast can only be achieved through greater safety at sea at the multinational level."
"Any particularist approach by small states must be relegated to the past."
"What is effective is if, in the context of joint protection of the coast, synergies can be recognised and, through a joint organisation, people and materials be aligned with each other and the best possible use made of them across the countries and seas of the region."
"For me, therefore, coastal protection, environmental protection or whatever you would like to call it is also a form of regional and structural support across Europe."
"I take such protection to mean preventive measures for the protection of the environment and, in the context of a joint monitoring of the coast, also an effective resource for combating crime at sea."
"I am proud of this and I am sure that the catalogue of measures we have decided on will achieve its objective."
"This will be to the benefit of everyone in the European Union, in both the present members and the new ones, in the short, medium and long term."
"A revival of the maritime ecosystem and increased readiness for investments in maritime routes, the maritime motorway of the future, will be the payoff."
"Mr President, learning from a catastrophe means facing the future."
"All the laws or directives that we pass here are, at the end of the day, worth nothing if they cannot be monitored and enforced."
"For this reason, we need very rapidly in the medium term a European coast guard service, not least in view of the new and emerging risk of terrorism."
"We cannot sit and wait until terrorists attack vessels in European waters, but rather we must counter them in good time through a coast guard service."
"My second point is that the Baltic is a sensitive maritime area."
"As a committee, we called for obligatory pilots in the Baltic, but we are aware that this cannot be achieved without Russia."
"For this reason, we ask you, Commissioner, to combine with the Commission and the Council in putting political pressure on Russia to ensure that Russia also at last complies with the international regulations in the IMO."
"My third and final point is that we are aware that 80% of all accidents at sea are attributable to human error."
"Hitherto, we have devoted great attention to technology."
"In the future, we must concentrate more on the human factor, which means that we must direct our attention more specifically to the training of captains, officers and crew in accident management, fire protection and emergency measures."
"Mr President, I have campaigned long and hard for the establishment of a European coastguard, and in the light of numerous maritime accidents and incidents that have occurred in recent years, the case for such a maritime force has never been stronger."
"Last year I produced a detailed policy proposal calling for the establishment of an EU coastguard, which I submitted to the European Convention for discussion."
"Since the disaster in November 2002, the issues of European maritime security and safety have been given a much higher priority on the European agenda."
"The enduring environmental damage caused by the disaster demonstrates that Member States acting alone are under-resourced and ill-prepared to face such disasters."
"In addition, the traffic in EU shipping lanes is increasingly heavy and the number of collisions and disasters that have occurred in EU waters points to the need for more effective coordination in avoiding potential maritime disasters."
"Regrettably, our coastal waters are being exploited by organised crime for trafficking in arms, drugs, cigarettes and human beings."
"Additionally, given the present geo-political climate, we must consider how we can prevent the potential threat of terrorist attacks using the seas of Europe."
"Often EU leaders seek to make the EU more relevant in the daily lives of their citizens."
"Establishing an EU coastguard would be a tangible way of doing this because it would tackle the real concerns of those we represent."
"I therefore welcome the Sterckx report."
"I welcome the fact that it has adopted my proposal for the establishment of an EU coastguard as the best means of improving safety at sea in the long term, and in addition has called for a clear decision-making and command structure for dealing with maritime emergencies."
"I congratulate Mr Sterckx for producing an excellent report and I would urge Members of this House to support it enthusiastically."
"Mr President, I regret that Mr Sterckx cannot be with us here today, but such is the fate of a party leader."
"I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on her work in the field of maritime safety."
"To send the frail into the open sea in storm conditions was a capital blunder on the part of the Spanish Government."
"The refusal to admit mistakes was characteristic of the Aznar Government and it is not surprising that this Government has now been voted out."
"The covering up of the facts was the result of a wrong interpretation of democracy, one that is still tangible in Galicia."
"I went along to help the volunteers clear up the oil."
"I am backing this report and therefore hope that this disaster was the last one of its kind."
"In this report, measures are proposed."
"A European coastguard service will play a crucial role in future."
"My last word on this – and I say it with pride – is: ."
"Mr President, I would like, firstly, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, although he is not present, to congratulate Mr Jarzembowski for his magnificent work as chairman of the committee and to congratulate you all, ladies and gentlemen, for your speeches and for your work to take this committee forward and make it work."
"I would start by requesting, ladies and gentlemen, that we all be fair and that we try to be a bit impartial."
"If we must be critical, we must go back much further, as before the , before the , unfortunately, the European coastlines had been polluted, assaulted, by a series of dreadful accidents."
"I would recall the , off the Breton coast, or the , off the Galician coast, to name but two cases previous to those cited, which are as alike as two peas in a pod."
"At that time, dreadful disasters took place and nothing was done, ladies and gentlemen."
"In this respect, we can feel proud that now something has been done."
"This time has been different from that time, in the eighties and nineties, when nothing was done, whilst, for example, the United States, following the disaster, took a series of measures that now allow them to assert that their coastlines are much safer, given that there can never be zero risk."
"I must say that, as a politician, the past only interests me in order to be able to avoid repeating mistakes and look towards the future."
"The future is where we are and this is what we are all working on together."
"In this respect, we can be satisfied and say that in the future, in current reality, the European coastlines are safer than four years ago."
"We can be satisfied with everyone’s participation, and the Commission is aware of the joint effort we have made."
"I must also say that the Council has taken the corresponding steps forward."
"It is, however, true that the decision of the Commission and Parliament has been much more systematically clear than that of the Council."
"I am not referring to each of the countries of the Council, as they have different sensibilities, but to the Council as a whole."
"To move on the issues relating to the true situation of Community law, we are first of all monitoring the timetable closely."
"When the months envisaged for transposition come to an end, any Member State that does not report the transposition of a regulation will be summonsed to legal proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg. I have told you, ladies and gentlemen, we have already initiated a series of proceedings in some Member States."
"Second, regarding the reality of internal application, even when the transposition has been carried out, we are, thanks to the European Maritime Safety Agency – we have present here today its Executive Director, Mr De Ruiter, who is doing a fantastic job – making systematic inspections ."
"This allows us to verify whether, as well as incorporating a certain number of rules into national law, this is also reflected in practice."
"We will also produce the appropriate and relevant reports."
"Third, you have asked about the situation of Captain Mangouras."
"Look, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is not able to intervene in the legal systems of the Member States."
"Neither can the governments intervene in the legal decisions of the Member States."
"There is a separation of powers."
"In this respect, I suspect, as has already been indicated, that a political change in the Spanish Government will have little effect on the opinion of the judge on duty."
"It would be catastrophic and disastrous if the judge on duty were to obey the political impulses of the ideals of the government in power."
"I would find it regrettable and I am sure that the judge on duty is doing his job."
"In this regard, consider the precedents, such as the fact that the captain of the – I would like to remind this House that this was a vessel whose owners were very close relatives of the owners of the , as close as brothers and brothers-in-law – who was responsible 14 years ago for a catastrophe similar to that of the on the Spanish coastline, left without allowing them to bring him to justice, because he took advantage of his bail to, quite simply, get on a plane and never again set foot in Spain."
"In this case, what is happening is that the judge on duty is taking precautions as there is some very specific background that is particularly unfavourable in terms of the behaviour, at least in this case, in a very similar situation, of some companies that are particularly involved."
"As one of you, ladies and gentlemen, said a short while ago, although the majority of crews, captains and officers are reliable, reasonable and respectable people, there are exceptions."
"I will now comment on spills."
"The great disasters, according to the statistics, represent less than 10% of marine pollution."
"Most pollution, although it is true that it is more diluted and, therefore, less visible, is continuous spillage, bilge cleaning, the cleaning carried out on the open seas by unscrupulous vessels."
"In this respect, I would like once more to thank this Parliament for the backing it has given to the Commission proposal to penalise those who voluntarily cause this sort of pollution of our seas."
"Regrettably, the Council is not in favour, which is causing problems."
"This proposal, as Mr Poignant has said, includes such subjects as traceability and sensors to monitor how the large vessels that put into our ports manage dumping and bilge cleaning."
"All this is also in line with the measure that we previously adopted for harbour installations to collect waste and to allow the vessels putting into European ports to carry out cleaning within these installations."
"Fifth, I agree with Mr Ortuondo Larrea that the classification societies have a great responsibility."
"The classification societies should be the guarantee and, in this respect, Mr De Ruiter, the European Maritime Safety Agency and also the Commission are monitoring and analysing their behaviour because, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, we have increased the responsibility of the classification societies following the disaster and we can even withdraw their power to recognise and certify vessels in relation to European ports."
"We are working on it and I agree completely on its importance, as well as the chain of responsibilities that another of you indicated previously comprising the maritime transport operator, the ship owner – not only the captain, who also is responsible – and the various elements appearing in the transport chain."
"This must be done, however, not only at European Union level, but also at the level of the International Maritime Organisation."
"With that, we arrive at the sixth point of my intervention."
"We are talking about an entirely international and globalised activity."
"In this respect, we can adopt a series of measures at European regional level, but there are other measures that can only be adopted, or will only have any real effect if adopted, at international level."
"This comprises our fight against flags of convenience, although to some degree we are already penalising them, because of the criteria by which the vessels that must undergo port controls are selected."
"The flying of certain flags automatically causes that vessel to be a priority control objective and, therefore, it is moored for longer and experiences more problems, etc. Therefore, to a certain extent, we are already looking at this problem, but we will only be able to go further when at international level, which is what we are pushing for, all questions of auditing and of the responsibility of the Member States issuing the flag are clearly reinforced."
"The minimum rules regarding crews are also international."
"In this respect, the International Labour Organization must make progress regarding the qualifications and training of maritime personnel, not only for European crews, but also for international crews that put into our ports in vessels from third countries and to whom our European regulations cannot be applied."
"It is, however, clear that we require the seafarers and the crews of our vessels to have undergone training that makes them much safer."
"We simply have to compare the reality of the accidents in vessels with a European flag with that of third-country vessels."
"It is necessary to continue this work and, in fact, throughout this legislature we have established and adopted measures to strengthen and improve the quality of crews and also the prestige of maritime work, making it more attractive, making it a viable life option for our young people to join a merchant ship as a seafarer, officer or captain."
"In this respect I think that, for example, during the Greek Presidency, a series of measures were taken and I hope that there will be a commitment on the part of the British Presidency to take up all these initiatives that we are working on to make the occupation of sailor more attractive to young people in the European Union."
"You are aware, ladies and gentlemen, that the coastguard problem is important to the Commission, but we know that for now it will not be resolved."
"For this reason, we must back what is attainable at the moment: greater cooperation and coordination between the coastguards of the different Member States and, of course, an expansion of the role of the European Maritime Safety Agency."
"Very recently, we adopted a regulation to amend the powers of this Agency, including the power to manage anti-pollution activities in the event of accidents, in order to be able to tackle them by means of European measures that are equal to any needs that may arise, but we have also expanded its powers in the spheres of safety and security"
"I would appreciate it, therefore, if we had financial backing in the budgetary debate, because we are discussing financing for 2005 and we need funds to be able to establish the anti-pollution measures and, specifically, the cleaning vessels we were discussing."
"I will finish on a very clear issue, directed at Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso."
"Look, Mr Gorostiaga, you know as well as I that I will be able to come here."
"Aralar upholds the same ideals as your party, apart from the fact that it condemns terrorism."
"You know that your political party has been declared illegal by the judgment of a judge in Spain, not by a government decision."
"It is true that this judge was basing his judgment on legislation adopted democratically and legitimately by over 90% of the Spanish Congress of Members and that, from that moment, your approach is defensible, but what is indefensible, not only from the point of view of the Spanish, but also of Europeans, is not condemning a very specific example of terrorism, that of ETA. In this respect, I would like to remind you that your party has been considered a terrorist organisation by the European Union by means of a decision of June 2003."
"Mr President, I wish to say to the Commissioner that, firstly, in Spain there is Spanish nationalism, and Spanish judges are under its influence all the time."
"We are neither Spaniards nor French: we are championing a political course to self-determination for the Basque country."
"We are not championing terrorism of any kind, contrary to what the Commissioner said."
"We are championing a political path for the Basque people."
"If we are in a European Union based on democracy, and if the Basque people were to decide on a particular political future for their country, everyone should respect that decision."
"I refute any kind of accusation of complicity with terrorism."
"The Commissioner knows perfectly well that I have never defended in this House any kind of action that could be construed as terrorism."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"There can be no doubt that the Spanish authorities have a great deal to answer for over the shipwreck of the ."
"The report itself, although it is very much lacking in some areas, is highly critical of the Spanish authorities, and in particular of the statements made by Spanish leaders and of the failure to make the conclusions of the investigations more widely known."
"It is also positive that the report emphasises the need for more attention to be paid to the maintenance of ships and to their condition, even in the case of double-hulled vessels, which may represent a greater potential hazard; that it advocates agreements under the auspices of the IMO on the speedy and independent investigation of shipping disasters; that it calls on the coastal Member States to establish a clear and independent decision-making and command structure for dealing with maritime emergencies; that it calls for an investigation of the scope for introducing mandatory insurance; for financial compensation for places of refuge; for a system of penalties to combat illegal discharges; for an audit of the classification societies; and for the Member States to transpose the relevant Community directives and to ratify the international conventions; for the training of seafarers; and to retain the dignity of the seafaring professions."
"I regret, however, that the report does not mention improvements in workers' social conditions and that our proposals to abolish flags of convenience, to make all parties responsible for the payment of damages, and to support investigations of the authenticity of maritime certificates issued, were rejected."
"We hope that these amendments, which we have tabled once again, will be accepted in the plenary."
"The next item is the report (A5-0220/2004) by Mr Cocilovo, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have today before you for the vote a report of great importance within the framework of European transport policy, specifically, the amendment of the ‘Eurovignette’ Directive."
"As you well know, the current Community framework is inadequate in view of the numerous initiatives that have been set up recently at national level in this regard."
"This framework needs to be strengthened, particularly in order to ensure fair competition conditions between freight transporters and give greater stimulus to the balance between the individual modes of transport."
"First of all, I would like to sincerely congratulate Mr Cocilovo on his excellent work."
"He has achieved something that, I must say, I thought impossible: grouping, bringing together, and integrating a series of amendments, presenting in the end a result that respects the principles and philosophy of the Commission proposal."
"Apart from some technical aspects, I would like to convey clearly the Commission’s support for the Parliamentary report."
"First, I would like to point out that the draft report takes on a fundamental principle of the proposal, and this is the allocation of charging income to transport."
"This principle has been and continues to be the subject of arduous debates in the Council."
"For this reason, it is of vital importance that Parliament has supported it."
"How can the idea of a motorway toll be justified if we do not know what is to become of the funds it generates?"
"In an internal market, such as we have now, how can this situation, that could send us back almost to medieval times, be justified?"
"The execution of the great projects of the Trans-European Transport Network also suffers from a lack of funds."
"In this respect, road charges constitute a financial impulse mechanism that must contribute to the improvement of transport links in the enlarged Union."
"With regard to the calculation of tolls, the draft report encourages the Commission to develop a method of calculating external costs."
"The discussions held in the Council demonstrate that, for the moment, it has not been possible to reach a compromise based on objective data and objectively determined costs."
"In this respect, we must continue our work and find a reliable methodology, which can be clearly accepted horizontally within the Council."
"It is also necessary to obtain the support of Parliament for the increase of tolls in particularly sensitive areas, such as mountain regions and those affected by a high level of pollution."
"This last concept is completely innovative and will contribute to the creation of infrastructures that are costly but necessary for the elimination of bottlenecks in our network."
"I would like to finish by emphasising the fact that the Commission has made an effort to offer the European Parliament a text that is acceptable to everyone; the transit countries must be capable of applying a system of charging that allows them to promote their own network within a perspective of sustainable transport development and, at the same time, the peripheral countries of the Union and their freight transporters will be the first to benefit from an effective charging policy in Europe that provides them with well-functioning networks."
"On the other hand, we need to understand the concerns of those countries that are expecting a possible increase in transport costs and, therefore, a comparatively unfavourable situation."
"In order not to affect the viability of transport companies, the tolls must be fixed at reasonable levels that imply compensation for the use of an infrastructure, and therefore for the objectively calculated costs generated by the use of that infrastructure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, I would have liked to have this initiative adopted at first reading and for an informal trialogue, or an informal agreement between Parliament, Council and Commission, to have allowed us to go ahead with this initiative."
"This has not been possible."
"I hope, however, that thanks to the result of Mr Cocilovo’s report, to the amendments to be introduced and to the fundamental support of this Parliament for the Commission proposal, we will soon be able to achieve a common position in the Council that is sufficiently close to Parliament’s proposal to allow, quickly, at second reading or through a quick conciliation, the adoption of this extremely important directive for the balance of transport in the European Union to be completed."
". Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commissioner has mentioned, it is important not just, and not so much, to highlight the significance of this proposal for a directive, within the framework of developing a European strategy for transport systems, but also to mention that it is not the first time that the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council itself have dealt with matters relating to the transport system and transport networks and expressed their views with specific pronouncements on them and with reference to the external costs involved in their use and the associated, problematic issue of transport infrastructure charges."
"As regards the reference to Parliament’s contribution, certain points were highlighted on all of these occasions in the conclusions linked to individual reports and speeches: the need first of all to harmonise transport charges in all Member States to consolidate the single European market; the opportunity for a transformation – if not a radical one in some cases, then one that is objective and realistic at all times and, in any case, challenging – of the charging structure with a view to internalising the external costs of transport, which are often overlooked when decisions are made concerning the transport mode and, therefore, omitted from infrastructure completion strategies."
"On the one hand, there is an increasingly urgent need to invest huge resources to satisfy the demand for transport infrastructures. On the other hand, the Member States must tackle the costs – including social costs – involved in the growth of mobility, from increased air and noise pollution to environmental problems, and above all increased congestion and rising accident rates."
"I cannot call to mind the figures relating to this outlook, which must also be seen in the context of enlargement and of the expected increase in demand that, as always, must be met."
"This is not just an issue of external costs."
"We know that often the construction of infrastructures and the operation of the transport system have been funded primarily from general taxation."
"Today, however, the new approach to the sphere of public sector activity, the ceilings on the Member States’ budgets and policies for the privatisation of services, make it essential also to have recourse to private-sector capital to finance the construction of infrastructures, even if it means sacrificing a plan for completion."
"I would just like to mention that if this all has to take place outside of a plan – which is acceptable to no one – of detrimentally penalising road transport, it will be necessary to guarantee alternatives because the single incentive of toll charging or the measure relating to costs would not constitute an answer to the problem, in the absence of real and competitive alternatives to redirect a proportion of the volume of traffic."
"Instead, in terms of costs, it would exacerbate the forced use of this infrastructure and would have general economic consequences. This is why we have tried to give guidelines and find solutions to the most sensitive and difficult aspects of the problem through the cost financing instrument, and to divert an additional set of resources to accelerate the implementation of such projects."
"I will conclude by lamenting the fact that a delay on this due to internal positions in the Council will today prevent a complete result."
"In order to achieve one, I believe that strengthening Parliament’s position could play a major role in the future development of negotiations and, to this end, I must thank all the groups and all the Members for their valuable cooperation in the work at this stage, at least in view of the objective of bringing the first reading of the report to a positive conclusion."
"Mr President, the fundamental aim of this directive is to create a system of cross financing that will facilitate the construction of alternative transport infrastructures in particularly sensitive areas."
"At the same time, it will help to improve conditions for the movement of persons and goods within the Community, it will stimulate increased competitiveness in the transport sector and it will regulate the inclusion of all external costs in the prices paid by users."
"I am basically in agreement with these objectives, although I would have liked to see a more ambitious text in terms of harmonisation."
"I nevertheless consider it vital, and I emphasised this in the opinion that I drafted, that the new charges and tolls should not lead to an increase in the aggregate tax burden."
"For that reason, the Member States will have to revise annual road taxes and registration fees downwards."
"Lastly, I have taken into consideration that the original proposal did not include any measure to allow for the specific situation of outlying countries, whose transport operators, as regards their ability to compete, will be more affected in the short to medium term than their counterparts in Member States in the centre of Europe."
"The approval of a new recital covering exactly this point should encourage the Commission and the Council to take this fact into account."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mr Cocilovo, my group does, of course, endorse your report, in which you support the proposal of the Commission to review the Directive on the road toll fees and propose major improvements."
"We are also glad that the committee, contrary to the rapporteur’s original inclinations, has not proposed the introduction of road toll fees for private motor vehicles by way of Community law, because I believe – and in this the Commission is completely right – that whether a country wishes to introduce road toll fees for private motor vehicles should be left up to that country on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity."
"In my own country, Germany, there would be no reason for it, because when we consider what the driver is already paying for fuel and vehicle taxes, he is to a large extent paying for the costs of roads, indeed more than the costs of the roads would require."
"So we are glad that the question of toll fees for private motor vehicles is dealt with under European law."
"Secondly, we support the Commissioner in her struggle – –which is what it is – in the Council for a clear commitment of purpose, because it makes no sense to increase the road toll fees in order to improve road maintenance and expansion, if as a result the increased revenues are added to the general tax pool and go to finance no doubt very reasonable training or cultural measures or other policies."
"If goods vehicles are to be subject to higher toll fees the revenues from them must be returned to the transport sector."
"I would like to end by raising two questions, and I can guarantee that we will be discussing them again in the second round."
"We were indeed all in agreement – even the rapporteur has referred to it – that we cannot increase the road toll fees without limit, because the increase of toll fees would lead to the death of the transport economy and the economy as a whole."
"We cannot just regard the goods vehicle as the cash cow of Europe."
"There must be limits to how far we can increase road toll fees, because otherwise we will harm jobs and economic growth."
"For that reason, there are two questions on which there is certainly a need for further discussion."
"Up to now, we generally took the view that it was possible to tax goods vehicles in favour of other transport players in the spirit of cross-finance in the Alps and the Pyrenees, because this territory, so to speak, imposed a need for particularly expensive transport facilities, for example for rail."
"Now, this provides a basis for permitting cross-finance in other sensitive areas also."
"I must warn against leaving the door open here."
"Speaking for my home city of Hamburg, I can say immediately that it is a sensitive area with a high volume of transport, so that we could indeed impose higher toll fees in Hamburg, Cologne and elsewhere."
"We must therefore think very carefully about where we will apply cross-finance as an instrument."
"The second issue has to do with external costs; let me give you an example of what I mean."
"If toll fees are increased because of blockages on many sections of the Trans-European network, we would be rewarding the Member States who fail to build the necessary infrastructure."
"They would get more money if they do not expand."
"That cannot be right!"
"So let us carefully consider these questions at second reading."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I note that there is still a great need for discussion and we will indeed continue with it in the next parliamentary term."
"Let me begin by expressing my best wishes and thanks to the rapporteur."
"He really had his hands full with one of the most difficult and important reports in this parliamentary term, and he has done an outstanding job of it."
"Some important comments have already been made."
"I would like to emphasise once again that it is a good thing that we have now formulated a uniform methodology."
"In this way, we can in future get rid of the mosaic of different toll systems with markedly varying charges."
"It is also extremely important for us that it has been possible to apply the full cost principle and to include infrastructure older than 15 years."
"There is, of course, another point that is close to my heart."
"The purpose of the Directive is not only to generate financial resources for the infrastructure, important though that indeed is."
"The purpose of the Directive is also to contribute to the control and management of transport, above all through levying appropriate charges."
"We will do this on the one hand through the differentiation of the toll and on the other through the possibility of cross-finance."
"In the differentiation of the toll, we will be able for the first time to allow for external costs such as ground contamination, blockage and noise costs."
"This represents a first step towards the comprehensive internalisation of the environmental costs, a result not to be underestimated."
"My group also endorses Amendment No 55, which deals with a further differentiation in these areas."
"As regards the increase of the toll for the purpose of cross-finance, the rapporteur has indeed proposed an excellent compromise."
"It is right that we have expanded the definition of the sensitive areas – something about which I absolutely do not agree with Mr Jarzembowski – so that the conurbations are also included in them, because that is where the most serious noise and emission problems occur."
"We have certainly not come up with the best solution, and it would be a pity if we now only get as far as the first reading."
"I look forward to the further discussion in the next parliamentary term and to future debates on the subject."
"Mr President, Mr Cocilovo, sooner or later, even the European Union will succeed in giving itself some rules in order to apply the two principles: the ‘user pays’ principle, whereby users meet the cost of infrastructure use, and the ‘polluter pays’ principle, whereby polluters will pay the costs of the negative effects of congestion, pollution and health damage, that are becoming ever more evident."
"Sooner or later it will happen."
"At the beginning of the parliamentary term we were idealistic about being able to apply both of them: this has not happened, we are half way there."
"We can say that the excellent Cocilovo report does, at least, allow us to achieve the first objective of sensibly applying the principle according to which those using the roads are charged the cost of them and this money is used to finance maintenance or further construction and, therefore, indirectly, to thus take a broad approach that, by using cross-financing, allows us to take a more comprehensive look at the corridor in which the road runs."
"Fortunately, however, it seems to me that the Cocilovo report gives some additional guidelines."
"In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with fixing tariffs and only maintaining this objective for some heavy vehicles and for some roads – just for transporting goods, in short – because at the end of the day something is achieved."
"At the same time, the report suggests guidelines as to the possibility of having different tariffs to take into account congestion and pollution and to encourage a shift to other modes of transport."
"From this point of view, I feel that the route chosen is positive and should be supported, including this relatively innovative concept, which is a concept upon which I believe we must carry out more work."
"The World Health Organisation sees a clear link between particulates and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases."
"This implies that we have a duty to intervene, including with a tariff instrument, to ensure that these problems are dealt with seriously."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur warmly once again for his constructive collaboration."
"He has really tried to achieve a viable compromise."
"For a sustained strategy for the Eurovignette, however, the success achieved so far is not sufficient."
"This is because the purpose of the Eurovignette is to achieve fairness in competition between rail and road and also to compel those who cause damage to pay for it."
"We think that external costs caused by transport, goods transport by road, must be attributable to it in full, and only then can fairness be achieved."
"Fairness in competition means that the long-term environmental damage must also be included here."
"Mention has been made of the sensitive areas."
"There too, it is obvious that not only the mountain areas, but also valleys, which have the effect of kettles and in which environmental pollution is massively intensified, and even the cities, which are already subject to strain, are all vulnerable to possible increases in the effect of traffic."
"Fairness in competition also means that social dumping in goods transport must be resisted."
"As we all know, it is only through more effective monitoring that this can be promoted."
"We therefore take the view that greater room for manoeuvre must be created in the integration of external costs into the ‘polluter pays’ principle in the area of transport for the purpose of achieving greater road safety, sustained long-term integration and above all sustained environmental protection, because we do not want the next generation to carry the cost of the damage that we are now doing with a short-term strategy for the Eurovignette."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, in my country, Austria, during discussion of the transit issue, the prevailing opinion was that the European Parliament was responsible for the failure to come up with a reasonable successor regulation."
"I believe that this was not the case, but it is essentially idle to argue about this."
"Here and now, we have what we always supported in Austria, namely a signal for a new Pan-European transport policy which, in addition to the classic objectives of such a policy, namely traffic capacity, a favourable costs ratio and road safety, the needs of others are also considered, in particular the needs of people who reside and have to live along the European transport routes, and the requirements of the environment and the goals of sustainable development."
"In this debate, which will, today, conclude with a result at first reading, the rapporteur, Mr Cocilovo, has achieved a great deal in an excellent collaboration with many people in this House."
"For this we must thank him, and also for the good deal of progress that we have made, which has produced results which should, at the end of the day, complete this procedure."
"We have prescribed cost-fidelity as a principle of European transport policy in general."
"In particular, we have also managed to get the so-called external costs integrated."
"We have addressed the special legal protection of sensitive areas, but also non-sensitive ones, and also sensitive times – with the emphasis on night-time traffic."
"We have, as is particularly important, ensured that toll revenues end up and are applied precisely where we urgently need them, namely in a combination of purpose for the transport sector and the possibility of achieving cross-finance between the individual transport players."
"Not everything that we have achieved in this first reading in this House is sufficient in each individual case, and, for that reason, the next few months will find us having to do more work on the subject in the new parliamentary term, and we will have to endeavour, in the new Parliament, in a larger and expanded Parliament, to gain an understanding – if possible an improved understanding – for the matters of which I have spoken."
"We will in particular also be required to ensure that the Council is involved in our discussion and that in the foreseeable future we will have a reasonable overall result."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like warmly to thank the rapporteur, Mr Cocilovo, for his efforts, his commitment and also his readiness to compromise on many points."
"The fact that I am nevertheless dissatisfied will perhaps be of some assistance to him in his dealings with Mr Jarzembowski, because he stands somewhere in the middle between the various opinions predominating in this house."
"I would like to take up two subjects that have already been debated today."
"One relates to the level of the toll and the fear of many people that excessively high toll will be levied."
"I believe that each country, each region will always have to consider for itself whether the toll might have adverse effects on competition, and so an upper limit will automatically be imposed here."
"In addition, even if there are some relatively high toll fees – such as, for example, those charged for the Brenner – thousands and thousands of drivers have not been deterred from continuing to make use of the Brenner. What this means is that, provided that the fee is not so high that it has a prohibitive effect, we have witnessed an increasing use of goods vehicles for many years."
"The second problem, which has not been adequately resolved, has to do with the external costs."
"I acknowledge that the rapporteur has made suggestions here which have also been accepted by the majority of the committee and which relate to the possibility of allocating external costs, that is to say, environmental costs."
"The whole question turns on the need for the Commission to make proposals – which, unfortunately, it has not done."
"I have been a Member of this Parliament for two parliamentary terms and there has been constant discussion of this, but no concrete proposals for charging methods have ever been made."
"Hence also the motions which had been proposed by my party, including with my signature, for an initial statement that the Commission will make specific recommendations for charging methods within two years and, secondly, the proposal that, until that is the case, reasonable – that is to say, non-arbitrary – national charging methods can be used."
"I would be happy if, at least on the first point, relating to the invitation to the Commission to make proposals within two years, we could achieve consensus even today."
"This would greatly promote the formation of opinions and therefore also the subsequent negotiations with the Council."
"Nevertheless, warm thanks to the rapporteur."
"It is a good, but not yet satisfactory, solution that has been produced."
"Mr President, I am pleased and at the same time grateful that, after a very long time, the rapporteur has, after all, managed to find good compromises within the life of this Parliament."
"This proposal to charge HGVs is an improvement on the current system."
"It offers Member States more flexibility with regard to the kinds of systems they use."
"Charges can be adapted according to time of day, day, weight and EURO emission class."
"As a result, the charges are more flexible and more market-oriented than in the old regime, and that is progress."
"It is also, in my view, important that the pre-conditions for charging HGVs should be regulated at European level."
"There should be a system in place to stipulate how a toll is to be imposed and organised by a Member State."
"In this context, it is important to ensure that unnecessary new charges for heavier transport do not have a knock-on effect, which would have serious consequences for the normal logistical flow of goods, and lead to competition from the top down."
"We do not want to turn this into a competition."
"The proposal that is now before us is not quite finished."
"I myself am pleased with Amendment No 50 tabled by Mr Simpson and Mr Swoboda."
"I too am concerned about the ambiguity surrounding the way in which attempts are being made to internalise external costs, environmental costs, social costs and costs of accidents."
"This should be done on the basis of generally valid calculation methods."
"It is positive that the Commission will return in two years with an indication as to how we should give this substance."
"Finally, I am pleased that any reference to passenger transport has been removed from this report."
"It is simply a bridge too far to make agreements at European level at this stage."
"That is why there is such a huge volume of passenger transport, in other words cars, and that in highly important Member States, this volume problem – car traffic to them often means local traffic – and also local charges can be tackled."
"However, it is, above all, important to ensure that an alternative is in place."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are standing at an historical turning point."
"With the agreement between Parliament and the Council in the Sommer report on toll systems, the comprehensive toll has for the first time been made administratively and technically possible."
"An agreement tomorrow on the railway package will also make possible an improvement through better harmonisation of European railways."
"The only thing that is not yet present is the political will for fairness, for fair competition between road and rail."
"Here, we have extreme differences in the working conditions."
"It is a scandal that the Irish Government has not even put the Markov report on the agenda."
"This is a matter of life and death, not just the ordinary rest and driving times on the road."
"Secondly, the ‘polluter pays’ principle must also be complied with;"
"Mr Jarzembowski, and all the others who keep saying that there are no figures, please note: accidents, EUR 19 billion; noise damage, EUR 11 billion; air pollution, EUR 62 billion; climate change, EUR 35 billion – EUR 134 billion in damage done by goods vehicles in Europe."
"Who pays for this?"
"This loss is paid for by those who sit up there in the public gallery, the European man in the street, and so long as you are not prepared to pass on the costs in full and therefore also to put money in the alternatives, the shameful political fight will continue against justice on the roads of Europe."
"– Mr President, Mrs de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, and Mr Cocilovo, whom I thank for an excellent presentation."
"It is only reasonable that we should have common rules for the financing of roads and charges for heavy goods traffic."
"We cannot go it alone; the Member States cannot go it alone."
"The report says that we are moving towards a fair system of charging, but this morning we have been listening to what is pure demagogy, particularly in the last speech."
"This cannot be measured with political arguments."
"The European consumer will pay the price if transport systems do not function in Europe."
"If the EU does not function as a whole, who will pay the price?"
"Again, it will be the European consumer who earns a thousand euros a month."
"Of course traffic emissions will increase, because it is by far the most effective way of transporting people and goods."
"The road network cannot be beaten."
"The road network is like someone’s veins, while the railway network, with all due respect, is like someone’s skeleton, and unfortunately it has all the signs of osteoporosis."
"We need an efficient, cost-effective way of running a transport system."
"In Finland recently 23 people died in just one crash involving a lorry and a bus."
"It is not at all the lorry that is to blame, but the fact that we are using taxpayers’ money, like in France where SNCF’s losses stand at EUR 27 billion."
"Consider yourselves what that means."
"Your money has been put into a loss-making operation, which can only account for a fraction of transport requirements."
"Finland is one of the richest countries in Europe."
"We still do not even have any motorways, though, and that is why accidents happen."
"We owe it to the European taxpayers that transport in Europe works rationally and efficiently; otherwise the China Syndrome will become an even greater threat."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the Commission and Mr Cocilovo for their excellent, not to say exemplary, cooperation on this report."
"The report is important because it concerns the most fundamental aspect of our economy, at European, national and regional level: that is to say, the efficiency of the transport system."
"It is also very important because it has the potential to contribute to overcoming environmental problems, crowding and noise."
"The Commissioner said that the Council was concerned about competitive disadvantages, and this concern is natural, as in some areas the charges are too high, for instance in northern Scandinavia, where the distance not only to the European market but also within the region and within each country is great."
"A system of user charges such as this must not be instrumental in obstructing transport with the result that the economy and employment are hit."
"The amendment to Article 7 of the report states that it should be possible to set lower charges."
"In my opinion, it is good to have this option and, when it comes to defining this, regional-policy aspects should be included. This is because, as I said, there must be no ensuing obstruction of transport such as to hamper the economy in certain regions of Europe."
"I have gained a hearing for these ideas in the Cocilovo report, and for that I give my warmest thanks."
"Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by saying that my first thought is that I personally am sorry that a European charging mechanism closer to the ambitions set out in the White Paper has not been provided; one that is more universal which would make it possible, in particular, to go so far as to finance the trans-European transport networks from a European source of revenue."
"From this point of view, we are well short of the ambitions which we set out in the White Paper, and it will no doubt take us a long time to reach this objective."
"On the other hand, I congratulate Mr Cocilovo on the excellent work that he has done on the basis of this ‘Eurovignette’ Directive, but the basic limitation of this is that it is not a European charging policy, but a regulatory framework for national charging policies."
"There are, therefore, bound to be differences between countries."
"It is nevertheless essential to support the guidelines adopted by the Cocilovo report in favour of internalisation of external costs, of cross-financing being extended to all corridors and of its extension to all road networks and not only to trans-European networks, which could give rise to transfers or shifting of traffic."
"If this is not the case, we shall vote against."
"Mr President, everything essential has already been said, and I understand the anger expressed by Mr Turmes."
"A radical transformation is needed in the charging structures with a view to internalising social and environmental costs of transport."
"Greenhouse gas emissions are mainly attributable to road transport."
"Although that is a well-known fact, it was still difficult to make others see that this is not about pestering lorries."
"According to some texts, there is a dramatic increase in traffic, and along with this, a dramatic increase in the emission of greenhouse gases."
"This is a tragedy, and it simply has to stop."
"I should briefly like to bring to your attention Amendment No 24 from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"It looks like a new committee is being created."
"I hope that this committee, when it is up and running in a couple of years' time, will duly seek advice from the NGOs in the field of protecting personal privacy and the environment."
"Thank you very much, Mr Dhaene."
"The Commissioner informs me that, in order to fit in with our timetable – because there is a dreadful lack of time before the votes – she waives her intervention, for which we thank her, and conveys to the chair which amendments have been adopted and which have not, and I have communicated this information to the rapporteur, Mr Cocilovo, so that you may have access to it. It will also be published tomorrow in the verbatim report of proceedings of Parliament's debates."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0216/2004) by Mr Markov, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on minimum conditions for the implementation of Directive 2002/15/EC and Council Regulations (EEC) Nos 3820/85 and 3821/85 concerning social legislation relating to road transport activities [COM(2003) 628 – C5-0601/2003 – 2003/0255(COD)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we have before us today forms part of this set of measures and its aim is that the measures related to the road transport sector, such as the one we have just discussed, should improve road safety and increase the frequency and quality of checks on compliance with social legislation in the road transport sector."
"It is a specific response to the numerous requests Parliament has been making, in the interests of greater monitoring and compliance with social legislation in the road transport sector, particularly in relation to rest, since tiredness can become a risk element at any given moment and, therefore, affect safety."
"This is the only angle from which, as Commissioner for Transport, I can take measures in this field."
"The specific legislation set out in the report issued by Parliament at first reading in January 2003 of the legislative proposal on driving and rest periods are a good example of the concern and position of this Parliament on this subject."
"The Commission has taken on many of the recommendations drawn up last year by Parliament, including that concerning the monitoring of provisions on working time, both on the road and at company premises."
"The proposal increases the percentage of checks, which rises from 1% to 3%, on the working days of professional drivers, introduces various measures to improve the quality of the checking activities in the Member States, and also establishes a common approach to the most serious offences."
"Another aim of the proposal is to guarantee that all the inspection services of the Member States are able to apply the same sort of sanctions, including immobilisation, or the restriction, suspension or even withdrawal of the driving licence or the licence of the corresponding undertaking."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this proposal that has been tabled must contribute, without a doubt, to greater observance of the current rules and, therefore, to an improvement of safety on European roads, while promoting and continuing to support the reality of our internal market."
"Consequently, I insist that there be no attempt to convert this proposal into a catalogue of the documents that need to be monitored, that excessive data collection tasks are not imposed on the inspectors, especially on those working on road checks because, quite simply, when we create a regulation that is difficult to apply, we are making a mistake: we must create a regulation that is, in addition to everything else, realistic and applicable."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of the European single market and the deregulation of road transport in the European Union have led to an enormous growth of trade inside the Community and a substantial increase in transport between the Member States."
"With the accession of the new Member States, this development will substantially increase."
"Mr Turmes is right; in the White Paper, the Commission found that compliance with the regulations on working conditions and rest and driving times in goods transport on roads is only patchy."
"In addition, the Commission, in its two-year report on the implementation of Regulation 3820, has recorded a constant increase in the number of infringements."
"Ensuring strict application of the social regulations for road transport is not only a matter of social and competition policy, but is also of decisive significance for the safety of road transport."
"This is shown by the large number of accidents involving buses and lorries that are primarily attributable to failure to comply with these regulations."
"The purpose of the Commission proposal was to implement modernisation of the enforcement measures, qualitative improvements in reviewing and quantitative expansion of the control measures."
"Even in earlier debates, we agreed that a directive or regulation would make sense only if compliance with it could also be monitored."
"Which now are the most important changes that the Commission and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are making relative to the currently applicable regulations?"
"On the positive side, I would like to point out that the proposed Directive is to apply not only to employed but also to independent drivers."
"In addition, through the Directive, a special monitoring of small companies in industrial areas is to be introduced."
"The scope of the control to be carried out in industrial areas has been substantially extended, for example to the weekly driving times, the total driving times during two successive weeks, the weekly rest times and offset times."
"This decisively increases both the social standard and the safety of transport."
"In its proposal, the Commission fails to allow for what Parliament contributed in the first reading on the implementation of the rest and driving times for professional lorry drivers."
"The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, however, agreed to include the proposals of Parliament at the first reading in the proposal made here, in particular the definition of the driver, the range of application of the Directive and the subject of the controls."
"I am very well aware of the difficulties entailed by a delay in the introduction of the digital tachograph."
"Unfortunately, so far there are no binding undertakings from the industry to the effect that the devices will be available in sufficient numbers by the scheduled deadline."
"To that extent, I regard the solution of the committee as acceptable, which is to increase the control not, as originally proposed, to 3% but only to 2%, as was already found in my report on the revision of Regulation 3820, at any rate in connection with the option of a further increase of the controls on the introduction of the digital tachograph."
"I very much regret that a small majority of the committee did not accept the reduction that I proposed in the threshold for classification as a serious breach."
"The fact my fellow MEPs agreed to reduce the permitted excess of the weekly maximum working time from 20% to 10% makes it all the harder for me to understand that in respect of excesses of the maximum driving times, the rest times and cases in which the minimum rest time is not provided they did not follow the percentage reduction."
"There is therefore a legitimate fear that, as a result, drivers and companies will regularly be tempted not to comply with the statutory standards."
"For this reason, we have once again submitted the relevant motions, and I earnestly ask you to give them a majority."
"In conclusion, I would like to highlight our good collaboration with the rapporteur for the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Schroedter, in the context of the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"I would also like to express warm thanks to the Commission staff involved and to the secretariat of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, especially Mr Hauck, for their highly effective and helpful support."
"I also extend thanks to the representatives of the various trade union organisations, employers’ associations, and police authorities responsible for monitoring compliance with the social regulations, for their valuable suggestions for the practical implementation of a directive of this kind."
"– Mr President, the monitor is still giving the wrong information."
"My name is Elisabeth Schroedter, and I am the rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, as already stated, in the context of the procedure of enhanced cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for this important dossier."
"I will take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his constructive collaboration."
"It is all the more disappointing that – as already mentioned – the Committee of the Regions has thrown out the Committee on Social Affairs’ main improvements, which had to do with the tolerance of excesses."
"The committee, that is to say, has proposed that excesses of up to 20% should be tolerated."
"What does that mean in concrete terms?"
"It means quite specifically that the 56-hour driving times that are already permitted per week can be increased by a further 20%, in other words, that a further 11 hours can be added."
"In my opinion, this is physical irresponsibility with regard to the drivers, and, secondly, it puts every road user at enormous risk."
"So I think that this matter will really be improved only if we agree, here in the plenary, to reduce this tolerance."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like first to thank the rapporteur for his work."
"This directive replaces the one dating from 1988."
"It relates to the monitoring of social regulations."
"The adjustment was more than necessary because there has been, in the interim, considerable progress, not only at the level of the regulatory framework as such, but also in the context of the technical facilities for monitoring."
"We can all agree on one thing, namely that social measures essentially have the purpose of improving employment conditions, avoiding distortions of the market and improving safety, and that the directives that we have drafted for this purpose only make sense if they are implemented and monitored."
"In particular, those of us who live on the border between Belgium and Germany, where we see thousands and thousands of lorries passing each day, know that transport is a cross-border affair and calls for solutions at European level."
"Not only the drivers but also the companies expect that in the various countries they will be charged and monitored under the same rules of the game."
"Coming a few days before enlargement, I see this Directive as having particular importance."
"It provides a partial answer to the question whether enlargement, which involves different working conditions in the various countries, will distort the market."
"Initiatives of this kind are intended, in particular, to avoid this."
"On the basic considerations, we all agree."
"I regard minor differences of opinion – which have indeed been mentioned – as matters of detail, because the Group of the European People’s Party is advocating realistic and viable controls."
"This relates to the working days – to which the rapporteur has just referred – and also to the distribution between road and works controls."
"These controls are intended to promote efficiency and should not lead to firms being charged too much."
"The figures that are to be monitored are of course the driving and rest times."
"With regard to working times, we know very well that, unfortunately, the interpretation is so different from one Member State to another that in some cases it is relatively hard to monitor this correctly in each country."
"The sanctions as such were also part of a debate as to what should be regarded as serious and what not."
"However, it is clear that exchange between countries must take place, that the auditors must apply the same type of monitoring and that their equipment must be compatible."
"Finally, I would like to say that I see this directive as raising the quite fundamental question of whether all these details, which we are discussing here, are necessary?"
"Would these details be necessary if the Member States were actually to put into practice their conviction that directives only work if they are monitored?"
"Almost all Member States take safety, improvement of working conditions and the removal of unfair competition as their watchwords."
"Why do not all Member States monitor in the same way and why do they not all give the monitoring authorities the same technical facilities that they need?"
"If they were to do so, there would be no great need for details, and then part of this directive would perhaps also be superfluous."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the problem which needs to be addressed is the violation of existing provisions relating to working conditions in the field of freight transport and our objective, of course, is to stamp out and drastically reduce these violations."
"We all recognised in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism that the European Commission's proposal was generally positive, but that there was room for improvement."
"Our rapporteur handled the subject extremely well, demonstrating how close he is to transport workers."
"He knows and understands their problems which, in this case, relate directly to road safety and concern us all."
"The combination of this awareness and a sense of moderation mean that the proposed measures have been addressed realistically and without overreacting."
"In our opinion, the volume of controls required needs to stand in logical proportion to the volume of results anticipated."
"Our committee took precisely this approach to the proposed amendments."
"We also took account of the need for maximum possible harmonisation between social provisions in the field of road transport in the Member States, the opportunities offered by modern technology in connection with the subject of controls, the statistics available to us, the views already expressed by the European Parliament about better application of current social provisions and the views of the social partners."
"Of course, we must remember that we still expect the Council to submit a common position on the regulation harmonising social provisions in the field of road transport."
"Congratulations once again to both the European Commission and Mrs de Palacio and our rapporteur Mr Markov."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I would like to thank the rapporteur for his unwavering work."
"The proposal has the important aim of improving road safety, and there must be an effective system of checks to act as a sufficient deterrent against failure to implement the legal provisions strictly."
"What is important is that there should be equal compliance with the provisions everywhere in the EU, in order that competition should not be distorted."
"The checks, however, should not be made too onerous for the transport sector."
"It is also important here to take the position of drivers and consignors into account."
"Moreover, as the resources for monitoring are few it is most important to allocate them where most results can be achieved."
"That is why our group is not in favour of all the details that have been decided in Brussels concerning how the checks should be organised: it is better to leave the power of implementation to the authorities in the Member States."
"For example, we do not see any need to specify that at least 50% of checks should be on small enterprises in particular."
"There will be even greater differences among us with enlargement, and we have to allow for differences in circumstances."
"We are thus in favour of safety and efficiency, but at the same time of taking the position of transport companies and drivers into account when it comes to practical matters."
"Mr President, we shall vote for this document, which is aimed at implementation, that is a degree of control, of social legislation relating to road transport, provided however that amendments do not completely change the nature of its content."
"After all, we are in favour of implementation of the few rare measures of social legislation decided on by Parliament."
"Inadequate social legislation is better than the completely discretionary power of the road haulage employers."
"The fact remains that the social legislation is inadequate, and scandalously so."
"It is content to fix the ceiling for driving time at 56 hours a week, with a maximum of 90 hours over two weeks."
"The fact that even a driving time of 56 hours is regarded as an improvement for a number of lorry drivers demonstrates the greed of employers in this sector, who not only exploit their employees disgracefully but who, moreover, expose everyone to risks."
"How can we be surprised at the frequency of road accidents after a week of more than 50 hours?"
"This shows that I am of course opposed to all the amendments directly inspired by the employers’ lobby, which are aimed at watering down the controls ensuring compliance with this already intolerable working time."
"I am speaking on behalf of the road haulage unions, which are demanding that working time should be fixed at 45 hours at European Union level."
"I should add that, over and above this claim, which is in fact modest, it is unacceptable that the concern is not to reduce the working time and efforts of the men, but only to ensure profitability, that is basically to ensure the profits of the road haulage employers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, even though children are taught rules, they still try to break them, in which case more serious measures are needed to correct their behaviour."
"The same applies to adults."
"Something pushes them to the edge of what is allowed, and often a corrective measure is needed to keep them on the straight and narrow."
"In road transport, what one party gains by infringing the law can force another party to do the same in order to remain competitive."
"I am convinced that we can drive back these situations by effective controls on legislation, so that infringements do not pay."
"In his report, Mr Markov has made sound proposals in order to tighten up these controls."
"However, it also contains less meaningful remarks, and some aspects are missing."
"The positive points concern the paragraphs about the equal interpretation and application of existing rules and striving towards the non-discrimination of drivers to be checked."
"The inclusion of the driver's licence in the controls is a useful addition."
"In our view, however, the remarks about what we refer to as 'serious' infringements in their current form overshoot the mark."
"Due to the restricted margin of error, everyday traffic situations can result in infringements on the part of both drivers and undertakings, while there is definitely no intention involved."
"Only repeated infringements should be regarded as serious."
"The fact that the working hours directive has been included in the scope of controls is another example of the report overshooting the mark."
"At the moment, national freedoms make it difficult to regulate clear enforcement, which leads to much ambiguity and frustration."
"It would be wise to agree on an equal interpretation of the provisions first before including them."
"One crucial failing, at present, is in the position of the inspectors."
"In not all Member States have they been given the powers that are needed to be able to perform their duties satisfactorily."
"That will need to change."
"Despite these reservations, I should like to thank Mr Markov for the sound report."
"I hope Members will be willing to reconsider my observations."
"The Commissioner, following the precedent of the previous report, waives her intervention in order to save time, and conveys to us which amendments that she can or cannot adopt, which has been referred to the rapporteur."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0249/2004), on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on minimum safety requirements for tunnels in the Trans-European Road Network [5238/1/2004 – C5-0118/2004 – 2002/0309(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Rack)."
". – Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1999 and 2001, in the Mont Blanc tunnel, in the Tauern tunnel and in the Gotthard tunnel, we had three major fire disasters."
"Those events made it abundantly clear to us at the time that, on the main stretches of the trans-European network and in particular in its tunnels, we had something of a safety deficit."
"On that occasion, Parliament wasted no time in asking the Commission to carry out the appropriate investigations of this and then to submit a text that would, by becoming European law, enable us to ensure that we could achieve greater safety for the users of the roads of Europe – especially in tunnels."
"The Commission has taken up the subject in a way which deserves our gratitude, and in the last two and a half years it has in particular been able, in a consistently difficult process of dialogue with Parliament on the one hand and the Council on the other, to make its contribution to ensuring that in record time we have produced a very good joint text, which we can now agree at second reading and thus even before the end of the present parliamentary term."
"We can then expect, as soon as possible, on the roads of Europe and in the tunnels of Europe, a higher, better degree of safety than prevailed in the past."
"Of the many points that it has been possible to include in this directive or statutory text, I would like to mention one subject in particular, which above all Parliament, but not Parliament alone, regarded as of particular interest, namely the fact that we are also considering, quite specifically, the interests of the disabled."
"Last year, we had the European Year of People with Disabilities."
"At the time, we rightly stressed that it was not sufficient to have a year in which we frequently used the word ‘disabled’ and then did nothing about it."
"We also had quite specifically to seek to take the subject of tunnel safety seriously in this context."
"I was also particularly delighted, as rapporteur for this proposal, by the fact that we have also been able to include in the meetings and negotiations for this admittedly far from simple text two countries that are not original Member States of the European Union – I mean unfortunately not original Member States of the European Union – but who are of course also of very particular importance for questions of safety on the European road network."
"One is Switzerland, and the other is Norway."
"Both these countries, especially at the level of the Council, but also in meetings with Parliament’s rapporteur, have been involved to a large extent in the discussions, and we can expect that as a result in these countries also a uniform tunnel safety standard at the general European level can be expected."
"Similarly – and this is the last point that I would like to stress – we can assume that, in the future Member States of the European Union, which will be full members of the EU as from 1 May 2004, with this statutory text, which is for some of the new members part of the that they have yet to take on board, we have created a European basis for ensuring that these parts of the overall European road network are also rapidly offered the degree of safety which must be guaranteed by road builders, road maintainers and road monitors, as we rightly believe."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank warmly all those who have actively collaborated in the creation of this piece of legislation, especially the Commissioner, who has been decisively committed to the subject, but above all also the Commission as a whole with its staff and both the Council and its staff and also Parliament and our groups here in this House and their staff."
"They all worked on this text and contributed to the result, which is that, in all probability in a few minutes’ time, we will be able to give almost unanimous assent to this text, and I believe – and we will also rightly be saying this in the next few weeks to the population of Europe – that the work has been worthwhile in the interests of safety for the users of Europe’s roads."
"Mr Rack himself pointed this out in the course of his presentation at second reading. In particular, we are focusing on an aspect that came to the forefront following the terrible accidents in the Alps in 1999 and 2001."
"I would remind the House that yet another fatal accident took place last week. It happened in the Baregg tunnel in Switzerland."
"They are perceived as one of the most dangerous incidents possible, and must be dealt with. In 2002 the Commission forwarded a proposal for a directive laying down a series of minimum safety requirements for tunnels."
"This proposal aimed to prevent accidents of type mentioned, or at least to minimise their consequences. Parliament had previously adopted a number of resolutions on the subject, and it also supported this draft directive."
"I should mention that the Council responded very positively. In addition, I have to say that these proposals are in line with the initiatives regarding the transport sector put forward for the European regional area within the framework of the United Nations."
"The same is true of the Council. I should emphasise that it is thanks to support from both quarters that full agreement has at last been reached by all three institutions, after discussions lasting 15 months."
"Consequently, this text will soon see the light of day. Parliament is to vote on it tomorrow."
"Parliament has undertaken a thorough study of the Commission’s proposal. It tabled 78 very detailed amendments at first reading."
"This demonstrates Parliament’s noteworthy dedication and depth of knowledge. Most of the amendments have been incorporated into the revised proposal presented by the Commission."
"I am grateful to Mr Rack and to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for studying this very technical text in such depth. They are to be commended also for their efficiency throughout and for maintaining such a constructive approach."
"The engineers responsible for safety in tunnels in the Member States have a great deal of work to do to implement the agreement in all tunnels across the Union. Of course, the Member States also need to make an effort to improve safety in tunnels, which are such vulnerable points of the road network."
"I should like to take this opportunity of thanking Mr Rack once again. I would also like to thank Mr Markov."
"I have not yet replied to him, but I would like to congratulate him on the work done regarding driving time, safety and controls. Good controls are essential."
"Otherwise, the limits will not be observed. Any number of statements can be made, but they will never be implemented unless the controls are in place."
"The honourable Member will be aware of the effort we made regarding digital tachometers."
"We shall be writing to him in the near future to inform him of the decisions taken. As a result of these decisions some countries will begin to fit this type of tachometers in July of this year."
"In general, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take the opportunity provided by this debate to thank all members of the Committee on Transport. I am most grateful for the outstanding cooperation we have developed over these years."
"They concern safer and more competitive transport, taking account of the environment promoting sustainable development and making the internal market a reality. Transport is playing its part to promote growth and the well being of the citizens of Europe."
"I would like to recall briefly the adoption of the first rail package. A debate on the second package is due to take place tomorrow."
"The second package will allow a truly European railway to be developed at last. I could remind the House also of the adoption and implementation of the single European sky."
"In addition, the Galileo project was conceived, undertaken and finally launched. As a result, Europe is now at the cutting edge of technology and able to compete at all levels with other leaders in this most technologically advanced area of the space sector."
"Nonetheless, others are also worthy of mention, such as support for passengers’ rights. In the air, maritime, and rail transport sectors measures have been developed to improve both safety and security."
"Operational agencies have been created to protect all forms of transport. Social legislation has been taken forward."
"I could also refer to the adoption of a wide range of other proposals, not to mention international agreements concerning the maritime and air sectors for example. An effort has been made to foster cooperation with all our neighbours both in the Mediterranean area and throughout Europe and Asia."
"Mr President, despite the movement and noise around the House, I would not like to miss this opportunity of expressing my thanks for all the work done jointly. I believe we can be reasonably pleased with ourselves."
"I certainly agree it is very noisy at present. The day may come when European noise regulations have to be implemented in the Chamber, as the noise level rises considerably on these occasions."
"I give the floor to Mr Lisi, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio is quite right to express her satisfaction with the work that was carried out on a very sensitive road safety issue."
"As a group, we must congratulate Mr Rack, who carried out a very difficult task."
"Let us not forget that the text that will emerge from this House today is a text that strongly reflects the contribution made by the European Parliament and its amendments."
"The first Commission version, as Commissioner de Palacio said, was somewhat too regulatory and prescriptive and it would have been difficult to enforce."
"I feel that we should be delighted to stress, on the one hand, the excellent work by the rapporteur and, on the other hand, this good example of Community legislation."
"When they want to, the three institutions are capable of working together and working well."
"I feel that this is an extremely important message, for our European citizens too, since the issue of road safety, as the Commissioner recalled, is something that we have long been concerned with in this parliamentary term."
"I am disappointed, Commissioner, that we did not succeed in finishing off the proposal on driving licences but unfortunately there was not enough time for us to do so."
"I am also disappointed that in the next parliamentary term we will not, I am sorry to say, have your tenacity and constancy to wrap up the issues that remain open."
"Nonetheless, I am convinced that you will, in any case, contribute in other roles."
"That being said, we still have to take a further step on this issue."
"A large part of the costs of this provision will fall on some countries of the Union in particular – at least 50% of these tunnels are in my country – and I believe that it would be useful, in the next parliamentary term, to find means to financially support this endeavour, which should not be left solely to individual Member States but must involve all the European institutions."
"Mr President, I will be very brief;"
"I believe that Mr Rack’s work deserves our approval."
"He has done an excellent job, and has, in particular, been able to strike a balance between the costs connected with safety measures and the major safety measures which must be taken in tunnels in the next few years."
"I would also like to make a brief personal comment to the Vice-President and discuss her personal contribution."
"Madam Vice-President, for many years there has been an often very hard, but also very fair cooperation and debate."
"You have indeed not always made it easy for everyone."
"While not exactly being a person who radiates meekness and readiness for compromise from the word go, you are a person with whom it is worthwhile to argue and find a compromise."
"In that sense, I would like to say that I agree with you entirely: in the last few years in the area of transport policy we have taken a very large number of important decisions, in which you and your staff have played a very important part, and for that you have my warm thanks."
"I assume that you will remain in the Commission and continue to be politically active, and perhaps we will have a little bit of time to argue with each other."
"In any event, it is a pleasure to argue with you, when we are dealing with the real issue."
"Thank you for your collaboration."
"The Presidencycertainly supports the views expressed by Mr Swoboda. I feel sure he speaks for a majority if not all of the Commission and Parliament too."
"Thanks are due to Mr Swoboda for his work today and over these last years."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Pursuant to Rule 34 of the Rules of Procedure, I have received a motion of censure on the Commission, signed by 65 Members, concerning the Commission's role in the Eurostat affair."
"This motion meets the basic requirements of Rule 34 and so will be forwarded to the Commission."
"I propose that the debate on this motion of censure be scheduled for tomorrow, 21 April at 9 p.m."
"Rule 34 stipulates that the vote on the motion cannot take place until at least 48 hours after the start of the debate."
"This means that the vote will be taken during the May part-session, at a time to be indicated on the agenda for that part-session, in agreement with the Groups, when we prepare the details of that part-session."
"I do want to have an extended debate on this, but I see that some colleagues wish to speak.(1)"
"Mr President, further to the statement you have just made, I must point out that if I am not mistaken there are three issues arising under the same item in the order of business. Firstly, there is Mrs Stauner’s report."
"Next there is the decision, proposed by the Group of the European People’s Party; to request a Commission statement on the Eurostat case, with a resolution. Lastly, there is a proposal for a motion of censure tabled by part of the PPE."
"I am not sure if the whole PPE Group supports this proposal. It would be appropriate to check."
"There are therefore three issues relating to the same item in the order of business."
"In the interests of rationalising Parliament’s workload, it would be best to discuss these issues jointly or to delete the Eurostat case."
"I should like to raise another very important matter too, Mr President."
"Pursuant to Rule 34 of the Rules of Procedure, I would ask you to state which Treaties are applicable to consideration of a motion of censure. Currently we are working in a Parliament composed of Members representing fifteen Member States."
"When Parliament votes on 3 May, however, it will be composed of Members from twenty-five Member States and the enlarged Commission will be in place."
"I believe this is an important constitutional matter."
"I am not thinking only of the new Commissioners, who will be welcomed with a motion of censure. I feel strongly that it is important to deal with this matter before moving on to consider the motion of censure and vote on it."
"I should like to make two observations."
"Firstly, I am applying the Rules of Procedure regarding the motion of censure."
"There is a motion which is stated in valid terms and where the requisite number of signatories have been verified."
"The Rules are quite clear on this matter."
"That is why I bring it forward to the House."
"With regard to the question of the May voting session and the issues of who is entitled to vote and under which Rules, we will deal with that – once we have taken advice on it – at a forthcoming meeting of the Conference of Presidents."
"I invite the Groups to participate in this meeting."
"However, at the moment the Rule is quite clear as to the procedure with regard to the motion itself."
"The motion is a valid one and must be brought to the House at the earliest moment."
"This is that moment."
"We cannot add the question of censure itself to another debate."
"Under the Rules the issue must have its own integrity at whatever time we choose to discuss it."
"Mr President, I am very surprised about the statement by Mr Barón Crespo, for whom I otherwise have the highest regard, in which he mentions our group in the same breath as the no-confidence motion against the Commission."
"I would like here to state that I am severely critical of the fact that Commission President Romano Prodi is obviously too involved in Italian domestic politics to bother with his tasks as President of the Commission."
"This is still no reason, however, for us now to consider a vote of no confidence, precisely because we have such excellent members of the Commission as the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, who is here today."
"So our group has absolutely nothing to do with the no-confidence motion, Mr Barón Crespo."
"I really ask that you forget about the elections for a bit"
"and not look for arguments that are simply not there."
"That is the first point."
"Secondly, Mr Barón Crespo – and I would like once again to express my high regard for him – has said that we should not deliberate or vote on Eurostat and a dismissal."
"The Parliament decided to do so yesterday."
"Mr Barón Crespo, we jointly have that right, that is the basis of our work, of the European Union, and for that reason I recommend that we proceed in the way that we decided to yesterday."
"Mr President, I should like to thank those who have resisted very powerful pressure and allowed their names to appear on this list."
"It is not, however, certain, of course, that anything will be put to the vote at all during the May part-session."
"The whole point of the motion of censure is to get the Commission itself to attribute responsibility to one of the Commissioners for a scandal for which there must be political accountability."
"The aim is nothing more and nothing less than that, so if, between now and May, the Commission itself can attribute responsibility, there will be nothing to vote on in May."
"If, however, it cannot attribute responsibility, there are no methods available to us other than that described in the Treaty, and the motion of censure must therefore be voted on."
"We are very annoyed that this vote must take place in May. We had arranged everything so that we could avoid having it mixed up with the solemn celebration of the accession of the new Member States, but your services have not been helpful in verifying the signatures, which have, for all that, been available since yesterday."
"We could therefore have had the vote held this week too, if the services had been willing."
"Now, it will be in May, and that is something we must live with."
"I call upon the Commission to attribute the political responsibility itself and so get this matter out of the way."
"The earliest moment when this motion could have been announced is now."
"The earliest the debate can take place is 24 hours after it has been announced."
"The earliest valid time to vote, according to the Rules of Procedure, is 48 hours after the start of the debate."
"We will not be in Strasbourg 48 hours after the debate, so those who have tabled the motion can contemplate whatever they will after the debate and we can discuss that outcome at the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I have been informed that you have deleted two names from the request for the motion of censure."
"They are the names of two Members from my Group – Mr Mussa and Mr Turchi – who unfortunately are not here today."
"I watched them sign the paper in this Chamber, and would like to know why those signatures have been deleted."
"Mr Camre, firstly, I have asked all those who signed to verify."
"I have no active verification from the two people you named."
"Secondly, notwithstanding their removal from the list at this time, the list is still sufficient to warrant the tabling of a motion of censure."
"May I say to my fellow Member that only Hans Peter Martin, and no one else, can verify signatures."
"That is the one thing, but I seriously wanted ..."
"Seriously, I should first like to say something about the motion of censure."
"Mr Barón Crespo’s question relating to the legal basis is quite apposite."
"A motion of censure must be supported by 10% of Members."
"Does this mean 10% of MEPs today, or 10% of the MEPs after 1 May?"
"Because if it is 10% of Parliament after 1 May, that means a greater number of Members than if it is 10% of Parliament today."
"If the vote is taken on 5 May with the Members of 1 May, voting cannot be allowed on the basis of a figure of 10% of the MEPs today."
"That is illogical and legally untenable."
"It has, therefore, got to be one thing or the other; either the vote is taken with Parliament as it is today – although you have rightly said that this is not possible – or Mr Bonde must be told that, for his vote of censure to be valid, he must get together 10% of the Members of this House as it is constituted on 5 May and not today’s Parliament."
"That is the first thing."
"I am sorry, Mr Bonde, but I am censuring you, who wish to censure everyone, for your lack of knowledge of the Treaties."
"Secondly, Mr Bonde – and in saying this I am also addressing the members of my group who have signed this motion of censure – I consider it the responsibility of this Parliament not to appear completely foolish by having us believe that a motion of censure tabled at the end of a legislative period is a political act."
"It is a hypocritical act in the face of electors who are completely baffled by it."
"I am, therefore, appealing publicly to the sense of responsibility of the members of my group and asking them to withdraw their signatures from a completely foolish political document."
"Very good!"
"We can bring the spirit of '68 to the debate at 9 p.m. tomorrow!"
"The next item is the vote."
"We have 37 reports and 1 252 amendments to vote on today."
"This combination of reports and amendments is the largest single voting session we have had in the last five years, so I will need your fullest cooperation."
"Mr President, I am entitled to two minutes’ speaking time, and I wanted to take advantage of this, because we Germans are so keen to talk about electronic toll systems."
"Mr President, election period or not, we are proceeding with the second reading on the interoperability of toll-collection systems in the European Union, and this is truly a subject that Germans like to address. Toll-collection technology has, of course, been on our agenda in Germany for several months."
"That is not my main point, though."
"By and large, the Council has now adopted our amendments from the first reading."
"This represents a good bit of work on our part in the European Parliament, because we made major changes to the Commission draft."
"We firmly believe that it is not a matter for the legislature to prescribe the use of one particular toll system in a binding legal instrument."
"It will now remain possible to use satellite positioning and mobile telephony as well as 5.8 GHz microwave communication for the collection of tolls in the European Union."
"The only thing it is important to prescribe is that these technological solutions must be interoperable, in other words that a vehicle must be able to operate throughout Europe with a single on-board unit – one device per vehicle and one contract per customer."
"And that is precisely what we shall achieve now through the establishment of a European electronic toll service."
"We have called this ‘contractual interoperability’."
"This was the specification laid down by the present draft directive, and the draft now fully meets that specification."
"The market – the forces of free competition – will now determine which system becomes the electronic toll technology of the future."
"At the same time, however, we wish to make it crystal-clear that, in view of the vast array of potential additional uses of satellite positioning and mobile communications, their adoption is to be recommended in principle – provided that the strictest of measures are put in place to protect personal data."
"The innovative European project Galileo will provide the information services for this purpose from 2008."
"In short, the common position as it now stands constitutes an absolutely excellent outcome."
"I should like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to everyone – to the Council, the Commission and especially the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups – for their extremely cooperative approach in this matter."
". Mr President, just a brief word, because we are already running very late, to mention that Eurocontrol is the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation and that the effect of this report is to approve the ratification by the Community of the Protocol on accession to the revised Eurocontrol convention."
"This ratification will enable the Community to contribute to policy making and to strengthen the synergies between the two organisations."
"It will also strengthen Eurocontrol’s ability to launch development programmes and to implement new air traffic control technologies that will ensure the creation of the Single European Sky."
"The entire air sector should benefit from this."
"Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the enlargement of the European Union now imminent, I would like to stress how valuable membership of Eurocontrol by the accession countries that have not yet joined it will be for everybody in improving air safety."
"I hope that these new Member States will rapidly integrate the process of the Single European Sky so as to allow the airspace to be properly managed over the entire territory of the unified Union."
"That is why we must encourage the countries that will be joining the European Union on 1 May and that are not yet members of Eurocontrol to take the steps necessary for accession as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the general plan adopted by the Council in 2002 on the suppression of illegal immigration and human trafficking in the European Union provided for the introduction of a new early-warning system, which is now to be further developed into a secure web-based Intranet site."
"The Commission’s proposal is good."
"That needs to be emphasised too."
"We were able to work very well with it in committee, and we regard it as a decisive step towards improved coordination and communication between Member States, which is the key to successful cross-border efforts to combat illegal immigration."
"Exchanges of information, of course, can only become an everyday reality if the Member States can be sure that the information they provide will be sufficiently protected."
"The CIRCA system proposed by the Commission is a commendable step in this direction."
"It meets the required security standard."
"In particular, it permits selective access to the information within the system."
"I wish to thank my honourable colleagues from the various parliamentary groups for their broad approval of this report, and I am pleased that we shall manage to complete this process before the end of the current parliamentary term."
"Mr President, the safety of our citizens is a priority for all of us."
"We are aware of the importance of external border controls and the need to strengthen them, also as a result of freedom of movement and the abolition of controls at internal borders."
"We are living in times in which the growing threat of cross-border organised crime, illegal immigration and above all terrorism have moved to the top of our political agenda and have become the focal point of the public's concerns."
"This represents a threat to our democracies, a threat we need to combat by strengthening our own democratic systems and instruments here in Europe."
"Mr President, all this means that we need a system for rapidly and efficiently exchanging information for border controls, including the area of political cooperation."
"For this reason, it is vitally important either to develop a second generation SIS – Schengen Information System II or SIS II – or to create a visa information system, not forgetting the issue of introducing biometrical data."
"We need, however, to do this within a framework of clear rules that ensure that the system is effective, economical, and scrupulously respects Community rules on personal data protection."
"The proposal before us and a second proposal announced by the Commission – for the purpose of defining the system and the way in which it is to operate – are complementary and must be dealt with jointly."
"If something is to be financed, both the legislative authority and the budget authority need to know exactly what."
"Having said that, I call on the plenary, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, to reject the Commission initiative, which is little more than an empty vessel."
"I hope that at the start of the next parliamentary term the Commission will submit a detailed, exhaustive and soundly based proposal, unlike the one before us today."
"Mr President, given that we are at the end of the parliamentary term, I would like my draft legislative resolution to be put to the vote also."
"On behalf of the committee, the rapporteur recommends rejection."
"Does the Commission agree to withdraw the proposal?"
". Mr President, the rejection of the proposal concerning the first phase of the establishment of the visa information system is a matter of great regret to the Commission."
"It means delaying the creation of the final system that will have to be in place before the end of this year."
"Pursuant to the framework agreement, Mr Vitorino will inform the College of Commissioners of this result. He will also provide ongoing information on follow up to this matter."
"In that case the matter is automatically referred back to committee under Rule 68(3) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I would like to refer to what happened with the Schmidt report during the previous sitting: it does not make any sense at all to refer the report back to the committee."
"We do not have two months, because we are at the end of the parliamentary term, and I call on this House to vote on my report, which includes a legislative resolution from this Parliament and rejects the Commission's initiative."
"No, we shall not vote on the legislative resolution."
"I am quite satisfied that I am following the Rules of Procedure as they should be applied."
"If you wish to take it up with me later I will be happy to explain why."
". Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs recommends the appointment of Mr José Manuel Gonzáles-Páramo as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank."
"We have no doubts about his personal integrity and professional competence."
"In this context, however, we should like to point out that it would be a good thing if the European Central Bank were to sit down with this Parliament in future and reflect on the future role of the system of central banks."
"This is truly a vital requirement, not least with regard to the future selection of candidates."
"We also believe there is a need to examine whether it would not be appropriate to introduce a procedure whereby we ratify future appointments rather than merely deliver a consultative opinion."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just come to an understanding on a few more points with a view to making the voting procedure easier for you."
"By agreement with my honourable colleagues, I should therefore like to propose that, beginning with the Committee’s Amendment No 10, we consolidate the votes into four blocks."
"I have already indicated to the Bureau how these blocks can be arranged so that we can deal with the whole proposal fairly quickly, and I should like to ask your permission, Mr President, to present a brief oral proposal for a compromise before the vote on Article 3(2)(a) and before the vote on Article 16."
"Mr President, as this matter was agreed just prior to the vote I want to be quite clear about the separate vote, because the complete voting list was only available this morning."
"We would like to check that there is to be a separate vote on Amendments Nos 38 and 39 as a block and on Amendments Nos 80, 102, 122, 127 and 128."
"If that is what the rapporteur has given you, then I am happy to go along with that division."
"Mrs McCarthy, I understand that Amendments Nos 38, 39 and 102 have been withdrawn."
"On the other amendments mentioned, it seems that the rapporteur agrees with you."
". Mr President, we are dealing here with the applicability of the Directive to agreements relating to small amounts of credit or those covering particularly large amounts."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled an amendment proposing that the coverage threshold for microcredits be drawn at EUR 500."
"I should like to combine this amendment with Amendment No 175, tabled by the Group of the European Socialists with a view to setting an upper limit of EUR 100 000."
"That would be a sensible joint solution."
"If it secures a large majority, there is a good chance that it will serve as the basis for further deliberations within the Council."
"Are there any objections to the oral amendment?"
"Mr President, I object on the basis that we reserve the right to vote on an amendment that allows us to have no lower threshold."
"This combination means that there would be a minimum threshold of 500 combining with a Socialist upper threshold."
"We do not want a lower threshold, so we cannot accept this compromise."
"Mr President, Amendment No 206 is not rendered redundant by the adoption of the previous amendment."
"Therefore, we need to vote on Amendment No 206."
"I shall ask the rapporteur for advice on this."
"After the adoption of Amendment No 64 I was advised that Amendment No 206 would fall."
"Rapporteur, what is your opinion?"
". Mr President, the Commission proposed a ban on doorstep negotiation of credit agreements."
"The committee called for this ban to be completely scrapped."
"We approved that motion."
"So there is no longer any scope for a reduced ban as proposed in Amendment No 206."
"It is therefore correct that Amendment No 206 should fall."
"Mr President, the Group has not tabled an amendment to ban doorstep selling, but rather to make it subject to conditions in terms of unsolicited negotiation of credit or doorstep selling."
"As it is not a ban, we should be able to vote on it."
". Ladies and gentlemen, a majority of you have come out against the inclusion of any rule on doorstep selling, and with good reason too."
"The fact is that a separate directive covers these matters, and in the wake of this vote there is no more scope for the inclusion in the present directive of other rules on the same subject."
"I still say that the amendment should fall."
"I will follow the advice of the rapporteur."
"I will come back to Mrs McCarthy and her colleagues with an explanation later."
"I waive my right to move an oral amendment."
"Anyone from Ireland will know that an accumulator is a bet on a horse race!"
"President. – That concludes the vote."
"The Commission is proposing a revision of the European Investment Bank's external lending mandate, under which loans are guaranteed from the EU budget, so as to take account of the new Neighbourhood Policy against the background of the enlarged European Union, as part of its proposals for the 2007-2013 policy and financial framework."
"If the overall ceiling for credits opened, equivalent to EUR 20 260, is taken into account, it will soon be seen that the report accompanying this legislative proposal does little to further the geopolitical considerations and objectives which it is supposed to be inspired by, and in particular the creation of a pan-European-Mediterranean free trade area, in which the European Union has great political, economic and military influence at regional level."
"The Neighbourhood Policy gives particular priority to Russia, for which the rapporteur proposes an increase of EUR 500 million in the provisional allocation, and to the Mediterranean shore countries."
"These loans would obviously serve the European Union's policy of regional influence, interest and interference – an objective that we reject."
"But more worrying still is the fact that this Neighbourhood Policy appears to be to the detriment of the European Union's cooperation and development policy, especially in relation to the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) countries, Latin America and Asia."
"The proposal before us deals with the revision, up to the end of the remaining period of the mandate, of the Community budget guarantee to the European Investment Bank for the loans the EIB grants to third countries on the basis of its own resources."
"The enlargement of the Union on 1 May 2004 will result in an increase in the EIB's lending capacity without raising the ceiling on its external lending mandate, which will be particularly favourable at a time when the European Union is stepping up its cooperation with potential candidate countries in the Western Balkans and is preparing to gradually strengthen its links with other neighbours to the south and east."
"According to the EIB's Corporate Operational Plan or COP, the forecast utilisation rate for the various regional packages during the remaining period of the mandate points to a total guaranteed loan volume in excess of the total amount fixed."
"On the basis of these projections, the Commission is proposing a new geographical distribution of the current mandate, while maintaining the current overall limit of EUR 19 460 million."
"Given the need for the Union to strengthen its links with its closest neighbours, I voted in favour."
"The report before us comes in the wake of the large number of amendments approved by the European Parliament at first reading, almost all of which were subsequently accepted by the Council."
"The common position demonstrates that the solution suggested by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is that best suited to achieving the key objective of interoperability between the various electronic road toll systems in operation in some Member States."
"Microwave technology for electronic road tolls is the most affordable, is based on the application of existing technology already successfully used in telephony, provides the ideal solution for the objective proposed in the directive, and genuinely makes the life of certain motorway users easier."
"It should, however, be stressed that the committee is not ruling out a study at a later stage, for 2008, on the applicability of satellite technology, but everything will depend on technological progress in the market and on the specific needs of other types of road traffic control."
"Given that the report before us does not amend the text of the common position, which ensures compatibility of the various systems operating in the Member States by 2007, I am voting in favour of it."
"The object of the proposal for a regulation before us amending Council Regulation (EEC) 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code is to create a harmonised legal framework with identical customs controls in all the Member States, based on commonly agreed standards and risk criteria for the selection of goods and economic operators in order to fight terrorism, organised crime and trade in dangerous goods."
"With a view to tightening security around goods crossing international borders, traders will be required to provide customs authorities with information on goods being imported into or exported from the European Union."
"This information will be in electronic form and will be exchanged between the authorities of the various Member States."
"Once again, we must reaffirm that the fight against terrorism cannot be allowed to threaten respect for our citizens' rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to privacy, of which the protection of personal data forms a part, as laid down in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The protection of personal data should not be viewed as an obstacle to effectively fighting terrorism, which means that we have certain reservations about the changes proposed to the regulation, in spite of the European Parliament's amendments, which specifically refer to these rights."
"The object of the proposal for a regulation as presented by the Commission is to modify the Community Customs Code, incorporating certain basic principles for managing the security of our external borders and establishing a harmonised risk assessment system."
"The proposal provides for a set of measures aimed at increasing security in the international movement of goods."
"The following measures deserve particular attention: (a) the introduction of a requirement for traders to provide customs authorities with information on goods before they are imported into or exported from the European Union; (b) the establishment of a framework for authorising operators; (c) the creation of a mechanism for agreeing risk criteria at Community level; (d) the establishment of automated support systems for the implementation of risk management."
"The proposal reflects a positive desire for integrated and effective management of our external borders, by seeking to improve the effectiveness of customs procedures and controls, both by simplifying customs legislation and by enhancing the use of electronic systems in customs procedures."
"I wish to stress that those working in the sector support the changes, which will make it possible to strike a satisfactory balance between growth in the checks and formalities needed for security purposes and the need to facilitate legitimate trade."
"I share that view and voted for the report."
"The Council and Parliament recently adopted the regulation on the Single European Sky, one of the provisions of which was Community membership of Eurocontrol."
"In accordance with the accession protocol, as is the case with other international organisations, the Community and the Member States will participate in the work of Eurocontrol, with voting rights allocated according to whether an issue falls within an area of Community competence or that of the Member States."
"The institutional synergy between the Community and Eurocontrol will bring certain benefits in terms of air traffic capacity, safety and efficiency, to be achieved by initiating programmes for developing and implementing new air traffic control technologies."
"Given that the issue here is to establish rules for international cooperation with the ultimate aim of pursuing the objectives already described whilst respecting the competence of the Member States in this field, I voted in favour of the report."
"As the Treaty provides for a common transport policy, the Commission has been presenting a series of proposals for membership of various international conventions, so as to enable it to exercise those competences delegated to it by the Member States."
"This proposal forms part of the ‘Single European Sky’ initiative, which provides for an active Community role as regards Eurocontrol's technical competences."
"The accession protocol stipulates the legal provisions permitting the Community to become a full member of Eurocontrol, establishing joint participation in Eurocontrol by the Community and the Member States on the basis of an allocation of voting rights."
"Voting rights are to be exercised by the Community or by its Member States depending on whether the issue at stake falls within the competence of the Community or of the Member States."
"Nevertheless, the treaties do not, apart from anything else, confer competence on the European Community with regard to issues of defence and national security, which means that the use of airspace for military purposes does not fall within the competence of the European Community, as we advocated during the debate on the Single Sky."
"As ever, attempts are being made to move forward in ways and at a pace with which we cannot agree."
"This proposal relates to the accession of the European Community to the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, Eurocontrol."
"In accordance with Rules 86 and 97 of our Rules of Procedure, Parliament is required to give a favourable opinion on this agreement, as the relevant negotiations were concluded on 8 October 2002 with the signing of the protocol in question."
"In accordance with the accession protocol, as is the case with other international organisations, the Community and the Member States will participate in the work of Eurocontrol with voting rights allocated according to whether an issue falls within an area of Community competence or that of the Member States."
"The Council and Parliament recently adopted the regulation on the Single European Sky, one of the provisions of which was Community membership of Eurocontrol, so that Parliament has already indirectly expressed its views on this matter."
"The relationship between the Community and Eurocontrol may bring certain benefits in terms of air traffic capacity, safety and efficiency, to be achieved by initiating programmes for developing and implementing new air traffic control technologies, and I accordingly voted in favour of the report."
".The transformation of the new borders of the European Union formed by enlargement into a veritable iron curtain will have tragic consequences for the populations living on either side of these borders."
"These borders sometimes divide peoples, and even families, and turning them into the Schengen borders is unacceptable in human terms."
"If Europe demonstrated some genuine brotherly love, it would, on the contrary, make travelling easier."
"This is not the reasoning, however, behind the report’s proposal to relax the rules somewhat as regards local border traffic. Instead it claims that ‘the EU and its neighbours can profit from putting in place mechanisms that allow workers to move from one territory to another where skills are needed most’."
"In other words, closing the borders too tightly would prevent businesses from benefiting from cheap casual labour or from keeping local trade on its feet."
"Hence the proposed regulation, which is nit-picking and bureaucratic."
"To cap it all, the Stockton report, for its part, gives, albeit only temporarily, approximately the same treatment to residents of the border areas between the countries currently in the Union and the new accession countries."
"This goes to show that enlargement, even if it removes all the barriers to the movement of capital, is not removing the barriers to the movement of people."
"We have abstained so as to avoid blocking the slight relaxation for border residents with respect to Schengen, without endorsing inhumane legislation."
"The object of the Commission's proposal is to regulate local border traffic."
"The main objective is to avoid barriers to trade, social and cultural interchange or regional cooperation, with a view to promoting the development of border regions and facilitating border crossing by bona fide border residents, and harmonising the rules applied in order to achieve this."
"Although I wish to congratulate the Commission on its initiative, I must disagree with certain points, points that the rapporteur has also challenged and addressed in her report."
"They are issues connected with what might be called ‘good faith’, and with the lack of effective border control resources, which could give rise to constant abuse."
"Bearing in mind the need to fight illegal immigration, and to prevent criminal activity and even the entry of terrorists, I cannot understand why the Commission is not providing for any controls to ensure compliance with the authorised time limit for a stay."
"We agree with the central concept of making it easier for some residents of third countries to enter the EU, but we wish to press for greater rigour in granting such facilities."
"The points the rapporteur has drawn attention to are extremely pertinent, and given that the amendments in her report will have precisely that effect, I am voting in favour of her report."
"This proposal is one of a group of legislative acts aimed at harmonising rules applying to local border traffic."
"More specifically, it attempts to facilitate the entry of certain border residents from third countries into the EU."
"In particular, it advocates that restrictions relating to ‘transfrontier workers’ should not be lifted, and proposes that a specific visa intended for them should be created."
"The temporary nature of this visa is stressed, as is the fact that it is only aimed at persons living within 50 km of the border."
"The amendments proposed by the rapporteur and her comments are very much to the point. They are comprehensible and justified, and do not undermine the objective of the Commission's proposal."
"I am voting in favour of the report."
"Nevertheless, the Commission's attention should be drawn to the abuses that may occur if proper precautions are not taken, with a view in particular to preventing abuses and weaknesses that could facilitate illegal immigration, criminal activity and even terrorist activity."
"Despite certain concerns expressed in the European Parliament's opinion, this initiative, although it is apparently ‘technical’ and ‘neutral’, in fact has to be seen in the context of the criminalisation of immigration and of support for so-called emergency management and the deportation of immigrants back to their countries of origin."
"The proposal emphasises that ‘as a development of the Early Warning System, the network is primarily designed to facilitate the exchange of strategic and tactical information on irregular or illegal migratory flows and trends’. It is not, for the time being, ‘envisaged to exchange personal data regarding criminal networks involved in smuggling or trafficking of human beings’."
"The rapporteur herself makes the following criticism: ‘The fight against illegal immigration should not only be targeted at persons who have illegally entered the EU, but should, above all, combat facilitators who supply illegal labour networks in Europe’."
"An attempt is being made here to create an improved instrument that will make the coordination and communication ‘vital if irregular migration is to be successfully combated on a cross-border basis’ more effective."
"This is yet another aspect of a policy that ignores the economic and social causes of immigration."
"Faced as we are with the opening of borders within the Schengen area, constant breaches of Community borders and urgent security requirements resulting from the current world geopolitical situation, I consider it vital for means of managing and monitoring migratory flows to be coordinated, and the same applies to the monitoring of and fight against illegal immigration."
"The Commission's technical platform, CIRCA, the Communication and Information Resource Centre Administrator, will provide a virtual workspace for closed user groups and a continuing information exchange, if it can guarantee a high level of security."
"I wish to emphasise the possibility of Europol being included in this network."
"I hope that the users and beneficiaries of this more efficient web-based approach to migration will not forget that the subjects of their investigations are individuals who, regardless of their legal status, have inalienable rights and deserve to be respected."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"The Commission proposal, which has the full backing of the rapporteur, reflects the urgent need for the long-awaited amendment of Directive 77/388/EEC."
"As is well known, services have as a rule been taxed at the place where the supplier is established."
"The Commission now wishes to reverse this situation, so that, with some exceptions, tax will be levied at the place where the customer is established."
"As I understand the position, this change will better reflect the current situation in the service sector, and will provide greater security for all parties involved."
"The measures proposed will also make it possible to eliminate some existing problems that are the result of the far-reaching changes that have taken place since 1977."
"The report does not raise any particular problems and essentially aims to respect the general principle according to which the place of taxation is defined as the place where the services are supplied."
"Furthermore, it is important to bear in mind that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs approved the draft legislative resolution unanimously."
"I voted in favour of the report."
". We have today voted in favour of the report on the conclusion of the Framework Agreement between the European Community and the European Space Agency (ESA) in accordance with the EC/ESA agreement of 2003."
"Previously, we have also given our support to the resolution on the Commission Green Paper on space policy, adopted on 9 October 2003, the resolution on a uniform European space strategy, adopted on 17 January 2002, and also the resolution on an action plan for implementing the European space policy,adopted on 29 January 2004."
"We have also supported efforts to implement the Galileo project."
"It is important that EU competence not be otherwise extended to space policy and that industrial cooperation on space chiefly take place between Member States according to the Convention establishing the European Space Agency."
"The European Union’s involvement in space should cover research in the first instance."
"We reject the increased EU competence that is set to be included in the EU Constitutional Treaty."
"I shared the generally positive attitude of those voting on this framework agreement, the discussion of which ended up revolving around the legal basis. That positive attitude was underpinned by an opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which recalled – and this was very much to the point – that the choice of the legal basis referred to could not be left to the discretion of the Community legislator, but should instead be based on objective criteria and subject to legal control."
"According to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the rapporteur of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the absence of a reference to Article 300(3) of the EC Treaty, stipulating that Parliament should be consulted, could only be the result of an oversight, which should be rectified."
"The rapporteur eventually presented an amendment to this effect, which was quickly replaced by a corresponding correction."
"The willingness of the rapporteur to do this was another factor that encouraged me to vote for the report."
". The security of our citizens is of paramount importance to every one of us."
"We are aware of how important and necessary it is to tighten controls at external borders, as a further consequence of free movement and the scrapping of internal border controls."
"We are living in times in which transnational organised crime, illegal immigration and, particularly, terrorism, stand at the top of the political agenda and at the forefront of the public’s political concerns."
"These problems threaten our democracies, and must be combated by strengthening European democracy and its instruments."
"What is required is the swift and effective sharing of information in the fields of border controls and police cooperation."
"Consequently, the development of the Second Generation of SIS (SIS II) and of a Visa Information System (VIS) and the introduction of biometric data all take on vital importance."
"We must undertake such action within a framework of clear rules that ensure that the system is effective, efficient and in strict compliance with Community rules on protecting personal data."
"This proposal to establish the VIS and to enable the system to be funded outside the Community budget and …"
". Establishing a Visa Information System (VIS) should be seen as part of the Schengen Information System (SIS) and EURODAC, within the framework of communitarising the ‘third pillar’, namely, Justice and Home Affairs, and seeks to remove certain key competences from the Member States."
"It should be noted that, as from 1 May, such a decision no longer requires unanimity in the Council."
"The VIS is proposed as a system for the exchange of Visa data between Member States."
"Whilst we do not share the rapporteur’s position, we do accept his conclusion that this Commission initiative must be rejected, given in particular that it defines neither the system nor its operation ‘including the categories of data to be entered into the system, the purposes for which they are to be entered and the criteria for their entry, the rules concerning the content of VIS records, the rights of access for authorities to enter, update and consult the data and rules on the protection of personal data and its control’."
"Hence our vote against the proposal."
". This report concerns yet another rejection by Parliament – of a Spanish government initiative from April 2003, a measure that forms part of the so-called ‘fight against terrorism’, which seeks to establish an agreement with the USA on the communication of airline passenger data."
"We are strongly opposed to such a move, even though this is a , since various airlines already pass on such information. We therefore welcome the fact that Parliament’s Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has delivered a negative opinion on the matter."
"The initiative seeks to transmit to the USA personal data which, according to the information made available, would cover thirty-four areas, including telephone numbers, credit card details, political opinions, family background, religious beliefs and health. No effective checks or safeguards are provided for, which places citizens’ rights, freedoms and guarantees in jeopardy."
"Currently, individual countries are responsible for ensuring that people are protected as regards the data contained in passenger name records. This proposal seeks to limit a country’s ability to block the transfer of data, in order to guarantee its citizens’ rights."
"Mr President, I think it is important to point out that it was not I alone but all the members of the Austrian People’s Party in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats who ultimately rejected the de Roo report."
"We have difficulties with the nuclear issue in Amendment No 38."
"The wording is simply too vague for our liking, and I am a little surprised that Alexander de Roo does not also recognise that the right to bank credits leaves the door open for credits issued before 2012 in respect of nuclear projects to be used after that date."
"This means that operators could meet their environmental requirements by means of credits from a nuclear project conducted in the period from 2008 to 2012."
"Our support for the total exclusion of nuclear projects is absolutely solid, and this is why we were unable to accept the de Roo report at the end of the day."
". Issues relating to police cooperation and to protecting our citizens are among our most pressing concerns."
"Police cooperation is essential if we are to provide the European public with a higher level of safety within the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Following up the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, the Portuguese presidency tabled an initiative, adopted in December 2000, which set in motion the first stage of the European Police College, as a network of the existing national training institutes of each Member State."
"The College is intended to train senior police officers by developing a European approach to the main problem areas in combating crime, preventing crime and maintaining law and order, in particular the cross-border dimensions of these problems."
"This report on the operation and future of the College notes some difficulties, mainly caused by the lack of legal personality."
"In spite of these difficulties, the College can be deemed to have done excellent work."
"I support these two initiatives, particularly the implementation, at legislative level, of the position adopted by most Member States, including Portugal."
"At this stage, it is preferable to retain the network structure of national institutes, but now with a legal personality, a governing board responsible for organising and running the College, and its own secretariat and seat."
"The Tampere European Council, of 15 and 16 October 1999, decided ‘to set up a European Police College for the training of senior law enforcement officials’. It stated that ‘it should start as a network of existing national training institutes’."
"The aim of this Irish initiative is to confer on the European Police College (CEPOL) the legal personality and authority normally accorded to legal entities."
"The purpose of the United Kingdom’s initiative is to locate the College’s seat in Bramshill, following on from the political agreement at the Council, and to establish a permanent secretariat to assist CEPOL."
"The feasibility study on giving CEPOL a permanent structure was carried out in a three-year report on the operation and future of CEPOL, which stated that the lack of legal personality had led to difficulties in terms of governance, and at financial and organisational level."
"The rapporteur tabled three amendments in order to restore some logic to the proposals, as regards costs borne by the CEPOL budget and the location of the seat of CEPOL."
"There is no need during the current stage to create a European College separately from the national training institutes. Consequently, I support the proposals tabled by Ireland and the United Kingdom, along with the amendments adopted and ..."
". We voted against the recommendation before us, for the following reasons:"
"Firstly, the rotation of nationals from the Member States on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB) has not been guaranteed."
"The ECB was not content with merely being the first Community body to break the representativeness rule by not comprising nationals of every Member State, or with its Statute being altered to ensure that members of this committee have permanent voting rights, unlike those on the governing boards of Central Banks, who exercise their right to vote on a rotation basis."
"In this area too we are seeing the consolidation of a cabinet consisting of the larger members, while smaller countries such as Portugal are excluded from decision-making at the heart of EU monetary policy."
"Secondly, the nominee slavishly toes the line on monetary and budgetary orthodoxy, and on the prevailing trends in the EU’s economic and monetary policy. He also appears blithely indifferent to the economic crisis facing the Community."
"He is committed to the ECB’s key objective of price stability, and feels that the crisis is the result of structural reforms."
"Furthermore, he sees ‘no need for changes in the current form of the Maastricht Treaty or the Stability Pact’, given that, according to him, ‘current problems are not the result of undue rigidities’ in the Pact, but the fact that come countries fail to comply with the commonly agreed rules."
". In the Dutch press, the impression has been created that Mr Doorn, the acting leader of the CDA Party, has found a way of saving the country EUR 10 billion a year."
"While a superficial reading of this will lead one to assume that he will use this sum to reduce EU tax payments, Mr Doorn does not offer a solution to the problem of the EU’s waste of 20% of its budget annually on prestige projects, on pumping money around rich Member States and fraud."
"His only concern is to liberate businesses from what he considers to be stifling bureaucracy."
"Above all, he wants fewer rules that are intended to protect employment and the environment and, consequently, fewer costs for entrepreneurs."
"That is in keeping with the ambition of Mr Zalm, the Dutch Finance Minister, who wants to reduce the administrative burden for businesses from EUR 17 billion to EUR 14 billion annually and reckons that half of this is attributable to European rules."
"According to Mr Zalm's calculation, the sum involved therefore is not EUR 10 billion but only EUR 1.5 billion."
"While I support an expansion of the options to be able to assess the negative impact of European regulations at the earliest possible stage, I do have a feeling that Mr Doorn will be wanting to put a stop to entirely different rules from those I have in mind."
". I congratulate Mr Doorn on his excellent work, and the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on approving this report unanimously."
"Impact assessment, as stated, incidentally, in the institutional agreement on better lawmaking of June 2003, is an essential tool, not only in terms of improving the quality of legislation, but also in terms of reducing the financial and administrative burden incurred in complying with legislation."
"In this regard, studies carried out by the IMF (International Monetary Fund) suggest that improving legislation could result in economic growth of 7% and in a rise in productivity of 3%."
"It is extremely important to monitor the implementation of cost assessment and impact assessment."
"If civil servants are assisted and monitored by an independent audit, and by the institutions themselves, and if an assessment is made of the burden that businesses and individuals incur to comply with legislation, I feel that this would be a vital step towards greater EU development."
"I therefore endorse the report."
"The fight against discrimination suffered by people with disabilities has been stepped up at national and European level, and adopting the European Plan for people with disabilities was an essential step in this regard."
"People with disabilities are still, however, not accorded equal treatment and opportunities in all aspects of life."
"The gains that have been made must be consolidated by means of appropriate political and legislative policies."
"The European Plan must, accordingly, contain a directive against discrimination based on disability, which must be applicable to all policies that fall within the EU’s competences."
"All Member States must transpose all of the applicable legislation in this area and must develop channels for sharing good practice."
"I also endorse the report’s recommendation to improve disabled people’s accessibility to information technologies, to the built environment and to high quality services that encourage such people to be independent."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report, which underlines the importance of improving the situation of the 50 million citizens of the enlarged European Union that are affected."
"."
"I welcome this report, although it falls short in certain areas."
"It regrets the fact that, despite repeated calls by Parliament, the Action Plan does not contain legislative proposals, in particular a directive to combat discrimination based on disabilities, extending to all sectors of European Union competence and designed once and for all to remove all barriers to participation in community life by people with disabilities."
"It also criticises the fact that in the proposals for the Action Plan attention has not been given to the need to offer specific support to disabled persons’ organisations in the new accession countries."
"The report also states that the future Treaty must provide for stronger measures to combat discrimination and to promote respect for human rights, especially of those people with a high degree of dependency and/or unable to represent themselves unaided."
"It advocates a United Nations Convention on the human rights of people with disabilities and calls for the recommendations of the EU expert report on ‘Accessibility for All’ to be implemented, including the revision of Constructive Products Directive, thereby laying down mandatory accessibility standards."
"The report calls on the Commission to place special emphasis on combating violence against women with disabilities, under the Daphne Programme and to introduce measures to remedy …"
"I congratulate Mr Mantovani on his excellent and timely report on the Communication from the Commission on Equal Opportunities for people with disabilities: A European Action Plan."
"I also strongly agree with Mr Mantovani’s call for a timetable for the submission of a directive to combat discrimination based on those areas not covered by Directive 200/78/EC."
". Mr Mantovani’s report addresses the issue of equal opportunities for people with disabilities, which is certainly to be welcomed."
"It is true that we too often forget that, before people are people with disabilities, they are, quite simply, people, who also deserve to have their dignity and their rights respected: the right to freedom of movement, the right to take part in the life of society in general, the right to equality of opportunity and the right to be respected as a person."
"Put simply, the rights accorded to all human beings."
"A dignified society can be recognised by the place it gives to its most vulnerable members."
"Unfortunately, today, in the countries we call developed, people with disabilities are still too frequently the victims of discrimination."
"That is why I support the rapporteur in his request that any policy should be based on universal values accorded to everyone."
"I hope that this report finally makes us pay attention to all people with disabilities and this is why I voted in favour of it."
". This report offers a timely reminder that in the enlarged European Union there are around 50 million people with disabilities of various kinds."
"European strategy must, therefore, focus on combating discrimination and on promoting human rights. The European Year of People with Disabilities 2003 succeeded in raising awareness of disability-related issues."
"I therefore applaud the Commission’s initiative to propose the adoption of a European Action Plan in this area."
"We regret, however, that there are no specific legislative proposals, and nor is there a timetable for the submission of a directive to combat discrimination based on disabilities."
"We must also strive to ensure that disabled people’s organisations play a more active role in the decision-making process at EU, UN and national level."
"I should also like to highlight the Commission’s undertaking to submit a working paper on the implementation of the European employment strategy with respect to disabled persons, and improved accessibility for these individuals to information technologies and the built environment, including access to services."
"We share this point of view entirely and feel that this is an excellent report."
". I should first like to point out that this report is a follow-up to the European Year of People with Disabilities 2003 and related issues."
"It calls for non-discrimination and the promotion of human rights to be the main focus of the European Union’s strategy."
"According to the report, the positive results obtained should be incorporated into the European Union’s policies."
"The report regrets the absence of legislative proposals, and calls for a timetable for submitting a directive in this regard."
"It calls for stronger measures to combat discrimination and to promote respect for human rights and opportunities for people with disabilities."
"It also expresses support for a United Nations convention and calls on Member States to promote such a convention."
"The report calls for organisations representing persons with disabilities to play a more active role in the decision-making process."
"It advocates the use of the European Social Fund and Structural Funds for persons with disabilities."
"According to the report, it is vital that disabled people should have greater accessibility to information technologies and to the built environment, including access to services. It also calls for a specific action programme, with effect from the 2005 budget."
"For all of these reasons I am voting in favour of Mr Mantovani’s report, which contains excellent observations and suggestions."
". Over the course of the years, Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 has undergone many modifications that have rendered it more complicated."
"This Regulation must, as a matter of urgency, be brought up to date and simplified, in the context of enlargement and given the need to coordinate social security systems in Member States in order to protect the rights of citizens moving around EU territory."
"I therefore voted in favour of this recommendation for a second reading regarding the Common Position adopted by the Council."
"This Regulation, which applies to all European citizens covered by a social security system in their respective Member States, represents fundamental progress."
"Coverage is wider, as it applies to all those persons resident in the territory of a second Member State in the same way as their own national systems, thereby also making a major contribution towards social inclusion."
"All citizens are guaranteed protection when they move around other Member States and are not subject to double taxation."
"An essential step has been taken, especially with the introduction of the principle of good administration, which will encourage greater cooperation and mutual help between the institutions in Member States, and will enhance the way in which citizens’ requests for information are dealt with."
".We voted in favour of this report even though its explanatory statement specifies that the social security systems of each Member State should be coordinated, not harmonised and still less harmonised from the top down."
"Coordination does, however, at least enable certain categories of employees, particularly frontier workers, to know their rights in terms of medical treatment, unemployment benefits or pensions, which is not the case at the moment, apart from a few bilateral agreements."
"If the European Union wanted to make progress in the field of social rights, it would impose a single social security system, extending to all other States the most employee-friendly aspects of legislation in the countries that are most advanced in this area."
"The current trend, however, is for each State to make cutbacks in its social security system, which results in the working classes’ access to appropriate care being restricted."
"The European Parliament recognises its voluntary powerlessness by stating, as this text does, that it can ‘appreciate the desire of Member States to maintain a complete control of their social security systems (…) for budgetary security’."
". Social security systems must be coordinated if freedom of movement is to be enjoyed, as provided for in the Treaties."
"The current regulation on the matter is over 30 years old and has undergone numerous modifications, as a result of national systems being updated and of rulings by the European Court of Justice. What remains is a document that is extremely difficult to read."
"Furthermore, it addresses subjects that are covered by other directives."
"This new version has the advantage of being simpler and more up to date, and does not represent a step backwards in relation to the current situation. It will apply to all citizens of the European Union, in accordance with the concept of citizenship set out in the Treaties."
"A number of derogations and exceptions have also been conceded."
"It is regrettable, however, that the Council has not gone further as regards two aspects."
"Firstly, there is no guarantee that prior authorisation to receive suitable treatment outside the Member State of residence will be granted if the patient’s condition demands this, as Parliament proposes."
"Secondly, concerning unemployment benefit, Parliament and the Commission had suggested that the unemployed could, with prior authorisation, seek work in another country for a period of six months."
"The Council, however, chose to retain the current period of three months with the possibility of extending this to six months…"
". The aim of Regulation No 1408/71 is to ensure the coordination of the Member States’ social security systems in order to protect the rights of persons moving within the European Union."
"That is why this regulation is essential, and why its adoption today is necessary."
"Indeed, I must remind you that the free movement of workers is one of the four freedoms laid down in the Treaty of Rome."
"Over many years – since 1971 to be precise – this regulation has been amended considerably in order to take as much account as possible of changes in national legislation, to improve certain provisions and to fill the gaps that still exist."
"Following a great deal of negotiation in the Council and some effective work by our rapporteur, we have achieved a satisfactory balance, taking into account the constraints and characteristics of the Member States’ various social security systems."
"True, the text could be improved."
"Nevertheless, it forms without any doubt whatsoever, an important step forward as regards the free movement of citizens."
"They will now be able to retain their rights to social security when they go to work in another Member State."
"In addition, their families will also benefit from full health cover."
"It is for all these reasons, and in particular because of the essential and tangible improvement in the daily lives of our fellow citizens, that I am voting in favour of this report."
". We fully support the right to free movement of persons, as one of the fundamental freedoms of the internal market."
"That is also why we have chosen to vote in favour of Mrs Lambert’s report."
"It is natural that the EU, in order to realise its vision of the free movement of workers and other citizens who can support themselves, lay down stipulations for EU citizens moving from one country to another."
"A significant risk when the EU becomes involved in areas that should chiefly be dealt with by the Member States, however, is that the body of legislation doubles."
"When Member States want to protect their benefit systems, they resort to discriminatory transitional arrangements because the detailed EU rules do not permit permanent measures that are completely reasonable."
"Pensions and other benefits that have been accrued can be taken along without problems when citizens move to another EU country, whereas social security benefits (for example child allowances and housing benefit) that are not accrued individually should not in principle be paid out to persons resident in another country."
"In the context of the EU-25 that is now being formed, Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, the Social Charter, should be revised in order that it better suits the new requirements."
". I welcome the adoption of this Common Position, in an area in which Community provisions have already enabled millions of European citizens to enjoy social protection when they move around the EU."
"The Common Position simplifies and updates the legal framework – Regulation 1408/71 – thereby broadening its material and personal scope."
"The principles of equal working conditions and of exported benefits are both strengthened."
"The Regulation will apply to all those citizens of the Member States covered by the social security legislation of a given Member State."
"It offers protection to salaried workers, to self-employed workers, civil servants, students, pensioners, and those who do not pursue an activity."
"Furthermore, it improves the chances of people without jobs – including unemployed frontier workers – finding work in another Member State."
"The difficulties that arose at first reading centred on the approval of two amendments concerning tax harmonisation and an unacceptable definition of the family."
"The Council also rejected these two amendments. I therefore support the final Common Position."
"Safety – and in this particular case road safety – is an area that the European Union has always held dear. Indeed many directives have been adopted in this regard."
"The proposal before us seeks to increase minimum safety requirements in tunnels on the Trans-European Road Network."
"I therefore offer my wholehearted support to this report."
"The Common Position that has been reached, which the rapporteur calls on us to endorse, reduces the technical elements substantially and does not seek to impose specific and detailed obligations on Member States."
"The main objective remains the same and a higher level of safety in Trans-European tunnels will be ensured."
"I also welcome the administrative structure suggested in the report, with a safety coordinator and an authority responsible for traffic in the tunnel. This strikes me as an effective means of achieving the desired aim."
"The unanimous vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the complete convergence of the positions of the two institutions were important factors in my decision to vote in favour of the report before us."
"Council Directive 96/62/EC of 27 September 1996 on ambient air quality assessment – the Air Quality Framework Directive – provides the framework for future EC legislation on air quality, of which the proposal for a directive before us is the fourth and final development. This proposal forms part of an integrated package of measures to combat air pollution in the EU, based on the aims of the Community’s fifth and sixth environmental action programmes for the environment."
"Without prejudice to the special emphasis placed on monitoring air quality, which is, of course, to be welcomed, I agree with the rapporteur’s criticisms of the absence of limit values in this proposal (unlike other directives in this field)."
"Given that arsenic, cadmium, nickel and certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have carcinogenic effects on human beings, and are thus hidden dangers to health, I must offer my support to this proposal, without prejudice to the pertinent criticisms raised."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"Article 129(a) of the Treaty states that ‘The Community shall contribute to the attainment of a high level of consumer protection’, through ‘specific action which supports and supplements the policy pursued by the Member States to protect the health, safety and economic interests of consumers and to provide adequate information to consumers’. Any such action, however, ‘shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures’."
"The regulation before us forms part of the follow-up to the Commission Green Paper on European Union consumer protection, giving substance to Article 129(a) of the Treaty. Its aim is to strengthen cooperation between the national authorities responsible for the surveillance, investigation and prosecution of cross-border infringements."
"A network of public bodies is thus created, in order to address the rise in cross-border trade – especially electronically – and the need to offer consumers better protection."
"The rapporteur also seeks to enlist the participation of consumer organisations in this cooperation, and this is something that we consider to be of vital importance."
"Hence our vote in favour."
"We feel, however, that all efforts should be made to avoid any major repercussions on the Member States’ national legal systems or any disparities in the prosecution of national or cross-border infringements."
". Consumers certainly deserve more rigorous and more effective protection, especially in today’s world."
"The aim of the Commission’s proposal is to increase protection for consumers."
"Consequently, I accept the need to implement a system of cooperation that will lead to a high level of surveillance, in order to investigate and combat cross-border infringements."
"There are some extremely welcome measures in this proposal for a regulation, such as closer cooperation between Member States through bodies specially set up for the purpose, and the creation of an electronic database, containing comprehensive information in this area."
"I welcome the Commission’s proposal. I also endorse the amendments tabled in this report, which are intended to develop the Commission’s proposal and to pre-empt certain problems that may arise from the coexistence of different systems for implementing the legislation."
"Against this background, the report paves the way for the involvement of private consumers’ associations in the framework of cross-border cooperation between the authorities concerned."
"For all of these reasons, I voted in favour."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, for having done a fantastic job in turning a disastrous Commission proposal into something that still has some problems but is considerably improved."
"It is vital to remember that we must not produce a proposal that undermines access to credit."
"The Commission's proposal would have denied the less advantaged and lower- income groups from access to credit."
"It would have meant a huge amount of inconvenience for consumers."
"For example, many consumers in Europe have credit cards, and some have two, three or four."
"Under the Commission proposal they would have to resign their contracts for each of these credit cards. They would have faced a lot of red tape when their credit limit changed."
"They would have faced even more red tape if they wanted to be overdrawn for a day or so."
"If they wanted to buy a fridge or a TV on credit, they would have had to leave it in the shop for two weeks before they could take it home."
"There were bizarre proposals from the Commission on the destruction of data that would have inhibited the law enforcement authorities in the fight against fraud and financial crime."
"Many of these problems have been solved by our amendments, and I would appeal to the Council to accept those amendments adopted today."
"There are still some problems with overdrafts and credit intermediaries, but Parliament can claim credit for achieving significant improvements to this proposal which I hope will be accepted in the final directive when it is agreed in the next Parliament."
"Mr President, thank you for the outstanding way in which you have conducted the sitting."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is extremely pleased with the outcome of the vote."
"We have addressed some of the things that had been preventing the development of the banking sector, but at the same time we have retained very important aspects of consumer protection and developed that too."
"I think that we have created a Directive that will enable increased cross-border trade within Europe in the future."
"I know that some people would have liked to vote in favour of provisions on mortgage credit, but I hope and ask that the Commission presents a proposal on this point, which is extremely difficult to regulate."
"My thanks to the President for giving me the floor, and for conducting the sitting so excellently."
". – I trust that the proposal for a directive on consumer credit which we are debating will provide a solution for the benefit of consumers and will put a stop to this unacceptable situation which functions like an El Dorado for the credit institutions."
"In Greece, in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in consumer loans and we are already talking about the excessive debt of Greek households."
"This increase is due not only to misleading advertising to attract customers, but also to the ambiguous terms and 'small print' in the agreements, which put an additional burden on borrowers."
"No one can deny the need for measures to be introduced to standardise the information which banks must provide so that consumers are in a position to compare more easily and select the product best suited to their needs."
"This information must also list the actual annual rate of interest, the eventual cost of contracting the agreement, the number and amount of the instalments and the total cost of the loan."
"The right of the consumer to be able to withdraw from the agreement within a reasonable period of time without needing to justify his action must also be established."
"In 2003, consumer credit accounted for over EUR 510 billion in the euro zone alone (13% of household consumption). This illustrates both the economic interest in this market by the banks and other operators and also the reality of over-indebtedness, which must not be underestimated."
"In Portugal, household debt exceeds 100% of available income, if mortgages are taken into account."
"The issue does not, therefore, solely concern access to credit and consumer protection, but also economic sustainability, with families at severe risk of falling prey to the dictates of monetary policies and to the artificial temptations of consumerism."
"The consumer credit market is predominantly a local or regional market. There is, therefore, no apparent reason to encourage granting credit to cross-border trade, particularly with fallacious arguments that this will be the ‘engine’ to ‘stimulate internal consumption in Europe’ or a ‘key factor in the much-hoped-for economic resurgence’."
"While I am aware that some operators are opposed to this directive, due to certain obligations that the directive imposes on them, I have my reservations as regards the process of maximum harmonisation as contained in this Commission proposal."
"We must take measures to increase cooperation, to strengthen mechanisms for protecting consumers and to introduce the flexibility that Member States need in order to adopt measures that are more ..."
". The report before us seeks to amend Directive 87/102/EEC, concerning Community rules on consumer credit."
"The issue at stake is whether the application of harmonised rules in this area will contribute towards protecting the consumer."
"On the one hand, such harmonisation offers greater security to trade within the Community, to creditors, to traders and to consumers."
"On the other hand, complete harmonisation would weaken the rules applied by individual Member States, who must, therefore, retain the right to offer a higher level of protection to their consumers, even those States that feel that total harmonisation may prove useful in certain areas."
"Without going into detail, it strikes us that, even though the report is the result of compromises struck in the committee concerned, it is well-balanced and reflects our concerns that both lenders and borrowers should be held liable, at a time when marketing and invitations to buy on credit are extremely aggressive."
". The purpose of the Commission’s proposal, which updates the provisions of Directive 87/102/EEC, is to raise levels of consumer protection."
"Such an initiative is, therefore, to be welcomed."
"It also contains some less positive elements, however, and this report seeks to rectify those elements."
"Some of the measures put forward by the Commission could make credit more expensive and, in so doing, could lead to a reduction in loans."
"We welcome those rules that are intended to strengthen transparency and comparability."
"It is also important that we establish the principle of responsible lending, placing special emphasis on the obligations of both lender and borrower."
"We must establish minimum, yet essential rules at Community level for consumer credit."
"Nevertheless, a higher level of consumer protection must fall to Member States at national level, otherwise the subsidiarity principle will be breached and the nature of a directive will be undermined."
"In light of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, I am voting in favour."
"I must, however, state my approval of the way in which the Commission draws attention to over-indebtedness."
"In this regard, in fact, I cannot agree with the report."
"One of the main reasons for consumer over-indebtedness must surely have to do with easy access to consumer credit, such as non-essential or other items that consumers clearly neither need nor can afford."
"In this respect I agree ..."
"The aim of the Green Paper on Consumer Protection in the European Union was to define a framework directive to offset the negative aspects of business-consumer relations, namely unfair business practice. The Green Paper acknowledges the importance of self-regulation of the main operators through codes of conduct."
"This is, accordingly, a further directive forming part of the consumer protection package based on broader objectives that are intended to safeguard consumer confidence and to promote transnational and European business transactions."
"Accordingly, the intention is, once again, to harmonise the internal market, by establishing Community legislation in the area of unfair business practice."
"Nevertheless, this proposal for a directive, amended by Parliament, aims to improve the rights of consumers who have been the victims of unfair practice, provides a clause that establishes a general prohibition of unfair commercial practices, clarifies the definition of such practices, broadens the range of practices covered, provides stronger measures to protect consumers deemed vulnerable, such as children and the elderly, and involves consumers’ organisations more closely in drafting codes of conduct. We welcome all of this."
"The directive falls short, however, of what was required."
". Following up the provisions of the Green Paper on consumer protection, this proposal for a directive from the Commission is intended to protect consumers from unfair commercial practices by companies in the internal market, by defining what constitutes unfair commercial practice uniformly across the EU."
"The Commission’s proposal seeks to strike a balance between, on the one hand, a higher degree of consumer protection and, on the other, the smooth operation of the internal market."
"I welcome the rapporteur’s amendments to the Commission’s initial proposal, which have made significant improvements to the proposal."
"Of these amendments, the rapporteur is particularly concerned with commercial practices aimed at specific categories of consumer, namely those consumers whose vulnerability is exacerbated by factors such as age, disability, temporary physical or mental condition, or literacy level."
"As regards misleading advertising, I endorse the rapporteur’s suggestion that the proposal for a directive should cover advertising whose content is controlled by the companies themselves and not by advertising agencies."
"I applaud the rapporteur’s work and voted in favour."
". I have chosen to vote against Amendment No 21 by the committee, which aims to abolish the Swedish system of different voting weights for A and B shares."
"Some harmonisation of the rules of EU countries on financial markets may be needed for the benefit of the internal market, and thus of growth, but this amendment is along the wrong lines."
"The system of A and B shares is open, non-discriminatory and based on purchasing contracts that have been entered into freely."
"It offers opportunities for individuals and institutions to invest risk capital in an enterprise without the liability associated with ownership."
"There is no proof that the system of differentiated voting power obstructs takeovers."
"A more fundamental objection is that deciding on forms of ownership, questioning ownership and preventing long-term owner liability for an enterprise are not matters for the EU."
". The presence of pesticide residues in products of plant and animal origin affects human and animal health and must be reduced as far as possible."
"This question is intrinsically linked with commonly used agricultural practices – the agricultural model – and with the environmental risks associated with using pesticides, particularly in soils and water."
"The proposal before us is intended to consolidate and harmonise existing legislation on pesticides and to standardise the rules across all Member States."
"The regulation sets maximum pesticide levels for all products, gives the Commission the final say in setting import tolerances and gives the European Food Safety Authority the responsibility for risk assessment."
"In spite of our reservations about the report’s federalist attitude, the questions of principle appear to be sound, provided that Member States retain the possibility of enforcing more stringent measures in their own territories and that specific national and regional characteristics are taken into account, such as climate differences and the available best agricultural practices."
"We must, moreover, address the issue of setting levels, which should be based not on helping business or on complying with WTO rules but on consumer health."
"It is, therefore, vital that imported products are subject to the same rules."
". The aim of the proposal for a regulation is to harmonise all maximum residue levels (MRLs) at Community level, which will ensure a high level of health protection for consumers and will reduce commercial problems."
"The purpose of the proposal is to simplify existing legislation and to define the roles of the various parties involved, in particular that of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and that of the Commission, in setting MRLs."
"The EFSA will take responsibility for risk assessment, based on its network of experts and institutions in the Member States, and will issue an expert opinion on the safety of each MRL."
"The Commission will be responsible for risk management, and for setting MRLs based on the expert opinions of the EFSA."
"The authorities of the Member States will provide the EFSA with details of national food systems and of the products and practices permitted in those countries."
"MRLs of existing or new substances that have yet to be harmonised, previously set at national level, will be compiled by the EFSA. If those are proved to be safe, based on available information, they will be set as temporary MRLs."
"In light of the need to guarantee a high level of food safety and given that I endorse the move to define roles and responsibilities more clearly, I voted in favour."
". I welcome the Council’s adoption of the ‘general orientation’ proposed by Parliament at first reading, taking on board the objections raised at that time, in particular concerning respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"The ‘common orientation’ is thus entirely consistent with the basic idea that security of natural gas supply should be guaranteed in the first place by the companies involved, whereas Member States and, finally, the Commission should intervene only at the second and third stages."
"Of course, I welcome the fact that a ‘Gas Coordination Group’, consisting of representatives of the Member States and interest groups, is to be set up along the lines of the body that already deals with oil."
"This is precisely the measure to provide the much-needed ‘sharing of best practice’, to implement the best solution and to ensure that subsidiarity is respected."
"Lastly, the choice of Article 95 TEC, as the legal basis for the original proposal for a directive was justified by the fact that the Commission had proposed a range of measures for harmonisation."
"It is precisely these measures, however, that Parliament and then the Council removed from the initial proposal, because they considered them to be fundamentally unsuitable."
"In line with the terms agreed by the Council and the European Parliament and because I agree with changing the legal basis to Article 100 TEC, I voted in favour."
". The reaction of the large private monopolies or of the large countries when their interests are put at risk, in this case in the vitally important energy sector, is most revealing."
"As the rapporteur says, ‘a market can be 100% open, as in Germany, but still be virtually impenetrable to foreign companies, because domestic companies in effect have a monopoly over the infrastructure’ … ‘There was also unwillingness in France for legal unbundling of both electricity and gas markets.’"
"The aim of the major powers and their large corporations is to liberalise the energy market, provided that they retain control in their countries and gain control of the market in other countries."
"This is the case in France, where the market will only be liberalised when conditions are met for French big business to be in control."
"Parliament, accordingly, seeks to enforce ‘equal’ rules for all, when what is actually required is to remove the strategic control of a country’s energy supply from big business – with its mindset of profit and domination – and to promote a sector and a public policy that ensures fair and universal access and a country’s sustained and balanced development."
". The gas and electricity markets have, to a large extent, been liberalised but remain essentially national markets."
"A consensus must be found, at European level, on developing technical rules relevant to the completion of the internal gas market."
"This matter was considered by the bi-annual Madrid European Gas Regulatory Forum, which brings together representatives of the Commission, national regulatory authorities, Member States, network operators and users, as well as gas consumers."
"As was concluded at that meeting, we must ensure the openness and transparency of national markets, a gradual reduction of gas prices (an area in which there are still enormous disparities between Member States), improve interconnection capacities and the problems ensuing from low capacities and remedy the lack of proper rules on charging for cross-border trade in energy."
"That Forum – to which the proposed regulation gives a formal consultative role in preparing and debating the guidelines – strove to achieve a consensus on the technical rules for completing the internal market in gas at the Forum’s seventh meeting in Madrid, in September 2003, which looked at the issue of the principles underlying compliance with the set of guidelines under review."
"This consensus provided the basis for the proposal, which once again ..."
". I voted in favour of this proposal for a directive because I believe that the ecological design of energy-using products should be encouraged and I therefore believe that Parliament must support the Commission in its Integrated Product Policy (IPP)."
"The environmental impact of a product must not be measured only according to its use or consumption but also by considering the fact that, within its life-cycle, design could have a major impact on the effects a product has."
"Like the rapporteur, I believe that eco-design could thus incorporate environmental considerations at the stage when the technical possibilities for so doing are at a maximum."
"I also think that there are significant advantages to be gained by manufacturers (and consumers) from this proposal’s adoption, such as knowing and optimising the flow of raw materials and energy, anticipating and complying with environmental legislation and meeting the expectations of customers and users."
".– The ΕU has been undermining the Kyoto protocol since the moment it signed it."
"Instead of taking substantial measures to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases responsible for the greenhouse effect and the climate changes which it causes, it is trying to take advantage of the 'flexible' mechanisms so that not only are industry's interests not touched, but so that there are benefits too."
"This is happening at a time when it is certain that the ΕU will not achieve its objective of reducing emissions by 8% by 2010."
"Thus, within the framework of the principle that everything can be bought and sold, a market with the right to pollute has been established."
"Now, the directive is being supplemented in order to include 'joint implementation' and 'clean development mechanisms', both of which concern industries which invest in cleaner technologies in non-EU countries."
"The reduction in emissions achieved is reported under the assets of the industries, which acquire the right to pollute elsewhere (inside the ΕU)."
"It is obvious that this is yet another scheme which involves complicated procedures with uncertain results in order to circumvent the material provisions of the Kyoto protocol and benefit businesses, in that the cost of applying the protocol will fall by 20%."
"The report does not put forward the tiniest objection to the above measures, which is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against it."
". – Production focused solely on profit, with no concern for the environment, has consequences that are so threatening to the very survival of the human race that international institutions are beginning to take an interest in it in certain areas and to lay down regulations setting, in particular, allowances limiting greenhouse gas emissions."
"Allowances intended to reduce pollution, however, become in turn commodities that can be bought and sold and turn into rights to pollute that the richest countries can buy from the poorest."
"These allowances-cum-commodities are, to judge by the report, a real headache for Parliament when it comes to determining their ‘market value’ The more extraordinary aspects of this debate illustrate the extent to which we are living in an economic system that does not allow society to control its own economic activity."
"A self-aware human race with control over its means of production would attempt to satisfy everyone’s needs in the short and long term, while respecting nature."
"It would have no difficulty in establishing, at a global level, ceilings that must not be exceeded for production that may damage the environment."
"It is the economic system itself, though, which is blind and stupid, and, Kyoto agreement or not, it constitutes a threat to the future of humanity."
": I voted for the report by Mr de Roo today for several important reasons."
"The Irish presidency has intensified the level of discussions on securing broader international support for the implementation of the Kyoto Accord."
"We have serious political obligations with regard to complying with the Kyoto provisions."
"If we are to offset the effects of global warming and the resulting damage to the global economy, we must reduce the level of greenhouse gases."
"This has been my view for some time."
"The European Union must be to the forefront in persuading our international partners to agree to all aspects of Kyoto."
"I welcome the Irish Government’s talks this week with the new head of the American Environmental Protection Agency."
"I hope these can help move the process forward and that this lobbying will encourage the US to review its isolationist position on Kyoto."
"I also hope we can move away from the adversarial approach on environmental issues between environmental groups and key business communities."
"Enlargement on 1 May 2004 will strengthen our voice and position on the international stage in favour of Kyoto."
"We know what our obligations are. We must ensure they are met."
". I voted against the de Roo report."
"I am, of course, in favour of a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading, in order to make it easier for our economies to adapt to the constraints imposed by the objectives set out in the Kyoto protocol."
"I feel, however, that Parliament wants to introduce an overly bureaucratic system and pointless obstacles."
"This is all the more regrettable because the Kyoto protocol has not yet entered into force and, as a result of this, the United States, Russia and China will gain a competitive advantage over their European competitors."
". At the end of each legislative period, rapporteurs try to bring the negotiations with the Council to an end promptly, so that, following the elections, there is no need for another discussion with uncertain outcome."
"Before a public debate becomes possible, serious differences of opinion have already been cleared out of the way."
"In this case, industry is pleased that, thanks to the energy displayed by the Green rapporteur, CO2 emission allowance trading can start as early as 2005 instead of 2008."
"That is in keeping with the Liberal view that a reduction in emission is too expensive at home and it is therefore preferable for this to be done in countries where this is more cost-effective."
"The expected advantages are that at world level, results are achieved more quickly and that in their industrialisation processes, developing countries are encouraged to make use of environmental technology developed in Europe straight away."
"This is traded off against the fact that no measures are taken at home, countries in eastern Europe sell their rights in order to reconstruct their industries and countries in the developing world may not be able to start the industrialisation process for a long while yet."
"However, on a positive note, at least 50% of reduction must be achieved within the EU."
"The advantage of this proposal is that production forests, which are intended to be felled or which can burn down, can no longer be fraudulently entered in accounts as carbon pits for taking carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converting it into oxygen."
". ‘Joint Implementation’ (JI) and the ‘Clean Development Mechanism’ (CDM), together with international emissions trading, are innovative instruments provided for under the Kyoto Protocol."
"The ‘flexible mechanisms provided for under the Kyoto Protocol’ allow the Parties partially to meet their Kyoto objectives, whilst taking advantage of the opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other countries at a lower cost than in their own territories."
"These projects must provide real, measurable and long-term benefits related to the mitigation of climate change, whilst at the same time contributing to the sustainable development objectives of the host countries, in particular by transferring environmentally safe and sound technologies."
"On 18 March 2003, the Council adopted a common position on a Directive establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading."
"By stimulating demand for CDM credits, this proposal will enable us also to assist developing countries implementing CDM projects in meeting their objectives for sustainable development."
"This would also help to combat climate change through the effective implementation of the Kyoto Protocol."
"I therefore voted in favour."
". The main problem posed by batteries and accumulators is the fact that they contain heavy metals, such as mercury, lead and cadmium."
"In practice, the collection of batteries that contain these metals did not work, largely because, as the Commission has said, consumers did not sort goods properly."
"This is one of the reasons why the Commission decided to opt for the collection of all batteries, so as to ensure that the valuable material contained in all batteries could be recycled."
"It is crucial, as I have said on other occasions, to explore all forms of waste treatment with a view to reusing and/or recovering products."
"It is essential, however, that we also heed the warning from industry professionals to the effect that it will take five years for the recycling market to come of age."
"Furthermore, the proposed collection rates are too high, particularly in comparison with the best per inhabitant per year rates in some European countries."
"Lastly, I believe that we must invest, in particular, in alternative technological solutions, which are safer and less onerous. This is an area that I would like to see developed further in the near future."
"I thus abstained from the final overall vote, because I believe that the outcome of the various votes will not ensure the required balance."
"Mr President, allow me to explain my abstention on the Cocilovo report."
"The rapporteur took great pains to support a new approach and to pursue it boldly."
"I should have welcomed an even bolder line and particularly a more receptive attitude to the amendments tabled in committee and here in plenary by the various political groupings – I myself was among those who tabled them – with a view to taking more account of the needs of people in sensitive areas."
"This boldness was lacking at the first reading."
"I hope this will have been rectified by the time we next deal with the proposal. I am confident that this is the right approach, but it must be pursued more consistently and more boldly."
".– Nobody now denies that road transport has fallen into the brutal clutches of free trade, to the detriment of employees’ working conditions, road safety and the environment."
"In this context, I have supported all the amendments that aim to make social and fiscal dumping illegal."
"For example, I voted in favour of measures strengthening monitoring accompanied by sanctions, whether on the road or on company premises, and in favour of all improvements to drivers’ working conditions."
"In this field, as in others, I am in favour of striving for social and environmental excellence."
"That said, I am still sceptical as to whether the European Union truly wants to legislate in this fundamentally important field for the capitalist economy and, above all, to impose proper checks and sanctions on all offenders."
"Without real involvement from the Member States, and without additional human and material resources, which includes enlarging the labour inspectorate, I fear that these provisions will once again go unheeded."
"I have nevertheless voted in favour of this report, but I am counting particularly on the Europe-wide mobilisation of employees and of their unions to really shift the balance of power."
". The establishment of the single market and the consequent liberalisation of the road transport sector and of short-sea shipping in the Union have led to stiffer competition and to a substantial increase in the number of cases in which companies attempt to gain a competitive advantage by failing to comply with Community legislation on driving and rest periods, as can be deduced from the significant increase in infringements recorded."
"Imposing rules for monitoring the correct implementation of provisions on working time should be seen, therefore, against the backdrop not only of protecting drivers’ rights, but also of competition and road safety."
"We therefore rejected the amendments seeking to remove from the scope of this directive control over the maximum weekly working time, night working hours, weekly rest periods and driving times between these rest periods and a two-weekly limitation of driving hours as proposed by the Commission in Annex 1."
"I must state my unhappiness at the Council’s ongoing failure to present its common position on adopting a regulation on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport, a matter on which the EP delivered an opinion in January 2003."
"I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his work."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Deprez’ report (A5-0267/2004)."
"We think it important further to develop the Refugee Fund and to coordinate efforts at EU level, as well as to lay down sensible procedures and such like."
"We are nonetheless aware of the fact that the Council decision is covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the EU and does not apply to Denmark, cf. the Protocol on Denmark’s Position."
". We are now looking at developing the first phase of the European Refugee Fund (ERF I), which started on 1 January 2000 and will expire on 31 December 2004."
"ERF II will attempt to improve assistance to Member States for receiving asylum seekers, for integrating into the EU persons requiring international protection and also for actions to promote the voluntary return of persons without protection or asylum seekers whose requests for asylum have been rejected."
"Its programme will be divided into two periods (from 2005 to 2007 and from 2008 to 2010) and its total cost will be EUR 687.48 million."
"It will apply to all Member States, except to Denmark, and also to all applicant countries."
"ERF II complies with the relevant provisions of the Treaty."
"Consequently and also given that there is broad consensus on this subject and that ERF 1 has produced good results, I voted in favour of the Deprez report."
"This communication is the outcome of a consultation process involving various special interest groups, which will furthermore take account of studies currently underway. The communication will also formalise a thematic strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste to be adopted by the Commission, as announced, in September 2004."
"The strategy to which I refer, which follows on from the Community waste management strategies of 1989 and 1996 – is intended to promote a more sustainable form of waste management, which covers environmental, economic and social aspects and introduces new concepts and both qualitative and quantitative approaches, which will certainly help us to find better solutions."
"I agree with the emphasis the rapporteur places on the importance of more ambitious actions for raising environmental awareness among the public, businesses, economic stakeholders, etc and I agree that one of the essential aspects of the desired strategy must reside, precisely in this point, paying particular attention to information and training campaigns and projects in schools."
"Mr President, I would like to make some comments on Mr Voggenhuber’s report."
"I note that some fundamental rights are not included in the draft constitution."
"Mr Voggenhuber, who is a member of my own political group, was a member of the Convention."
"I am talking about the principle of legal equality of languages."
"I am talking about the right to self-determination."
"Finally, a flagrant violation of fundamental rights has occurred in Spain with the closure of the Basque newspaper ."
"The text also fails to address this issue."
"I am extremely unhappy about this and, because the chairman of my group called me an idiot for signing the draft motion of censure, I have taken the liberty of not voting the way my group directed on this matter and have abstained."
".– The ΕU never misses an opportunity to brag about its principles and values and to give everyone else lessons in good manners."
"Just how hypocritical this is can be seen from the fact that it considers the prosecutions and bans against communists in numerous candidate countries and the Annan plan for Cyprus to be compatible with its principles."
"In political practice, its principles are so broad as to allow room for everything which is in the interests of monopolies and so narrow as to exclude the fundamental rights of the workers."
"The Commission communication and the report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs address the matter as a legal matter and focus on the procedure for applying Article 7 of the Treaty, which makes provision for measures to be taken against Member States which violate the principles of the ΕU."
"This is not just a legal issue, it is a deeply political issue."
"In addition, the report does not for a moment doubt the 'good intentions' of the ΕU."
"Nonetheless, it does contain some positive points, such as those which refer to the need for a higher standard of protection of fundamental rights, tolerance, the promotion of a political climate in which people feel threatened and so on."
"That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece did not vote against the report but abstained from the vote."
". I voted against the Voggenhuber report, which attempts to exploit Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union to implement, in the area of general policy and citizens’ rights, a new form of ‘multilateral monitoring’, added to the one arising from the Maastricht Treaty for economic policy and the one that the socialists would like to strengthen in the social field."
"This multilateral monitoring, the growth and increasing strictness of which is becoming a characteristic of the current European Union, poses two problems."
"First of all, there is the problem of its legitimacy, since it uses the basis of a largely artificial European democracy to suppress national democracies, even though they are more effective and closer to the people."
"Then there is the problem of its effectiveness, since to date, as we know, its main achievement has been to paralyse the Member States and to cause stagnation throughout the European system, which is becoming, in all areas, more and more cumbersome, more and more rigid, and more and more difficult to get moving."
"Finally, the desire to unify and move beyond the nation States on which this monitoring is founded causes many more problems than it solves, because it subverts democracy and destroys both the pluralism and the dynamism of Europe."
"In 1992, when our Community declared it was moving beyond the economic dimension to become a Union, its treaty stated that ‘the Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States’."
"Article 7 provides safeguard mechanisms."
"The sad Austrian episode in 1999 caused us to think again about the effectiveness of those instruments."
"Amendments were subsequently adopted, but they did not go far enough."
"We can therefore be pleased at the Commission’s initiative."
"Like the rapporteur, however, I think the Commission is on the wrong track in basing its strategy only on prevention."
"Prevention must be combined with penalties."
"A risk of breach of fundamental rights is very difficult to define."
"I advocate a broad definition, to include, for example, a Member State’s failure to deal with human rights violations (racism, anti-Semitism), the discriminatory impoverishment of population groups, serious restrictions on the freedom of the press."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Voggenhuber’s report (A5-227/2004) on fundamental rights in the EU."
"We support the basic idea behind this report, but reject, however, the wording of paragraph 11(a), stating that ‘Union intervention pursuant to Article 7 of the EU Treaty must therefore be confined to instances of clear risks and persistent breaches and may not be invoked in support of any right to, or policy of, permanent monitoring of the Member States by the Union’."
"We believe that the EU must be able to monitor a Member State for a period in the event of fundamental rights in the EU being violated."
"If, for example, a country grossly violates human rights, it is necessary to be able to monitor that it is remedying the situation in question."
". Mr Voggenhuber has been arguing on behalf of the Group of the Greens for an EU Constitution for years."
"Meanwhile, such a constitution is in preparation, in which free competition pure and simple, more and more arms and the undemocratic authority of the Council are permanently established."
"This constitution, and also Article 7 of the present Treaty on European Union, allow measures against Member States that cease to be democracies and seriously and persistently breach the rule of law of the constitutional state."
"That is important for the undemocratic Spain under the recently defeated Aznar Government and the potential future Member States of Romania and Turkey."
"Neither these provisions nor the Commission’s communication on them make clear whether they also cover a serious failure to act against violations of human rights."
"I appreciate the fact that, in his resolution, Mr Voggenhuber wishes to give it an interpretation based on openness, equality, plurality of opinions and confidence that the Union is not going to engage in permanent monitoring of the Member States."
"I also agree with him that Parliament must play an important role in the event of suspensions and this must not be left to the power politics of the Council."
"What disturbs me, however, is the idealistic sauce being poured over his resolution."
"The real values of the EU, alas, are the market, currency, free competition and armaments, rather than democracy, human rights, the environment, peace and solidarity."
". I voted against this report because it takes a maximalist and centralist, almost persecutory approach towards respect for and promotion of the values on which the Union is based and – neglecting its role, which is to complement the States which it comprises – it has opted to ignore the nature and reality of national democracies, casting an unfortunate pall of suspicion over them."
"At a time when the European Union is preparing for the largest wave of enlargement in its history and particularly in light of the degrading spectacle that the annual debate on the report on human rights in the EU has become, it would be worrying, to say the least, if the European Parliament were to grant itself the task of ‘policing’ Member States’ adherence to democracy and values, whilst ignoring the role of States and Nations in a multifaceted definition of what it is to ‘be Europe’ and putting forward a disciplinarian and perverse vision of this reality."
"I agree with the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market when it recommends that the potential Interinstitutional Agreement on Article 7 of the EU Treaty should only be addressed, if at all, after the accession of the new Member States."
"The proposal to extend the ‘values’ on which the Union is based, incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into this field, and ambiguously and disproportionately to extend the list of phenomena to be considered serious risks are, in my view, both mistaken."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"– Before turning to this afternoon’s work, I owe you a brief explanation for being late."
"As you know, voting took more than two hours this morning: real political efficiency is required at the end of a legislative period to conclude the work of Parliament’s committees.There is something else, however: I was involved in a very important ceremony outside our Parliament early this afternoon to mark the deaths in Rwanda ten years ago, with the speaker of the Rwandan parliament and a delegation of parliamentarians who had come from Rwanda to be with us here in Strasbourg today."
"I therefore apologise for being late."
"It was, however, a shocking fact that must be acknowledged and even commemorated, as we did today, since, in addition to our other responsibilities, we for our part have at least a duty to remember."
"– The main reason why I am in the Chair at the start of this afternoon is to mark the visit of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the French Republic."
"Welcome to the European Parliament, Minister."
"Mr Barnier worked with us here for a long time, in particular as commissioner with responsibility for the European Union’s regional policy."
"He is highly regarded in this House, but he recently escaped, and he was not able to say goodbye to us any more than we were able to say goodbye to him."
"It is therefore my very great pleasure, Minister, fellow European, to be here, yes, better late than never, to welcome you and tell you how much we appreciate the work you have done for Europe."
"In your new position as a French minister, you will be continuing down the European road, a large part of which you travelled here."
"Thank you very much, Mr Cox, for coming here today and for allowing me, with the kind permission of the Council presidency, to occupy the Council’s benches temporarily for a few minutes and say a few words to you."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to have spoken to you a few days ago, but that was not possible because my appointment as France’s Minister of Foreign Affairs happened very quickly."
"I wanted to say a few words to you and I am very grateful to Mr Cox, the President, for allowing me to do so."
"Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, Voltaire liked to say that his motto was: short letters for long friendships."
"The brevity of my address will likewise bear no relation to what I hope will be a long and enduring relationship."
"My first words have been for you, Mr President, to thank you for allowing me to say them to you; I know that you have made an exception for me."
"Now that another task has been entrusted to me in my country, I am pleased to be able to pay tribute to you and take my leave as is customary between partners and between friends, because I cannot forget – and have no wish to – that the battles I had for nearly five years here in Strasbourg and in Brussels in the service of the Commission were battles shared by and with this House."
"First, the battle for the Constitution, which, we hope, and we are working to that end, will reach the decisive stage of adoption in June at the latest, thanks to the skill and efforts of the Irish Presidency; it is based on a project in which we can all see the work we have put in, because that project is our own."
"When it came to designing it, Commissioner Vitorino and I found ourselves working in the Presidium with Mr Hänsch and Mrs Méndez de Vigo."
"When it was fiercely debated, article by article, comma by comma, and finalised, we were again side by side with many other members of the Convention whom I see again here: Mr Brok, Mr Duff, Mr Duhamel, Mr Lamassoure, Mrs Van Lancker, Mr Voggenhuber and others I am thinking of who will not take it amiss if I do not mention them by name, Parliament’s delegates to the convention and their deputies, who were always active, uncompromising and intelligent."
"I have no doubt that when the time comes to defend this text and explain it to the peoples of Europe – I remember the concern that Mr Dell'Alba had and still has to explain it – we shall all be back together again as a team, whatever our positions, doing so together."
"Mr President, all along this exciting and difficult road there was someone who helped me greatly with his guidance and advice, and that was Mr Napolitano, who is here today."
"In spite of everything, he believed above all in the possibility of that Convention and of the Constitution."
"I would like to thank him for his advice and to pay tribute to his work and his vision, by quoting the French writer André Maurois, who once said that ‘progress is made by doing the impossible’."
"As you know, my other battle was and will continue to be economic, social and now territorial cohesion and its future after 2007."
"Cohesion, ladies and gentlemen, is one of the European Union’s finest policies."
"Together with the entire team at the Commission’s Directorate-General for Regional Policy, who were a tremendous help to me, I wanted to ensure that the regions – your regions and, first and foremost, those whose need is greatest because they are the poorest or the most remote, such as the outermost regions and others – are really partners and never spectators of European projects and European progress."
"Decision time is approaching."
"When it adopts its position on the financial perspectives and cohesion policy in a few hours’ time, this House will be taking an important step towards that final decision in 2005."
"This gives me an opportunity, and I have almost finished, to thank some of you more personally – the three chairmen of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism with whom I had the good fortune of working: Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Caveri, and today Mr Costa; the successive rapporteurs who helped me unstintingly in shaping the future of this cohesion policy: Mr Musotto, Mrs Schroedter, Mr Mastorakis and Mr Pomés Ruiz; and finally those whose similarly unstinting vigilance and advice enabled me to base that policy on sound joint budget management: Mrs Theato, Mr Wynn, Mrs Pittella and Mr Kuhne."
"I do not want to hurt the feelings of others I have worked with; I am thinking of them and include them in my thanks."
"Mr President, this is the first time in a long time – I was once a minister – that, with your permission and that of the Irish Presidency, I have spoken to you from the Council benches."
"The responsibilities that I have today are, of course, different from those of the Commission."
"You may be sure of one thing: neither my ideas, nor my method, nor, in particular, my availability or my friendship with this Parliament and those who sit here will be affected or changed now that I am Minister of European and Foreign Affairs of the French Republic."
"We met because of a particular idea of Europe and I am quite sure that in the near future we will meet again for the same reason."
"There are so many things on which we need to work together."
"Ladies and gentlemen, for the great democratic and civic moment of exchange and dialogue that awaits you and this House in a few weeks’ time, I sincerely wish each and every one of you good luck, whatever your opinions and convictions."
"Mr President, because I know this was not customary, I want to thank you for allowing me to say these few words, because it was something I very much wanted to do."
"Mr President, I take the floor for just one minute to thank the Commissioner, Mr Barnier, not just for the comments that he addressed to me, which moved me deeply, but also for the cooperation that he has been able to establish with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and with Parliament as a whole over these years."
"Thanks to him, the dialogue, the cooperation, the shared commitment and the alliance – as has sometimes been said – between the Commission and Parliament in the field of institutional affairs, have not remained pure rhetoric but have become a working reality."
"We are sure that our friend the minister Michel Barnier will be able to worthily occupy the position that Robert Schuman once held, of interpreting the Europeanist traditions of France, that great founding Member of the European Community."
"– Thank you everyone, especially you, Minister."
"(1)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0268/2004) by Terence Wynn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on 'Building our common future – policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013'."
". Mr President, when I first came in and looked around I thought people were actually here for this debate, but then I suddenly realised that former Commissioner Barnier was about to make his speech!"
"Members have in front of them a report not just from the Committee on Budgets, but one that has attempted to take on board the opinions of the other committees."
"In doing so, we have tried to include at least three or four priorities which they consider to be paramount priorities, and then ask the Commission and the Council, in paragraph 31, to at least look at all the Annexes to get a feel for what the other committees are trying to do."
"I say that because I have had a letter from one of my fellow chairmen actually complaining about this procedure, but we thought it was a fair way of proceeding and one that would give everyone a chance to have their say."
"The thrust of the report is not to make concrete proposals, but to lay down guidelines for the next Parliament."
"The idea is that we in the present Parliament should not do anything definitive, but should at least give an opinion how we think negotiations should proceed in the next Parliament."
"My job as rapporteur for this report, rather than as chairman, is to defend the position of the Committee on Budgets."
"As a result, I am not here to recommend acceptance of any of the 22 amendments that we have before us, although I feel Amendments Nos 3 and 5 do help in the wording."
"I will leave such decisions to my political group."
"I am fascinated by the amendments from my British Conservative colleagues in the name of Mr Bradbourn and others, especially Amendments Nos 17, 18 and 19."
"Amendments Nos 17 and 18 ask that there be a maximum of 1% GNI for the Community budget, and Amendment No 19 is about renationalisation of the structural funds."
"As a British Labour Member I very much welcome the approach of my Conservative colleagues, who are now endorsing Gordon Brown's proposals."
"I am sure this will please him!"
"I am still confused about Amendments Nos 20 and 21, but will speak to Mr Bradbourn about those later."
"However, whilst I may welcome them as a British Labour Member, I am here not as a British Labour Member but as a rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets, and cannot support them."
"As I said, Amendments Nos 17 and 18 asked for a maximum 1% GNI for own resources."
"My preference is for the existing paragraph 17, which states that we should evaluate our political priorities, then their needs, and only then should Parliament decide on what the level of own resources should be."
"When President Prodi first presented the Commission's proposals I made the point that between 1988 and 2002, under the existing financial perspective, the amount of payments had indeed averaged out at 1% of GNP."
"Of course, if the average is 1% there will have been times when that 1% was exceeded."
"If you look at paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 of the report, it actually says that we should be looking at the priorities and then deciding what that average overall should be."
"It could well be that after making the evaluation and looking at the political priorities we end up with a figure of 1% of GNI."
"Paragraph 19 would seem to indicate a higher figure, but looking at this sensibly and pragmatically, we could get any figure and 1% cannot be ruled out."
"However, that is a decision not for this Parliament, but for the new one, as is the timeframe."
"The reason for this is to ensure the involvement of the new members from the ten new Member States, along with the ten new Commissioners."
"As I said earlier, this report does not aim to take decisions, but to enable the new Parliament to do so while also, along with the new Commission and the Council, to at least take note of what we are saying."
"To repeat one other point I made in the first debate on this issue, I would remind the Council that the Interinstitutional Agreement is only an interinstitutional agreement when the institutions keep to it between themselves."
"In other words, Parliament is a key player in this."
"It is not a bit-part player in the process."
"It is a major player and I hope the other institutions recognise that."
"This is probably the last time I will address this Parliament as chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"I would like to say what a great privilege and what a great job it has been."
". Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Wynn and his committee for their work."
"I welcome the opportunity today to participate in this debate on the future financial perspective, and I note the points made by Mr Wynn."
"The report and the work undertaken by Parliament constitute an important contribution to the process of working towards the agreement on future financing for the period from 2006 onwards."
"The nature of the agreement on the next funding round will have a critical impact on how the Union equips itself to tackle forthcoming challenges, including those most relevant to the quality of life and economic prospects of our citizens."
"Each of the Union's institutions has a responsibility to ensure that we achieve a balanced and fair outcome that supports our policy goals in a financially efficient and financially effective manner."
"As we are aware, there are no easy answers to the challenge that the negotiations on future financing will have to address."
"We must address the need to boost growth throughout the Union so as to capitalise on the economic recovery that is now evident."
"We need to target resources effectively so that we build a growth-enhancing infrastructure throughout the Union that contributes to the improvement of transport links, with investment in communications and new technologies."
"Similarly, the provision of support for human capital – in particular in terms of education and training – has the potential to complement our investment in infrastructure."
"Upgrading the skills of Europe's workforce will contribute significantly to improved productivity."
"Equally, support for innovation will provide added value in the demanding global marketplace, thus enhancing the competitiveness of the Union and its output."
"The policy of solidarity is critical to the success of our Union."
"The European Union must consider how best to support those regions of the new Member States that will lag behind the Union's average in terms of development and access to growth opportunities, including access to employment opportunities."
"Equally, certain regions of existing Member States are still engaged in the convergence process, and the Union will need to consider what continued assistance is appropriate to support our shared objective of enabling all regions to converge on the EU average level of prosperity."
"Similarly, our debate on future financing will have to address the differing needs of urban and rural populations and regions and consider how best to create a balanced outcome that will promote greater prosperity for a wider range of Europe's citizens."
"Our debate on future financing must also consider how we can enhance the priority which we attach to promoting the principle of sustainability in respect of future growth and development."
"Equally, we all recognise the importance of providing appropriate resources for increased Union actions in the areas of freedom, security and justice and in support of the Union's external relations role."
"In short, the challenges facing us as we look at the future financial perspective are very significant indeed."
"As Parliament is aware, we are still at the very early phase of our deliberations on the future financial perspective."
"The Irish presidency's approach is to build a solid foundation for the detailed work that will need to be undertaken under succeeding presidencies to achieve agreement on the level and on the focus of future financing."
"Its related objective is to provide Member States with the opportunity to consider the Commission communication as a whole and to outline their initial response."
"This process is intended to enable us to identify areas of agreement and also areas of potential divergence."
"Parliament will have seen the European Council conclusions welcoming the work of the Commission on this issue and endorsing the presidency's approach to handling it."
"In line with these conclusions and analytical exercises currently under way in the Council to examine each of the areas addressed in the Commission communication, this work will form the basis for the report which will be prepared for the June European Council, outlining the outcome of the deliberations thus far."
"The Wynn report is therefore an important contribution to work on an issue in which each of the Union's institutions will be involved."
"I welcome the constructive manner in which the European Parliament, as usual, has approached the issue of future financing."
"While there may be differing viewpoints on specific aspects of the issue, I am pleased to see that there are many areas of shared analysis and a common recognition of the importance of focusing on issues such as sustainable development, growth, freedom, security and justice, and the Union's external role."
"We have much work to do, as I have already said."
"That will determine how the Union acquits itself to meet the challenges ahead."
"Obviously, there will be points on which we will differ as the negotiations proceed – that is the very nature of politics and political dialogue."
"However, I am confident that our shared commitment to achieving a fair and balanced outcome to negotiations will help us to work towards a final package that will promote effective use of resources in support of greater prosperity for all the Union's citizens in the years ahead."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we politicians who deal with budgetary affairs can look back today on five years of successful cooperation."
"The budget for the year 2000, the first for which we were jointly responsible, was also the first budget to be drawn up under the current system of financial planning."
"After five years of shared experience of the financial perspective as a planning instrument, we now have a welcome opportunity to discuss this experience in terms of its implications for the next planning period."
"Our experience shows that the planning instrument has proved well able to guarantee the orderly development of expenditure and its funding."
"In particular, the instrument of the interinstitutional agreement, with its consultation and cooperation mechanisms, has also managed to ensure that the discussion process is efficiently conducted and is concluded in good time."
"On the other hand, experience has also shown that a greater degree of flexibility is desirable, that the ceiling for expenditure on foreign policy was simply set too low and that the capping of administrative expenditure is liable to create its own problems."
"The beneficial effects of the Financial Perspective derive from its capacity to foster mutual trust between the institutions and to promote compromise."
"In this respect I fully endorse what the Chairman, Mr Wynn, has said."
"This very point is also an argument in favour of synchronising the duration of the Financial Perspective with the mandate of Parliament and the Commission – in other words, limiting it to five years."
"The Commission agrees in principle with the Committee on Budgets here."
"The Commission, however, has proposed a further seven-year period as a transitional phase for many reasons, which I do not wish to recapitulate here."
"Perhaps there is room for a compromise, such as an arrangement whereby the support programmes for which the Commission is currently drafting the legal basis would not have their budgets fixed at this stage for all seven years."
"If we want to ensure that all the legal bases can be adopted in 2006, there is simply not enough time to wait for the new Commission to create them."
"It goes without saying, however, that the new Commission will be able to assert its own priorities in the consultation process."
"The Financial Perspective establishes the financial framework for the policies that will be pursued over the next few years."
"It is a highly significant political project, which is why the consultations must be preceded by an agreement as to which tasks the Union intends to perform collectively in the future."
"That, indeed, is the way in which the Irish Presidency has addressed this matter, and I should like to take this opportunity to offer a most emphatic vote of thanks for the manner in which you are dealing with this dossier and with the Commission’s proposal at the present time."
"Our common aims are ambitious: sustainable growth, greater competitiveness through enhanced support for science, research and education, the development of a European Union area of freedom, security and justice for our citizens, the assumption of more joint responsibility in the world and the successful integration of the new Member States."
"The new framework will apply to an EU of 27 Member States."
"The Commission proposes that all of this be funded within the present ceiling for the Union’s own resources."
"We are not proposing an increase in the ceiling, even though the present limit has remained constant since 1999."
"We are even proposing a far greater flexibility margin below this ceiling of 1.24% of gross national income than the one proposed by the previous Commission for the present planning period."
"If we compare the figures from the current financial plans with those in the Commission’s new proposal for the years 2007 to 2013, it emerges that our proposed ceiling for this next planning period works out at an average of 1.14% of gross national income, while the current average is in the order of 1.12% if the EDF and the Solidarity Fund are included. If the European Development Fund and the Solidarity Fund were removed from the equation – as they are in the figures for the new period – and the values for the present period were recalculated on the basis of 25 Member States, the result would actually be a slight reduction in the percentage of gross national income to be levied in the coming years under the Commission’s new proposal compared with the present planning period."
"How has it been possible for us, in spite of this ambitious agenda, to remain below the said ceiling?"
"The only reason, of course, is that the Commission has reallocated funds from old to new tasks."
"For example, the percentage of the budget devoted to agricultural expenditure will decrease, while the allocation to sustainable growth will increase."
"Reallocations are proposed between the old and the new Member States."
"If we examine the Commission’s proposals for the forthcoming planning period for the old Member States alone, we see that they fall well below the ceiling of 1.0% of gross national income requested by some of the Member States."
"If, however, we were to set a ceiling of 1.0% for the enlarged Union of 27 Member States, we should have to forego the pursuit of entire policies, and the catalogue of objectives adopted by the Council and ourselves would then become unattainable."
"Over the past few years, we have done much to consolidate the budget, far more than has been done in the Member States."
"The budgets of recent years, the budgets for which we have been jointly responsible, may be regarded as the lowest in the history of European financial perspectives."
"The amounts of expenditure flowing to the current Member States have been reduced in order to create, within the limits of the current ceiling, sufficient financial capacity for the accession of new Member States."
"In the realm of budgetary policy, we are well prepared for enlargement."
"We have a new up-to-date budgetary system, and we have a new budgetary structure which is far more transparent and far more political."
"Thanks to very close cooperation among the institutions in recent years, our record has been good."
"And you, Mr Wynn, have been a magnificent chairman of the Committee on Budgets and have led the committee very, very successfully."
"You were, however, also fortunate in having very good committee members, who have been professional, competent and – an essential attribute in any politician involved in budgetary matters – extremely hardworking."
"The same applies to the bureau of the committee."
"We have achieved a lot, thanks to excellent cooperation."
"It was a very good experience in every way."
"I am extremely grateful to you."
"Mr President, with telegraphic brevity then, first of all congratulations to Mr Wynn on his report."
"On behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I have four points to make."
"The first point is that we fear that too restrictive a budget may actually prevent the European Union from playing its part on the international stage."
"The second point is that while we supported a transparent, flexible and simplified budget, we also very much want the European Parliament to retain control of it before any decision is taken."
"So far as external relations are concerned, we therefore call for a budget breakdown that is both thematic and geographical."
"The third point is the fight against poverty."
"It seems to us that one of the ways, albeit not the only way, of preventing terrorism in the world today is to eradicate poverty."
"That is therefore one of our priorities."
"The fourth point is that, with enlargement, we want our relations with the Arab world to be maintained and expanded and the Barcelona process and neighbourhood policy to be relaunched."
"That is also our last priority."
". Mr President, the Committee on Budgetary Control has published, to give you the main points, the following suggestions on the resolutions of the Committee on Budgets."
"In the first place we would like the budgets to be more realistic in the future than they have been in the past."
"We note that large amounts remain unspent every year."
"There is nothing against that as such, but then why did that money have to be in the budget in the first place?"
"The second point, that is very important to us, concerns the fact that about 80% to 85% of all the money is spent by the Member States."
"As a way of exercising extra control over this, would it not be possible for each Member State to issue a declaration each year, stating that the money had been well spent."
"If things turned out later to be wrong, then the Commission would be in a stronger legal position to deal with the Member State concerned."
"In other words, national declarations of good conduct."
"The third point is that we would like, but that is widely known, that a positive Statement of Assurance (DAS) be produced once every so many years."
"On the eve of the elections, it is really difficult to explain why, after nine years, the Commission is still unable to extract a positive declaration of expenditure from the European Court of Auditors."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, you said that the medium-term financial plans also determined our policies for the next few years, and indeed they do."
"In the realm of agriculture, unless the worst comes to the worst, we shall obtain codecision, and our system of financial planning has a substantial agricultural component."
"We in the European Parliament want to be involved; we have no wish to accept the implication in the draft constitution that all power over money matters tends to rest with the Council, and we shall play our active role here."
"You also said that expenditure on agriculture would fall, while expenditure on sustainable business activity would rise."
"That is all very well, but if you consider the second pillar, to which rural development belongs, there is no real increase once you take account of the fact that there will soon be 25 and then 27 Member States."
"This needs to be rectified, particularly since the proposals formulated in the agricultural domain did not provide for capping."
"The third point is that we want to be more heavily involved in research."
"In the framework programme for research and development, only five of the individual programmes relate to agriculture."
"There is therefore a need to focus more sharply on the economic development of agriculture in rural areas."
"Allow me to conclude by returning to the discussion that took place on gross national income and to the contributions on that issue."
"I see little sense in the letter proposing a limit of one per cent."
"The proposal that the Commission has now made is an offer – let me just call it that, although I would personally have preferred a rather more sharply defined line to follow."
"We must, of course, succeed in narrowing the wide gulf between authorisations and disbursements by means of better policy – and this is naturally a matter for Parliament too."
"One final thought: you have formed a reserve for a Growth Adjustment Fund, but there is no provision for a specific reserve to deal with crises in areas such as foreign policy or the environment."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, we are undoubtedly confronted by formidable tasks as we try to determine the future shape of the EU, and setting the right priorities for this purpose is not easy."
"Top priority must attach to the real Community policies."
"One of these is unquestionably the common fisheries policy, which continues to need a solid financial basis – a need which is now greater than ever before."
"Allow me to enumerate briefly the main points which I identified in drafting the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries and which were explicitly and emphatically reaffirmed by the future Commissioner from Latvia, Mrs Sandra Kalniete, at her hearing."
"Firstly, adequate funding of the CFP in the forthcoming financial perspective is imperative."
"Secondly, the areas that depend on fishing, most of which are structurally weak regions, are in particular need of the solidarity and support of the Community."
"Moreover – and this is my third point – we need more socio-economic measures; fourthly, we need greater diversification and, fifthly, we need the development of new activities."
"I am convinced that fisheries in Europe have a future but only if they are adequately funded."
". Mr President, on behalf of my committee, I wish to thank the Committee on Budgets and Mr Wynn for having given very substantial consideration to our committee’s views on the future financial framework."
"It is crucial to cohesion policy that the funding it receives should be 0.45% of GDP, especially as the challenge of enlargement is to be taken into account."
"There must also be adequate funds for developing the weaker regions of the current Member States."
"I am also grateful that the report is calling for there to be verification of how compatible state aid policy is with regional development."
"This was a key message going out from our committee."
"Parliament’s message regarding the simplification of administration and the monitoring of implementation is unequivocal."
"To its credit, the draft report also mentions the need for financial support for regions with special problems."
"As someone from a sparsely populated region, I warmly support this."
". – Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur sincerely for having given substantial consideration to the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"I would also like to say thank you to the Commission for emphasising the importance of education, culture and youth in building an expanding Europe."
"The Commission deserves full support in this."
"The educational exchange programmes are a success story."
"An even more vigorous effort will have to be made in the future to ensure that they are also within the reach of those with meagre funds."
"The culture industry is a growing sector, which has to be invested in."
"To ignore it is to forget culture’s wider importance for sustained growth and increased mutual understanding."
"I am pleased that the report stresses the importance of simplifying the administration of cultural and educational programmes."
"On the other hand, I hope that the Committee on Budgets will not then create legislation that complicates the procedure."
". Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Wynn on an excellent report."
"As the Development Committee's draftsman, I would like to stress that our Committee's most important condition with regard to the financial perspectives, that of reaching the Millennium Development Goals – the most prominent of which is to halve world poverty by 2015 – has to remain one of the principal objectives of the category for external action."
"Money allocated to poverty eradication must be safeguarded from being transferred to meet the Community's other objectives."
"Therefore clear distinction has to be made between those areas of external action which have different characteristics: pre-action aid, enhanced cooperation development, cooperation humanitarian aid, relations with ACP countries, peace and security and, finally, reserves."
"New aid and development assistance is almost invisible."
"The other agencies we use to deliver our money, aid and assistance take the public credit for our taxpayers' endeavours."
"This must change: it must stop and stop quickly."
"The plan to the budgetise the European Development Fund must not result in a reduction in the overall development finance for ACP countries."
"These funds must be focused by means of sub-headings, or ring-fenced in their financial perspectives."
"I must reiterate that we must keep poverty eradication at the forefront of our development assistance."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on this report."
"I seem to remember saying a few weeks ago that I regretted that would be the last time he spoke as chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and yet he is still here."
"Who knows what will happen in our new Parliament, assuming of course that we are both re-elected?"
"This debate highlights how the EU institutions seem to rush into debates before fully preparing the ground."
"In the brief time available, I would like to reflect on the period in which the financial perspective has been in operation."
"A few of us were Members of this House in the 1980s, when we had turbulent budget debates that were not over-affected by the limits imposed, and then had the financial perspectives from 1988."
"Since then we have witnessed an enormous rush in European history, from the disintegration of the Soviet Union to German unification, followed by the rush to include countries from central and eastern Europe, which will be complete in a few days time."
"We have noticed over this period that the financial perspective, as Mr Colom i Naval pointed out in one of his working papers, is indeed somewhat rigid and requires certain changes."
"Since we are now on the brink of central and eastern enlargement, it seems to me that this period should be one for reflection as we bring in new countries, although possibly not a united Cyprus."
"It is slightly odd that we have had this debate without the full participation of the representatives of the central and eastern countries, when we realise there are huge problems and challenges concerning the absorption of those countries, as regards not only institutional operation but also policy making."
"In this debate we are looking ahead to the distant date of 2013, and although useful policy documents exist we have yet to see them."
"We are therefore right to call for these documents so that we can see exactly what basis has been used to assess how to ensure the European Union will work for 25 countries and how to ensure that Europe will become more competitive, and indeed meet its international obligations – the members of the European Council take decisions on our behalf, but very rarely provide us with the requisite budgetary framework."
"There are therefore three points which we should include in our message to the incoming parliament and the incoming administration of the European Union."
"Firstly, there must be a coherent strategy for the European Union in the years ahead so that we know what the Union's priorities are to be, both internally and externally."
"Secondly, we should avoid trying to stretch the political credibility of the Union too far in taking on ambitions that the institutions themselves are incapable of handling at the present time."
"I refer in particular to future enlargement for a country like Turkey, as things stand."
"Lastly, we need a period of consolidation during this financial perspective period, to make the European Union not only an effective operator internally and externally, but also an operator that is seen to be truly democratic and smooth-functioning."
"If we try to take on too many of the ambitions harboured in certain quarters, our institutions will be incapable of fulfilling them."
"Mr President, the Wynne report we are currently debating represents an initial response to the Communication from the Commission on the new Financial Perspective."
"There is no intention of arriving at a definitive response during this final plenary. That said, I believe the response provided by the Committee on Budgets is too ambiguous."
"I feel the European Parliament is missing yet another chance to make a clear statement on its positions concerning key budgetary issues."
"Parliament already missed the opportunity provided by the Convention."
"We Socialists always advocated deepening European integration because we believe it is beneficial to all the citizens."
"More Europe means more benefits in everything and for everyone."
"In our view, being part of such a Europe is a win-win situation."
"The Socialists favour a citizens’ Europe rather than a Member States’ Europe."
"This is why we have argued repeatedly that citizens should pay the contributions, not the Member States."
"Members of this House will remember Joan Colom."
"He was forever saying that he felt it was unfair for a rich Spaniard to pay fewer taxes to Europe than a German manual labourer."
"This is what actually happens under the present system of own resources."
"We also believe that the fiscal principles applied in our countries must apply also at Union level. I should like to make it clear that for both the reasons stated we shall be voting as a Spanish Socialist delegation in favour of the amendment tabled by the French Socialists."
"– Mr President, first of all I wish to congratulate Mr Wynn on producing a very balanced report."
"At the same time I would like to thank you, Terence, for the constructive work you have done as Chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"Yours has been an amicable and constructive approach to the job, with the result that the work of the committee has been harmonious and effective."
"The value of the financial perspective proposed by the Commission depends on what the balance of power between the budgetary authorities will be in the future."
"If the end result is that the financial perspective creates a jointly agreed framework in which Parliament can participate fully in drafting the budget, it will be of great value."
"If, on the other hand, the EU budget is to become merely a set of small-scale appropriations, as the Ministers of Finance recently proposed, that does not bode well for consistency in budget policy in the years to come."
"The Commission’s proposal to review the financial perspective is a step in the right direction."
"The number of headings has been reduced."
"Nevertheless, heading 1 covers an unnecessarily large area compared to the others and it might be a good idea to divide it in two."
"Similarly, the allocation of appropriations for agriculture and environmental protection under the same heading raises questions."
"The priorities with regard to future policy are the right ones."
"EU competitiveness will only improve by promoting entrepreneurship and by investing in research, product development and education and training."
"The intention is to treble the figure for appropriations currently being spent in the next seven years."
"My group is in favour of this."
"There has to be investment, particularly in education, training and trainee exchange programmes, so that we will have better educated youth with a more international outlook that can take responsibility for its intellectual and material development in the future."
"The other important priority is cohesion policy."
"It is now vitally important to promote cohesion, as we are about to be joined by new Member States whose combined GDP is just 5% of that of the old Member States, although they make up 20% of the population."
"One of the EU’s main objectives is the promotion of economic, social and regional equality."
"The EU bureaucratic machine is vast, and not only does it pose a threat to efficiency but it especially threatens to tarnish the Union’s reputation in the eyes of the public."
"That is why there has to be less bureaucracy and more administrative efficiency."
"Power and responsibility must be devolved downwards and personal accountability clarified."
"Mr President, one of the first questions that must be asked in this debate is whether the financial framework proposed by the Commission is up to the task of guaranteeing economic and social cohesion and of guaranteeing the redistributive nature of the Community budget and the commitments to the less advanced countries in a European Union enlarged to 27 Member States, in which Community GDP will be reduced by more than 12% and whether economic, social and regional disparities will increase, as stated in the third cohesion report."
"My answer is no – this perspective is clearly not up to the task."
"One only has to look to the past."
"The financial perspectives for 1988-1992 and for 1993-1999 increased the ceiling for own resources from 1.15% to 1.27% of Community Gross Domestic Product."
"In both cases, the Structural Funds were duplicated in the packages nicknamed ‘Delors I’ and ‘Delors II’."
"Agenda 2000 maintained the ceiling for own resources and for funds, when enlargement to encompass a further six countries was already on the horizon."
"The Commission’s current proposal, however, maintains the ceilings set in Agenda 2000, despite the fact that the current round of enlargement involves a further ten countries, plus another two, with incomes of less than 40% of the Community average."
"I refer to the pressure exerted and the lack of solidarity shown by the main cash contributors to have signed the Letter of the Six, who are seeking to limit the budget to 1%."
"Nevertheless, Commissioner Schreyer acknowledges that her proposal, which is low, is only possible due to the process of budgetary consolidation that has taken place in the current 15 Member States: to the Stability Pact and to the reallocation of funds."
"But what and who will suffer as a result?"
"This framework shows the risks both for the countries that are about to join, and for the cohesion countries, such as Portugal, given that the value of the Structural Funds for the current Member States will fall from 0.31% to 0.21% of Community income."
"This situation really needs to be changed, the ceiling on own resources must be increased and a response must be given to the serious problems of cohesion, poverty and of protecting greater economic and social cohesion between all the countries of the European Union."
"Mr President, from an agricultural and rural development perspective, the delivery of EU policy objectives, taken in tandem with the most recent CAP reform, means that EU farmers can now plan to meet the challenging agenda of food security, quality and high environmental standards."
"I have every confidence in their ability to do so."
"Farmers and rural communities have legitimate expectations, to which Parliament has responded in a positive way."
"It is my hope that the most dramatic reform since the CAP was first introduced will lead to greater stability and provide a much-needed stimulus for young people to take up farming as a full-time career."
"There are some encouraging signs that this may happen."
"Finally, as this is likely to be my last contribution in this House, I want to acknowledge the success of the European project."
"Ireland, perhaps more than any other EU Member State, bears witness to the practical realisation of the aspirations and dreams of the EU's founding fathers."
"There can be no doubt that Ireland's economic success would not have happened, and could not be sustained, outside the framework of EU membership."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a very well-balanced report and provides a sound basis for the work of the next European Parliament without seeking to prejudice our successors’ decisions, which it could not do anyway."
"Many of the questions that will have to be discussed with regard to the budgetary policy of years to come can only be answered by the enlarged European Union, and we must also give due consideration to the adoption and implementation of the constitution."
"For this reason it should be re-emphasised at the present juncture that, while the Union must, of course, provide itself with the means necessary to attain its objectives and carry through its policies, as prescribed by Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, it must equally ensure that contributions and appropriations are fairly distributed and that budgetary processes are open to scrutiny."
"It is certainly true that, under the new headings, the Commission is concentrating on growth targets, employment and sustainability, but I must say that we should be all the more credible if this were not confined to the allocation of budgetary resources but were also reflected far more clearly in the application of the Community acquis and if we focused far more sharply on this aspect in the adoption and consolidation of European legislation."
"Let me also say at this point that it is too soon to talk about figures today – whether 1%, 1.24% or somewhere in-between – because we must first deliberate carefully on these things on the basis of the constitutional discussion."
"To this extent, the letter from the six leaders was neither helpful nor in any way expedient in its timing or its content."
"I also insist on the need for synchronisation of the financial perspective with the legislative term of Parliament and the Commissioners’ term of office, and let me make one last point, Mr President."
"On the basis of our experiences and the turbulence that is often part and parcel of political life, adequate budgetary flexibility within each financial perspective is surely one of the major objectives that will have to be discussed, and we in Parliament shall play our part in that discussion."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, I concur with all the previous speakers who have said that the debate on the future financing of the Union is still in its infancy, and indeed we may stand on the threshold of some rather hard bargaining."
"It is therefore, as my fellow Member Mr Böge said, far too soon to talk about figures, ceilings and minimum allocations, but what do we actually think of the Commission’s basic approach?"
"Let me begin with what we perceive to be good points."
"The Commission is proposing a different set of budget headings from those to which we are so accustomed."
"It is also proposing a somewhat different aggregation structure for the individual EU policies."
"One of the new categories is to be sustainable growth, and another will be conservation and management of natural resources."
"This is the result of the Commission having paid very careful heed to Parliament’s frequent discussion of budgetary priorities."
"We want to become the most competitive economic area, and we want to preserve a decent world for our children and grandchildren."
"About four fifths of our budget is to be devoted to this aim."
"‘Wonderful’ is all I can say to that!"
"A German saying, however, tells us that there is no light without shadow."
"The main shadows are in those areas where the Commission has kept its own counsel."
"I cannot find any reference to its ideas and proposals as to how the European budget is supposed to acquire the funds we intend to devote to the pursuit of our policies."
"It would have been better if the Commission had accompanied the financial perspective with its ideas on how to reform the Union’s own resources."
"That would have forestalled several squalid discussions about Member States’ contributions, but perhaps the Commission can still plug these gaps."
"I hope it does."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0272/2004) by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission Communication: the Third report on economic and social cohesion."
". – Mr President, I must say that today's debate on the third cohesion report, for the fourth community support framework, is basically much easier than previous debates which we have held on the same matter in the European Parliament, and I think that one basic reason for this is the personal contribution to it by Commissioner Barnier, in the sense that he started the dialogue on the new 2007-2013 programming period very early, making it possible, thanks also to the assistance of the European Parliament and thanks to the fact that he also listened to the views of the European Parliament, to achieve a broad consensus on this very difficult issue."
"We therefore need to give him credit and to note, of course, that Commissioner Fischler, who is present here, and Commissioner Diamantopoulou helped him in this."
"I should also add that this endeavour was complicated by impending enlargement, with many new countries covered by the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, and by the fact that the regional policy of the European Union basically needs to be reprogrammed from its foundations."
"I think that both the third cohesion report, as presented by the European Commission, and the position of the European Parliament clearly demonstrate the usefulness of this policy."
"I also think that the first message which needs to be made clear from this debate here is that the European Parliament and the European Commission are against any thoughts of renationalising this policy."
"This policy has European added value, it has visible results in the regions, especially in the regions which have problems, in the poorest regions, and it must continue."
"Another thing I should like to add is that this policy, especially with enlargement coming up, must be given material support from the point of view of funding, which is why Parliament is also reiterating once again its position that funding for it cannot be below 0.46% of gross national product."
"Consequently, we agree with the European Commission which, in all events, has adopted a European Parliament proposal on this."
"The European Parliament welcomes the fact that the lion's share from the point of view of funding is going to what has been known so far as Objective 1, the 'convergence objective' as it is to be known henceforth, and we consider that the problem created in areas which fall victim to statistics needs to be addressed effectively."
"These areas also need to be integrated into Objective 1 and to receive substantial financial coverage and, furthermore, we consider that the areas which fall victim to statistics – and here we disagree with the European Commission – should be integrated from the point of view of state aid into the provisions of Article 87, paragraph 3a of the Treaty."
"The European Parliament also considers that it is right to simplify the approach to Objective 2 and we also consider it right that the initiatives we have known so far – Equal, Leader and Urban – are being integrated into the basic programmes of the European Union and that the only Community initiative left, as a new Objective 3 if you will, is the Interreg initiative on cross-border cooperation, which we see as an addition to cooperation and development at European level."
"I should also like to say that particular importance is attached in our report to individual sectoral problems, such as the problems of rural areas, on which we accepted numerous proposals by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and of towns."
"As an MEP from Greece, I want to focus in particular on the problems created by permanent geographical structural disadvantages and refer to areas such as islands, mountain areas and, of course, the sparsely populated areas of northern Finland and Sweden."
"We consider that there should be special policies not only within the framework of regional policy, of cohesion policy, but also more generally in the other sectoral policies of the European Union."
"We welcome the European Commission's efforts to simply procedures with the principle of 'one fund per programme', but we shall wait to see the details and we want the role of the European Parliament from now on, especially as regards the drafting of the European Commission's strategic documents for the new programming period, to be substantial and for the European Parliament to have a right of codecision."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, my colleague Michel Barnier has been appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs of the French Republic and has consequently had to leave the Commission."
"Until his successor is appointed, President Prodi has asked me to look after the structural and regional policy portfolio."
"I therefore welcome the opportunity presented by Mr Hatzidakis’ report today to debate the principles of future policy on the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union."
"Let me also thank you, Mr Hatzidakis, for your interesting report."
"The Third Report on Economic and Social Cohesion was adopted by the Commission on 18 February and was presented to Parliament by Mr Barnier on that same day."
"The presentation of that report is to be seen in the context of the proposal for the financial perspective, which we had also adopted in February before the cohesion report."
"The Commission is calling for a new partnership for cohesion."
"It must be our common will not only to build a Europe based on the common market but to build a Europe characterised both by a keener competitive edge and by more solidarity, a Europe that is more capable of achieving the aims set at Lisbon and Gothenburg, namely sustainable development and a knowledge-based economy."
"The imminent enlargement on 1 May, which will integrate many economically weak regions into the European Union, makes it even more urgent and even more crucial that Europe should pursue a robust policy of economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"The Commission has made strenuous efforts to respect the wishes of the various European institutions and regional and local authorities as far as possible in its proposals for the next planning period from 2007 to 2013."
"The report, in other words, does not simply reflect the ideas of a single Commissioner but is the product of a comprehensive broad-based debate, to which the European Parliament has also made significant contributions."
"I refer in particular to the two major reports by Mr Mastorakis and Mr Pómes Ruiz which you adopted in September 2003 and to which Mr Hatzidakis also refers explicitly in his report."
"In addition, the debate, particularly among the Finance Ministers and the Heads of State or Government, as to how ambitious our cohesion policy should be has only just begun."
"Since these deliberations will undoubtedly be difficult, the report you have presented today provides valuable backing for the sort of ambitious cohesion policy that the Commission is also proposing."
"How specific are our proposals?"
"Firstly, there is a convergence target for those regions with a GDP of less than 75% of the Community average."
"Secondly, account is to be taken of the particular situation of the regions hit by the so-called statistical effect deriving purely from enlargement."
"Thirdly, the Cohesion Fund is to be integrated into both of these measures."
"Fourthly, a new target is to be introduced for the improvement of regional competitiveness and employment."
"The fifth and last proposal is that the measures for the promotion of interregional cooperation should be restructured on the basis of our experience with Interreg."
"In general terms, I can only agree with the rapporteur when he calls for radical simplification of the administration of the cohesion funds."
"Here too, we have already drafted precise proposals, which we intend to pour into a legal mould in July."
"This applies to all areas, not just to Mr Barnier’s portfolio."
"For example, in the realm of rural development, for which I am responsible, we want to do some pruning too."
"We shall press, firstly, for the creation of a single fund for rural development which would consolidate all the resources that exist at the present time."
"Secondly, there should be a single regulation in which all the measures for the development of rural areas are defined, and, thirdly, due priority should be assigned to rural development in the financial perspective."
"The same applies to the sphere of responsibility of my former colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou, and to the portfolio for which Mr Barnier has hitherto been responsible."
"We have reached the level at which the aim is to develop a single instrument for the planning and funding of programmes with an appropriate set of common control mechanisms."
"I believe that would constitute major progress."
"I also agree with Mr Hatzidakis’ view that 0.41% of Community GDP – 0.45% if we include the resources for rural development – ought really to be regarded as a minimum for an effective cohesion policy."
"Mr Hatzidakis also expresses certain fears and concerns in his report."
"Some of these relate to the thorny issue of the definition of cohesion policy and to the system of regionally targeted state aid, to which he referred in his speech."
"I also have a personal interest in the question of the contribution made by rural development to a policy of compensatory regional planning, and this House can rest assured that we shall continue to focus on the necessary measures in their entirety and that, as I have said, we shall be working on specific proposals for a regulation that we can present to Parliament during the month of July."
". – Mr President, having first warmly congratulated the rapporteur, I should like on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to emphasise the importance in this third report on economic and social cohesion of the contribution of industrial policy, especially research and innovation policy."
"It is obvious that economic and social development, which is now geared to the notion of a knowledge-based economy, depends on overcoming the syndrome of peripherality and making full use of the regional comparative advantage, innovation and research."
"In order to find their way, the regions need to stop treading the traditional path and focus on the increased economic importance of new branches of industry, such as the eco-industries and cultural industries, which can provide new jobs and, at the same time, overcome geographical limitations."
"Economic and social cohesion requires new ideas, inventiveness and innovative methods, not just funding."
". Mr President, we welcome the Commission's approach, the broad thrust of which we fully endorse."
"We also thank Mr Hatzidakis for his excellent report."
"We have specific concerns relating to the European Social Fund under the competitiveness objective."
"First, the wider approach to social inclusion appears not to be supported to any substantial extent."
"We fear that many valuable projects will be lost."
"We hope that there will still be room for such projects, provided that they support the employment strategy."
"Second, national planning of programmes could prove counterproductive to addressing regional and local circumstances and involving local stakeholders."
"We call on the Commission to ensure genuine decentralisation in the development and implementation of programmes."
"Third, the disappearance of the Equal programme may lead to a loss of impetus and we wish accordingly to see a requirement for gender mainstreaming at all programming stages."
"Similarly, we hope for continuing availability of innovative measures as currently allowed under Article 6."
"Finally, we look forward to structures that will allow us to address genuine areas of need wherever they may be located."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, because I do believe he has summarised very well the content of a highly realistic proposal from the Commission."
"The biggest-ever enlargement of the European Union is about to take place, and in two weeks’ time we shall have ten more Member States."
"If economic and social solidarity is to be achieved, an efficient cohesion policy will be indispensable."
"The structural support provided by the European Union contributes substantially to the development of rural areas."
"The common agricultural policy alone, even with its second pillar, is not able to perform all the tasks on the agenda."
"For this reason, it remains essential that we have adequate resources at our disposal over and above the CAP budget."
"We really must ensure that the rural-development programme is a sharply delineated instrument and that it is tied to the CAP and hence to active, productive agriculture."
"Rural areas will account for most of the territory of the Union in the enlarged Union too."
"I believe that rural areas must be active and appealing if they are to be capable of creating new jobs, more output and income opportunities."
"Mr President, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has given a positive opinion on all the proposals made and we want to thank the rapporteur for agreeing to include in his report certain aspects of the gender dimension that were missing from the documents."
"That seems to us absolutely essential because progress remains totally inadequate despite an avowed willingness to promote equality between women and men all these years past."
"There are two points to be made."
"Firstly, the situation of women in the new Member States, which requires special attention."
"The second point is a regret, Mr President, Commissioner, that our recommendations on methodology have not been followed."
"If we are really to achieve the gender mainstreaming we want, however, we need genuine local appraisals of the situation of women."
"We need to have people who are working for gender equality sitting on the Structural Fund monitoring committees."
"Finally, all the specific actions deployed must incorporate these conditions so that women are involved in employment, in training, but also, Mr President, in decision-making."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking former Commissioner Barnier for his comment on how well the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism worked with him. We pooled our efforts to defend the European Union’s principles on regional policy and territorial cohesion."
"I would like to thank Mr Barnier for mentioning my name, and I wish him every success at the helm of the French Foreign Ministry."
"I should also like to thank the former President of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Hatzidakis. His excellent term as President is crowned by the report he is presenting today on economic, social and territorial cohesion in Europe."
"I feel it appropriate to take him back to the basics of cohesion. The latter is a long-standing principle."
