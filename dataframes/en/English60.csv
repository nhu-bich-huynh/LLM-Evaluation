"Quite simply, they are detrimental to the environment."
"It is important to bear in mind the visual aspect of the environment and not to equate environmental issues with the defence of all conceivable animal rights."
"As regards social issues, it must be remembered that there is more to them than democracy and tolerance."
"Moral values also have an important role to play."
"I am bound to say, Mr Barroso, that you gave in to pressure from the Left when you undertook your reshuffle to come up with a new Commission-designate."
"Your actions do not bode well for the future of moral values in Europe."
"Turning to foreign policy, its scope has to be broader than Turkey and North Africa, Mr Barroso."
"I am well aware that citizens of the old Union holiday in those countries."
"I also realise that citizens of the old Union meet people from those countries as they go about their daily lives back in Europe."
"It must be understood, however, that foreign policy also involves what lies beyond the Union’s eastern border."
"Until recently, that was deemed to be the single huge area of Russia."
"That is not the case."
"There are countries other than Russia across that border, and I have in mind Ukraine in particular."
"Ukraine is a free nation and wishes to remain one."
"You spoke of showing solidarity with Africa, Mr Barroso."
"Subsidies are not the best way of doing so, as they are mere drops in the ocean."
"The best way of demonstrating solidarity is by withdrawing subsidies from European agriculture."
"African countries would then be able to compete and build a better future for themselves."
"Mr Barroso, it is essential to be guided by moral principles and common sense if weare to come up with something more than empty phrases."
"I trust you will bear this in mind."
"Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently discussing your Commission’s strategic orientations."
"I should therefore like to ask your Commission, perhaps in collaboration with the Council, to give a clear message, as soon as possible, to all citizens of the European Union as to what will happen if the European Constitution is not ratified in the next two years in one single country."
"I realise that the major political forces in this Parliament consider it to be just a matter of course that the European Constitution will be ratified in all twenty-five countries, but I can assure you that the reality is different in my country."
"I am not saying that the Constitution will not be ratified, but nobody there is looking it at as a forgone conclusion that it will be ratified."
"There is at present a sort of legal vacuum here, similar to when the initial proposals for the composition of your Commission was not ratified, and nobody is able to give a clear answer as to what will happen."
"It is being said that if the Constitution is not approved in the countries of the former fifteen the process will start again from the beginning."
"It is being said that if it is not approved in the new ten the same process as in Nice will be followed, namely the referendums will be repeated a year later in those countries."
"I do not think that the new countries are so inferior that there should be these two different outcomes, and I think that the citizens of the European Union deserve a clear answer as to what will happen if the European Constitution fails to go through in one single country."
"I should like to make one further point."
"At the present time, the adopted European Constitution also includes clearly established Financial Perspectives, drawn up by the European Commission for the period 2007-2013."
"I therefore consider it to be of the utmost importance that both the citizens and this Parliament should be given an answer as to what will happen if the European Constitution does not come into force."
"One of the chapters of the proposal for a decision put forth by the European People’s Party and European Democrats is about how to get Europe closer to its citizens."
"I firmly believe that establishing the Commission is in itself a step towards bringing European institutions closer to the citizens."
"The European Parliament is the only directly-elected body of the European Union, and with the election of the European Parliament and the establishment of the Commission, a clear and unequivocal direct link has been established for the first time in the sense that the parties with the most votes will have a more definite say in the Commission’s decisions on the issues that concern the citizens of Europe the most."
"According to the European People’s Party and European Democrats, there are three fundamentally important questions to be addressed by the new Commission over the next five years: competitiveness, cohesion and security, all of which have been mentioned by the President of our party."
"I believe that growth, the encouragement of small and medium-sized enterprises and consequently job growth, research and development are fundamental goals of Europe that promote the welfare of European citizens."
"As far as research and development are concerned, let me add that it is the European People’s Party’s determined policy to promote ethical research."
"As to security, I would like to point out to the President as well, that if we examine the question of security from the European citizens’ viewpoint, then crime, crime that crosses borders, illegal immigration and terrorism are indeed interrelated questions."
"It is by no means an accident that notions of freedom, security and justice are so strongly dependent on each other and from the citizens’ point of view they are downright inseparable."
"The third and perhaps most important task is cohesion, the creation of European unity."
"The newly-established European Commission inherited the pre-existing situation of an expanded Europe and if you are from one of the new Member States, you sometimes have the impression here in Parliament and also in other European institutions, that Europe, the European Union, has not fully realised the scale of its expansion yet."
"New opportunities for a united Europe need to be created, and further steps need to be taken to ensure the success of this enterprise, which is the greatest expansion of the European Union to date."
"This is not only in the vital interest of citizens from new Member States, but also in the interest of those from existing members."
"Therefore, cohesion policy must be improved and expansion must be consolidated."
"The expansion has only been completed from a legal point of view."
"There is still a lot to do on the social and economic front and the European Union must help new states catch up and provide the means to create unity within the European Union."
"With the expansion, the European Union has become a much more diverse place, but its problems have also become more diverse."
"These problems need to be solved and the new questions, such as minority rights, warrant adequate, joint European answers."
"I would like to emphasise the question of the Romany minority and all those that may be addressed with the help of the Commission, the cooperation of European institutions and by taking into account the opinion of the directly-elected members of Parliament."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, a moment ago, the President of our party, Mr Schulz, presented the vision and a list of practical proposals, and I should like today, as President of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament during your Presidency, to propose ten practical points to you."
"Firstly, and as you yourself said, Europe needs the Lisbon strategy to become a reality."
"It must be practical, and it must be focused."
"We propose to you a five-year programme in which Europe’s development of the Lisbon strategy is placed within a time frame as specific as the one devised when we duly created the internal market in 1992."
"Secondly, we need a new European multiannual growth strategy with stronger coordination of the national governments’ public investment programmes."
"By doing things simultaneously, we achieve a far greater impact."
"Thirdly, we need a Commission proposal that can strengthen companies’ social responsibility, especially in the light of outsourcing and the major problems involved in European conversion."
"Fourthly, we need to strengthen gender equality in the work place."
"Fifthly, we need to double the sustainable energy objectives for 2020 from 6 % to 12%."
"If we act single-mindedly, we can actually do this."
"Sixthly, we need the Commission’s programme genuinely to give higher priority to research, development and training within the financial estimates."
"Seventhly, we need a European Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"Eighthly, we need a charter for services of general interest that can establish the principles governing citizens’ rights in the modern welfare state."
"Ninthly, Mr Barroso, we need a list of common principles governing ‘best practice’ when it comes to the exchange of information about the integration of immigrants into our society."
"Tenthly, and finally, we need, as you yourself said, to show more solidarity."
"We need the Commission to present an ambitious plan to the European Council by June 2005 to increase EU aid to developing countries, a plan to ensure that, in 2009, we make an overall contribution of 0.5% of GDP and that we establish a ‘road map’ to achieve 0.7% in 2015."
"Mr Barroso, I have very quickly mentioned a number of the important points I believe are fundamental to the success of the Commission’s work."
"We need good speakers, but we also need practical action."
"When I listen to your contribution in this House today, I see that such ambition is present."
"We shall assess your work on the basis of the practical action taken."
"I look forward to sensible cooperation in people’s best interests."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is by no means easy to deliver an appreciation of the Commission’s strategic policy objectives in two and a half minutes, but, as we are in such festive spirits, I do have this to say on the subject."
"Let us imagine the Commission as Santa Claus and me as a little boy."
"I will have to give some more thought to the role to be played by the Council, and will leave you to imagine it as Rudolf or as Santa’s little helpers."
"I now have the difficult task of drawing up my wish list, and top of the list is that I, along with all other MEPs, should no longer be denied the right of codecision in matters of justice and home affairs."
"This is an important field for the EU, and one in which this House expects, from 2005, to be fully involved, for our European society is founded upon the rule of law, and every citizen allows himself to be guided by the standards set by the Community, believing as he does that these have been examined and approved by the majority of his legitimate representatives."
"My wish is that that belief should become reality."
"My second wish is that we should all play by the same rules – rules that we have made for ourselves."
"I think we can no longer tolerate the situation in which national governments, in love with their own grandeur, circumvent the institutions they created."
"When a handful of European interior ministers take decisions as a clique, they treat European democracy with contempt."
"Both Tampere and the Hague Programme are good examples of a Community approach that involves everyone."
"My wish is that we should press on with this open dialogue instead of forming ourselves into small clubs."
"My third wish is that due account be taken of the need for data protection."
"It is time that the third pillar included an instrument comparable to Directive 95/46/EC on data protection."
"I would like Commissioner Frattini to remember that he has indicated his agreement to this."
"My fourth wish – and my last for today – is that the European Union should face terrorism head-on, and that it should show that democracy also means the defence of democracy."
"The European Union must demonstrate that it is more than equal to those who seek to send freedom up in flames."
"A victory for terrorism means the destruction of free society, and that is something we must neither aid nor abet."
"I would like to see the Commission valuing and maintaining fundamental democratic principles, the freedom of the individual, and giving due weight to data protection."
"Most of the wish lists I have seen and heard so far are not as short as that, but for all those who wrote them they are expressions of hope."
"My hope is that what I want for Christmas will not be buried under a snowdrift thrown up by political aberrations."
"Mr President, I wish to make a plea on behalf of Europe's stateless nations."
"Like Mr Alvaro I was struck by our proximity to Christmas."
"All the good little boys and girls have drawn up their Christmas lists and instead of sending them to Lapland we are sending them to the Berlaymont."
"Mr Barroso, it is up to you to find out in January whether you have been Father Christmas or Scrooge."
"However, I hope you will make all our Christmases merry and bright."
"I refer to paragraph 3 in the Christmas list in the name of Mrs Frassoni and Mr Cohn-Bendit and the reference to the subsidiarity protocol, which is the biggest opportunity your Commission has to put meaning to the often empty phrases about subsidiarity and bringing Europe closer to the people."
"The subsidiarity protocol represents an opportunity for the Commission to do something brave and new."
"It is perfectly possible for the Commission to act as if the protocol were in force from this afternoon."
"Regardless of any decision on the Constitution itself, this Commission could act in a way totally unlike its predecessors and involve the relevant institution at the relevant time, regardless of whether or not it is a nation-state parliament."
"By way of example, until five years ago, my own country, Scotland, had no parliament."
"Now we have a parliament, a government and a civil service with near total power over health, education, justice, home affairs, the environment and many other areas."
"The only thing we do not control is money, which, as colleagues will be aware, is a subject close to any Scotsman's heart."
"However, we are bigger than Ireland and have more people than Denmark."
"The relevant institution for the Commission to deal with in Scotland is the European Parliament and the Scottish Parliament and yet our flag is not there."
"We are firmly in the second class when it comes to relations with Europe and yet we could contribute so much."
"I would urge you, Mr Barroso, to make our Christmas merry and bright and use your Commission and the subsidiarity protocol to put meaning to the phrases about subsidiarity, about bringing Europe home, because you will gain, we will gain and Europe will gain."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, the economic policy guidelines for the European Union’s strategy are laid down in the Constitutional Treaty."
"Let me cite three examples from Part III: Article 177/78, which lays down the principle of an open market economy with free competition;"
"The result of this is merciless competition to undercut in social terms, in environmental terms, and as regards protection in the workplace."
"Everything the Commission does is done according to the same blueprint; you ask for a navigation system, but you already have one, in the shape of the directive on services, the directive on ports, and the third railway package."
"If you really want advice as to how the European Commission should set its navigation system, then I can give you some in very brief terms: do it socially rather than taking a radically free-market approach!"
"Mr President, we are all taxpayers, and we all pay subscriptions to the EU."
"We are also all citizens with different views of the Constitution."
"According to both the EC Treaty and the Constitution, we are all equal before the law."
"Nonetheless, all the EU bodies now propose that we who are opposed to the Constitution should pay subsidies to those who are in favour of it."
"There are major hearings to which no opponents of the Constitution are invited."
"There are major subsidies to the European movement and to think-tanks that think alike, and now millions of euros for propaganda."
"It is undemocratic, improper, in conflict with the principle of equality and, therefore, illegal."
"I do not understand how the Commission’s clever Swedish Vice-President can put her name to a communications strategy that will impose a particular view of the Constitution upon people."
"The public authorities have just one task: to publish the draft Constitution and the alternative produced by the Convention, preferably in reader-friendly editions for every possible target group."
"Opinions should be left to a free press, the political organisations and parties, citizens’ initiatives and interested parties."
"States should not have opinions, and constitutions should have no specific political content."
"A state is a tool for all the citizens."
"A constitution should merely create ground rules for bringing the laws into being."
"It is up to the people to decide the political complexion of the laws, whether they are to be adopted in Brussels or by the national parliaments and whether they are good or bad."
"It is totalitarian to want to give the state a specific opinion and lock people into a specific policy."
"Mrs Wallström can scarcely sell that project to the electorate. She would do much better to stick to her own proposal, which is much more reminiscent of Grundtvig’s message of ‘freedom for Loki as well as for Thor’."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that one of the new Commission’s priorities ought to be to begin a constructive debate on the Stability Pact and possible reforms to it."
"Let us quickly clear away any misunderstandings."
"No one is intending – and the Commissioner responsible has done well in confirming this emphatically – to think up a reform to get around the Maastricht criteria."
"Rigour in complying with the Treaty and a commitment to a progressive reduction of deficits remain the objectives needed to make Europe economically credible and stable."
"I believe, however, that it is possible to have a debate on the operational criteria for achieving the objective of deficit reduction, and to think not so much in terms of a reform as of a transformation of the Pact, one that can reconcile budget rigour and flexibility in order to give renewed impetus to growth, development, employment and, finally, the Lisbon strategy."
"The Italian Government has done its thinking, and has not gone unheard."
"Faced with considerable concerns over the excessively high rate of the euro and the loss of Europe’s competitiveness compared with the United States and emerging countries, the proposal could be to remove investments in infrastructure and research from the calculation of national budgets."
"In simple terms, this means introducing the golden rule to achieve the goal of budgetary consolidation without compromising the recovery."
"In conclusion, the Pact can no longer content itself with being merely a pact for stability, and unfortunately also a pact for economic stagnation, but must become a pact for competitiveness, for structural reform and, above all, a pact to guarantee a future for our children."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Mr President of the Commission, you have a very important role and ultimately, as this discussion shows, it is difficult to build but easy to criticise."
"I assure you that the debate following the introduction of your programme will be far more dramatic than todays, when it is our task to present to you our aims and our dreams."
"First and foremost, I would urge you to address the future in your programmes, by which I mean concern for the next generation, for young people and education."
"I would also urge you to give priority to the past and show concern for the generation which is ageing, concern for older people."
"The first experimental and very clear aim will be the Constitutional Agreement mentioned by my colleague, Mrs Bobošíková."
"I am convinced that you will be able to assure the European Community that this is a modern document which simplifies all the previous historically outmoded rules of the game."
"For the first time, you are President of the Commission of the enlarged Community."
"I would ask you to make use of the potential offered by the ten new Member States in the shape of their Commissioners so that you too can tear down that virtual frontier that exists between the old and the new Europe."
"A momentous period lies ahead of you; the fulfilment of your aims, the fulfilment of the trust we placed in you when we voted for you, but, of course, this also applies to us as our assistance will be required in all of this."
"I cannot speak for all the Members, but I can say that those of us who are here for Slovakia and for my political party are always ready to engage in constructive discussion and to participate in your programme."
"I will vote for it and I assure you that I will monitor the area of healthcare very closely and carefully."
"The free movement of people is nothing more than an empty phrase if it is not accompanied by matching health cover provision."
"I will keep my fingers crossed for you, Mr President, and I believe that in January you will succeed in putting together a programme that is in line with our goals."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, the strategic policy should mainly be focused on big issues."
"Tinkering with small matters eats away at both the Commission’s and Parliament’s credibility."
"One important area of focus with regard to policy is, unquestionably, security."
"We need to tackle the issue of security as a broad concept, like peace in Europe or peace in the world."
"More than anything, however, we need to tackle the issue of security at the level of the individual."
"Our citizens must feel that their lives and living conditions are safe."
"Another important area of focus is something that is often mentioned here: competitiveness."
"In this respect, the Lisbon strategy is of key importance."
"The President of the Commission presented a list of tasks in connection with Lisbon and it must actually be implemented; it cannot be allowed to remain just a ‘wish list’."
"An essential ingredient in competitiveness is our need to create conditions that spawn new companies in Europe, which in turn generate new jobs."
"These we need in order to achieve vital economic growth."
"A stable, healthy and growing economy nevertheless requires instruments such as the Stability and Growth Pact."
"We must fearlessly adhere to that at all costs, and all countries should comply with it, both big and small."
"Finally, I would like to refer back to yesterday’s debate on Turkey."
"If enlargement comes about too quickly, it might lessen our chances of achieving the results we want to see in the economy and with regard to security."
"This in turn would increase public opposition to the EU."
"Enlargement should therefore proceed at a sensible, controlled pace."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, a great discrepancy is becoming apparent in Europe, and we all have to deal with it, although it is of course the Commission that has to do something about making it less glaring."
"On the one hand, the European Union appeals to the outside world – consider Ukraine, the Southern Caucasus, Turkey, to which reference has just been made, but also the migration that is going on, the fact that Europe is a destination for all, or many, states or individuals."
"On the other hand, we find ill-feeling, disappointment, and a bad atmosphere in Europe itself."
"In many cases, it will be for the Vice-President of the Commission and her public relations work to deal with that, but the Commission as a whole, along with Parliament, must work at resolving this contradiction."
"This does of course tie in with what previous speakers have already mentioned, namely the fact that many members of the public believe that nothing positive is being done about reinforcing and modernising the European model – which is what we wanted to express in the resolution on which we will be voting – but rather that it is being dismantled."
"Whether that actually is the case, I do not propose to consider, but people feel that social rights are being reduced, that social options are being cut back, and that there are also not enough jobs for people to earn enough money and amass sufficient financial resources to keep themselves and their families."
"I believe that the public’s perception that the social model or the European model are in danger imperils the European Union as a whole."
"Even where it is globalisation or new forms of competition, which actually have no direct connection with the European Union, that are bringing this situation about, and threatening people’s living conditions, it is often the European Union that is blamed, and that is why we must do everything in our power to really make a success of Lisbon, so that the people can identify with the European model."
"We are not dealing here with abstract concepts, but with things that are very real."
"As reference has already been made to the Services Directive, let me say that I think that it, in the form in which it has been presented, may well be an example of how ordinary people can come to believe what they do."
"A lot of people are afraid not only that their social rights or their rights as employees are now being eroded, but also that the same thing is happening to their rights as consumers, quite simply because the principle has gained acceptance that, in future, the lowest consumer standards should prevail and become normative across Europe instead of higher, or perhaps even the highest, consumer standards."
"So, even though it is now for us to work on it, I ask you too to consider whether a different approach might be taken in future, one using something other than the principles contained in the Services Directive."
"Let me say, by way of a final comment, that we all agree on the need to reduce bureaucracy and over-regulation, but, if you will just take a look at the legal opinions on how the Services Directive is to be interpreted, you will see that to say so amounts to mere pious platitudes and that the reality is rather different."
"That being so, Mr Barroso, I urge you and your Commission to get back to supporting and reinforcing the European model of social and economic policy."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, my group expects the Commission to do at least as well as its predecessors in terms of external and security policy."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Mandelson are faced with the difficult task of continuing the policy of Mr Patten and Mr Lamy while maintaining the good rapport with Mr Solana as before."
"We expect Commissioner Michel to breathe new life into the Union’s development policy."
"Coherence will be of the essence in order to lend the European Union the same weight in world politics as it has in the global economy."
"We expect the Commission to prepare and guide the accessions that are in the pipeline, including that of Turkey, and to adopt a policy of in-depth work with our new neighbours."
"Those are all fairly traditional complaints, but we expect more from you."
"We expect you to become much more active in the Middle East, and to enter into fully-fledged dialogue with the United States on an equal footing."
"We expect you to further shape the Africa policy without losing sight of promoting democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"We also expect the Commission to continue the policy of Mr Lamy and Mr Fischler in terms of world trade."
"Indeed, the Union’s efforts are absolutely essential to enhance the Doha development agenda."
"Last, but not least, we expect the Commission to promote multilateralism in order to contribute to a more balanced, and thus, safer world."
"– Mr President, the programme statements by the new Commission may not be admissible in evidence, but they were submitted."
"The faster implementation of the Lisbon strategy, with increased working hours and times, reduced wages, pensions and unemployment benefits, specialisation in part-time and temporary work, the abolition of collective agreements and privatisation in the health, education and welfare sectors will bring more profit for capital and more poverty and unemployment for workers."
"The so-called 'European Constitution' and the Hague programme will result in the further militarisation of Europe, with the development of arms programmes and massacre of the individual and collective rights and freedoms of the peoples on the pretext of terrorism."
"It is a policy of new privileges and power for the European monopolies."
"The financing of the occupying government and cooperation with the conquerors of Iraq will be to the detriment of peace and of the Iraqi resistance, while negotiations with the WTO guarantee that new hordes will join the unemployed and small and medium-sized farm holdings will be wiped out."
"The peoples of Europe should be concerned and, at the same time, should step up their fight."
"Their fight can raise obstacles."
"We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece shall fight with them in order to put a stop to the new anti-grass roots tempest which is building up."
"Mr President, the European Parliament is today debating the Commission’s strategic and political goals, and the memory of the recent confrontation between these European institutions is still fresh."
"In many different ways, this House is reminding President Barroso of the fact that, under pressure from the European Parliament, he has made far-reaching promises at times."
"I should particularly like to draw your attention to one of those pledges, namely his promise to commit himself actively to the protection and promotion of basic rights, equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination."
"We take the view that the Commission should shape this policy in such a way that the European Union does not redraw ethical boundaries."
"The fight against discrimination should not result in the squeezing out of biblically-founded views about marriage and the view that life is worth protecting."
"Secondly, I should like to ask the new Commission to hold back as regards the ratification of the European Constitution."
"This ratification is, and will continue to be, a matter for the national states."
"The Commission should keep well away from a unilateral campaign in favour of the European Constitution."
"Needless to say, the Commission’s contribution to boost turnout at national referendums should also benefit those voting against it."
"In a real democracy, they too should be taken entirely seriously."
"Mr President, if we talk about the EU’s strategic and political guidelines, we will inevitably end up talking about Turkey."
"Even though Parliament, the Commission and the Council have failed to even make a start on a debate about Europe’s boundaries, accession negotiations will almost certainly be opened with Turkey, a non-European country, and one which, by the time it actually accedes, will have more than 80 million inhabitants."
"What fine strategic thinking that is!"
"We are still in the dark as to how much this accession will cost, never mind will be footing the bill."
"It is a telling fact that a country such as the United Kingdom should be backing Turkey’s accession all the way, while at the same time refusing to budge on its rebate."
"The same is also true, in fact, of a number of other net contributors."
"Substantial research has still not been done into the effects of immigration from Turkey."
"The EU is becoming ever more estranged from its people."
"We are told that we must bring Europe closer to the citizen, but when push comes to shove, nothing is done."
"The Turkey issue is a perfect illustration of this."
"It is a perfect opportunity to ask the public for their opinion, and yet it is unlikely that a referendum will be held in any of the Member States."
"Commissioner Michel explained why that was when he was still Foreign Affairs Minister in Belgium."
"He said that a referendum about an issue of this kind would open a debate with vicious arguments about Islam, among other things, which would only play into the hands of Right-wing parties."
"According to him, our western democracies would not have the wherewithal to control and frame a public debate on subjects of that kind."
"This anti-democratic creed is quite simply perplexing."
"We should in any event thank Mr Michel for his frankness."
"He has stated out loud what many of his fellow Commissioners are thinking privately."
"Europe has a serious problem where its democratic legitimacy, and its being held accountable, are concerned, and there looks to be no sign of improvement in the near future – quite the reverse, in fact."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Commission has already given this Parliament proof of his determination and enthusiasm by taking on the leadership of the European Union’s executive body on a ticket of reforming practices, policies and procedures."
"I hope, Mr President, that the Commission as a whole will succeed in finding what those who enter the life of an institution with energy and a desire for reform always have the greatest difficulty in finding: the right distance between realism and utopia."
"It is the search for that constant balance – which some call common sense – that for the last fifty years has enabled Europe to develop the social model that is the driving force behind Europe’s identity."
"The essential components of the model have been peace, prosperity and the convergence of cultures, and it has proved to be a winning model."
"Today, however, we are faced with a reality in which there have recently appeared a number of hitherto unknown aspects: a worrying demographic situation together with unprecedented technological evolution, one of the principal factors to have consolidated the phenomenon that has made the world a smaller place: globalisation."
"In these circumstances, for Europe to remain an area that lives up to the winning model, we must wholeheartedly accept the inevitability of carrying out reforms that will first and foremost enhance our competitiveness."
"That means the opening-up of markets, increased productivity, more and better research, more innovation and greater investment in people and ideas."
"The reforms that Europe needs must not, however, be seen as a task for the Commission alone."
"In my view, the most critical point in the period of reform that is now beginning is rather the commitment of the Member States and their willingness to take risks in putting these reforms into practice."
"Only with strong commitment from the Member States can the most dynamic sectors of society and the middle-tier authorities be encouraged to take part; without their participation no reform will be possible."
"This is also an area in which I believe Parliament should take action."
"Mr President, in the introduction to your speech, Mr President of the Commission, you said that it was important to demonstrate that Europe could make a difference."
"We share this aim, in particular as regards growth and employment, and, in order to restore confidence among the citizens of the European Union, the Union must clearly demonstrate its capacity to revive our economy."
"The debate will, of course, revolve around the strategy and the means for restoring our competitiveness."
"When you present your proposals in January, our group will be listening particularly attentively to your Commission’s choice of economic strategy."
"In this context, a number of speeches have referred to a link between the economic dimension, the social dimension and the environment, which is, I believe, no more than rhetoric and masks a real difference in approach."
"In our view, it is the Lisbon strategy that represents the path to follow."
"You mentioned the objective of a competitive, knowledge-based economy and we go along with that."
"We believe that, in choosing an economic strategy, we are choosing a social model and if we choose an economic strategy that is only based on liberalisation, this will be at the expense of the social model."
"We do not subscribe to the idea that the social aspect will simply follow on later."
"I shall naturally refer to the example of the directive on services."
"If the price to be paid for developing the internal market in services is that our social services – our health services – are to be deregulated, that a number of services of general interest are to be put at risk and that employment law is under threat as a result of the country of origin rule, then I do not believe the return of competitiveness will in itself allow us to retain elements of the European social model."
"The Clinton years in the United States showed that it is possible to have economic growth rightly based on investment in the knowledge economy and in new technologies, but without pulling the social model up with it, since the President did not, at that time, have a majority in Congress or political support for the implementation of a social policy that would provide for such a balance."
"We believe, on the contrary, that investment in social aspects, investment in public services and infrastructure and high environmental standards can be factors of production and competitiveness and can contribute towards success in international competition from the European Union’s point of view."
"We are therefore serious about this interdependence of the economy, social aspects and the environment."
"We could give examples of this and we shall do so in the dialogue with you in January."
"The need to increase the employment rate and the rate of labour participation will accordingly be among the subjects raised."
"Let us look at the sections of society worst affected."
"Women constitute one such category. It is in those countries that have invested in public amenities, such as crèches and in training that the employment rate among women tends to be higher. ."
"We could also mention other vulnerable sections of society, such as the many children from disadvantaged, in particular immigrant, backgrounds, who not only face racism and discrimination but also suffer from gaps in their education."
"What must also be borne in mind is the need to reduce frictional unemployment and the fact that there have been a number of successes, for example in the Scandinavian countries, achieved thanks to investment in training."
"I also believe that you will have to prove that you are capable of improving the quality of social dialogue, which will ensure greater involvement among employees in their companies’ development."
"Against this backdrop, we also await an initiative with regard to the revision of the directive on European works councils, which is now experiencing enormous delays compared to the other directives on information and consultation."
"Mr President, I am sorry to supplement Mr Barroso's catalogue of strategic priorities – which has already grown during the debate – but I hope that the Commission will focus upon the necessity of preventing a collapse in the transatlantic partnership."
"There is currently a dangerous and unprecedented American reaction to European integration."
"Europe and America diverge on a clutch of important questions: trade; science; fundamental rights; climate change; monetary policy; competition policy; foreign, security and defence policy and the Constitution."
"It is a priority for us all that the Constitution should enter into force."
"We have to fight for it across the Atlantic as well as within our Member States."
"It falls to the Commission to state clearly what the Constitution says, why it says it, and what the outcome will be if it is not brought into force."
"It is surely a perfectly sensible question for the citizen to ask 'What happens if I vote no?'."
"We need some serious answers to that question."
"The Commission should not fight shy of offending some of our governments that have sought refuge in plebiscites but are failing to show any signs of wanting to make an effort to win them."
"The public should be informed of the sheer folly of rejecting the Constitution and of what the outcome would be for an enfeebled European Union."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in adopting the Lisbon strategy one of the objectives that Europe set itself was the ambitious goal of becoming the most advanced knowledge society in the world."
"Such an objective cannot, however, be achieved without giving renewed impetus to basic research and innovation which, in turn, makes it necessary to put greater resources into facilities, infrastructure and European centres of excellence and to target the improvement of human capital by bringing in thousands of young researchers."
"This step change necessitates a rise in research investment to 3 per cent, at the level both of individual Member States and of the European Union as a whole."
"The Prodi Commission’s proposal aimed at an expenditure ceiling of 1.24 per cent of gross national income, but some major EU countries have already publicly set a maximum limit of 1 per cent."
"Such a severe restriction of Community financial resources is likely to have the concrete result of penalising many high-priority policies, including the cohesion policy, the rural development policy and the funding of training and research programmes, to which development policies are increasingly closely linked."
"With such a reduced budget it would truly be wishful thinking to go on talking of a renewed impetus in research in Europe and of becoming the most advanced society."
"Mr President, I am delighted that Mr Barroso wishes to be informed of the views held by this House on the work of the Commission."
"I shall now make my comments."
"Not a single European Union competence has been devolved to the Member States since the principle of subsidiarity was announced."
"It is high time we took subsidiarity seriously, and took the Member States seriously too."
"It is time to recognise that Member States must not be dictated to over issues they are very well able to settle for themselves."
"Indeed, excessive regulation is the next issue I would like to mention."
"We must stop regulating everything."
"That is the socialist approach, and socialism has been proven to fail people."
"The Member States need to regain their freedom."
"My third comment is that the worst type of regulation is to be found in the common agricultural policy, which should be done away with."
"It is unfair to poorer Member States, especially to countries that were previously part of the Soviet bloc."
"There is one notable exception to this rule, however."
"The former German Democratic Republic, or East Germany, received the same treatment as members of the old Fifteen from the moment it joined the Union."
"Unequal treatment of this kind must cease."
"Why should a Polish farmer receive worse treatment that one in the former East Germany?"
"The common agricultural policy is also unfair to poor countries outside the Union, and it should simply be dispensed with."
"Farmers within and without the Union should be granted freedom and equality."
"My last comment concerns the approaching referendums on the Constitution."
"Care must be taken to ensure that they are democratic, and that both supporters and opponents of the Constitution enjoy equal rights and equal access to the public media."
"It is all well and good to support democracy in Ukraine, Iraq and Palestine, but first and foremost we must nurture it amongst ourselves."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I have six ideas to put to you."
"Firstly, give back the people of Europe their confidence in a Europe of peace, freedom and justice."
"What do I mean by that?"
"I mean that everyone should have to abide by common rules, that all must obey the Treaties, that all must implement decisions, that the Commission must avail itself more of its right of initiative and must monitor more."
"The rules are sufficient, but there is a lack of political will and determination."
"Words such as ‘infringement proceedings’, ‘Stability and Growth Pact’, ‘Lisbon’ and ‘Barcelona’ spring to mind."
"Mr President of the Commission, I urge you to withdraw Commissioner Almunia’s proposal on the Stability and Growth Pact, which weakens the Commission and Community law."
"The common rules need to be reinforced."
"Secondly, do not let what you do be influenced by those who break the rules, but take initiatives to do away with unanimity in the Council, so that your success or failure is not determined by those who block progress."
"Thirdly, make Europe more competitive in line with Lisbon and Barcelona, and take initiatives to remove from the internal market all barriers, blockages and distortions of competition."
"We need a stronger Commission, we need more Europe, and we need more initiatives from the Commission."
"Fourthly, let us not just train researchers, but also let them carry out research into things that are usable!"
"Fifthly, make Europe more secure and stronger on the world stage, with the common foreign and security policy, the common defence policy, a common asylum and immigration policy, and a stronger United Nations."
"What we need is not for Germany to have the right of veto in the Security Council, but for the European Union to be a permanent member of it."
"The sixth thing I urge is that we should make informed participants of the people of Europe."
"There is not enough European consciousness in the Member States, which use a double strategy to weaken it."
"Let us make it impossible to shift the blame on to the EU; this will involve you, Mr President of the Commission, putting a European information and communication strategy on the table after every summit, so that what you have achieved cannot be claimed by the nation states."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to make a few observations about external policy."
"I have no doubt that we will have many meetings discussing the EU’s external policy and security policy in the coming years."
"In my view, the Commission, and also its President, play a major role in controlling policy cohesion and must ensure that the Commission’s tasks and the Council’s responsibilities are coordinated effectively."
"What is important in this is, of course, the correct use of all instruments which the European Union has at its disposal."
"To date, we relied on the excellent relationship between Commissioner Patten and High Representative Solana."
"However, we are now heading for a slightly different scenario, one that has been provided for in the Constitution."
"What we mainly expect, and ask, from the Commission is, pending the adoption and ratification of the Constitution, is that it should continue to work in the same spirit and now to look for a model of integration in which the scope of the different pillars, namely the first, second and third pillars, can be combined."
"The second point that is of importance to us is the EU’s commitment to promoting effective multilateralism."
"This has to do with the Commission’s contribution to the EU’s international relations."
"We would also like the Commission to devote much of its attention to fleshing out the civilian aspects of the EU’s security policy;"
"I should also like the Commission to return to pledges it has made in the past with regard to reinforcing the EU’s action in conflict prevention."
"Furthermore, I think it is important to enter into a debate with the United States about the UN’s future."
"That is a very topical issue, in respect of which the Commission can be expected to make an active contribution."
"That should be a new element in the transatlantic dialogue."
"As far as we are concerned, making the world more democratic – starting with Europe, of course – is the leitmotif."
"I can be brief about the third point."
"The EU’s enlargement and the Commission’s commitment to negotiations with Turkey, which we discussed this week, will be important tasks in the years to come."
"The fourth point concerns the relationship with Russia, a resolution on which will be adopted this week."
"How can we develop the relationship with that country along twin tracks, on the one hand, economic cooperation and working on common energy policy, and on the other hand, an open debate about values, democracy and the developments in Russia in this area?"
"In our view, a lively debate about the relationship between the EU and Russia is inevitable, as well as a discussion about the neighbours we have in common, which should touch on Russia, Moldova, the Caucasus and Ukraine."
"I should like to end with a remark in connection with the new neighbours."
"We believe that the people in Ukraine have sent out a clear message."
"What will be the EU’s response after the third round of the presidential elections?"
"We see the new neighbourhood policy, in its current set-up, is an inadequate match for what is developing over there."
"I think that the EU’s action plans, in the framework of the new neighbourhood policy, must be linked more closely to the European aspirations that were very prominent in Ukraine."
"I think that that requires a fresh debate in Parliament."
"In short, with regard to the new neighbours, there is a need for a more comprehensive concept, a European ."
"Mr President, behind us we have an historic enlargement and the first elections to the European Parliament following this enlargement."
"It is reasonable for the Commission’s main emphases to reflect the message that has emerged in connection with these events."
"I therefore want the guidelines to send out a clear political signal worthy of the unique situation in which Europe finds itself."
"We have promised that the divided Europe will grow together."
"The most important emphasis should therefore be to bridge the gulf."
"Differences in health must be evened out."
"We want companies that operate across the borders and even out the economic differences."
"In order to achieve that, we must fully exploit the opportunities provided by structural and research policy."
"The Baltic must become the world’s cleanest sea, meaning that there must be an end to the emissions from Saint Petersburg."
"We want a top quality, dynamic research society in the Baltic Sea region, and there are surely corresponding expectations further south."
"We must construct a legal area in which everyone feels protected by law, irrespective of where they are in the area of the EU."
"Finally, we need a consistent and vigorous policy towards the EU’s Eastern neighbours too."
"The crisis in Ukraine has revealed the weaknesses in our neighbourhood policy."
"The EU must also tighten up its strategy and be consistent in its policy towards the countries of the Caucasus, Moldova and Russia."
"These are precisely the issues also touched upon by Mr Wiersma."
"It is easy for me to concur with Commission President Barroso’s words in the French part of his speech: [we must set priorities for the whole of Europe]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on other occasions I have already indicated that we should realise that a certain approach to the European project has now reached a very difficult social and political crisis point."
"While the updating of the Lisbon strategy is being debated, however, concrete choices are being made which can indicate a move in a particular direction."
"On this point, I would like to mention two actual examples."
"The first example is a proposal for a directive, the so-called Bolkestein directive, which in our opinion ought to be rejected."
"It is an outright collection of negative contents mixed up together, which would lead to an outright jungle where the fundamental rights of workers and citizens to high-quality services would be simultaneously violated, and it is therefore quite rightly opposed by the trade unions and by a wide range of social partners; we call for its withdrawal."
"The second example is the proposal for the REACH regulation, designed to reform our chemical industry in terms of quality and health and safety, and we strongly call for it to be adopted speedily."
"These are two concrete choices which demonstrate two different conceptions of Europe."
"Mr President, this debate is about strategic priorities."
"As coordinator for my Group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I want to focus on one crucial priority: the internal market."
"I want to say in response to previous remarks – it is a pity that some speakers have already left – that the Commissioner's support for the Internal Market Services Directive is very welcome because it is a fundamental part of completing the internal market."
"Sixty percent of the European economy is taken up by services and we have a complete network of anti-competitive restrictions among the Member States."
"Mr Barroso, do not withdraw the directive: make it better."
"I am afraid to say that some of my colleagues are still living in the past and calling it the 'Bolkestein Directive'."
"I hope, first of all, that they might move with the times and consider calling it the 'McCreevy Directive', but maybe with your endorsement it could become the 'Barroso Directive'."
"Who knows?"
"I want to make a second important point about internal market strategy."
"We have to make the rest of the internal market work better for consumers and businesses."
"Aside from the Internal Market Services Directive, we do not want a lot more legislation during your Commission in the internal market area."
"What we want you to do is to put some serious enforcement and simplification behind the existing internal market directives."
"On the ground, businesses find many of the European directives much too complicated; in many cases there are inconsistencies between them."
"The objectives on the environment and social policy are, in many cases, not being delivered and yet we have the costs and inconsistencies that go with them."
"Consumers are concerned that they are not getting their full rights in terms of availability of products, common prices, or access to justice if they have problems in a cross-border world."
"I hope that the theme of your strategy on the internal market will be that consumers and enterprises will get a better deal from the internal market and you will bring in provisions during your term of office to make sure that we really achieve that essential goal."
"Mr President of the Commission, you expressed a personal vision nearly six months ago when we first heard you speak here in Strasbourg."
"Since then your personal vision has expanded and been restructured; as you are also the head of the government of Europe, your goals will be jointly determined and we will also comment on these goals and their execution from a different perspective."
"Let me refer to your first address to us, when you made the promise that parallel processes will enhance each other in your politics."
"You promised a sort of Euclidean political organisational work where parallel values do not cross over and extinguish each other, although it is a great challenge."
"Let me refer to two examples that have been brought up several times during today’s debate."
"Lisbon promises a Europe of competitiveness, growth and employment."
"I would like to highlight my colleagues’ comments: competitiveness, growth and an increase in employment cannot conflict with the interest and value of social acceptance."
"It must be emphasised again and again that social acceptance represents European solidarity only if it is able to cross state boundaries and is able to create solidarity within all of the united Europe, as well as between states, in order to help weak and vulnerable countries to rise and catch up."
"In order for this to be achieved, complex programmes are needed that help those who fall outside our field of vision (as well as those who will not make it to the job market) and that are able to rehabilitate human resources and its environment at the same time."
"We need complex programmes that will make job market opportunities equal between the existing and the new Member States."
"The second great set of tasks is to exercise the powers of freedom security as well as security justice."
"There is no such thing as freedom security, or security justice."
"Martin Schulz indicated, and I have also heard from the mouth of a high-ranking European official, that refugees to the European Union bring with them the danger of terrorism."
"I hope that you reject this opinion."
"It is also unacceptable to regard different cultural backgrounds or Non-Christian religious views as a basis for any sort of suspicion."
"Specific legal measures are called for against discrimination and I am asking you to remember your promise of personal commitment and organisational work in order for the appropriate legal measures to be taken."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the strategic planning guidelines must also cover the area of the common agricultural policy, for the Luxemburg Council decisions also apply to this area."
"A comprehensive reform of the common agricultural policy was decided on in June 2003, and this reform, which has yet to be implemented in some Member States, has brought with it profound change; it has resulted in many discussions and much insecurity and continues to do so."
"The next big step that is due will be the reform of the sugar market regime, but after that there must again be some inactivity; without that, we will not be able to offer our farmers the security to plan ahead."
"This must also be clearly stated in the strategic planning."
"Agriculture needs periods with which it can calculate, and policy must also offer a degree of certainty if it is to have any credibility."
"As regards the Financial Perspective for 2010 to 2013, Mr President of the Commission, we have to be clear in our own minds about what we want from this Europe of ours."
"An enlarged Europe makes a balanced cohesion and structural policy more important than ever as a means of counteracting structural differences."
"The forthcoming rural development has to do with the overall funding of the second pillar and hence with the maintenance of active and attractive rural areas, which cannot exist without working farmers."
"So it is that modulation is the source of some of the money for the second pillar."
"We are also concerned about our regions, their villages and towns."
"Europe needs clear objectives and strategies."
"The public also expect us to offer practical solutions to the thorny questions relating to immigration, asylum and security."
"When all these issues have been addressed, we will also have to budget for them."
"To do otherwise would be scarcely credible and will not bring us any closer to the peoples of Europe."
"Mr President, we in the Socialist Group have ambitions in the field of development cooperation and humanitarian action which we will try to include in Parliament’s recommendations to the Commission and its President."
"The impetus we are calling for from the Union is enshrined in the European Constitution and it is very encouraging that here, and in other areas, the philosophy and the budgets of the Constitution are being applied even before it is ratified."
"The Socialists’ main contribution to the process of European integration was to introduce solidarity as one of the fundamental pillars of our project, solidarity not just as a great moral and political value, but also as a guarantee of peace, stability and prosperity for Europe."
"In a manner that demonstrates considerable coherence, we have managed to update that principle in the Constitution, translating it to the reality of a globalised world."
"In these new circumstances, intra-European solidarity is no longer enough, at least for the Socialists."
"We can no longer be content with a solidarity which is restricted to the territories and citizens of the Union."
"Rather, that solidarity must also be the European Union’s distinguishing mark on the international stage, in particular solidarity with peoples who are combating underdevelopment, for the sake of their dignity and prosperity."
"Our solidarity, within the new context of globalisation, must, therefore, guide the European Union’s actions in the world, but it must also be applied horizontally to all Community policies."
"Fundamental priorities for the Commission will be to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Objectives, with particular emphasis on the eradication of poverty and hunger, taking action both in the least-developed countries and in the least-favoured pockets of population in the more developed countries."
"Combating AIDS and other diseases linked to poverty and underdevelopment, such as malaria and tuberculosis, must also be our priorities, as well as the promotion of women in the countries with which we cooperate with a view to ensuring their development and dialogue between civilisations, implemented by the President of the Spanish Government."
"Throughout this field, the Commission will have a great responsibility in terms of promoting and coordinating its action with that of the Member States of the Union, with a view to ensuring complementarity and consistency, particularly in terms of our presence and influence in the development agencies of the United Nations."
"In order to achieve all of this, it will be essential to maintain, and even to increase, the funding of our development and humanitarian action policies, fulfilling the commitments and the timetable we established in Barcelona and Monterrey, and not simply be content with that, but set increasingly ambitious goals."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the incoming Commission is starting its work at a moment that is bound to go on record as a turning point in the history of the Union."
"A number of important issues have coincided;"
"I refer to the preliminary assessment of the most recent enlargement, preparations for subsequent enlargements, including the complex debate on Turkish membership, the initial assessment of actions ensuing from the Lisbon strategy, and preparatory work for the new Financial Perspective for 2007-2013."
"The new Commission will have to decide on the strategic actions it considers most important with a view to achieving the both the aims laid down in the Treaties and those thrust upon us by current circumstances in the Union and neighbouring areas."
"This is an issue of great importance for the European Parliament and also for national parliaments."
"Clearly, Member States are at different levels of economic development."
"In the interests of all Members of the Union it is therefore essential to take all necessary action to reduce such differences, which will facilitate development of the Union as a whole."
"For many years now, an active cohesion policy has been instrumental in the reduction of development differences, and has been accompanied by deepening economic integration and the entry of new Member States, which are rated relatively poorly in terms of development indicators."
"This situation emphasises the appropriateness and validity of the provisions of the Treaties, in which it is laid down that one of the Union’s key aims is attaining social and economic cohesion."
"It is also recognised in the Treaties that cohesion policy is one of the Union’s main policies."
"In addition, cohesion policy is not perceived as a short-term policy in response to the current situation, but a permanent and inviolable feature of Community action."
"All the experience gained to date indicates that cohesion policy is as important as ever, and this has been confirmed by successive Commission reports."
"It is also apparent that, although cohesion policy requires significant financial resources, what it requires above all else is for those charged with implementing policies to show the necessary will and determination."
"In conclusion, and speaking also on behalf of many Members of this House, I should like to say that we are confident the new Commission will live up to expectations."
"We trust it will not start from the false premise that it needs to choose between cohesion policy and growth policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have two clear objectives."
"They are the European economic and social model which we advocate, and developing the area of freedom, security and justice."
"For all this to be achieved, principles of sustainable development need to be applied."
"According to the Lisbon strategy, however, competitiveness cannot come about if the Member States do not start to implement decisions effectively."
"Within the Union a sort of non-solidarity movement has developed, led by those countries that are slow to implement decisions."
"This is conspicuous, for example, in the telecommunications and energy sectors."
"The Commission should intervene here swiftly, as it is costing us billions."
"What is sustainable development?"
"Is it environmental, social or intellectual development?"
"It is obviously all of these, but particularly intellectual."
"If the basic education system of our countries fails, there will not be sustainable development."
"In my own country, 15% of teenage boys have dropped out of school."
"The link between school and home is no longer viable, despite the fact that for years my country has been the best in the whole world in the field of basic education."
"What are we doing in Europe?"
"The result will be a Europe of ageing and poorly educated people."
"What sort of sustainable development is that?"
"We have to invest in research and product development."
"A 3% ceiling is unachievable, except in two countries."
"Take a look at all the statistics."
"The countries that have achieved this top all the available statistics."
"That gives us a good example of what should be done."
"This is the century of revolution within the fields of information and technology."
"Since the mid-1990s, 40% of our competitiveness has been based on new technology, and in the United States the figure is 60%."
"We can only gain from this."
"I would urge Mr Barroso and the Commission to take advantage of this; otherwise we will be trampled on by others."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, to answer the question as to what has to be done over the next five years, I would like to make just three points."
"The first is that our great task in the aftermath of 1 May 2004 is to stabilise the process of European integration."
"We must not overstretch ourselves by now accepting too many new Member States into the European Union; instead, we must join together with our ten new Member States in consolidating what we have achieved, for they want this and are willing to actively contribute to it."
"Secondly, we have to make the European Union more competitive, and there is much that has to take second place to that."
"Let me take this opportunity to put the very straightforward question – and I am glad that the Vice-President is here – as to whether it makes sense to use the REACH project to enhance the competitiveness of industries outside the European Union, while ushering in a programme of deindustrialisation at home?"
"I would like to back up Mrs Schierhuber in what she said about the sugar market regime. Is there any sense in our allowing into the European Union sugar produced in Brazil with disregard for the environment and for human life, while at the same time making life difficult for our countryside with more and more impositions?"
"Does that make the European Union more competitive?"
"Such are the questions that the Commission will have to answer over the next five years."
"The third issue is this. We need to create confidence in the euro."
"This is something we can do together."
"People have followed this single currency project with no more than a critical eye."
"Our task must be to create the favourable prospects that this young currency deserves."
"In practical terms, that means that the Stability Pact must not, of course, be called into question, nor must it be subject to intelligent interpretation; instead, Europe will not be able to produce a lasting solution to the problems of a constantly ageing population and the diminishing options for the young unless all the Member States find a way out of the debt trap."
"In doing that, the Stability Pact has a highly disciplinary effect; it must not be abandoned, but defended."
"– Mr President of the Commission, the programme which the Commission will present for the next five years must have as its basic objective sustainable development, full employment and economic and social cohesion."
"The citizens of Europe expect specific policies which will create new jobs and really improve their standard of living."
"It is a question of the credibility of Europe that the necessary and adequate financing be safeguarded in order to implement these policies."
"The Commission's stand on the question of the financial perspectives must be firmly based on the Prodi proposals and we expect a commitment from you here."
"The policy on the competitiveness of the European economy has as its precondition the simultaneous strengthening of cohesion, solidarity and social Europe."
"Priority also needs to be given to education, training, innovation and research and technology and equal importance also needs to be attached to upgrading services and infrastructures in the regions of Europe."
"We expect specific commitments and specific proposals from the European Commission in this direction when it presents its programme next January."
"Mr President, at the start of this debate Mr Poettering referred to a resolution from the PPE-DE Group."
"This is an excellent paper and I commend it to you, Mr Barroso."
"Its priority is your priority: to make Europe more competitive and prosperous."
"It recognises that this can only be done by economic reform and, as part of the reform programme, it calls upon the Commission to offer stronger leadership to make labour markets more flexible."
"This does not mean that the Commission should lead only individual Member States towards the promised land, it should also lead each individual Commissioner."
"What particularly worried me during the previous mandate was the way that certain Commissioners ran their own individual empires."
"For example, in the area of my particular interest, employment and social affairs, I waited in vain for the Commission to act as a college and for Mr Prodi to highlight the way that certain social directives were hampering competitiveness and holding back employment."
"However, this seemed to be a no-go area for the Commission as a whole, as if to say that, if it dared to challenge proposed social legislation, this might signify that it did not care about social justice and social cohesion."
"We all believe intensely in the importance of social justice and social cohesion, but the greatest social injustice is unemployment: one of the greatest sources of social exclusion is unemployment."
"Mr Schulz talked earlier of workers' rights, and of course these are important, but we must also pay attention to non-workers' rights, the rights of those who are willing and eager to work but have no job."
"That is why the Commission as a whole must have the courage to revisit and rebalance the social agenda and to promote employment as a priority, with flexibility in labour markets as the guiding star."
"Mr Barroso, you will not succeed unless you do this."
"Europe will not succeed unless you do this."
"You must succeed and we wish you well."
"Mr Barroso, it has fallen to you to lead a changed Union."
"The changes have come about because of the accession of ten new Member States and because of the new eastern border."
"This House believes you have every intention of fulfilling the incoming Commission’s historic mission."
"Nonetheless, if the Commission’s actions are characterised by inertia, and if its strategic political approach fails to take these two new parameters into account, the mission will not be accomplished, Mr President of the Commission."
"This mission consists of bringing together a Europe torn asunder at Yalta."
"It involves creating a new eastern dimension for the European Union."
"The first objective has to be the reunification of Europe, and ensuring that theoretical enlargement is consolidated through greater cohesion and economic solidarity should be one of the main and ongoing objectives of the Barroso Commission."
"It must be an objective in its own right, and not secondary to the Lisbon strategy and subsumed within it."
"In addition, good governance of the new Union calls for cohesion to be achieved by levelling out differences in economic development."
"According to your statement to the House, Mr Barroso, one cannot have more Europe for less money."
"You must therefore stand firm against the selfish attitudes of net contributors and of those Member States no longer eligible for cohesion funding following their economic success."
"The new Constitution requires greater political solidarity, and it is impossible to ensure credible consolidation of the Union on the basis of this new Constitution whilst simultaneously refusing or indeed reducing economic solidarity."
"Such a policy would be inconsistent and therefore ineffective."
"I appeal to you, Mr Barroso, to defend the original budget proposal put forward by the Commission."
"I urge you to hold an in-depth discussion with Commissioner Grybauskaitė."
"As we understand it, in Parliament she adopted a position contrary to yours."
"The second objective must be the new eastern dimension."
"The Union is a community of values, and we ought to be delighted that these values are spreading beyond our borders."
"We should be exporting democracy and human rights."
"On the one hand, the Commission’s eastern policy should be firmer, more demanding and speedier, and on the other, it should be more open and generous to fledgling democracies."
"It needs to be a diverse policy, and one that imposes conditions."
"It should encourage democratic choice, as in Ukraine."
"Ukraine needs action, not merely words."
"Its European aspirations should be welcomed, and it should be offered something more than the old action plan prepared before the great democratic transformation."
"It should be offered an Association Agreement."
"The new eastern policy calls for new instruments."
"The Union is in danger of allowing itself to be led by old objectives."
"New challenges call for new approaches."
"We trust you will foster the latter, Mr Barroso."
"– Mr President, President of the Commission, when it comes to setting out strategic orientations, it is best to speak clearly so that we can better express our aims."
"The European Union has to be the Europe of freedom, and freedom only exists in a healthy economic environment, where there is real and effective security."
"We need a competitive economy to meet the challenges of growth and full employment within a context of globalisation, the benefits of which we must learn how to harness."
"The challenge we face is that of achieving an economy that makes use of natural resources in a balanced way and that is efficient because it is modern, and not because it accepts any breach of the commitments on which the essence of its social model is based."
"Wealth cannot be produced without work, and more wealth cannot be produced by working less."
"There is no such miracle, and those who persist in conjuring up that mirage will be responsible for less development and less cohesion on both the economic and the social fronts."
"In addition, we need security."
"Not the security of talk that exploits people’s fears or that ignores the threats, but the kind resulting from firm policies that guarantee effective borders and internal security."
"Europe also needs to share with our traditional allies an international policy that promotes democracy and peace in our neighbouring countries and which contributes to a safer and more developed world."
"Mr President, the coming years will require Mr Barroso’s Commission to display competence and to chart a firm course during a period marked by uncertainties arising from the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty and the financial constraints imposed on the Member States by the Stability and Growth Pact."
"We cannot have a Union with more competences, more policies, more obligations and more Member States on the one hand, and a smaller budget and fewer resources on the other."
"It is an impossible equation, which, in the long term, will prevent us from achieving what we all want: a free, developed economy on safe territory."
"That is truly the key to our model and to the political orientations on which it must be based over the coming years."
"– Mr President, as a member of the Committee on International Trade, I should like to focus my intervention on the strengthening of the role of the European Union in achieving a more transparent, more democratically legitimate and efficient world trade system, a system which is at a crucial stage in its further development."
"We are witnessing increased international commercial interdependence and integration of the markets."
"We are also witnessing a constant increase in the number of States participating in the multilateral cooperation system."
"These are both good reasons for adjusting the rules and disciplines of the WTO, for further opening the markets in goods and services and for forging a stronger link between international trade and development."
"This trend clearly colours the Doha agenda."
"However, progress with negotiations to date demonstrates that there are difficulties."
"The European Union, the most important factor in the international economy and commercial diplomacy, is being called on to take on an even more active – I would say leading – role in strengthening and constantly adjusting the WTO system."
"In order for the new globalised environment to be able to optimise the distribution of resources, stability, predictability and solidarity, it will need to be reinforced with new, strong administrative institutions and mechanisms."
"Only thus will repercussions be avoided such as, for example, the textile and clothing industry and the sugar regime."
"My proposal concerns the fields of economic and political cooperation between the financial markets and international development cooperation on the basis of a standard for a new, international, social and ecological market economy."
"Today's world needs a new, cohesive global economic order, a new system of mutually supportive institutional and operational arrangements."
"I believe that this is the direction in which Europe should move and in which the Commission – I am addressing you, Mr President of the Commission – is being called on to develop creative initiatives and actions."
"Mr President, my apologies for having left the debate for a moment, but I had a trilogue meeting about unfair trading practices, which is also important, of course."
"Mr President of the Commission, you have announced that you and your Commission will be prioritising the socio-economic dimension of your policy, and it goes without saying that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports this."
"We all know that there is some catching up to be done in the Lisbon process, and we are delighted to hear that you want to put the train to Lisbon on a fast track."
"Together with Mr Kok, we would urge you to be more focused and to coordinate the Lisbon process more effectively, as regards both the internal objectives and others, including the guidelines for employment, the global economic guidelines and the macro-economic dialogue."
"We want to complete the Lisbon process, because we consider it imperative to be able to live in a social market economy in future, where efficiency goes hand in hand with justice and own responsibility goes hand in hand with solidarity."
"We are acutely aware that you cannot have one without the other."
"We would therefore ask you, Mr President of the Commission, to table concrete proposals in order to bring pressure to bear on the Member States and their regions, so that they can do their share of the work in the areas of education, training, and investments in scientific research, but also in structural reforms."
"Possible aids could be national Lisbon plans, a number of structural indicators, involving national parliaments in monitoring and assessing the process and certainly also a classification of the Member States according to performance."
"In addition, we would also urge you to ensure that the essence of the Stability and Growth Pact remains intact."
"That is something about which a number of Members have had a lot to say."
"Finally, we would ask you to help us to bring about the internal market in services, but in the right way, that is, with the support of the public and of civil society."
"We are also expecting proposals aimed at improving the investment climate, including for the medium-sized and small enterprises that are still the driving force of our economic growth."
"We all know that without any growth, there are no jobs, and without any jobs, there is no basis for social security, which we are all very keen to see protected."
"Mr President, you have an arduous task, all the more so because the Constitution has not yet been approved and the financial perspectives are as yet unknown."
"We are, in fact, asking you to serve up a menu without having a kitchen to prepare it and without knowing what budget is available."
"However, we are counting on your creativity and on a good team spirit among your people."
"If, in January, you propose solid policy and dish up a consistent meal, you will have a lasting ally in the PPE-DE Group."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to each and every one of you most attentively."
"I thank you for your contributions, which reflect a wide variety of views in this Parliament."
"I also eagerly await the result of your vote next Thursday."
"The resolution that is then adopted will certainly be very important for the common strategic vision that we want for the European Union."
"At this time I think I might already draw three provisional conclusions."
"First, I note that the great majority of speakers agree with the need to define priorities that correspond to the public’s expectations and think it important that the European Union and its institutions should respond to the primary concerns of European citizens."
"Secondly, the great majority of speakers identified three basic areas for action: the area we can call Lisbon, the Lisbon strategy (economic reform with a social and environmental dimension); the areas connected with security and justice; and Europe’s role in the world."
"Thirdly, I also see that there is broad consensus on the need for a proactive cohesion policy, a true solidarity policy in Europe."
"I particularly hope that the Member States’ Governments have taken careful note of this."
"Accordingly, I feel that we can conclude that there is consensus regarding Europe’s need for growth and employment."
"Without growth, without job creation and without greater dynamism in our economy, we shall be unable to maintain the high levels of social protection and the exacting environmental standards that we regard as part of what is normally called the European model."
"What is at stake is not, and never has been, the destruction of the European model."
"What is truly at stake is the need to adapt and to modernise this European model, and to take account of a number of new challenges that are now making themselves felt across Europe and the world."
"The increasing age of our population, the effects of globalisation – all this requires Europe to adapt and change within this more competitive context."
"I am pleased to say that I do not believe that concerns for economic efficiency and concerns for social justice are mutually incompatible."
"These objectives – greater competitiveness alongside sustainable development and social concern – cannot in any way be incompatible."
"We have to work to make them compatible."
"These are objectives that define one of our priorities."
"I therefore believe we must work towards achieving the broadest possible consensus, but a dynamic consensus and one that is not the result of cancelling out opposing points of view, because we also have to recognise that there are some contradictory priorities here in Parliament."
"Accordingly, we have to identify the highest common denominator for a dynamic consensus."
"I think that one consensus that has clearly emerged is the need to strengthen our solidarity at this time when we have an enlarged Europe."
"We have a Europe in the process of reunification."
"Our enlargement is an enlargement that has only just begun."
"We have signed the treaties and have ten new Member States among us, but we have to do all we can so that we can soon stop talking about old and new Member States and become a real Union, and for that we need an active cohesion policy."
"That is why I keep returning to the idea of a plan of values, and solidarity is certainly a value that can unite us."
"That is why I say that now, when I see the issue of European identity being debated so often in Europe, I have to stress that it is rooted in respect for our various national, regional and local identities."
"European diversity is what truly defines our identity and, if we want to define identity, we must define it in terms of the values enshrined in the European Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that is, respect for the dignity of the human being, for human rights, for justice, for the rule of law and for the principles of freedom and equality."
"These are the values that define our identity."
"Respect for the principle of non-discrimination and tolerance towards anyone who comes in through our borders."
"It is therefore on the basis of these values that we can promote the idea of Europe around the world."
"I said in my first speech that it is on the basis of these values that we can best look after our interests."
"We are looking after our interests with a more ambitious neighbourhood policy: a policy for our Eastern or Mediterranean neighbours that promotes stability and peace, as we have been doing in Ukraine, for example."
"I should like to underline something that has not always been put into words."
"The signals that the European Union has sent out during the current crisis in Ukraine have been highly positive."
"Without any competition for the limelight, we have had the Council Presidency, the European Council, the European Commission and some Member States all involved in seeking a peaceful, democratic solution for Ukraine."
"That reflects very well on our Europe."
"We must also, however, have a generous development policy."
"As I have already said, Europe cannot be selfish."
"The policy must reflect externally what we now do internally, having overcome a great many historical conflicts by means of collaboration between Member States that were very often at war with each other in the past."
"That is why I believe we have the duty to advocate effective multilateralism, whereby we work on a platform of equality and respect with our principal partners, we seek to revitalise the transatlantic alliance, and unite all our partners around values such as freedom, peace and democracy."
"That is how Europe progresses – by enriching its heritage, by building and renewing a dynamic consensus and by seeking to show the world those qualities that make it so different."
"I should like to finish, ladies and gentlemen, by assuring you that the Commission will seek to take account of Parliament’s positions, so as to incorporate those positions into what we hope will be a strategic vision not just for one institution or another, but a strategic vision for all European institutions and for the European Union as a whole throughout the next five years."
"At the conclusion of this debate, I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 103 of the Rules of Procedure.(1)"
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall proceed to the formal sitting for the award of the Sakharov Prize to the Association of Journalists of Belarus."
"It is a great honour and pleasure for me to welcome the winners of the Sakharov Prize 2004, a prize which the European Parliament is awarding to the Association of Journalists of Belarus, headed by its President, Mrs Zhanna Litvina."
"I would like to welcome you in your language: , Mrs Litvina."
"I must inform Parliament that the representatives of the Association of Journalists of Belarus include Svetlana Zavadskaya, whose husband has been missing since July 2000."
"We wish to express our sympathy and solidarity with Mrs Zavadskaya and her family at this very difficult time."
"This prize recognises a group of professionals who risk their lives on a daily basis to seek out the truth and communicate it to their citizens."
"In 2004, more than 50 journalists have been murdered throughout the world, together with 14 media assistants."
"Around 200 have been imprisoned and we should remember that two French journalists have been held in Iraq for more than 100 days now."
"2004 has not been Belarus's best year."
"The pressure from the authorities on the independent media has increased considerably."
"The State has continued to silence critical voices, imposing fines, systematically suspending and closing newspapers, harassing journalists and taking criminal action against them."
"Freedom is what society has the right to do and know and what the State does not have the right to hinder."
"In Belarus, however, it is hindered."
"Within Belarus's dictatorial system, the result of elections not recognised by the international community, access to information not filtered by the authorities involves risk, and the Association of Journalists of Belarus and its one thousand members, being awarded this prize today, run that risk every day."
"Having suffered various methods of traditional censorship, the Association manages, courageously, to broadcast its information via the Internet."
"But the authorities continue to pursue you and, nevertheless, you continue to try to keep the public aware of the right to freedom of expression and the need to exercise it."
"The attacks suffered by your Association are attacks against fundamental human rights, which are enshrined in the Charter of Rights and in the draft European Constitution."
"Madam President, I would like to inform you that we in the European Parliament have decided that our Delegation for Relations with Belarus will not maintain relations with the authorities of the regime, and will only maintain them and promote them with the NGOs and with civil society."
"We are all saddened and frustrated to note that, 15 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, vestiges of that artificial division of Europe still remain."
"We are frustrated to know that in Belarus the death penalty is still in force, and it is the only country in this continent which still applies it."
"The prize we are awarding today reminds us that there are borders within Europe which restrict the application of our values."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that our Parliament usually stays in contact with previous winners of the Sakharov prize and that this month it will be 14 years since we awarded this prize to Aung San Suu Kyi, who is still under arrest in Myanmar, and whose immediate release we continue to demand."
"Madam President, perhaps I should make it absolutely clear that, when you have returned to your country, we will continue to support you through all of our resources and we call on the Belarusian authorities to respect your rights and freedoms."
"I would like to congratulate you on the work you are doing in Belarusian: , Mrs Litvina."
"You have the floor."
"(1) Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a very emotional moment for me, because this is an extremely important, significant moment for my colleagues and I. The fact that we are receiving this prize as an organisation is a sign of solidarity and support for the entire Belarusian democratic movement and support for the political forces that will finally ensure that in future there will be a link between Belarus and the European Union."
"The fact that this prize was initially put forward for two Belarusian organisations – the second organisation was the youth organisation ZUBR – is probably a sign that Belarus is the focus of international attention and that my country, which one of my colleagues has described as a chess piece which has fallen off the chess board, will once again become an independent entity in European politics and will one day take a worthy place among the other nations around the European table."
"The prize is such an important signal for us because we understand our problems, but they are not just a matter of upholding our own professional principles."
"It is also about defending the rights of all our citizens to receive objective, uncensored information."
"It is extremely important that our problems are understood by you and by European politicians."
"Unfortunately, the Belarusian authorities have managed to create a closed society built on isolation and disdain for democratic values."
"They protect their stability and survival by means of total control over the flow of information."
"The electronic media are almost totally monopolised by the authorities."
"The situation is worse because the work of these monopolised media is directed at discrediting any political adversaries, and the monopolised media try to reinforce stereotypes and myths."
"One such widespread myth in Belarus is that nobody in Europe is watching us, nobody expects us to join them and Europe is hostile and aggressive towards us, the only guarantee of stability in our country is the head of state, and so on and so forth."
"Despite our constitutional provisions, there is only one obligatory ideology that prevails in Belarus now."
"In Belarus a process has now been completed – the creation of a new state structure which is known as the ideological 'vertical'."
"There is total intolerance of criticism and we are not allowed to object or express our views."
"My colleagues know that we are subject to use of the criminal code against us if we criticise the President."
"Two years ago, Paval Mazheika, a young journalist, was given a prison sentence under the criminal code."
"During political campaigns there is even more pressure on the non-state press; the referendum and the recent parliamentary elections are a case in point."
"On the eve of the referendum my colleague, Elena Ravbetskaya, the editor of the newspaper published an article in which she said that calling the referendum was 'a challenge to society' and that to carry it out required a total lack of conscience and total neglect of public opinion."
"My colleague was also tried and fined as a result."
"Her newspaper has also been punished and has been closed down for three months as a result of that article."
"Again, two weeks ago, a very well-known person, Garry Pahaniayla, Vice-President of the Belarus Helsinki Committee, was also sentenced for slander against the state."
"The reason for this was a cassette taped by a Swedish television journalist, which was confiscated from him at the border."
"Mr Pahaniayla had given an interview and mentioned the names of those suspected of involvement in the disappearance of Belarusian opposition politicians."
"That was sufficient for them to bring him to trial and he may well be imprisoned for five years as a result."
"We are very concerned that, despite the conclusions reached in the report on the disappearances of Belarusian politicians and journalists by Christos Pourgurides, a Council of Europe special rapporteur, and despite the international community's close attention to this subject, it seems that the Belarusian authorities are still not interested in a full in-depth investigation of these disappearances or in publishing such an investigation."
"We still do not know what happened to Dmitry Zavadsky, who disappeared four years ago."
"He is a journalist and a member of our organisation and the authorities have never told us what happened to him."
"His wife, Svetlana Zavadskaya, is on our delegation."
"The issue of the disappeared is still in the newspapers."
"Three years ago, during the presidential election campaign, we were punished for mentioning this."
"There was direct censorship."
"At the beginning of this year, in the last campaign for parliamentary elections and the referendum, we saw for the first time the summary closure of newspapers at the behest of the Ministry of Information."
"There were 19 cases of suspension of the activities of independent media outlets."
"Our colleague, Andrey Shantarovich, actually went on hunger strike as a result of his paper being shut down."
"After the hunger strike he was charged with carrying out an unauthorised protest."
"This was absurd."
"The information about his hunger strike had been published all around the city and, as a result, he was fined for the hunger strike."
"Suspending the activities of newspapers is aimed firstly at hitting the newspapers economically."
"Economic discrimination has become one of the ways of restricting the activities of the independent press."
"My colleagues in the press are coming up against major obstacles in the distribution of their newspapers."
"The distribution of alternative, accurate information to citizens is one of the major problems facing our society."
"If a publication criticises the authorities, this automatically leads to problems with the printing houses."
"According to the Ministry of Information, there are hundreds of independent printing presses, but already five independent publications can no longer be printed in our country; they have to be printed in Smolensk in Russia because they cannot use printing presses on Belarusian territory."
"I can say quite categorically that the journalists – my colleagues from the independent press – remain true to the principles of their profession."
"The independent press, which still appears in Belarus, is virtually the only institution which exercises any scrutiny over the state and it is the only source of free information to citizens."
"It would not be possible for us to survive without the collective support of international and European organisations."
"I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Article 19; to the International Federation of Journalists; Reporters without Borders; the International League for Human Rights; the Danish organisations; the Helsinki Committee from Sweden and Norway; the Centre of Extreme Journalism, as it is called – a Russian organisation; and the Glasnost Defence Foundation."
"All these are partner organisations that are helping us, and our strength lies in this partnership and cooperation."
"It is very important for us that European society and the European institutions should not weaken their position with regard to the principles of freedom of speech and human rights."
"If there were to be any weakening of those positions, then the repressive machine within Belarus would start to go into overdrive and we would feel even more pressure against us."
"Recently, at international level, many politicians from eastern European countries have expressed their concerns about the situation in Belarus and are prepared to work towards formulating a strategy towards Belarus at European level."
"I would like to express our support for that and the certainty that a common European strategy towards Belarus will emerge and will very much help our situation."
"We can only combat a totalitarian regime by creating an open information society; a society that would encourage debate; a forum – which is a place for people to receive accurate information."
"We have a comprehensive programme which we feel will help to unlock the situation in our country."
"We are prepared to discuss that with you."
"I will just mention a few of the priorities."
"We need support for what is legal and what is still working in Belarus."
"Basically, what I am referring to is the independent press and the non-governmental organisations that are still operating in our country."
"What is also very important for us is the effect of the strengthened presence of the European Union in Belarus – something that we would encourage."
"Perhaps there is some way of establishing a European Union special representative for Belarus."
"We feel it is very important that our people should receive a message from the European Union."
"Its value would be that our return to Europe depends on us, the Belarusian people."
"We understand that today, Belarus's visiting card unfortunately implies the Lukashenko regime."
"In fact there are ten million people in our country and at least half of those associate the future of our country with a return to Europe."
"I should like to take this opportunity to urge the Members of the European Parliament – especially the members of the delegation to Belarus – to support our proposals with regard to staging hearings on the media situation in Belarus."
"Such hearings might lead to recommendations on bringing our legislation into line with European standards and would help us to demonopolise the mass media."
"Once again, I thank you for this award."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the formal sitting is closed."
"Mr President, pursuant to Rule 166 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, I should like to enquire on what legal basis the miniature national flags were removed from the seats occupied by Polish Members from the League of Polish Families?"
"Is there any legal basis for removing someone else’s property, and on whose orders were the flags removed?"
"We insist they be returned immediately."
"As far as we are concerned, they are holy."
"In addition, I fail to see how they could be detrimental to the European Parliament."
"This is an important issue, ladies and gentlemen. As you will be aware, we do follow the Charter of Fundamental Rights in absolutely defending the right to property."
"This morning, the House’s services were informed that a number of flags that had been in this Chamber were no longer there."
"Even after painstaking investigations, it has not been possible to determine who removed them and where they are now."
"I would ask the indulgence of the Polish and other Members."
"We will continue our investigations and hope that the flags will turn up somewhere, but, for the moment, they have simply disappeared."
"I must, however, point out, ladies and gentlemen, that it has not hitherto been good practice in this House for individual delegations to use flags to mark where they sit."
"Let me further point out to you that the Bureau, at the request of one of the Vice-Presidents, considered this issue yesterday and that this issue of flags is on the agenda for the next meeting of the Bureau, which will deal with the matter."
"The readmission agreement with Sri Lanka is part and parcel of the introduction of a common immigration policy. The June List does not, however, wish to contribute to any Fortress Europe."
"Measures concerning illegal immigration and residence, including the repatriation of illegal immigrants, should be an issue for the Member States’ national parliaments."
"Consequently, we are voting against the report."
"The Commission did not manage to obtain a unanimous decision in the Council on its proposal for a directive on simplifying and streamlining reduced VAT rates. Consequently, the period of application of Directive 1999/85/EU, authorising Member States to apply, on an experimental basis, a reduced VAT rate on labour-intensive services, has been repeatedly extended, and now comes to an end on 31 December 2005."
"The purpose of this recasting of the Directive is to make it possible for the new Member States, following enlargement, to apply it, and this is something that we welcome."
"Whilst the Commission’s assessment report says that the effects of this measure are negligible and that the cost/benefit ratio is unfavourable, the Commission’s main objective revolves around the difficulty of harmonising VAT, although it does state that this measure does not prejudice the rules of the internal market."
"This will contribute further towards creating jobs and towards combating the parallel economy. We hope that the new Member States will make their contribution towards achieving this aim."
"We have voted against this report."
"We believe that those Member States that wish to contribute to the International Fund for Ireland must do so by deciding in their respective national parliaments to give such contributions."
"The Member States must fund these contributions directly out of their respective state budgets, and the money should not need to take a detour via the EU budget."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this year’s mobilisation of the flexibility instrument is closely connected with the success of the Budget consultations and the agreement that we concluded – as we indeed needed to – between the institutions."
"Let me say, Mr President-in-Office, in retrospect, how good it is that at that time, in 1999, Parliament secured this flexibility instrument following laborious negotiations, for it has been very much to the benefit of the Council’s priorities when implementing past years’ Budgets."
"Let me once again remind you that the flexibility instrument, the annual upper limit of which the May 1999 agreement set at EUR 200 million, is intended to deal with unforeseen eventualities, and also that heading 24 of the Interinstitutional Agreement states that, as a rule, this flexibility instrument should not be applied for one and the same purpose in two successive financial years."
"Before this flexibility instrument is made use of, there does of course have to be a motion to that effect, and there has to be examination of whether new unforeseen measures are to be funded within a heading or, where this is impossible, by shifts between one heading and another, which is to be followed by discussion of whether the flexibility instrument is to be applied."
"We go through this procedure almost every year, and what we have actually learned from the experience is that the interpretation put on this flexibility has sometimes placed it under some considerable strain."
"I would draw attention to this year’s result, which is that we have EUR 185 million at our disposal, EUR 45 million for the Peace II programme, EUR 40 million for the agencies – which are obviously among the Council’s really important priorities and are always threatening to displace important programmes in heading III, which yield added value for Europe – and EUR 100 million for the reconstruction of Iraq."
"For that reason, I believe we would be very well advised, in the debate on the new Financial Perspective and the flexibility it calls for, to draw on the experience we have had of the use of the flexibility instrument over the past years. Let me take this opportunity to say that we are talking here, overall, in terms of payments from the 2005 Budget of EUR 106.3 billion and EUR 200 million allowed for flexibility."
"What is interesting about this year is that, for the first time, not only does heading IV – foreign policy – benefit from the use of the flexibility instrument, but also headings II and III necessarily benefit from what we have negotiated."
"The ultimate result of this, and what might be called an additional result, is that the Agreement has also made it possible – in a sort of legal/budgetary emergency operation – to incorporate EUR 120 million worth of funding for Northern Cyprus under heading VII and to add EUR 10 million to the funding for the common foreign and security policy, bringing it up to EUR 62.5 million."
"Mr President, please allow me to make a final comment: our experience and the virtually annual debate on the use of the flexibility instrument must surely make it clear to both the Council and to Parliament, as they debate the new Financial Perspective, that the longer we set the Financial Perspectives for – be it 2007 to 2013 or whatever – and the longer the period for which the amounts are laid down, the more likely it is that we will need more flexibility to deal with the unexpected in coming years and will have to demand this of the Council in the negotiations on the Financial Perspectives."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner Grybauskaitė, Mr Nicolaï, ladies and gentlemen, we may, today, be discussing the agreement with the Council about the 2005 Budget, but we are, of course, already looking to see how things will progress with the 2006 Budget and what is to be expected in the coming years in relation to the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013."
"So I will tell you in plain language that my political evaluation of the result we have achieved for 2005 makes me both laugh and cry."
"What I see as positive is the flexibility instrument. I would like to say here and now that I agree with Mr Böge, who made it very clear that we have succeeded in making these funds available now – not only for internal policy and the agencies, but also for foreign policy, above all for supporting the elections in Iraq."
"That is a success, and it was one that we in this House saw as urgently necessary if we were to be equal to all the tasks set us."
"I see it as indispensable that we were able to uphold as part of the Lisbon strategy our priority of upgrading information policy, enabling us better to reach the citizens and voters in Europe."
"We Greens also see it as important progress that the LIFE programme and the programme for the protection of the environment have been prevented from falling by the wayside."
"I would, however, like to say with equal clarity that what I see in a negative light is the shape taken by the payments for 2005."
"We do, admittedly, conclude that this round of negotiations did not offer more room for manoeuvre; that is why we will vote in favour of this Budget."
"I am right behind Mr Ferber in his criticisms of the Council and in his statement describing the 1% criterion as misguided fetishism on the part of the Council."
"I want to make that very plain to you, as I was very pleased to hear him say this and it does not often happen that Mr Ferber and I are of one mind."
"The fact is that I do believe – and here I am addressing you, Mr Nicolaï – that you stated, not only in the course of our negotiations during the conciliation procedure, but also in this House today, that this House, in exactly the same way as the national governments, must be willing to decide on priorities. That is indeed so."
"My fellow MEPs have also already said that we all have a great interest in budgetary discipline and a serious approach to the Budget. In the same way, though, you cannot evade our question, for if we have to set priorities, the same must also be said of the national governments."
"Your belief that you have to make unilateral cuts in which European policy loses out I regard as the wrong approach. Politics risks being renationalised, and, for an enlarged Europe – for, for the first time, we are dealing with a Budget for 25 Member States – with new tasks and new challenges, that would be a mistake."
"If you want to fashion a truly European policy, you have to have the political courage to make the Budget reflect that."
"I do not at present see that in the position of the net contributing countries and in the obsession with 1%."
"That I regard as a mistake in political terms."
"If we want to join together in further developing our wonderful continent, if we want to do more for economic renewal, for spending on education, youth and new talents, then jointly, and together with you, the Council and the net contributor countries – and this is where I am critical of the red/green government in Germany – we must get moving in order to achieve more for Europe’s benefit."
"Let me express, by way of conclusion, my gratitude to all the staff and members of the Committee on Budgets."
"I hope that we will continue to work together with such powerful effect over the years to come in order to achieve much for Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, work on the Union’s 2005 budget is almost at an end."
"The Commission proposed a budget amounting to EUR 109 billion, the Council proposed a figure of EUR 105 billion and Parliament proposed EUR 111 billion. The final figure is EUR 106 billion."
"The rapporteurs must of course be thanked for their work, but the question arises as to whether this amounts to success and an appropriate compromise. In fact that is not the most crucial issue at stake."
"What is much more important is that the outcome is below expectations. I can see other Members of this House share my view."
"The policy of cuts won the day, despite enlargement of the Union to take in ten new Member States. Wishful thinking prevailed, namely that it is possible to have a larger Union for less money."
"The agreed level of expenditure may impact on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, and this is even more worrying. The Union for Europe of the Nations Group’s attitude to the 2005 budget is that it is something that cannot currently be opposed, but we see no reason for rejoicing."
"This is also an opportunity for broader reflection. George Kennan observed in the past that Soviet expansion came about because of an inability to solve internal problems."
"I trust the same will not be true of the European Union. Unfortunately, there are some worrying similarities regarding two issues, the first of which is economic policy."
"To date, the Union has pursued a policy of cohesion and economic solidarity, helping the less-developed countries so as to promote the development of the Member States as a whole."
"At present, the concept of cohesion and economic solidarity is being written out of Union agreements."
"Weakening cohesion policy or doing away with it altogether may lead to differences becoming even more entrenched in the future. This is especially likely if the Lisbon strategy comes to mean giving up on economic policy, that is, achieving the highest possible quality at the lowest possible cost, to the benefit of social policy in the more developed countries."
"I refer to protecting jobs in those countries burdened with excessively high social costs. The second question I would like to refer to is that Europe is unable to define its own identity."
"Events concerning Mr Buttiglione and the failure to integrate Islamic communities in Western Europe, as referred to recently in , are both relevant examplesas is the question of the text of the preambleto the Constitution."
"At the same time, we are continuing to debate enlargement to include Turkey, without taking any account of the fundamental issues dividing the Union from Turkey. The former include social, economic, political and cultural problems."
"The response to the conflict between the theory of universal standards and particular ones has been to do away with standards of all kinds. Those determined to go to any lengths to achieve a federal Europe without borders, lacking ideological identity and cohesion policy, are acting to the detriment of the Union."
"They are working slowly but more surely against it than those who currently wish to harm the Union with extremist language. There can only be one conclusion, namely that in future, the Union must come up with a broader ideological identity and make more resources available, so as to implement cohesion and solidarity policy effectively."
"Mr President, as the representative of my political group, I have been following the budget debate in the Committee on Budgets since the spring."
"I am sure that both rapporteurs have done their very best, but, despite that, my group is proposing the budget be rejected for the reasons of policy that our Chairman, Francis Wurtz, mentioned at the start of the sitting."
"The problem from Parliament’s point of view is budgetary discipline, which does not recognise flexibility to any adequate extent."
"Stringent budgetary discipline is supplemented by an interinstitutional agreement, which was smuggled through the European Parliament in May, 1999."
"The previous Parliament was unable, as is the current one, to have an influence on the ceilings for appropriations determined in the interinstitutional agreement."
"The only way to create more flexibility would have been to terminate the interinstitutional agreement that came about in such strange circumstances, but Parliament has not been prepared to do that, in spite of the fact that the inflexibility of the budget has been common knowledge."
"This lack of flexibility is in the Council’s interests, but not Parliament’s."
"I would, however, like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and the rapporteurs and coordinators, for their excellent levels of cooperation, even though my group has decided to propose that the budget be rejected."
"Mr President, it may be that the best thing one can do for democracy is to remain objective about things with which one disagrees, and that is what I shall try to do, as the Committee on Transport and Tourism was not in agreement with every aspect of the proposals."
"There were two that it highlighted: the first had to do with the trans-European networks, where, in a desire to send a signal about enlargement, the commitment appropriations were increased."
"The second point of disagreement concerned agencies, where the situation is, as we see it, far more difficult, for, whether in relation to safety, or to transport by road, air, sea or rail, there are many areas in which a political agreement has been reached between the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"When, though, it comes to allocating the necessary funding, this does not – astonishingly enough – always apply."
"For that reason, where these agencies are concerned, the question arises in our minds as to whether personnel costs really belong there, because they eat into the operational appropriations, or whether the personnel appropriations ought to go somewhere else. I do not propose to go more closely into the technical details right now."
"The other point I would make deals with very important areas."
"Of course we are glad that, in the area of measures to combat marine pollution, which was envisaged and proposed by the Council to be a zero entry, a token entry, there are now some funds available after all, so that we can at least explain to the outside world that we now have not only the political will, but also the means, to intervene in that area."
"It will be for the future to show whether the EUR 17 million will be enough, after we proposed far in excess of EUR 20 million. The same applies in the case of rail and air transport."
"There is evidence from these agencies that they cannot do the job properly with the funds allocated to them, and so the warning from the Committee on Transport and Tourism is that we cannot wait for the next disaster before adjusting the resources in line with the facts of the situation."
"The debate will now be suspended and will resume at 9 p.m."
"That is your opinion. As I said, the location of the European institutions was decided in 1957 and it has continued to be a very high level of political decision-making."
"The Commission is ready to discuss all these issues. It is very difficult to estimate the costs to the environment, but the amount of money in our budget for 2003 was EUR 1.7 million."
"Madam President, Commissioner, do you agree with me that Strasbourg is the seat of Parliament, that it is only by way of a concession in order to reduce bureaucracy in its cooperation with the other European institutions that it migrates to Brussels, and that its principal seat is here in Strasbourg?"
"Do you also agree with me that the figure of EUR 200 million that you have given for annual expenditure refers not to the extra costs, but to the total costs of running this House?"
"The formalities were completed on 22 November and immediately after the new Commission started we made the decision to advertise this post and fill it through an open competition. Today we received the final opinion of the legal services about some nuances concerning the announcement."
"."
"Madam President, I must also say in this connection that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties, and that it has always done what is necessary to ensure compliance with the competition rules, in particular the provisions concerning State aid in the field of broadcasting."
"Still on this question, I would like to add that the 2001 communication on State aid to public service broadcasting clarifies the way in which the relevant rules must be applied. It explains clearly, should there still be any need to do so, that Member States are responsible for financing this public service and for defining its remit, and that it is not for the Commission to decide whether a programme should be broadcast as a service of general economic interest or what the definition of the remit should be."
"The important thing in the eyes of the Commission is therefore that the remit be defined as clearly and precisely as possible, and that if a public service goes beyond its public remit it should keep separate accounts for commercial activities such as the sale of advertising space, for example."
"Thank you for your reply, Mrs Reding."
"Thank you for clarifying so precisely what we already know to be laid down in Community legislation."
"The purpose of my question, Commissioner, was to try to go a little further."
"In all the countries of the European Union, we often note that, in accordance with that interpretation of our rules, which you have clarified so well, there is often – shall we say – perverse behaviour that transgresses free competition."
"Do you believe that we could seek to produce a new formulation, a new text, which is able to bring together the public service criteria in a clearer manner?"
". I would like to assure the honourable Member that I remember his letter of 25 November 2003 on the subject very well."
"Now that I am responsible not only for the Television without Frontiers Directive but also for the new media in general, I will certainly put even more weight on this question than I did before."
"The answer to the honourable Member's question is that the study on the policy models will start at the beginning of 2005 and will finish roughly one year later, between the beginning and middle of 2006. As for the Contact Committee, its work is continuing and the results will be published on the web in early 2005."
"The Commissioner will be aware that I have been raising with her the question of the broadcasting of the English Premiership on television."
"The Commissioner has replied that broadband Internet may be a possibility for broadcasting this without restriction."
"If broadband Internet is to be used as a new way of providing more widespread communication, could I ask the Commissioner if she would also consider introducing provisions in the new proposals she is putting forward to ensure that broadband Internet broadcasting arrangements also include some suitable subtitling for the kind of people mentioned in the question?"
"Madam President, the Commission is obviously required to be neutral in matters of technology. What is true for one technology must be true for another, and we must show persons who have difficulties in participating fully in the information society the same respect regardless of the technology."
"In substance, therefore, it does not change anything, but in form, of course, it does, and where we are encouraging broadband technology, persons with sight or hearing problems must obviously be assisted."
"Incidentally, we are seeing, for example, that third-generation telephones really do allow us to meet these persons’ needs; they enable the hard of hearing to use the telephone by transmitting an image of the lips."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"I am glad to hear the Commissioner say that she will give priority to consumer protection in this case if there is to be a change of opinion in 2005."
"The fact is that existing practice has not been particularly satisfactory, with approaches having been taken that do not protect the consumer, and something must be done about that."
"Madam President, I shall, then, try to set an equally good example and to keep it brief. Consumer protection is of course high up on the agenda and we will take due account of it; the Commission is prepared, in revising this Directive, to cooperate closely not only with the MEPs who concern themselves with consumer protection, but also with consumer protection organisations."
"If somebody can be tracked without their knowing it, that has very serious implications. For the person being tracked, their personal security is violated; they may be, for instance, under the threat of violence."
"Mr President, this question of the European Union’s financial framework is crucial."
"It is crucial because the European Union must rise to formidable challenges: bringing the enlargement process to a successful conclusion, achieving the aim of cohesion, the symbol of our policy of solidarity, without forgetting the less favoured regions of the old Union of 15, meeting commitments under the common agricultural policy and Natura 2000 and, above all, achieving the Lisbon objectives in the realms of competitiveness, research, employment, training, environmental policy and public health while giving due consideration to the ageing of our population."
"This last point has not been addressed this afternoon, even though an ageing population clearly has economic and social implications for our future."
"Faced by these challenges and by the explosive growth in Chinese competition, how does the Commission intend to position itself?"
"At a time when the Commission and the Council are preparing to open the gates of Europe once again, can we continue to operate with a budget that has not developed since the 1990s, even though the European Union has subsequently taken on many new Member States and been accorded wider powers under a series of new treaties?"
"Mrs Grybauskaitė, we are not reassured. Questions need to be asked about the Commission’s desire to make tangible proposals."
"Arm yourself with the support of Parliament and do what you can to influence the one-per-centers, to bring home to them, as Mr Barroso said, that more Europe cannot be achieved without more money. Even allowing for the agreement on the CAP, we already know that it will be impossible to fund the Union’s regional policy between now and 2013 if we adhere to the one-per-cent ceiling."
"Europe is on the move; it has been enlarged, it is ambitious, but are you sure, Mrs Grybauskaitė, that you have the means to fulfil its ambition?"
"What we are asking you to do is tell us what resources are needed to finance our objectives."
"And you know that they will have to be increased."
"Be prepared, Commissioner, to defend the key positions vigorously. You must be aware that this would be a bad time to disappoint not only Parliament, but all the people of Europe too."
"That concludes the list of speakers. I understand the Commissioner does not wish to take the floor."
"The debate is therefore closed. The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can inform you that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats cannot lend its support to the draft recommendation we are discussing today, because it does not provide answers to the major challenges on which the EU should focus its future drugs strategy."
"Recent figures about drug use among young people are alarming."
"An increasing number of young people start experimenting, and at an ever-younger age, with soft drugs, in particular, which are made ever more accessible by the falling prices for them."
"I believe that the rapporteur, in his report, is minimising the problem, and I see this as clearly inappropriate in this situation."
"On the contrary, the situation requires a bold and comprehensive approach with only one goal in mind: that of reducing the use of drugs and all their adverse consequences."
"The Commission’s assessment report and the annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction prove that a great deal is yet to be done, including at European level."
"The European policy should, as the Commissioner stated, add value to the differentiated approach in the different Member States in terms of coordination, information, scientific research and the tackling of the cross-border drugs trade and crime that goes hand in hand with that."
"We believe that, if such a policy is to be adopted, a separate budget line should be created for supporting new initiatives and promoting the exchange of useful experience between the various Member States."
"Nothing of the sort is to be found in this report."
"Far from it; it is incoherent and riddled with contradictions."
"For example, it calls for an approach based on facts and scientific research – something that we can, of course, support – while, in the same breath, drawing conclusions most of which are incorrect."
"It claims that repression has no benefits, and that past action has failed to bear any fruit."
"Moreover, it jumps to conclusions as to what should be done."
"Finally, the European Council will be determining the strategy this week, and Parliament …"
". Mr President, this is an excellent report which we on this side of the House support."
"We support it for many of the reasons which the previous speaker mentioned, including in terms of the science and pragmatic facts of this debate."
"We do not take an overtly ideological stance, but there is some ideology in the debate and the ideology says that, unless we deal with harm reduction, unless we understand addiction and unless we understand the explosion in crime which leads from drugs to the domestic crime that we suffer in all of our European Union Member States, we cannot tackle the problem efficiently and effectively."
"This report – which was a much amended report with approximately 106 amendments in committee – shows two things."
"One is that there is an active interest in this House in an EU drugs strategy."
"Secondly we all know as MEPs that there is a very strong public appetite for there to be an EU strategy."
"So what is that strategy to be?"
"The answer to that question is very much contained in this report."
"For example, in this report we talk not about being hard on drugs or soft on drugs, but about actually looking at intelligent harm-reduction strategies."
"We know the connections between drug use and HIV."
"If we ignore those in this House, then there will be further harm, further crime and further suffering."
"We want to lay much greater stress on harm reduction, but also on rehabilitation."
"We want to provide appropriate funding for information measures and not to pretend that the public has sufficient information about this problem."
"We also want to take appropriate steps to prevent the profits of illegal drug-trafficking from being used to fund everything from international terrorism to other forms of crime."
"This report is thus not 'hard' or 'soft'. It is effective."
"It tackles crime, as well as the harm being done to individuals."
"In this report we also urge governments and national parliaments to take effective measures to prevent drugs entering prisons."
"Mr Catania continually stressed this point, because it is too often ignored in Member States."
"It is for us in the European Union to tackle some of the difficult issues across Member States which sometimes individual Member States are not emphasising enough."
"Prisons are now multiplying the effects of drug harm."
"People are coming out of prisons and committing more crime."
"This is a serious issue for the European Union."
"There is a strong public appetite for us as MEPs and for the Commission to tackle drugs with an effective drugs strategy."
"This report places the right emphasis on harm reduction, tackling addiction and dealing with the source of drug problems, rather than expounding clichés about the effects. It is a good report which we will support."
"Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, the report presented to us today by Mr Catania calls into question the policy of zero tolerance and prohibition implemented by the Member States."
"The rapporteur’s aim is to amend the current strategy and it will be to no one’s surprise that we have voted against this report"
"Mr Catania mentioned the report by the European drugs and drug addiction monitoring centre."
"Mr Estievenart was with us last month and pointed out that, and I quote, ‘there are positive signs that progress has been made in reducing some of the worst consequences of drug use’."
"He said that the number of drug-related deaths has begun to fall, that heroin use has levelled off in a number of countries, that the HIV epidemic among users is slowing and, I quote, ‘measures to reduce drug-related harm are intensifying and, across much of Europe, drug users have better access to treatment and care’."
"This clearly demonstrates that not everything has been negative."
"Much remains to be done and, despite all the policies that we have been pursuing, enormous problems still exist in terms of the production and trafficking of drugs, and in terms of drug use, which continues to hit extremely high levels in all Member States."
"In light of the accession of ten new Member States, it is essential that we step up cooperation with the countries that now border the EU."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is room for a European anti-drugs policy that fights back against drug-related crime, and that, as per the programme, meets the four main objectives of preventing drug use and dependency, reducing the supply and demand of illegal drugs, limiting social and health damage and reducing crime."
"This is the path that we must follow – the path of combat, not the path of slackness."
"Mr President, the draft law we are debating in this House today will be of great significance for public health in Europe and for Europeans’ confidence in food safety."
"It is incredibly important for all our voters in our various constituencies, but it is particularly important perhaps for parents with allergic children."
"Our amendments are in line with what I and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe think is reasonable for bringing about a proposal that is effective from the points of view both of competition and of consumer protection."
"I should like to emphasise a few things."
"The internal market is incredibly important."
"In this internal market, we wish to protect our citizens and, at the same time, set standards for testing and treating food at those links in the chain where the food concerned first comes into contact with the consumer and first enters the distribution chain."
"In this respect, this proposal is sound."
"It is also sound inasmuch as it protects important and vulnerable high-risk groups such as women, infants and unborn children."
"We are also adopting a position on a standard for good agricultural practice."
"In this, we have taken account both of integrated pest control and of climate variations in order to bring about a fairer proposal."
"It is incredibly important that these options for taking account of local or regional variations should not reduce the proposal’s level of ambition."
"This is something that has to be considered in connection with the practical application of the proposal, once it has properly entered into force."
"It is good that there have been improvements to the Food Safety Authority in terms of both time and resources."
"I also think that the rapporteur has done a very good job."
"I am pleased that we have been able to make it easier for civil society and the non-governmental organisations to participate in the discussion and handling of these issues."
"The next item is the Commission and Council statements on the preparation of the European Council (17 December 2004)."
". Mr President, the forthcoming European Council in Brussels will be the first for the new Commission."
"It will be an important meeting, marking the next steps in the process of building a larger, more prosperous and safer European Union."
"It will be a sign of our ambition for a Union which is dynamic and on the move; a Union ready to share its destiny with the European family; a Union which is concerned about the security of its citizens."
"I would hope that the spirit coming out of the European Council later this week is one of cooperation."
"How else can we generate the trust in Europe’s institutions and politicians that is needed for a smooth ratification of the Constitution?"
"We have heard from the presidency about its expectations and the issues that the summit will address."
"Let me comment briefly on three issues: enlargement, the fight against terrorism and the financial perspectives."
"Firstly, our policy of enlargement of the Union has been the key in freeing us from our cold war past."
"The gravitational pull of the prospect of EU membership has transformed and modernised several post-communist societies."
"It has thus reshaped the European order."
"This was and remains an achievement of historic proportions that we should not underestimate."
"Your House has been instrumental in supporting this process, but our enlargement is still incomplete."
"This European Council will take the next steps for four countries, offering them the potential – through enlargement – to join the European mainstream."
"Last October the Commission made it clear that it should be possible to conclude the accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania in 2004."
"Indeed, this negotiating process was closed yesterday, thanks to the increased efforts by the European Union and by these two countries."
"I congratulate the Netherlands presidency for its excellent work and close cooperation with the Commission on that particular subject."
"The Accession Treaty for both countries now needs to be finalised and we hope that it can be signed after receiving the assent of this House during the spring of next year."
"In the remaining period up to accession, the Commission will be watching closely to see that both countries deliver on the commitments made during the negotiations, and in some cases this will mean a further acceleration in their efforts."
"At the request of the European Council, on 6 October the Commission adopted its report on Turkey and a clear recommendation."
"The main message in the Commission’s assessment is that Turkey has sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria and that accession negotiations should now be opened."
"We consider this recommendation, which was very carefully prepared, to be well balanced and a good basis for a decision by the Council."
"I am looking forward to taking comfort from the position your House will take on this question later today."
"Turkey has made further progress in the last weeks."
"It has adopted five of the six pieces of legislation signalled by the Commission in its report; the sixth law, on the execution of sentences, is pending before the Turkish Parliament."
"It is now time for the European Council to honour its commitment to Turkey and announce the opening of accession negotiations."
"A clear date should be indicated."
"We consider that, apart from the matters I have just mentioned, no other conditions ought to be added."
"The European Council will no doubt wish to recall that political reforms will have to continue in the course of the negotiations and ask the Commission to monitor further progress closely."
"We should also ask our Turkish friends in all honesty: if you want to become a member of a club, is it not normal that you recognise the other members of the club?"
"I am convinced that this will come at the right moment in the course of this difficult process, and preferably sooner than later."
"The objective of starting negotiations cannot be other than accession but we accept that the accession process is open-ended and its outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand."
"As in the past, transitional arrangements and certain specific safeguards may need to be considered."
"But let me state what our ultimate challenge will be: in the end, we need not only to overcome diplomatic obstacles, but also to conquer the hearts and minds of European citizens on this issue."
"Croatia represents the first of the Western Balkan nations preparing to start the process for accession to the Union."
"The Commission is ready to support the launch of such negotiations, but believes that any progress should be conditional on increased cooperation between the Croatian Government and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"If such cooperation is confirmed, then negotiations can be started in 2005."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with your permission I should like to turn to one of the twenty-first century’s key challenges, and one which we will also discuss at this week’s Council summit, namely the threat of international terrorism."
"What we are dealing with here is the ugly face of globalisation."
"International terrorism exploits the advantages of pluralist societies to attack the very foundations of those societies – our freedoms."
"I hope that at the end of the week we will reach further agreements on how terrorism can be fought."
"We must show our unwavering determination, but we must never lose sight of the democratic and legal principles which are at the very basis of our society and our prosperity."
"The European Commission has played an active role in promoting and preparing an updated EU action plan on the fight against international terrorism, and I should like to make absolutely clear what we hope the outcome of the decisions to be taken at the end of the week will be."
"These decisions must help us to ensure that the EU will be better prepared to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks, as well as allowing us to block the sources of funding for terrorists to a greater extent than previously, improving our ability to manage the aftermath of an attack and, finally, ensuring better protection for our key infrastructures."
"We should not limit ourselves to fighting terrorism by force."
"We should also oppose its perverse logic, by tackling the ideological and social factors which lead individuals to commit such acts."
"Long-term commitment and a clear political determination will be necessary to overcome this scourge."
"The discussions at the summit will also take stock of the situation regarding the Financial Perspectives for 2007-2013."
"I still believe that the Commission’s proposals are sound, based as they are on a broad political consensus on what the EU must do."
"The truth is that the political project on which the Commission’s proposals are based was not actually at risk."
"The Commission’s proposals therefore constitute a valid working basis."
"The current ceiling for own resources remains in place despite new requests to the EU due to the enlargement and to the development of new policies."
"They are therefore reasonable proposals."
"What we want to offer, however, is actual added European value, on top of what is offered at national level."
"Of course, we must ensure discipline in the budgetary process, but this cannot be achieved by setting arbitrary limits, without reference to what the budget aims to achieve."
"I am aware that some Member States remain convinced that the EU budget should be limited to 1% of gross national revenue."
"I do not believe that the EU’s policy objectives are compatible with such a figure."
"Are we prepared to abandon the challenges of social and economic cohesion, which are all the more pressing after enlargement?"
"Are we really being serious as regards the policy of investing in the major trans-European transport networks?"
"Are we really being serious as regards the need to foster the European research policy?"
"How can we ensure a European contribution towards combating terrorism and towards safeguarding our citizens’ security?"
"Let me state this to you clearly: we cannot have more Europe with less money and a union ceases to be a union if the objective of cohesion is forgotten."
"A 1% limit would force us to cut back on our political objectives and would force us to re-assess commitments already made."
"The Commission’s position is therefore clear: our starting point is the package submitted in February of last year."
"In spite of the Dutch Presidency’s very hard work, the negotiations have, thus far, yet to really begin."
"I sincerely hope that the Luxembourg Presidency will be able to drive this process forward and ensure that effective negotiations go ahead, because it is important that we respect the timetable established in the Council’s multiannual strategic programme."
"We must ensure that the programmes are fully up and running by 1 January 2007."
"This means that we must reach a political agreement in June of next year."
"There is one thing I can promise: as always, the Commission will not be the stumbling block to the outcome of negotiations."
"We shall help the Member States to reach agreements, but not at any price."
"In the short time between the confirmation of the new Commission and the forthcoming European Council, we will have seen important developments both internationally – in particular in Ukraine – and for the Union."
"With the decisions on enlargement and security that the European Council will take this week, we are showing in practical ways our confidence in the future of our continent."
"We are showing how we can succeed in projecting the values that we hold dear into the international arena and extending the ring of prosperity, solidarity and security further across our continent and the world."
". – Mr President, as with all European Councils, the next one has some very interesting topics to discuss."
"I would go further and say that they are not just interesting; they are perhaps crucial to our Union’s collective future. Consequently, not only will the Heads of State or Government be taking part, but also the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission."
"At this time, we must ask for three indispensable qualities: ambition, adequate resources and practical ideas."
"Let us look at what this means with regard to each of those topics."
"Whilst the process of admitting Bulgaria and Romania appears to be going well and the result of genuine efforts on the part of the two countries, we are strongly aware, however, that Romania needs to sprint down the home straight. Whilst we too have no doubts about Croatia – you only need to have been to Zagreb or Dubrovnik to appreciate how embedded it is in European culture – Turkey is a special case, not only due to its geography, but also due to its peculiar cultural and economic characteristics."
"The case of Cyprus must not be swept under the carpet while we discuss negotiations."
"Nevertheless, the opening of negotiations will undoubtedly help to clarify for both sides many areas that are currently in doubt and it will eventually be possible to gauge more clearly what kind of Union would be preferable to both sides."
"After all, there are other types of union apart from marriage that could potentially be considered."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, terrorism is certainly one of the Council’s most important portfolios and we must combat it globally and unstintingly."
"Rogue states that harbour international terrorism, with varying degrees of legality, must be sanctioned by the EU without delay. International cooperation at various levels – political, financial or operational – must also take place without delay."
"In this area, there must be no delay and no lack of resources."
"This brings me to the Financial Perspectives, a portfolio that, as far as we are concerned, will set the tone for Europe’s desire to deepen our Union."
"The resources must match the ambition."
"This is something that Jacques Delors said, and with good reason."
"It is not possible, moreover, to cheat the countries that recently joined our European Union, nor those looking hopefully to the EU as an engine to propel democracy and development forward in their countries."
"Let us be clear. To think that Europe, the new Europe, our Europe, can be built with the resources of the past is a fallacy and it is worth saying that if ambition and solidarity do not go hand in hand at this summit and in the orientations and guidelines that are adopted, we should be ashamed of our current leaders."
"Mr President, this brings me to external affairs."
"The Council services tell us that the Council is to discuss the Middle East, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Mediterranean Partnership and, I should add, probably the situation in Ukraine, Darfur, relations with China and Russia and even Transatlantic relations."
"What I am wondering is that with an agenda of which I have only mentioned a few topics, with the desire for a joint, EU-level external service, what resources will we use to seek to influence the international scene?"
"Will we continue to be a soft power, striving for multilateralism without being in any way active on the international scene? Or will we have at our disposal the resources – the appropriate resources – to finally stop being the political dwarf of the international scene?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall conclude by saying what I said at the beginning."
"It is crucial that we speak about the Lisbon Strategy, about combating drugs or AIDS, about the new neighbourhood policy and about sustainable development."
"If, however, we do not have the three elements of ambition, adequate resources and practical ideas, we will be speaking as though we were autistic."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should very much like to have been present at a meeting of the Portuguese Social Democrats."
"The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, has frequently told us of his ‘blind dates’, which have attracted the particular interest of this House."
"This morning I have now heard from Mr Pinheiro that he prefers forms of cohabitation other than marriage."
"Interesting things are going on in Portugal."
"In this instance, Mr Pinheiro, we are no advocates of the common law marriage the EU is to enter into with Turkey."
"We wish relations between the EU and Turkey to be strong, resilient, and stable – in good Christian Democrat style."
"I would also warn you against speaking of cultural differences, Mr Pinheiro."
"Zagreb may well look European, and so does Istanbul, but this is not the issue at stake; what is at stake, and this is a point I should like to repeat, is whether we are in a position to define what Mr Eurlings gave a precise description of in his report, namely that the European Union is a community of values – a political community of values – and that it is based on the Constitution with which we have endowed ourselves and on the Charter of Fundamental Rights we have enshrined in the Constitution."
"This community of values is open to everyone who shares these values, without any kind of cultural relativity, and this is a point I should like to reiterate once again."
"This is self-evident to our group, and, yesterday, we decided with what I think was almost 99% of votes within our group ..."
"in an open ballot, not a secret ballot, to give Mr Eurlings our support for his belief that, if this order of values can be enshrined in a Muslim society, it will be proof that this order of values is open to every person, of whatever religion, skin colour and cultural or ethnic background they may be."
"The reason why this is such an important issue, Mr Pinheiro, is that the fight against terrorism is also a subject for discussion at the European Council summit and during the preliminary debates."
"I believe that there is a direct connection between this issue and the question of whether we will manage to disprove the theory that the Islam of the most dangerous terrorists currently active, the Islamic fundamentalists, which they describe as the only Islam, and the order of values I referred to a moment ago are mutually exclusive."
"I believe that the mere opening of negotiations with Turkey, a step which also means that Turkey is prepared to submit to the Constitution and its rules, is evidence that the implementation of a secular social reality is not linked in any way to religion, but instead to the political will of a people."
"This is the crucial point, and this is an important contribution to the fight against terrorism."
"I therefore believe that the debate on Turkey and the debate on the fight against terrorism are two sides of the same coin."
"During yesterday’s preparations for today’s debate, we too discussed Romania and Bulgaria, and developments in both these countries."
"I will not deny that we regret that our friend, Mr Nastase, lost the presidential elections."
"It was a fair decision, and we should like to congratulate Mr Basescu."
"We only hope that Mr Basescu has a sufficient sense of responsibility, something which he did not demonstrate during the election campaign, not to enter into coalitions with parties in his country which are opposed to the European Union and which ride roughshod over our fundamental values."
"You may be sure, Mr Watson, that we will continue to observe Romania as closely as you have done to date, particularly with regard to the issue of whether the future Romanian President forms a coalition with the extreme right."
"This is something you can depend on, and something we will observe particularly closely."
"We believe that the debate that is on the Council’s agenda ..."
"should consolidate what the European Union has achieved in its role as mediator in Ukraine under the Dutch Presidency of the Council."
"On behalf of our group, I should like to say – and I also address these words to the Dutch Presidency – that the European Union has provided an enormous amount of support throughout what has been going on in Ukraine over recent weeks, which represents a fundamental shift in the internal political situation towards democracy, freedom and human rights."
"It was the EU that acted as mediator in the country, and I believe that the staunch support of all those concerned, including the Dutch Presidency, has made it possible to achieve progress which will result in a greater degree of democracy, and which has proven that a united European Union, combining its forces and deploying them jointly, can make a genuine contribution to international politics."
"For this we are grateful, and we would like to extend our renewed thanks to all those involved, including Mr Solana, Mr Kwaśniewski and also the Dutch Presidency."
"Mr Nicolaï, I would ask you to pass on our group’s thanks to the Council."
". Mr President, the Netherlands presidency is likely to be remembered for the decision on Turkey."
"A majority of the members of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe believe that Turkey fulfils the political criteria and that you should open negotiations."
"It seems to us important that Europe should not define itself as a Christian club."
"And yet, by the same token, we must beware of an aggressive secularism, which could drive away many of those who belong in our community."
"I pay tribute to the work of Mr Eurlings in drawing up the report on Turkey for this House; a report which I think commands widespread support."
"Mr President-in-Office, when it discusses Turkey, your Council will meet in secret."
"It is important that in this House, when we discuss and vote on Turkey, we do so openly and in public and not in secret."
"I also recommend to the Council that we have a discussion in our Union about the European Union's capacity to absorb new Member States, particularly countries beyond those which currently have candidate status."
"I recommend that we have a discussion on the nature of the European Union, because it is our vision of the European Union that will determine its borders, rather than our vision of countries wishing to join."
"The Council will also discuss Bulgaria and Romania."
"My Group has long believed that these two countries – and indeed others – should have separate accession treaties."
"Bulgaria closed all of its negotiating chapters earlier this year and has made good progress."
"In Romania, progress has been much less easy to see."
"For me, the election results this week give cause for hope."
"I believe that the concerns of many can now be set aside and that with resolve and goodwill, we can bring Romania into the European Union effectively in 2007."
"I say to my friend Mr Schulz: for heaven's sake stop defending corrupt socialist regimes, whether in the Maldives, the Seychelles or in Romania."
"I thought Mr Basescu was actually a member of the Socialist International, but I may be wrong."
"You should not be defending regimes which are doing things that are not worthy of your party."
"I believe that we now have the chance to move ahead with Romania and we must do so."
"On Croatia, President-in-Office, I recommend that you hold open the door, but insist on full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"High on your agenda, too, will be terrorism and I pay tribute to the work of the Council's anti-terrorism coordinator."
"You need promptly to put into practice measures that have been identified in the Hague Programme relevant to combating terrorism, in particular, measures relating to exchange of information between Member States."
"Efforts to combat terrorism must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and the Council must stress the importance of promoting respect based on universal values, tolerance, dialogue and democratic participation."
"Too often, our approach in this Union to the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice has concentrated on security and justice at the expense of freedom."
"I hope that your presidency, Mr President-in-Office, will ensure that the balance is set right."
"We need to get our police forces and judiciary working together."
"We need to move the European Union from being simply an economic community into seeing itself as a community of values."
"But for that to have the support of our citizens, it means recognising the fundamental importance of the values outlined in our Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The appropriate financial framework will be discussed in a building aptly named after a Dutchman, Mr Justus Lipsius."
"My Group welcomes the methodical approach of your presidency to preparations for the Union's budget from 2007 to 2013, but we are not sure whether your building blocks are independent building blocks or a Rubik's Cube."
"Is any outcome possible other than the one per cent to which your country was a signatory in the letter to Mr Prodi?"
"It seems to my Group that we need to give the European Union the resources it needs."
"It is better to spend 1.2 per cent well than to spend less than 1 per cent badly."
"While, as a Scot, I welcome the approach of my soulmates in the Netherlands to the financing of the Union, I believe that the Council must give the Union the resources it needs."
"You must also heed the report of the Court of Auditors and tackle the failure in our Member States to put adequate controls in place on the spending of European Union money."
"In conclusion, the Council will discuss ESDP."
"Operation 'Althea' is working successfully and three other ongoing missions are examples of solid progress."
"Let the Union's voice be heard in our neighbourhood policy and in our relations with China, the United States and Russia."
"Although the headline of the forthcoming European Council may be Turkey – and we should expect no less for a pillar of European civilisation – beyond the headlines there is much important work to do in foreign and security policy."
"Mr President, I have never made use of this Rule before, but I would ask to be allowed the following clarification."
"I would never defend a corrupt regime, whether headed by socialists or by anyone else, and this is something I should like to stress at this point."
"Rather than defending anyone, I merely appealed to Mr Basescu."
"I made no reference to any corrupt politician, in any country, and I should like, here and now, to say that any person who is corrupt should be punished and should not head a government."
"It is however equally unacceptable for people to come under general suspicion merely because they belong to a certain political family."
"It is clear that Mr Schulz has spoken pursuant to Rule 145 of the Rules of Procedure, which allows Members to speak for three minutes in response to personal comments made during the debate."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall use two minutes of Mr Schulz’s speaking time, which means that I have five minutes to speak."
"Our debate today is on culture, and on what is and what is not European culture."
"It is an issue on which I should like to make a few comments."
"I am always sceptical when anyone tells me that things are culturally incompatible, and this is perhaps due to family reasons."
"We are all aware of how often Jews have been persecuted for marrying non-Jews, and how often white people have been persecuted for marrying black people, and such persecution has always been carried out under the pretext of cultural incompatibility."
"I am also astonished at the emotional fervour, or in some cases even political blindness, with which debates relating to Turkey are conducted. I am well aware that there are worthy people with worthy arguments who are opposed to Turkey’s accession to the EU."
"It is entirely normal for worthy arguments to exist both for and against such an accession, and yet I am perplexed by the level of aggressiveness of those who are opposed to Turkey joining the EU."
"The basis for racism is always irrationality, and I cannot help but think that certain arguments against Turkey’s accession are not political, but purely cultural, or, in other words, racist."
"We cannot tolerate such a thing."
"What kind of an example are we setting to Turkey and to the world?"
"Mr Poettering has told this House that this is the most important decision to be taken by the European Parliament and by Europe in recent years, and that, as it is so important, we should take the decision in utmost secrecy, so that everyone is left in the dark with regard to how we have reached our position on this important issue."
"This House is to hold a secret ballot."
"Can you just be quiet?"
"Afterwards, you may speak for three minutes, like Mr Schulz."
"I shall say what I wish to say, and you may say what you wish to say."
"You may speak after I have finished."
"If Members of this House demand secrecy, it is because they do not want voters throughout Europe to know where we as individual Members stand on this key issue."
"It is a disgrace to democracy that the vote should be conducted in this way."
"It is a scandal."
"You should give some consideration to what the people of Turkey will think."
"One can perfectly well be opposed to Turkey’s accession, but what will the men and women of Turkey think if they are told that this is an issue they are not allowed to know anything about?"
"Do Europeans really want us to hold sittings in public and to provide public records of votes, as preached repeatedly and especially in Mr Poettering’s incessant sermons to the Council?"
"This is something we wish to know, and this is something that is enshrined in the Constitution."
"This Parliament, a moral authority for good behaviour, has suddenly decided on the most incomprehensible and undemocratic course of action possible, and I find this impossible to understand."
"I should like to make one more remark on Romania."
"Cultural differences sometimes also exist between the EU and societies which will shortly be joining it, for example the pervasive corruption in Romania, something which is a simple fact."
"We therefore call on the Romanian Parliament to take us seriously."
"Romania should be accepted into the EU, but only after it has met the Copenhagen criteria."
"At present it does not yet meet them, which is a fact that must be stated, and we should not accept it until it does. Romania will be accepted ..."
"... make use of a Rule of which others have also availed themselves, and I have no doubts as to this being the case."
"Despite any claims to the contrary by Mr Cohn-Bendit, I am not connected in any way to this matter, and I disapprove of his having used bogus arguments which bear no relation to the truth."
". Mr President, on 17 December a decision is to be taken on whether accession negotiations with Turkey should be opened."
"Accession to the EU represents a major opportunity for Turkey, as there is still a need for the values it represents, such as the rule of law, democracy and human rights, to gain acceptance there."
"There is therefore an urgent need for the negotiations to be conducted transparently, and for the democratic changes necessary in Turkey to be spelled out."
"This is particularly true in the case of the violent clashes in the Kurdish regions, and I would call on the Kurds and the Turkish armed forces to reach a ceasefire and to seek a political solution."
"I am extremely concerned at the increase in human rights violations and homicides, for example the case of the 12-year-old Urud and his father, as well as the new proceedings which have been initiated with the aim of banning the Union of Education and Science Workers."
"If there are to be accession negotiations, it would be up to Turkey to demonstrate, by means of a genuine implementation of its reform plans, that all Turkish citizens, regardless of their origin, are accorded the same rights, that there is equality of the sexes and that certain religions are no longer discriminated against in favour of others."
"It is crucial for the Ankara Government not only to adopt laws in order to meet the Copenhagen criteria, but also to implement them in practice."
"The 20 million Kurds in Turkey hope that, when accession negotiations are opened, their rights, too, will be secured, that they will be able to express their identity freely, that they will be acknowledged and that it will become possible for them to return to their villages."
"It is necessary for the village guard system to be abolished and for the 10% clause for elections to be reduced."
"Last weekend thousands of people demonstrated in Diyarbakir for the opening of accession negotiations."
"As a German MEP of Kurdish origin, I should like to join my group in calling for accession negotiations with Turkey to be opened, and we call on all Heads of Government to make known, on 17 December, their support for the opening of accession negotiations."
"The European Union should not fear Ankara, and Ankara should not fear Diyarbakir."
"Turkey can act as a bridge between the EU and Islamic countries."
"Mr President, I want to make my point of order just as Mr Schulz made his."
"Last month you refused a point of order from me because I did not mention the number of the Rule."
"On this occasion, Mr Schulz was allowed to make a point of order without mentioning a Rule number."
"Could you say what the rules are and why there is one rule for him and another for me?"
"I believe that you are invoking Rule 145."
"I am merely asking why there is one rule for him and one rule for me."
"You were in the chair both times."
"Is it not time that you understood the Rules?"
"Mr Knapman, please behave properly."
"If you wish to speak, please tell me which Rule you wish to invoke."
"If you tell me that you wish to speak on the basis of no particular Rule, you do not have the right to take the floor."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the next Council summit will focus on Turkey, and I shall do the same in my speech, even though the French sovereignists, as I noted the day before yesterday, have already made known the reasons for their opposition."
"This time I would like to look at the issue from a different angle, and to warn the Council against the decision it is going to take."
"It is my belief that this decision will have extremely serious consequences, not merely as a result of Turkey’s entry, but also in terms of the European Union’s image amongst the peoples of Europe."
"Firstly, the public is less and less sure of what we regard as our borders."
"If Turkey were allowed to join, the borders would be blurred, and the door would be open to a large number of Turkish-speaking countries, including the countries of the Caucasus such as Georgia."
"In short, we are currently slipping into a kind of world state, the foundation for which is merely a hazy catalogue of good intentions labelled ‘human rights’."
"This development is incomprehensible to many Europeans, all the more so because – and this is my second point – we are at the same time turning our back on what Europeans see as the essence of Europe, and what has been loosely, and perhaps clumsily, described as its Christian roots."
"In spite of everything, there is a very well-defined idea of the way of life and civilisations of which Europe is made up."
"We are moving ever further away from these, and we no doubt do not realise the extent to which we are insulting and shocking citizens, trapped as we are in the hustle and bustle of the globalised elite."
"My third point is that the first consequences will not be long in coming."
"The forthcoming referendum has meant that the French people are beginning to see the link between Turkey and the Constitution, and they will vote accordingly."
"I would therefore like to remind the Council of their responsibility for the outcome of the decisions they take next Friday."
". Mr President, no matter how much you try to dance around the issue, the subject of Turkey is bound to be divisive."
"It is bound to create the kind of tensions and inflame the passions that we have seen not only here this morning, but also in our debate yesterday."
"One of the most important issues that we have to look at as a Parliament and as a Union is: what message do we send if we refuse to open the door to negotiations with Turkey at the weekend?"
"We set down certain rules and criteria which must be met by Turkey before negotiations can be allowed to begin."
"The Commission has laid out a very clear blueprint of how much has been achieved and what has yet to be done before we reach the final hurdle."
"But we have also demanded that Turkey should fulfil its responsibilities and duties."
"There is, for instance, the question of the recognition of Cyprus and the independence and integrity of Cyprus."
"Then there are certain human rights issues that were mentioned by Mr Coûteaux, the previous speaker."
"It is interesting to hear a Kurd speaking about Turkey being part of the European Union."
"That is an important message that we should take acknowledge and follow."
"Our voice, our message, will determine whether or not the voice of moderate Muslims will be heard or whether we drive people back into a fundamentalist response and attitude."
"That is why, if we oppose Turkey coming into the European Union because we are fearful of its impact on our economies or its impact on the balance of power within the institutions, we should say so clearly."
"We should not try to hide behind some false pretence that it is going to change the way Europe operates forever."
"The European Union of today is a very different animal from its 1973 incarnation."
"Indeed, one of the things that is lacking in the European Union of today is the vision and inspiration of the founding fathers who made the phoenix of peace, prosperity and solidarity rise from the ashes."
"The responsibility of and onus on this generation to extend a hand to other countries is as great today as it was in the 1940s and 1950s."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the request by a number of members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for a secret vote on the Eurlings report speaks volumes about the impudent manner in which the advocates of Turkey’s accession to the EU – including the governments of the Member States in London, Berlin, Rome, but also the Belgian Government in Brussels – slavishly implement Washington’s agenda and bring pressure to bear on members of parliament and politicians, against the will of the large majority of the people, to push through a decision which will have dramatic historic and social implications for Europe."
"Indeed, quite a few members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wish to vote against the Eurlings report because they are squarely opposed to Turkey joining, but dare to do so only when the way they vote is concealed from the general public."
"For fear of possible criticism, though, and of all the consequences that this entails for their careers in their own countries, where their governments, haughtily laughing off popular opinion, want to give Ankara the go-ahead the day after tomorrow, they will not do so if the vote is public and not secret."
"The same may apply to quite a few Members of the Socialist Group."
"I would remind you of the valiant positions taken up in France on the Turkey issue by Robert Badinter, Hubert Védrine and the former Socialist Education Minister, Claude Allègre, all of whom have cautioned us about the disastrous consequences of Turkey’s possible accession."
"It is indicative of the lack of democratic openness with which this issue has been addressed for years now."
"In Helsinki, only three minutes were taken to discuss the question as to whether Turkey should obtain candidate status. That is what is reported by the former European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Mr Bolkestein, who was the only person with the courage to tell Mr Prodi that he refused to approve the positive Commission recommendation of 6 October."
"Three minutes to decide whether we move the hotbeds of conflict in the Caucasus and the Middle East to Europe’s boundaries."
"Three minutes to decide whether tomorrow, we will again offer millions of immigrants the opportunity to flood our continent."
"Three minutes to decide whether we allow a country, where human rights in general and women’s rights in particular are violated on a large scale, entry into our Union as a so-called model secular state and straight away give them the largest number of votes in the Council."
"Three minutes to give the go-ahead to a country that refuses to recognise another Member State and occupies part of that Member State with 30 000 troops after having committed untold crimes against humanity."
"Three minutes to give the go-ahead to a country where the state’s denial of the Armenian genocide is organised by the Ministry of Education, while nobody in Europe utters a word about this."
"I ask you, Europe, where are your grand principles?"
"Mr President, we are at an important crossroads here in this House and the key issue these days – not only in politics, but also among the public – is, of course, the possible start of negotiations with Turkey."
"As rapporteur, I should like to say, as I have said before, that my visits there have left me in two minds."
"On the one hand, there is a great deal of progress, and impressive progress too; on the other, Turkey is still trailing behind quite a bit if we were to compare that country with a country that really wants to become a Member of the European Union."
"That is why reforms have to continue in the areas of human rights, women’s rights and religious freedom."
"I cannot emphasise enough that pressure in those areas must be simply unrelenting."
"Indeed, the Turkish media and Turkish journalists urge us to use the stick and carrot approach and keep up the pressure."
"Human rights have to be implemented more effectively."
"A switch in mentality is required in the area of religious minorities, so that people are proud of minority religions instead of trying to oppress them."
"In the field of, for example, the law on foundations, further legal amendments must be tabled in order to offer scope to minority religions and minority cultures."
"That is why, quite apart from the whole core discussion that has been going on for months in this House and elsewhere, I should like to press home the fact that it would be good if an important section of the report that is now before us for final vote were also to be included in the Council’s conclusions. It concerns the following."
"I shall read out a few sentences in English, because I have the English text in front of me."
"'Considers that the opening of accession negotiations is to be recommended so long as it is agreed that, in the first phase of the negotiations, priority is given to the full implementation of the political criteria; that therefore the agenda of negotiations at ministerial level will start with the assessment of the fulfilment of the political criteria, especially in the area of human rights and full fundamental freedoms in both theory and practice, in the meantime opening up the opportunity to put other chapters on the agenda of the negotiations;'"
"I think that this emphasis on the political criteria is necessary, because not everyone in Turkey realises that the reforms will need to be carried out consistently if the country really wants to qualify for membership of the European Union."
"I think that these further reforms will determine whether or not Turkey will be able to do this."
"I have another brief remark to make."
"If we discuss political criteria, then I would like to say that if I compare Turkey to, for example, Romania, and I consider the poor treatment in prisons, the physical attacks on investigative journalists and corruption, I take the view that the Council should send out a message, and maximum pressure should be brought to bear in order to solve such matters."
"In my view, those practices are not in line with the political criteria which we uphold."
"My final remark concerns terrorism."
"I am glad that the President-in-Office of the Council has made this a key issue."
"I am also glad that the Netherlands – in the spirit of practising what you preach – will now finally start banning organisations that are on the European list of terrorists."
"I should like to ask the presidency to convey to the other Member States that we should stand united in this."
"Consequently, to name but one concrete example, ETA should be banned in all countries, and not only in Spain and France."
"Can the presidency guarantee now that with the exchange of information agreement, it will no longer be possible for one country to hold information about attacks in another country, without this information being automatically exchanged?"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that Parliament will adopt the Eurlings report on Turkey in the version approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and I also hope it will do so by secret ballot."
"I believe that my fellow Members are wrong in thinking that a secret ballot may favour a shift away from that position; on the contrary, I expect that Members in this Chamber will demonstrate that they are not subject to any pressures when freely carrying out their mandate."
"As regards the remainder of the foreign reports, I agree with much of what Mr Nicolaï said and I should like to express our agreement on all the measures that bring forward constitutional reforms."
"In the High Representative’s actions in Ukraine we have glimpsed a sign that the initiative in that direction is being strengthened."
"The initiative should, however, be supported by more substantial instruments, which are foreseen in the Constitution but which might perhaps be brought forward."
"With regard to the neighbourhood policy, we encourage the Commission and the Council in their work."
"We point out the danger, however, that the measures to create a free-trade area may take precedence over the other policies."
"I would stress that we do not just want to create a free-trade area, and so we should be careful not to weaken the policy’s regional and subregional dimension."
"As regards human rights and democracy, I recommend that we negotiate a proper convention with our neighbouring countries."
"Such a convention should at last spell out the shared values that we so often refer to and define them carefully in formal terms, particularly for the sake of the Mediterranean countries."
"The convention should make those values known to the people whom they concern and it should set up joint institutions that can guarantee them."
"Regarding the Middle East, we must ensure that the presidential elections in Palestine give the road map a new boost and that the Israeli Government’s unilateral decisions, such as the withdrawal from Gaza, are included in the negotiations with the Quartet, so that the creation of the Palestinian state can be completed within the established time frame."
"To that end, this issue will have to be placed at the heart of the relationship between the European Union and the United States."
"On the subject of Iraq, we consider that the hoped-for turnaround has failed to materialise even after the Sharm el-Sheikh conference and that the aim of holding elections may well be jeopardised by the violent situation in the country."
"Finally, I call on the Council and the Commission to devote attention also to the situation in Cambodia, where there is a humanitarian emergency concerning children."
"Mr President, the Dutch Presidency is nearly at an end."
"In the first place, I should like to assess the efforts it has made towards reducing regulation at European level."
"The aim was to end the Brussels bureaucracy and to cut the number of regulations it produced by at least 25%."
"Needless to say, we are far from reaching that percentage, but the tone has been set, and I regard that as a great bonus in itself."
"After all, if there are fewer rules and regulations, there is more room for entrepreneurship, because it is the entrepreneurs who have to save the European economy."
"I still think it desirable, though, to appoint a European Commissioner to focus solely on the elimination of superfluous and obsolete rules."
"A second topic addressed during the Dutch Presidency was the so-called Hague decisions about terrorism and combating crime."
"The agreements reached in The Hague illustrate that the European Union and the Council too – at long last – consider the fight against terrorism and crime as one of their priorities."
"At the same time, a balance has been struck between an effective approach and extra legal scope on the one hand and the protection of personal data and fundamental freedoms on the other."
"After all, we are still being put through our paces on that score, and I think that the Council has done a reasonably good job."
"The topic of human rights has not received a great deal of attention, but sound work has been done on it."
"I would particularly mention the protection of the defenders of human rights."
"Under the Dutch Presidency, the practical implementation of the EU directives concerning human rights defenders has moved one step closer."
"A manual will be compiled for the EU delegations across the world; it will provide for a prompt, flexible and consistent reaction from the EU when human rights defenders are in peril of death or are at risk of abuse."
"I congratulate Mr Nicolaï on the inclusion in the agenda of the need for good communication about European integration."
"The public still considers Europe to be far removed from their own personal lives and are far too ready to turn their backs on it."
"It is only by frequent communication and a constant dialogue with the citizen, not only by the Members of this House, but also by the members of the Commission and the Council, that this gap can be bridged."
"I should like to finish off with a remark about the debate about standards and values with which this presidency started."
"As a Liberal, I feel hesitant about such a debate, in general, and about the purely Christian nature that the Christian Democrats tend to lend it, in particular."
"I also find it objectionable that the Left have devalued the terms ‘standards’ and ‘values’."
"It is important that this debate should have made a start; after all, it is a debate about what Europe is, where it should be heading, where our boundaries are and what we are doing, or not, as the case may be."
"In short, it is a debate about where our foundations lie."
"Money is not, indeed, the EU’s only ."
"I think that Mr Balkenende’s article in of 7 December was excellent; one of his conclusions was that the Union is about dynamic values."
"I see these as including respect, responsibility and confidence."
"We have in any event made a start on the discussion and although the end is not in sight by a long way, this is still worth a compliment for this presidency."
"On a final note, the presidency has definitely brought the European Union closer to the Dutch people and even to members of the Dutch parliament."
"This, I know, is Mr Nicolaï’s crusade, and it has proved very successful; as a Dutch MEP, I too am pleased with it."
"Mr President, I should like to start with the financial perspective."
"At the summit, I hope that you will really take the time to discuss at length the kind of Europe that you have in mind, before you pass this subject back to the specialist ministers."
"Some Member States want a smaller budget than the present one, which is just above 1%."
"The Council prescribes that no cuts must be made in the agricultural budget, and it seems unlikely that any agreement will be reached on cuts in the structural funds."
"Where do you think cuts will be made?"
"They will be made in research and development, human rights, the environment, external affairs, youth exchanges and culture – precisely those areas which are close to people’s hearts and which visibly add value at European level."
"A budget that is born of euroscepticism will only breed more of it."
"With regard to terrorism, the draft conclusions of the forthcoming summit state that we, in our efforts to fight terrorism, must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"While agreeing with those conditions, I fear that this may be no more than an incantation."
"I would refer to the discussion about storing communications data of all telephone and Internet users or the biometric data on passports."
"The motto is: strict, stricter, strictest."
"It seems almost inappropriate to ask critical questions about the effectiveness or the legitimacy of measures against terrorism."
"Like all army generals, those fighting terrorism in Europe always want the top gear."
"At least in defence purchases, politicians always independently weigh up costs and benefits."
"Where measures to fight terrorism are concerned, though, almost nobody dares make this critical assessment."
"Nonetheless, I would invite you to do just that at the forthcoming summit, because at this rate, we will mess up our rule of law, and terrorists will have their way after all."
"Finally, I should like to make a brief comment about transparency."
"The Dutch Presidency has pledged to try to emphasise the implementation of the clause in the Constitution on the basis of which the Member States will have public meetings henceforth – after all, they were all agreed on this when the Constitution was signed – or at least hold more of them in public."
"I should like to ask Mr Nicolaï what he has achieved on that score."
"I hope that during the Luxembourg Presidency, the doors of the Council of Ministers will be truly open."
"We will then be able to see in all openness what is going on, and it will be possible for ministers to be held responsible for the decisions taken, as we today are keen to be held responsible for the decision we are taking on Turkey."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, the conclusions of the summit of the European Union to be held on 16 and 17 December are so important that they determine to a significant degree the physiognomy of the European Union."
"Enlargement, with the possible opening of negotiations with Turkey, requires decisions, the consequences of which will be decisive."
"We must clarify from the outset that we are not against Turkey's European prospects."
"We expect such prospects to bind any country pursuing such prospects within a minimum framework of obligations pertaining to basic issues which apply to the other Member States, such as fundamental freedoms, civil rights and workers' rights, without of course harbouring any illusions."
"However, these obligations must be laid down from the outset and be accepted by Turkey."
"How could it ever be possible for a candidate country to be allowed not to recognise the existence of another Member State and for this issue not to be clearly laid down at the summit?"
"How will this question be answered if there is real equality between the Member States or if, ultimately, there are two sets of standards and two yardsticks?"
"It is, in my opinion, a not only for there to be mutual recognition but also for there to be normalisation of relations between Cyprus and Turkey, not only because the European Union and the principles which govern its operation so command, but also because the Cyprus problem needs to be resolved in order for right to prevail for the benefit of our people, both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots."
"No nation in the world wants the illegal occupation of and hatred and partition in their country and this cannot be perpetuated."
"The European Union must open a window for the safeguarding of the basic principles of its very existence and call for the application of this minimum framework of obligations and must also open a window for the simple citizens by showing that it does not take decisions using two sets of standards and two yardsticks."
"To close, I wish to condemn the arrogant conduct of the Turkish leadership and its government when, in the statements it makes, the impression is given that it is the European Union which is asking for Turkey to join and not Turkey which is asking to join the European Union."
"Mr President, nothing could show Mr Barroso's contempt for this Parliament more than the fact that he could only attend this debate for a few minutes before disappearing."
"On the subject of Ukraine, after the way in which he pushed through the election of his criminals and Commissioners, let us stop pretending that we can in any way lecture Ukraine on democracy."
"With regard to Turkey, we will not be supporting its membership application, just as we did not in the last Parliament, on the grounds of both cost and likely migration patterns."
"Had anybody in authority been here, I would have asked for confirmation that the cost could be in the order of GBP 19 billion or EUR 28 million."
"This means that Turkey is costing us as much as the ten countries that acceded to this Union this year."
"Could we please know what the cost will be, because for the first time you are hearing from a nation that is actually paying for it."
"Although the Labour Party in Britain wants to put GBP 5 billion towards it, the Conservative Party believes that GBP 5 billion is a good price to pay and believes you can still have tax cuts."
"Presumably it also thinks that pigs can fly."
"Can we actually have confirmation of the cost of 19 billion?"
"Also, will some EUR 700 million be spent on around 60 diverse training projects in Turkey?"
"Is that the true cost, or is there a more up-to-date figure?"
"We know that Turkey's population growth rate remains phenomenal and that it has serious economic problems, including 70 per cent inflation."
"Seventy per cent inflation during the passage of the Maastricht Treaty would have caused some raising of eyebrows, but it is just a political project here, is it not?"
"Especially for those who do not pay."
"We also know that human rights concerns are widespread."
"On that basis I would say, on behalf of the UK Independence Party, that we will offer Turkey friendship and free trade, but we will not offer the country political union – especially with the corruption and fraud that are endemic in this place."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council will be particularly significant because, as the representatives of both institutions have indicated, it will certainly have to deal with particularly important subjects, such as the enlargement of the Union to include Bulgaria and Romania, the possible start of negotiations with Croatia and Turkey, a review of progress in the fight against terrorism and, in particular, the addition of information capacity within the General Secretariat of the Council and the preparation of the financial framework for the period 2007-2013."
"We have often said that Bulgaria and Romania ought to join the Union, though we are particularly concerned about the areas in which there is still a wide gap between the current situation in those two countries and the European average."
"In that respect we would point to their legislation on human rights, social protection for workers and economic development, which should reach significant levels by the end of the decade."
"Although in principle we are in favour of starting negotiations with Turkey – which, I stress, is a very different thing from accession – we must not forget the need for its acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide and for a lasting solution to the Cyprus question."
"To somebody with any common sense, it is incomprehensible that a country that aspires to join the Union should be militarily occupying part of another country that is already a member."
"We are not at all worried about the voting system that we should use."
"I believe in the freedom of all Members to make their own decisions, regardless of whether the vote is open or in secret."
"I think this is just a formality and certainly not a question of any substance."
"The fight against terrorism is closely linked to the development of the Middle East peace process and the situation in certain countries where conflicts are not yet over."
"I believe, however, that the Union should maintain an ever stronger presence through its policies and aid in those parts of the world that surround it and in which there are ongoing, sometimes tragic situations of conflict. By doing so it can exert a stabilising influence to support those sections of society that accept the values which characterise our democracy."
"Mr President, Mr Nicolaï, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that Mr Nicolaï will not leave the Chamber this time, as he did during the last debate on the EU’s relations with Russia."
"Mr Barroso, who has already left, said that the December Council would be a great step towards the building of a more prosperous Europe."
"Judging from Mr Nicolaï’s comments, however, it is more likely to be a small and timid step, not a great one."
"I am not the only one who feels that the Council is working without any kind of serious vision and without any long-term strategy, that it lurches from one event to another, and that it merely reacts to problems without any long-term plan of how it should act to avoid them."
"This lack of strategy is a fundamental error, and it gives rise to a great many problems."
"Much is now being said by the Council on the subject of Ukraine, and many of its comments are entirely relevant."
"Yet if the Council had stated clearly a few months ago, as part of its future strategy, that Ukraine would join the European Union, not today, not tomorrow and not the day after tomorrow, but maybe at the same time as Turkey, then the current situation in Ukraine would not have arisen, as the Ukrainian Government would not have been able to afford to rig the elections to such an extent."
"There is one thing I should like to thank the absent Mr Barroso for, namely that he was in favour of a larger budget for the European Union."
"An increase of EUR 114 billion over seven years will promote the development of both the EU and the new Member States."
"Mr President, the meeting of the European Council later this week is of historic significance, primarily because of the fundamental issue of the opening of negotiations with Turkey on future membership of the EU."
"There are very strongly held views on this issue across this Parliament and beyond."
"I acknowledge that."
"However, the policy of my party is clear: we believe that in the right circumstances Turkish membership of the Union could be good for Europe, good for Turkey and good for relations with the Islamic world and security in our societies."
"I accept that the negotiations with Turkey are likely to be lengthy and at times difficult, but this week the Council should take a first step in that process."
"Like any other applicant country, Turkey must satisfy all the criteria required in terms of human rights and economic and political reform."
"This might be very difficult, but by agreeing to the formal opening of negotiations the Council will send a clear message to the Turkish Government that we expect it to work assiduously to achieve the steps necessary for eventual membership."
"The issue of Bulgarian and Romanian membership of the Union will also feature on the agenda and the objective there must be to affirm the accession of both countries whilst recognising that a great amount of work remains to be done – in particular in the case of Romania – to ensure they remain on track."
"The issue of economic reform in the Union was discussed at the last Council in November."
"However, I hope that the Netherlands presidency and the heads of government will reaffirm their commitment to kick-starting the Lisbon agenda."
"Earlier this week the Socialist Group expressed concern at the neo-liberal nature of the new Commission."
"I want to make it clear that we expect Mr Barroso and his team to be true to their earlier statements on the need to reinvigorate the economy in Europe and the crack-down on red tape and regulation."
"The outdated social model so beloved of the left is to be replaced with a vigorous, dynamic and radical reform programme."
"This is the only way to deal with the high unemployment and sluggish growth that has led to Europe lagging behind the United States and the burgeoning economies of China and India."
"If the Commission acts in this way, it will get the full support of British Conservatives."
"Mr President, the next European Council is not just going to give its opinion on Turkey and other issues, but also – as Mr Nicolaï has mentioned – on the broad guidelines for the next financial perspectives."
"I would like to point out once again that the financial perspectives are an instrument of budgetary discipline and not an accounting instrument, an instrument that fundamentally serves to provide stability and allows for reasonable medium-term planning of the Union’s policies."
"This instrument is so important that it appears as a law in the future Constitution."
"The Commission yesterday and its President, Mr Barroso, today, have confirmed that they fully accept the proposal of their predecessor."
"Mr Barroso said a moment ago that the Commission’s proposal is a starting point for negotiations of the financial perspectives."
"Nevertheless, I would call on the Commission to pursue this objective energetically."
"In that way, that starting point could also become a finishing point and the Commission would thereby respond to that expression that we mention so often: we cannot create more Europe with fewer resources."
"The Council and Parliament must also fulfil their respective responsibilities and face up to the challenges confronting us."
"Firstly, economic and social cohesion is not just a principle enshrined in the Treaties and enhanced in the future Constitution, but also a necessary condition for maintaining and protecting the European social model."
"Secondly, with regard to the enlargement we have just carried out, we must not spare any effort when it comes to the new citizens of the Union."
"Thirdly, five years ago we set some very ambitious objectives."
"We are at the halfway point and we are very far from achieving, by 2010, a competitive knowledge-based society with full employment, as we proposed in Lisbon and Gothenburg."
"Fourthly, we are in the middle of the process of ratifying the European Constitution and the citizens sometimes show even more enthusiasm than their representatives."
"Faced with these challenges, we cannot be miserly towards our citizens."
"We would be making a great mistake if we were to try to incorporate them into this project we call European integration – and everything it represents – while at the same time reducing the Union’s resources."
"We must continue to build a Europe with the necessary resources, with the resources laid down in the Treaty, and use them efficiently."
"That would undoubtedly be the best guarantee we can offer future generations of a future of peace, freedom and prosperity."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have had a tough Presidency involving many controversial issues, dramatic events in the surrounding world, the procedure surrounding the Commission and, in particular, the internal political unrest caused by the appalling murder of Theo van Gogh."
"These factors must have affected your ambitions and efforts when it came to security and combating terrorism."
"Action plans and programmes are fine, but little has happened so far."
"If the European Council can make progress at the Summit, all well and good."
"It must not be forgotten that security and the fight against terrorism must never push aside protection of individual privacy."
"We have debated most of the issues on the agenda together in this House."
"You were here on Monday evening and listened to the debate on Turkey."
"In a few hours’ time, we are to vote on Mr Eurlings’ report."
"I believe that a solid majority of MEPs will vote in favour of giving Turkey a date."
"In that connection, I wish to say how deplorable it is that certain people in this House have pushed through a policy that makes the final vote secret."
"This Parliament is always at the forefront of openness and transparency, and the politician who does not dare to look his or her electorate in the eye on this issue has no place in this House."
"Nonetheless, we expect you to have the courage to take this historic decision and, notwithstanding all the difficulties, to give Turkey a starting date with a view to its obtaining full membership."
"Only in that way can the democratic process continue."
"This will also give a clear signal to the tens of thousands of Kurds in Diyarbakir who, at the weekend, demonstrated in favour of EU membership for Turkey."
"You mentioned the European security policy, together with disarmament."
"I assume that you will be discussing the agreement concluded by Iran with three of the Member States."
"It is, of course, extremely positive that Teheran intends to suspend its extraction of uranium."
"There are still, however, considerable doubts about what really lies behind this decision."
"We should be very vigilant before making any concessions to the Iranian regime, which must prove that it is serious and that it is not only, as so often, playing a strategic game."
"The mullahs in Teheran govern with an iron hand a country in which human rights are completely neglected."
"There is no reason for rewarding such a country until we see practical improvements in this area."
"The Social Democratic Government in my country maintains – although it may be mistaken, as it often is – that the issue of the embargo on arms sales to China will come up on Friday."
"If that is the case, I would remind you of the solid opposition in this House to lifting the embargo."
"This would send out completely the wrong signals to the Chinese regime."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, certain speeches on Ukraine – Mr Schulz’s in particular – have left me with a curious impression."
"After listening to certain Members of this House over the past weeks, one could be forgiven for thinking that the European Union took consistent steps to establish, support and guide the democracy movement in Ukraine."
"It would be a fine thing if this had been the case, yet in actual fact it appeared on occasion as though the EU’s high representatives were almost afraid of so much movement and so much lively and animated democracy, even during the mass demonstrations."
"I believe that lessons must be learnt from these experiences in Ukraine, and not only by the Members of this House, but also by the diplomats of the European Union and of the nation states."
"Europe’s security is also dependent on the situation in its neighbouring countries."
"This is something I have heard very frequently in recent weeks, yet it is not only our security and our well-being that is always at stake. If we are serious about the European values that we often invoke, the authoritarian and dictatorial systems around us must not be tolerated or accepted, regardless of our own interests."
"At a time of so many changes for the better in Ukraine, which we may have helped a little towards the end, even though we did far too little, we must be aware how problematic is the situation of the Belarussian people and their freedom, and we must also discuss Russia."
"It must not be said that President Putin and Russia are the same thing, as Russia has the ‘Memorial’ movement and a very strong freedom movement, and this is something that must influence our diplomatic relations with Russia and our policy towards it."
"– Mr President, a few days ahead of the abolition of the existing quotas on the international textiles and clothing trade, there is great concern over the future of thousands of companies and of more than 2.5 million workers concentrated mainly in Southern European countries. This sector has already shed more than 1 million jobs in the last ten years."
"I regret that the debate we requested on this extremely important issue has not taken place here in this House."
"It is crucial not only that we announce possible measures to prevent companies from closing and millions of workers from losing their jobs, and to dispel the threat of poverty and social exclusion that hangs over large areas in which these companies are heavily concentrated, as is the case in Portugal; it is also crucial that such measures be implemented."
"Hence the question that I ask once again: how will the impact of abolishing the quota system in those countries with the greatest concentration of the textiles and clothing industry be taken into account so that unemployment is prevented from getting any worse and so that this extremely important industry is defended?"
"I ask you, Commissioner, to ensure that this question reaches the President of the Commission, who did not deign to hear our question."
"Mr President, the EU Constitution and Turkey constitute a mismatch."
"Common citizenship and votes according to population figures will destroy the EU and give rise to dominance by the big powers."
"I want to see a Europe in which large and populous nations are able to operate better in conjunction with small countries."
"I do not understand how the Dutch Presidency can put its name to a communications strategy that will take money from opponents of the Constitution and make it available for propaganda on the part of adherents of the Constitution."
"That is in conflict with the principle of equality and is thus illegal. It is scandalous."
"The money used for propaganda is there for the purpose of selling an undemocratic Constitution to the electorate."
"It would be easier to ensure that the democracy we are losing in the Member States were at least combined in an open and democratic EU that was close to the people."
"The EU Constitution makes it incredibly difficult to amend the contents of laws."
"Any change to one of the numerous policies locked into the Constitution must first be proposed by unelectable Commissioners in Brussels and then be based upon a qualified majority in the Council of Ministers or, if appropriate, a unanimous amendment to the Constitution."
"That is not democracy."
"The undemocratic Constitution is, then, to be sold through an undemocratic distribution of funds for the purpose of providing information, so that people do not manage to discover that, crucially, they are losing what is at the very heart of democracy: the right to go to the polls and obtain a new majority and, subsequently, a new policy."
"Whether the solution to the democratic deficit is a federal bicameral system or, alternatively, our vision of a Europe of democracies is something that people should discuss and should decide in free and fair referendums in all the Member States."
"We rightly demand that Ukraine hold free and fair elections."
"Should that not also apply to ourselves?"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso, we all refer frequently to a European identity."
"Mr Barroso, you in particular have spoken a great deal about it before this House."
"It has to be said, however, that a European identity must be built first and foremost on common security and on the common economic area."
"There can be no question of a European identity if solidarity is lacking, and this lack manifests itself every time financial decisions are taken."
"I would remind you that you referred to Parliament’s key role in the drawing up of financial perspectives."
"I wonder what will become of financial solidarity and the foundation for the building of a European identity if Parliament’s proposal is cut from EUR 111 billion to EUR 106 billion?"
"If we wish to build a European identity in the shape of a common area of security or a common economic area, we must be clear where the boundaries lie for EU enlargement."
"Given that Turkey’s accession has been proposed, and that someone might well shortly propose the accession of Morocco, whilst overlooking Ukraine, it is likely to become impossible to speak of a European identity, as there will be no such identity."
"Mr President, I wish to focus this debate on the ongoing work of the Council to prepare and initiate the external relations service in advance of ratification and adoption of the Constitution, for it is the Constitution which validates that service."
"I have in my possession a letter from Mrs Wallström – the Vice-President of the Commission, who is present this morning – confirming that the outcome of the debate on the Constitution should neither be presumed nor pre-empted in any fashion."
"Yet that is precisely what is being done in this ongoing work on the new external relations service."
"That is wrong."
"As an individual Member of this House I protest against it."
"Either we acknowledge and accept the right of the nation-states to determine the fate of the Constitution, its new institutions and its working apparatuses such as the foreign service, or we do not."
"Both the Council and the Commission arrogantly continue to work as if the Constitution was already approved."
"It is a grave insult to and assault on the rights of nations and indeed the rights of people."
"Mr President, there can be no doubt that the Council summit of 17 December will go down as a memorable date in the history of the construction of Europe."
"I should, however, like to tell the President-in-Office of the Council that our fellow citizens are concerned about these future enlargements, and above all about the continuing lack of responses to the crucial question of where Europe’s borders lie."
"We are of course in favour of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession to the EU, although these countries still need assisting in their efforts, and we are also in favour of Croatia’s accession, as it will send a strong signal to the Balkans."
"Yet the situation is entirely different with regard to Turkey, a country which does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus, a Member State of the European Union which it has occupied for 30 years."
"Turkey punishes anyone who refers to the Armenian genocide, and 97% of its territory is outside Europe, which means that it has no right to join the European Union."
"This is why we hope that the Council will agree to the idea of a privileged partnership put forward by France."
"Turkey’s integration into the EU would be tantamount to rejecting a political Europe straightaway, before it has even come into being, and to perpetuating the image of a Europe subject to blackmail and pressure."
"Would this be a sensible course of action?"
"Moving on to another, equally important, issue, I welcomed Mr Barroso’s hard-hitting remarks on the EU’s Financial Perspective."
"Nevertheless, I remain concerned with regard to Europe’s future."
"Without the necessary resources, the EU cannot seek to strengthen social cohesion or to support competitiveness, employment, research and environmental policy, and it will also be unable to give due consideration to the ageing of the population – in other words to adhere to the Lisbon strategy – or to continue the fight against terrorism, drugs and crime."
"If we continue to operate with outmoded budgets, we will be unable to confront the challenges which await us, for example the explosive growth in Chinese competition."
"The Council should therefore abandon its calls for a European budget set at 1%, as otherwise Europe will no longer be able to guarantee the funding of its regional policy, which is close to the hearts of EU citizens."
"We expect the Council to take into account the priorities I mentioned previously, and then to allocate the resources necessary to achieve our goals."
"We should not forget that Europe cannot be built without the contribution of every individual and every European citizen."
"Europe should export its values to the rest of the world, but it should also respect the men and women who enable it to exist."
"Unfortunately, I fear that the decisions taken on 17 December will be incomprehensible to many of our fellow citizens."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Council is discussing the accessions of Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey."
"I should like to encourage you, when dealing with Croatia, to take a tough stance where cooperation with the International Criminal Court is concerned, because without that cooperation, it is irresponsible to make a serious start with Croatia."
"Persevere!"
"With regard to Romania, can you guarantee that we keep the requirements for that country strict?"
"That is to say: no accession as long as Romania does not meet the criteria in the areas of human rights and corruption, among others, even if that means that Romania joins the EU after Bulgaria."
"I will now turn to Turkey."
"Would I be quoting the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Balkenende, correctly if I said: no second-class status, such as a privileged partnership, and no end date?"
"Is that still your position now?"
"Are you also prepared to say: no membership at the end of the negotiations if the human rights violations persist?"
"Incidentally, with regard to the secret ballot which we are threatening to hold today about Turkey, I am left with a feeling that this would be to deceive the public."
"I hope we will not need to resort to that."
"Over the past few months, you have held a debate about standards and values."
"Should you not have made this concrete by applying it, for example, to an issue such as Romania or Turkey, in the spirit of the French philosopher who said: ?"
"Why not?Otherwise, it will remain a little theoretical."
"Does the arms embargo against China not fit perfectly in the framework of the debate about standards and values?"
"This is not about Islam or Christianity, but about the communality of rule of law and democracy, and in this great diversity, it is about the values we have enshrined in our new Constitution."
"I hope that that will remain the common denominator in the debate."
"I have said to you before that my impression so far of the Dutch Presidency is that its ambitions and goals are not as clear as they need to be."
"My question is whether that is a sign of insecurity or internal political contradictions within the Dutch Government, or are we still waiting for the big revelation?"
"In that respect, the Council has quietly saddled us with very thorny issues on a few occasions."
"I will for a moment forget this meeting place, Strasbourg, but I would refer to the inefficient Treaty of Nice and the agreements surrounding agricultural spending which were too expensive and produced too little change."
"Your ambitions concerning Lisbon, Kyoto in Europe and the world are wonderful and we support you in them, but the financial resources you are setting aside for them are pitiful."
"This contradiction will, of course, not escape the public."
"Terrorism is once again the subject of lively debates at very high level."
"Only last week, all European chiefs of police were gathered here, telling us that, due to diverse national practices, the factual exchange of information is still not getting off the ground as it should."
"There is still no person in charge at the heart of Europol, terrorists are still slipping through the net of the law and there is no harmonisation in the area of criminal investigation."
"The question remains: is Gijs de Vries to keep coasting along, or will you allow him to do his job properly?"
"Finally, I wish you much success with your position on Turkey."
"The line I would take would be: no second-class status and no alternatives; we are ready for real negotiations."
"I hope that with this, together with Mr Balkenende, you will provide Mr Poettering’s group with an adequate response."
"Mr President, I consider that Turkey has to begin making the necessary steps to be acceptable to join the EU."
"For this purpose, certain conditions must without fail be met, one of the most important of which is the recognition of Turkey's internal plurality."
"Breaking the fundamental Kemalist taboo is of vital importance."
"Recognising the linguistic, cultural and political rights of Kurdistan and other stateless national communities is crucial."
"Logically we Europeans want Turkey to comply with all of that, but we wonder whether we should not start by recognising our own intrinsic plurality."
"What about all the pluri-national states that keep denying their own diversity?"
"In the particular case of Spain – a state that in theory acknowledges its own domestic plurality, but not always equality among all the different nations that make up that state – still more steps have to be taken."
"The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Spanish Government, Mr Miguel Angel Moratinos, presented a memorandum on 13 December on the official languages of the autonomous communities."
"Such a proposal does not imply, as we wanted, full recognition status for Catalan, Basque and Galician."
"It does not give any recognition to Asturian or Aragonese."
"This memorandum offers the chance of speaking in the European Parliament in Catalan, but always at 15 days' notice."
"How can I handle this if I do not know until the day before if I am to be given the chance to speak?"
"When your Member States' governments sincerely acknowledge their plurality, that will be the most powerful tool in working towards a more democratic Turkey, and in asking for a fundamental change to the way in which it is applying to join the European Union."
"Mr President, my party and my political group hope that the European Council will decide to embark upon negotiations with Turkey concerning membership."
"It is just as important to point out that Turkey has a very long way to go, especially when it comes to human rights, the situation regarding minorities, the Cyprus issue and union rights."
"A great many legislative changes have occurred in Turkey, but it has to be realised that these are not matched by the reality on the ground and by changes in practice."
"Current Turkish legislation too is very deficient."
"I can point to the new criminal law that still in practice makes it a criminal offence to mention the Armenian genocide in Turkey."
"That is completely unacceptable, and to Turkey’s discredit that it continues to deny this historical fact."
"Recognition of the genocide would open the way to normalisation for the Armenians in Turkey and also to the normalisation of relations with Armenia – something that is necessary if Turkey is to become a member of the EU."
"Mr President, frequent allusions are made in this House to the continuing democratisation of Turkey, and yet we ourselves, who are supposed to vote on this issue, are taking our leave of democracy and transparency."
"Secret ballots are generally only held in this House on matters relating to Members, and it is entirely incomprehensible that such a ballot should be held on important political decisions on matters of principle."
"Who wants to hide, and from whom?"
"Are they hiding from the people of the Member States, the majority of whom – on the basis of rational argument – are opposed to Turkey’s accession, or from the chairmen of their groups, out of fear of standing up for their convictions, whatever those convictions may be?"
"This would mean that this House is merely imitating the Council’s behaviour, and ultimately we will fall hostage to those who say that it is too late to say no."
"It is by no means too late to do so."
"If Turkey were to join the EU, Europe would fall into chaos."
"This can be prevented if we are open and transparent in casting our ‘no’ votes today."
"Mr President, Mr Nicolaï, the Dutch Presidency has nearly come to an end."
"It was, of course, not the easiest of times to lead Europe, but we had no choice."
"It already had a late start, following the recess; then there was the handicap of a newly-elected Parliament that was starting to find its feet, and that was followed by the Commission which came about in fits and starts."
"Under this not terribly lucky star, the Netherlands still tried to set to work."
"That is why I think that the Netherlands should count its blessings, because despite the short period of time, an awful lot got done, for example, with regard to the Hague Programme for internal security, the security of our citizens."
"In that respect, Minister Donner, who is so often under fire in the Netherlands, has, together with his colleagues, done an excellent job."
"Mr Eurlings has already said a few things about Turkey;"
"I do not propose to repeat them."
"Something I do have difficulty with and which I think merits a comment is the acceptance of Romania and Bulgaria acceding."
"I think that we need to let the Council, the summit, know that the matter, particularly in relation to Romania, is certainly not done and dusted, because in that country, human rights, women’s rights and children’s rights are still being violated and corruption is still rampant."
"In any event, all things being equal, I do not think it is all that certain that Parliament will say ‘yes’ to it."
"With the same thing in mind, I should also like to make a remark about Croatia."
"It appears that there is much more reserve with regard to that country, and I would like to ask the Dutch Presidency whether that attitude would not stifle any initiatives."
"Finally, I turn to the Lisbon agenda, the ambitions of which should, of course, be measured against the funding that is being set aside for this purpose."
"In my view, at the summit, the 1% club should in any event ensure that the requirements for Lisbon and the question as to how social cohesion can be best achieved with the ten new Member States are examined more effectively."
"Ambitions and funding should tally with each other."
"Mr President, at the Council summit at the end of this week, the Dutch Presidency will present its conclusions on the European Union’s anti-terrorist policy and anti-drugs strategy."
"It is imperative for the European Union’s anti-terrorist policy to allow cooperation to be stepped up effectively between Member States and with third countries."
"In particular, we believe that Member States should enter into the necessary commitments with a view to implementing the action plan on the fight against terrorism, while sticking to the timetable for that action plan, and also enter into commitments with a view to eliminating the obstacles which certain national administrations are placing in the way of exchanges of information."
"We must also allow Europol and Eurojust to provide European added value in the fight against terrorism by placing them at the centre of cooperation and exchanges of information between Member States."
"We would however note that the fight against terrorism should maintain a balance between necessary security measures, on the one hand, and respect for fundamental rights, on the other."
"A political agreement on the EU’s anti-drugs strategy has already been reached within the Council, and merely needs to be adopted officially at the Council summit on 16-17 December."
"I believe it to be unacceptable that the Council has once again failed to wait for the European Parliament’s opinion, and that it refused to inform the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs of progress made in its own negotiations when the parliamentary committee was discussing the very same issue."
"Furthermore, we hope that a fairer approach will be adopted to issues of asylum and immigration, above all in order to ensure that the rights of every individual are respected and that responsibilities are shared."
"Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to express my regret at the fact that the Hague programme made no provision for measures to be taken in instances where Member States do not transpose legislation or instruments relating to justice and home affairs."
"This is one of the shortcomings of the most recent multiannual programme."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, I would like to start by congratulating the Dutch Presidency on its work."
"I have here the final draft of the conclusions and I must say that you have done a very good job."
"With regard to enlargement, I wish to start by highlighting positively the paragraphs of the conclusions relating to the imminent accession of Romania and Bulgaria and to emphasise that the accession of these two countries is creating a new geopolitical reality. Consequently, I consider it very important – as you mention in the conclusions – that the relevant agreements and treaties be signed early on in 2005."
"With regard to the case of Turkey, a great deal has of course been said."
"I, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, will insist on keeping paragraph 20 of the draft conclusions which I have before me, because it deals with the question of the peaceful resolution of differences with neighbouring countries. I would ask you to examine very seriously the inclusion of a paragraph on Cyprus, by which I mean the withdrawal of the Turkish forces and, of course, recognition of the Republic of Cyprus."
"I would also like to make a couple of positive remarks on what you have to say about the financial perspectives."
"It is very important that we resolve the problem of the financial perspectives because, as you say, the financial perspectives and how they are addressed will give an enlarged Europe the tool to deal with future challenges, and I welcome the fact that you are talking of the need for prudence."
"To close, I think that a great deal has been said about terrorism, but I wish to draw the Presidency's attention to the fact that the question of terrorism does not end with a few paragraphs."
"It is a complicated issue, a very serious issue."
"It is here to stay, we shall face new challenges every time and the Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission will therefore need to cooperate closely in order to combat this phenomenon."
"Mr President, this has been a difficult year."
"It started for me with a letter bomb exploding in my office."
"Since then we have had the Madrid bombings."
"I would hope that at this time of the year our thoughts are with the victims and their families."
"Outside the European Union there was the tragedy of Beslan, and then today's bus siege in Greece."
"All this reinforces the fact that the security of our citizens has to be an absolute priority for the EU but, as a number of colleagues have already pointed out, that needs real action."
"Far too often cooperation among our police, judicial and intelligence services is cooperation in name only."
"Even a short conversation with anybody who works for Europol would reinforce that."
"Member States have to deliver on their promises."
"We need action, not words."
"The same applies to the economic agenda."
"Member States have to be called to account by the presidency for the things they have promised to do."
"In particular, we have to get much more investment into people."
"We particularly need to deliver on the active labour market policies that Mr Wim Kok has reported on in the past."
"Too many people in the European Union are inactive."
"We are far too prepared to pay people to be on the scrap heap."
"We need much more proactive policies to make work pay, and that includes more childcare and more education and training."
"We cannot simply write people off as being unemployable."
"Sound finances are the basis of a good economy and therefore we are right to review the budget."
"As my colleague Mrs Dührkop Dührkop said, it must not be some sort of mathematical exercise."
"We have to look at what we do."
"What is the added value in doing something at European level?"
"What is the best way of getting value for money for our citizens?"
"At the same time, we always have to remember that solidarity is the cornerstone of the European Union."
"You remove that cornerstone and you undermine the very foundations of the Union."
"That is why this debate on finances is vital to the future of the European Union."
"I would like to comment on the accession process of two neighbouring countries."
"In the case of Croatia, we have a well-prepared nation and country with European traditions working toward admission to the European Union."
"As Croatians lived under the same form of government as Hungarians for over 800 years, 400 years of which as part of the Habsburg Monarchy, their commitment to the legal system, and their social and economic organisation is very similar to those of Hungary."
"I went to Zagreb several times in the 1990s, I have also visited it lately, and concluded that based on their institutional preparation on the levels of government, economy and parliament, their hopes for negotiations are as justified as Hungary’s were at the beginning of negotiations in 1998."
"Croatia’s economic and social preparedness also makes it possible for the negotiations for accession not only to be opened in the spring of 2005, but also to be concluded, regardless of other factors and other countries, such as Turkey."
"This may also serve as a positive message to other nations and governments of the West Balkans who are headed towards Europe."
"Romania’s accession will be a major step in the evolution of Europe, as a European nation composed of various European peoples, including two million Hungarians, will join."
"It will be a win-win situation for both foreign policy and the internal market."
"Being accepted by Europe will hopefully help Romanians not only to discover the advantages of their diversity but also to preserve them, contrary to their current policies."
"The preservation of European solidarity also includes paying attention to the impact that the expansion has on those Member States that comprise the borders of the European Union, such as Austria was this year."
"A monitoring system operating on a more regular basis, that is biannually, needs to be established to ensure that commitments are followed through."
"In the case of Romania, the functioning of the community system is of key importance, and in order to prove this, it is enough to consider environmental protection, the policy of competition or areas made vulnerable by internal considerations such as animal health, customs, or excise tax."
"If screening, that involves the European Parliament, reveals deficits in these fields a few years before and after accession, then EU resources must be mobilised for the necessary institutional development even at the cost of other goals."
"Should this fail as well, then – let us face it – specific sanctions will have to be applied."
"As Bulgaria (which has shown promising progress) and Romania should be subject to individual consideration, I believe it is necessary to separate their accession processes and if necessary, to stipulate a flexible accession date to Romania, whose membership I very much look forward to."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as rapporteur for Croatia I should like to say a few words today on a country to which little reference has been made, even though it is to be hoped that the European Council summit will see a positive and important decision taken on it."
"Although it is a fact that every rapporteur treats the country for which he is responsible a little like his or her own child, I do believe that this is not merely a matter of taking a decision on Croatia, but of taking a decision on a whole region."
"Particularly given the stability and security concerns that have already been touched upon, it is vital that the Council’s decision on it should be favourable."
"This would be a sign that every country in the Balkans, if it makes the appropriate efforts and meets the criteria, has a chance of becoming a Member State of the European Union, something that was recently promised in Thessaloniki."
"I believe that both the former and the present Croatian Governments, with their differing political orientations, have done a great deal to prepare themselves and to move towards meeting the criteria to which we must pay close attention in every instance."
"There is however an obstacle that is undoubtedly of great significance, namely cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague."
"It is claimed that there is such cooperation, but it has been neither full nor adequate."
"Demands have been made, and rightly so, that close attention be paid to whether every country – both Croatia and the other countries, above all Serbia – cooperates with The Hague in this respect."
"Yet I believe that in principle, and as a matter of priority, the Council should acknowledge the positive steps undertaken by Croatia, and that this should also be reflected in the Council’s decision."
"I also hope that the Government will not merely issue declarations, but will genuinely take every possible measure to bring the indicted general Ante Gotovina before the Tribunal in The Hague."
"In addition to taking such measures, it should also destroy the networks that perhaps still exist and support him, and it should ensure that they are genuinely destroyed."
"Finally, Mr President, I believe that Ante Gotovina, if he is the patriot he claims to be, should not take his country hostage."
"He must give himself up to the Tribunal in The Hague, as it would be a real shame if the fate of a country as important as Croatia were to depend on the decision of a single man not to surrender to justice."
"I therefore hope that, in view of all these circumstances, a positive sign will be given to The Hague."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that everyone – citizens and politicians alike – is living through an historic era, because the decision which the European Council is expected to take on accession negotiations with Turkey will be a landmark for Turkey itself, the European Union and our region as a whole."
"Public opinion has not concerned itself to such an extent with any other candidacy."
"There were no such differences between the Member States or between the political parties, no such pressure was brought to bear by the United States, no such concerns or fears were expressed, no such variety of questions was raised so seriously at every discussion table."
"The European Parliament is having trouble finding its political direction on this issue, not because of any weakness on its part, but because of the complexity and seriousness of the issue."
"Arguments have been expressed for and against the accession of Turkey to saturation point over recent days."
"We have one common denominator: we are calling on the European Council to defend the dignity of the European Union; to respect Turkey, but also to respect the values which unite the peoples of Europe."
"No can be used as an alibi for setting aside our values or for adjusting them to Turkish demands, be it in connection with the spirit or the letter of the Copenhagen criteria or with the recognition of all 25 Member States of the European Union, by which you will understand that I mean the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus."
"This is not only a moral choice, but also the best basis for a sustainable policy which will safeguard our cohesion and will inspire respect for and confidence in the Union in its citizens who, in all events, expect clear justification for the decisions of the European Council and a public dialogue which, unfortunately, has not yet taken place, with substance and depth on the future of euro-Turkish relations."
"The other issue I wanted to mention is that the Council should, at long last, draw up a long-term plan for our foreign relations with decisiveness, cohesion, properly coordinated objectives and reliable financing."
"In particular, I want to refer to our relations with the countries of the Balkans and our partner Mediterranean countries which make up our living space."
"This framework includes the role which we need to play in the resolution of the Middle East crisis, in this new era which is at long last now starting for the region; it would appear that the goal posts are shifting and that there are margins for intervention and change."
"Mr President, Hungarian citizens voted for membership of the European Union with an overwhelming majority of 83 per cent."
"They did so in the belief that after many lost decades Hungarian society could become a part of the common European social model, including strong social policies for everybody, real improvements in environmental matters, free movement of labour and solidarity for common standards among the 25 nations."
"That is the goal of this huge European project."
"Besides a permanent and almost endless enlargement, we should not forget the original idea of deepening the existing Union by the approximation and harmonisation of our standards of living, infrastructure and labour market."
"If we are deeply concerned about the ageing population and the lack of labour forces, why do some Member States close their labour market even to the skilled workers of other EU Member States?"
"The new financial framework does not seem to answer some of the basic questions – at least as far as I am concerned."
"Is 1.24 per cent of the GNI of our Member States enough to establish a common social model for us?"
"Is it enough to cover the expenses of the brave environmental initiative Natura 2000, designed to save our nature and biodiversity?"
"If we are so proud of our cultural values, as has been mentioned in this debate, why do we spend only one per cent of our budget on culture, education, etc.?"
"If 1.24 per cent of GNI is such a low amount to build up a common European social, environmental and cultural model, why are some Member States even considering reducing this amount?"
"Finally, does the Council believe in a strong social and cultural union and is it ready to provide the basic financial sources to create it?"
"Mr President, the debate on the Financial Perspective involves many different issues."
"The debate on how large the EU’s income should be should never conceal the importance of how we prioritise our expenditure."
"We must give greater priority to the expenditure supporting the development of the new knowledge-based society and dare to provide smaller subsidies to those parts of our economy that are too large and that belong to the economy of a different era."
"The Lisbon process will of course be the most important element."
"What the Commission and the Council must do is not just talk about lofty goals but also propose practical measures that increase competition, especially within those sectors associated with the knowledge-based society."
"What is at issue is how we are to extend competition within the fields not only of education and health care but also of other areas of our society so that, in Europe, we might obtain the best businesses."
"There is one issue that makes the summit we are now facing especially historic, and that is the issue of Turkey."
"A ‘no’ decision, or a means of delaying the membership process, would of course have consequences of various kinds."
"We should in that case be leaving the field free for forces and ideals other than those for which the EU stands."
"The EU’s basic task is to create safety and security and to bridge differences instead of creating new lines of demarcation."
"This means that we must ask ourselves the question: will we enjoy greater safety and security with Turkey rooted firmly in the fundamental values of the EU and of Europe, just as we are that much safer and more secure as a result of the enlargement that has taken place this year and just as we shall also be safer and more secure if the EU can be extended to the Balkans?"
"That issue is ultimately about the respect we perceive for the work done by the EU."
"The reason why other countries want to join the EU is the EU’s success in increasing safety and security."
"This is an important reason why the Council must take the historic decision to agree to commencing negotiations."
"In my brief contribution, I shall deal with just one topic and that is the topic of enlargement."
"We have been witnesses to an unprecedented historical enlargement with ten new countries."
"I myself come from one of the new countries and I think we can all agree that, after just the first seven months, we can say that enlargement has been a success."
"It has been a success for Europe, for the ‘old Member States’ and for the new countries."
"The process of the historic enlargement of Europe is not complete, however."
"We have talked in this House and we shall talk again this afternoon about Romania and about Bulgaria."
"I am convinced that both Bulgaria and Romania are well on the way to joining the European Union and I believe that, with the European Union’s help, they will be able to make a successful accession into our Community in 2007."
"We are also going to talk about Croatia."
"Croatia definitely plays a key role in the Western Balkans."
"I should like the Council to give a clear signal to Croatia that accession talks should begin with that country, provided, of course, that the appropriate Copenhagen criteria and the requirements of the International Criminal Court in The Hague have been met."
"Croatia can, I believe, play a significant role in the Western Balkans and could be a future model for Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Macedonia and the other countries of the Western Balkans."
"We spoke here yesterday, and we shall again today, about Turkey."
"I should like the Council to remember its obligations, to remember Europe’s promises and to begin accession negotiations with Turkey."
"Given that we have awarded that country the status of candidate country, I feel that we owe it to Turkey to open negotiations."
"This will also support the process of reform there, which has been pursued successfully for the last two years."
"– Mr President, there is something of which I would like to remind, our assembled Heads of State or Government, and that is that they are elected by the people."
"They were elected to represent, in a European context, the interests of their people, and thus of their nation states."
"They are only the first among equals, no more than that, and they bear a tremendous responsibility for our common future."
"One would normally assume that these very Heads of State or Government represent the will of the people, but, right now, that clearly seems not to be the case where existential questions are concerned. Let us take my own country, the Federal Republic of Germany, as an example."
"There has been a new survey on the issue of Turkey. Only 15% of Germans are in favour of Turkey gaining full membership of the European Union , 60% of Germans support that special form of cooperation that we call a privileged partnership, 22% are generally against cooperation between Turkey and the European Union and only 3% expressed no opinion."
"In spite of this, what our Chancellor put to the Council was his own party-political opinion."
"He is the strongest supporter of Turkey’s accession, of this great madness."
"Is that right?"
"Is it responsible?"
"No, it is not."
"We see exactly the same situation in other Member States."
"The Council must be aware that the decision now to be taken regarding the start of accession negotiations with Turkey is not just about the further enlargement of the EU."
"It is an existential question for the European Union, for the political Union which is of the utmost importance for us and for the preservation of peace in the future."
"After all, our history reflects the history of Europe, and shows how difficult it is to get along with all these small, headstrong European nations."
"History also shows us that if we expand too much now, as did so many other former empires which grew too fast, there is the danger of our overreaching ourselves and bringing about our own downfall and ruination."
"If our own Heads of State or Government now give Turkey a starting date for negotiations, even though the criteria have not been met, and even though we know that we cannot manage to integrate this enormous country, they will be gambling away our future."
"However harsh this might sound, Turkey is too big, too heterogeneous, too poor, and too populous."
"We must not take that step."
"We have expanded much in the past year and three more countries are yet to join us."
"We have to consolidate our position first."
"We have to get to grips with each other and it is the example of German reunification that shows us how difficult that task is. We have not managed it yet."
"I appeal to our Heads of State or Government to be aware that they represent the will of the people, that they have to convey the will of the people to the outside world, and that the majority of the people of Europe, I am quite convinced, think: ‘Please be careful in making promises to Turkey."
"– Mr President, I did not actually want to speak about Turkey yet again, for everything that there is to say about it has already been said, but Mrs Sommer has prompted me to speak."
"Everyone presents surveys that serve their purpose."
"I know of surveys carried out in Germany which show that people have nothing against Turkey becoming a member of the EU."
"I can only say that I would warn people against over-dramatising and exaggerating the situation, as you have just done."
"It is completely mistaken and inappropriate to tie Europe’s existence and the survival of the European Union to Turkey’s accession."
"Let ten years pass and wait until the negotiations are over, and maybe then Turkey will become the thirtieth member of a great Union with 500 million inhabitants."
"So please let us remain calm; let us keep a cool head and let there be less drama and emotion in this debate."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I too actually wanted to talk about an enlarged Europe."
"I wanted to congratulate you on holding a series of conferences on European identity."
"That was a very good and necessary thing to do."
"We have to ask ourselves what it is that holds 450 million Europeans together, what it is that unites us all, from Estonia to Portugal, from Scotland to Greece, and, as we all know, the answer is: European values."
"It is also the positive objectives the European Union has set itself: the commitment to peace, to freedom and to justice."
"These are the things that unite us in Europe."
"Over the next two years in particular, during the process of ratifying the Constitution, it is especially important to convey these things and not to lose ourselves in points of detail."
"I am therefore especially glad that, at the summit on Friday, under Points 66 and 67 of the Conclusions, you asked the Commission to put these matters at the forefront of its communication strategy."
"I think that we can win the people over in this way – Commissioner Wallström is also doing good work in this regard – and so I would like to encourage you to decide in favour of this, as it is indeed necessary."
"In this context, I also think that Points 69 and 52, in which we affirm human rights, are very positive."
"As it has already been agreed that there should be a European Human Rights Agency, it must now be set up."
"Europe needs this instrument, and our values are important not only for our identity within the Union, but also for our authority in the world at large."
"I therefore wish not only to congratulate you, but also to encourage you to push forward with these issues."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on Turkey’s accession to the European Union, which has lasted for several months, will shortly come to an end."
"I should like to congratulate all the Members of this House, myself included, on the wide-ranging nature of the debate, and to express the hope that every other important decision will be preceded by a debate of such calibre."
"During this debate, no fewer than four model positions on Turkey’s accession to the European Union emerged."
"The first is the traditional position, namely that negotiations should be opened, in all likelihood as early as next year, with the possibility of suspending them if it became apparent that problems or obstacles were being created by the Turkish side."
"The second position is that of opening negotiations with the possibility of offering Turkey an alternative solution if such difficulties arose during these negotiations, namely a special, privileged partnership."
"The third position consists of waiting until Turkey meets the Copenhagen criteria in full, which amounts to imposing additional conditions given that the Copenhagen criteria have not been fully met."
"Finally, the fourth position is that of a special, privileged partnership."
"I understand that Parliament’s decision is to adopt the first model, or in other words to start negotiations next year without any other additional conditions, and I also understand that this is likely to be the Council’s decision too."
"It will be a decision of ground-breaking importance, and a decision imposing a great responsibility on the Member States, the EU and the Council."
"It will mean taking the first steps along a very demanding path."
"Conditions are set not only for the Turkish side, but also for the Member States, the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"These conditions are all the more challenging, and this responsibility is all the more difficult to bear, because we are, so to speak, dealing with a child."
"References have already been made to a marriage, but I prefer to use the example of a family with an adopted child. In a certain sense, Turkey is an adopted child, and we should not forget that the responsibilities of the family and of the parents are particularly challenging when adopting a child."
"I hope we are all fully aware of this, and that we will begin to put our European house in order."
"– Mr President, of the various topics for debate at the forthcoming European Council – in addition to Turkey, which we have spoken about on a number of occasions – the topic of the fight against terrorism remains extremely important."
"The Dutch Presidency’s evaluation of the action programme of June 2004 is proof of this."
"Given that this is a threat to all of us, the most appropriate strategy is one that leads us to act together, bypassing national level and even the areas of internal justice and security."
"Indeed, the way to deal with terrorism today is entirely different from the 1970s and 80s."
"The events of 11 September 2001 have ushered in a radical change in the area of security. European countries have new responsibilities and new challenges, the urgency and seriousness of which was confirmed by 11 March."
"In a globalised world, politics, diplomacy, internal security and defence must be combined to address these new types of threat."
"Security has become a global, indivisible concept, which today encompasses internal and external security and the support of third countries in the fight against terrorism."
"The EU and its Member States must streamline their defence capacities and strengthen their channels of diplomatic cooperation, their information services and their legal and law enforcement coordination, in a genuine synergy of national and transnational policy."
"As a Portuguese Member of this House, I wish to point out that my government – under the then Prime Minister, Mr Durão Barroso, who is now President of the Commission – transposed all Community legislation in the area of combating terrorism and took the operational measures needed to carry this out."
"On the same subject, I should like to highlight the introduction of biometric data in passports, a measure that was only recently adopted by Parliament."
"Provided it is accompanied by essential precautions, this measure will serve to strengthen crime prevention and, in turn, to reinforce the citizens’ security, which is our primary objective."
"On the eve of the European Council, the various speeches made in this House on this subject have shown that Parliament wishes to send out a clear message that this is the path that together we must relentlessly continue to follow."
"As a representative of Estonia, herself the product of the recent enlargement, I welcome the conclusion of the accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania yesterday, and the readiness to open negotiations with Croatia."
"All the same, it is important to treat each candidate country separately according to progress made, not as a package."
"Second, the principle that every EU enlargement must be balanced by a strengthening of our internal dynamics and unity is important."
"As my colleague Mr Pinheiro said, ‘Turkey is a special case in the enlargement’."
"The opening of negotiations may be sanctioned provided all the Copenhagen criteria are clearly met, just as in the case of accession countries in the final round of negotiations."
"This is not yet the case."
"A fundamental question for governments, however, is the inconceivability of opening negotiations with a candidate whose military forces occupy the territory of an EU Member State, and which does not even recognise the existence of that state."
"This position must be made unequivocally clear before the negotiations start."
"This is fundamental and cannot just be recommendatory; otherwise, the present ambiguity regarding the criteria will create a precedent whereby such accommodations in regard to large candidate countries may begin to repeat themselves."
"This, however, will undermine the sense of security of other, smaller countries in the future."
"I also call on the Commission to consider Ukraine’s prospects for the future, because it is in Ukraine that the question of the EU’s eastern border is being decided today."
"Yesterday a representative of the Ukrainian people was here – the Ukrainian Eurovision Song Contest winner Ruslana, who probably has a greater number of supporters than any Ukrainian politician."
"Her message was this: ‘Show me the room in this building where we could hand in Ukraine’s accession application’."
"Today there is no such room, but for those of us who support the democratic rebirth of Ukraine, it is our business to heed this message and to make sure that this room is found and made ready for use in the near future."
"Mr President, today’s debate about the European summit at the weekend has become a continuation of our discussion about Turkey, which we began on Monday evening, and which we will bring to a conclusion immediately after this debate, when we vote on the Eurlings Report."
"It is a good thing that this House should devote a lot of time to the issue of Turkey’s readiness to join the European Union."
"That is what the public expects of this Parliament."
"However, the people at home also expect us to base our debate and our decisions on a serious analysis of the facts, and it is in this regard that I have some doubts."
"What has been said here today about Turkey’s accession has little to do with the reality in that country."
"The Dutch Presidency has expressly stated in the introduction that Turkey has fulfilled the political accession criteria, and thus is a democratic state under the rule of law, where basic rights, and especially the rights of minorities, are respected."
"The President of the Commission has obviously read the most recent Commission Progress Report more closely."
"He speaks instead about the fact that Turkey meets the political criteria."
"This apparently means, among other things, that torture is no longer systematically used in Turkish prisons, and that women can hope to one day have the same rights as men in Turkish society."
"It seems that a lot of my fellow-Members in this House are basing their opinions on this principle of hope – particularly all those who are to the left of centre and who, I suspect, will be in the majority."
"Mr Schulz, Mr Cohn-Bendit, and others, have told us that a Turkey that is secular and respects the rule of law would strengthen Europe’s community of values."
"That is true."
"A secular Turkey which respects the rule of law would indeed strengthen Europe’s community of values."
"The Turkey of today, though, is still a long way from these values."
"If we do not admit this to ourselves, we are not only being dishonest with the public, but are also endangering the stability and security that has hitherto been achieved in the European Union."
"Let us not proceed further down the road of automatic acceptance of accession, or at least not where and when the facts do not really justify it."
". Mr President, I am grateful for the remarks made by many and of which I have taken good note in preparation for the European Council that is due to be held on Thursday and Friday."
"Let me start with the fundamental debate raised by a number of Members of this House, that being the debate about what the European Union is, what Europe is."
"I am very much at one with a number of Members, of whom Mr Watson was the first and most outspoken, who state that the European Union is not a religious community."
"I am also in agreement with Mr Cohn-Bendit, who pointed out that Europe is not a cultural community either."
"As Mr Schulz and others stated, Europe, the European Union, is a community of values."
"European integration is a political project rather than a religious one."
"In that connection, Mrs Uca made the helpful remark that, with Turkey in mind, that conclusion can also be a bridge to Islam and indeed, we can use it to illustrate that Europe is a political and not a religious project."
"Conversely, Turkey can use it to demonstrate that a country that is Islamic for the most part can also be a democratic and functioning constitutional state."
"Some of you, including Mr Maaten and Mr Lehne, have spoken in explicit terms and with appreciation about the series of conferences on the nature of Europe and the essence of the values we share."
"One of the important lessons that we can draw from the discussion about European values and European identity is that we must, in fact, be careful about focusing on European identity."
"We all know, from the past century, what the adverse effects can be of an identity that has been imposed from above."
"We also realise that in terms of shared European values, many of those are, in fact, universal values, and we want them to be exactly that."
"Despite this, there are discernable European traits with regard to the way in which we apply those values, how we can invoke them and how we organise them."
"There are definitely specific European accents that are evident in those values, one important example being tolerance."
"This brings me to the enlargement debate, which attracted many speakers, starting with the debate about Turkey."
"We held that debate yesterday and concluded that, because of the concerns about it, we will, in time, need to clearly demonstrate the huge advantages of the possibility of Turkey joining."
"Mr Schulz mentioned security as one of the advantages."
"Mr Watson noted that Turkey sufficiently meets the criteria, and that is also, in agreement with the Commission’s conclusion, the presidency’s position following the entry into force of the six laws."
"Mr Eurlings and others pointed out once again that it is important to maintain pressure on Turkey in relation to the developments needed in that country in respect of human rights, religious freedom and other political criteria."
"That is precisely why the presidency has decided, based on the Commission proposals, to come up with a new framework for future negotiations about accession."
"That framework allows for more pressure to be brought to bear and offers more guarantees for smooth progress."
"This so-called ‘emergency stop option’, in other words an option of suspension, offers guarantees in relation to the sensitive political criteria."
"It is understandable that a number of Members of this House should, once again, have raised the issue of Cyprus."
"Mr Barroso included it in his introduction, and Mr Adamou and Mr Dimitrakopoulos alluded to it too."
"I should like to reiterate the Dutch Presidency’s key position on this score in the preparations of the Council that will be held at the end of this week."
"We do indeed want Turkey to recognise the fact that Cyprus is a Member of the European Union and is one of the Twenty-Five countries."
"We want to bring this about by getting Turkey to sign the protocol to the association agreement."
"Mr van den Berg has asked specifically whether the presidency can confirm that the intention is that no accession date be set."
"I can confirm very emphatically that that is indeed the presidency’s intention."
"Another question, related to the political criteria, was whether the presidency can confirm that Turkey will not join unless it is ready."
"Here too, I can definitely confirm that to be the case."
"Finally in connection with Turkey, I should like to raise the sensitive issue which will be discussed presently in Parliament, namely the so-called open-endedness of the negotiations."
"Once again, Mr van den Berg asked specifically what the presidency’s intention is."
"Let me make it clear once more: the presidency’s intention is that these should be accession negotiations with accession in mind."
"That is my first point."
"My second is that, following on from the Commission’s comments, it is an open-ended process."
"There is no guarantee as to the outcome."
"The third element is that European cohesion must in any event remain sufficiently guaranteed, but the Dutch Presidency’s understanding for Thursday’s and Friday’s conclusions is that there is indeed no Plan B."
"Since we will be discussing Romania and Bulgaria later on, I will now confine myself to a few fundamental remarks in response to questions in this respect."
"Mr Watson and Mr Becsey, among others, have insisted on a separate approach for Bulgaria on the one hand and Romania on the other."
"In that connection, it is useful to point out that, as you know, no distinction can be drawn in the agreement, but one can, if necessary, be drawn with regard to the date of accession, because the option has been introduced and agreed, if there is cause for this, to decide to suspend accession of the country in question for one year at most."
"That is also the response to the questions by Mr Eurlings, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Kirkhope, who are still deeply concerned about the situation in Romania and emphasise the importance of continuing to bring maximum pressure to bear on the developments there."
"I share that view, and that is why we in the Presidency have proposed that the Council should conclude that we want additional provisions in terms of monitoring and specific benchmarks for Romania, coupled with a potential sanction, if necessary, of one year’s suspension."
"A number of Members have made reference to Croatia, and, as it is not a separate item on the agenda, I think that, despite the uproar in the Chamber, it would be useful to give you a precise response to this."
"Mr Pinheiro and Mr Becsey have indicated that Croatia has made much progress in moving closer to Europe, and that it is a European country."
"I should like to emphatically endorse both of these statements."
"Much progress has been made and the country is located in the centre of Europe."
"In addition, Mr Watson, Mr van den Berg and Mr Swoboda were right to point out that full cooperation with the ICTY (International Criminal Tribune for the Former Yugoslavia) is of vital importance."
"I would say to Mr Swoboda and to Mr Becsey that it would, of course, be good if we could make that positive step, also bearing in mind the fulfilment of Croatia’s role as a model in the Balkans."
"I agree with Mr Swoboda that we must try to have a positive decision."
"That is the presidency’s commitment and that means that indeed, we can decide in favour of opening negotiations at the beginning of next year, provided that these are specifically linked to full cooperation with the ICTY."
"Another important point that many of you have raised is that of combating terrorism, the major significance of which has also been underlined by President Barroso and Mr Pinheiro, among others."
"In addition, Mr Watson, Mrs Malmström and Mrs Buitenweg were right, in my view, to point out the importance of striking a balance between fighting terrorism and fundamental rights."
"I agree with them, and I think that Mr Maarten was right to point out that we, in the Hague Programme, have demonstrated the Council’s desire to preserve that balance."
"Mr Eurlings specifically asked about ways of banning organisations."
"He will be aware that that is a responsibility, a competence, of the Member States, but we will definitely ensure that information about it is exchanged between them."
"Mr Eurlings, and others, see the exchange of information as crucial to the fight against terrorism."
"That is the cornerstone of this presidency, and is also included in the Council’s agenda for Thursday and Friday."
"Over these past six months, we have made concrete progress in making it easier to exchange criminal records, collating intelligence and in relation to situation centres and threat analyses that can be carried out in those centres."
"As you know, we will be asking the Commission to table a more detailed proposal for the exchange of information, as provided for in the Hague Programme."
"At the request of a number of Members, I am happy to inform you specifically of the European Council’s intention, next Thursday and Friday, to decide whether, in principle, to appoint a European human rights ambassador."
"Many in this House spoke about the financial perspective."
"In his introductory remarks, Mr Barroso mentioned the importance of added value where the multi-annual budget and budget discipline are concerned, and he had good reason to do so, but he also expressed his concern, which was subsequently given greater emphasis by others, about the 1% approach and the importance of sufficient funding for Europe’s priorities."
"It is therefore useful to indicate the Council’s position on this score."
"We subscribe to many of the priorities mentioned here, but it remains important in every financial discussion, in addition to the priorities, to determine the posteriorities, and not only count the priorities."
"That is exactly what we in the Presidency have done with what we call our ‘building blocks’ approach, in which we have tried to draft a summary and compile posteriorities rather than only priorities."
"I can reassure a number of Members who are worried about what is going to happen on Thursday and Friday."
"Mrs Grossetête feared that we would be taking a decision about 1% which would not be understood by the citizens."
"The Council has not adopted a position on the 1%, let that be very clear."
"Based on the Commission proposals, which are still the guiding principle – because, after all, the new Parliament quite rightly values them greatly – the Council has simply outlined the positions of the Member States, both priorities and posteriorities, and it is on those that we will be basing our decisions."
"I am keen to concur with Mr Watson in his concerns about the financial accountability and his concern about the fact that, for the tenth time now, the Court of Auditors has not issued a Statement of Assurance about expenditure."
"During our presidency, we have taken steps to improve that situation by means of single audits, and we will discuss this in more detail in the spring."
"As far as the EU’s external policy is concerned, I think we have experienced a historic moment, one that was mentioned by many."
"Mr Schulz was the first one to speak about it, and was very frank, as was Mrs Napoletano."
"That moment had to do with Ukraine."
"I think that the stance that we – the European Parliament, the Commission and Council – have taken has demonstrated our ability to speak with one voice where external policy is concerned."
"In my view, that is a very important step in the progress we managed to bring about in the democratisation process in Ukraine."
"It is also a very important step toward speaking with one voice in external policy."
"That is a first step and we intend to take more of them on the basis of the new Treaty."
"I can be brief about the next subject, namely the Lisbon strategy, which was raised by a number of Members, including Mr Maaten, Mr Kirkhope and Mr Titley."
"You know that this subject is not on this Council’s agenda, as it will be raised in the spring."
"However, we will persevere, and it is true that the implementation of the Lisbon strategy is one of the key components."
"As Mr Maaten and Mr Kirkhope stated, it is also true that deregulation and the reduction of the administrative burden is crucial for our competitiveness in the world."
"I turn, finally, to the issue of public involvement and the importance of transparency and openness."
"What I should like to say to Mrs Buitenweg with regard to openness is that we have, during our presidency, tried to create more openness in the Council meetings wherever possible."
"In addition, a unique meeting took place in Amsterdam involving all European Affairs ministers."
"The whole of this meeting was public, as was an informal industrial meeting."
"I should like to end on an optimistic note."
"Mr Maaten congratulated the presidency on promoting the public’s involvement by means of good communication."
"I am not certain whether it has anything to do with that, but according to the latest Eurobarometer survey, there is an increase in the public’s positive involvement."
"The percentage of citizens who say that EU membership is a good thing has risen from 48% to 56%."
"That is not enough, but is nevertheless a big step forward and I should like to end on this happy note."
"In any case, I would like to thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, on behalf of President Barroso and the whole of the Commission, I wish to thank you for this debate, which has provided us with many valuable and constructive proposals and viewpoints."
"The debate has also reflected the EU’s ambitious and demanding agenda over the next few years."
"I have only one single thing to add to what has already been said by President Barroso and the Presidency of the Council."
"This has to do with an aspect of the Commission’s proposal concerning Turkey."
"Parallel to the negotiations on which the Commission wishes to embark with Turkey, a cultural dialogue is also proposed."
"This will serve as a channel for the anxiety and prejudices that are to be found, as well as for the real differences that exist between the EU and Turkey, and will ensure that we can overcome all these by embarking upon a bilateral dialogue in civil society too."
"That is something I believe is very important if we are also to investigate and resolve a number of the arguments put forward in this House."
"These often have to do with a fear of what is viewed as unknown or frightening."
"Remember that such fear is felt on both sides. I believe this to be an important instrument in the dialogue."
"The concerns in question are of course of ten years’ duration when it comes to the issue of Turkey."
"It is also important to ask ourselves some fundamental questions in the run-up to this important decision."
"What is it that can bring about the strongest forces in favour of a secular Turkey characterised by legal certainty?"
"What would be the risks and the effects of signalling a change to the EU’s political direction when it comes to embarking upon negotiations with Turkey?"
"I hope, indeed am convinced, that the debate that has been conducted in this House today will be a sound basis for the discussions that are to be conducted by the Council and that will continue to be conducted in the Commission too."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr Watson has the floor for a point of order."
"Which Rule of Procedure are you invoking, Mr Watson?"
"Mr President, I rise because in ten years of service in this House I cannot recall an instance similar to that regarding today's vote on the Eurlings report …"
"I would ask you to obey the Rules of Procedure and indicate which Rule you are invoking."
"I apologise, Mr President, I should like to make a point of order under Rule 162."
"As I was saying, in ten years' service I cannot recall a similar instance to that with which we are faced today."
"We consistently demand of the Council and the Commission openness and transparency in political decisions ..."
"… and it is an extraordinary practice for Members of this House to ask for a secret ballot on a political decision under Rule 162, which is designed for the appointment of individuals."
"How can we be accountable to our electors?"
"How can we defend ourselves against charges of shame and hypocrisy?"
"Mr President, I urge you to face down this ramshackle coalition of cowards and autocrats, …"
"… to declare a secret vote inadmissible on the grounds that it is unworthy of this House and to seek an early change to the Rules of Procedure to clarify this Rule."
"Mr President, I have risen to speak on the basis of Rule 162(2) and (3) of our Rules of Procedure."
"As Mr Watson has just pointed out, and to pick up on the remarks made by Mr Poettering, it is the European Union’s duty to take the historic decision on whether or not to open negotiations with Turkey."
"There are those who are opposed to Turkey’s accession, and I have great respect for these people. There are also those who are in favour of such an accession, and I have great respect for them too."
"Yet I know of no one whom I respect who lacks the courage to say what they think about Turkey."
"I would ask Mr Poettering to make a public statement on whether he is for or against the secret ballot which will take place in this House today."
"Is he personally for or against the secret ballot?"
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, you may ask the honourable Members to calm down, but I must remind you that you are speaking on a point of order."
"So please restrict yourself to that."
"I would ask that those Members who have signed this resolution with the far right to withdraw their signatures, as the resolution is beneath their logic and their intelligence."
"I call on all those with any self-respect to withdraw their signatures and to vote…"
"Mr President, we are familiar with Rule 162, and we also see from the voting list that 147 Members are apparently invoking Rule 162 to justify holding a secret ballot on various tabled amendments and in the final vote."
"I would therefore like to make my group's position on Rule 162 clear: the Socialist Group in the European Parliament would prefer a vote by roll call, for we believe that Europe's citizens have a right to know how Members of the European Parliament are voting on this key issue."
"In our view, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in this House is incapable of adhering to a coherent and unified line."
"Most of the 147 signatures come from this group, and I would like to thank the former Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Dehaene, for informing the Members of this group in unequivocal terms that while this solution may be acceptable from a legal perspective, politically it is completely unacceptable."
"It is becoming clear that the point of order relates to the application of Rule 162 on secret ballots, in accordance with the request made."
"Mr President, firstly, this is one Rule that I did not draft."
"Secondly, let me underline – before you make your ruling – the significance of the word 'may'."
"Rule 162(2) of the Rules of Procedure says that voting 'may' also take place by secret ballot, if requested by at least one-fifth of the Members."
"It does not say 'shall'."
"The previous paragraph says 'shall' concerning voting on nominations of individuals."
"There is a clear difference between the two cases of 'may' and 'shall'…"
"Mr Corbett, we must respect the Rules of Procedure."
"I realise that you are extremely knowledgeable on the subject, but I have not asked you for advice."
"I take good note of your opinion and I will take it into account."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please only raise genuine points of order."
"Otherwise, this debate will go on forever."
"Mr President, without wishing to offer unwanted advice, I should like to make a suggestion, namely, that the request made by a number of Members be put to the House."
"Parliament would then be able to decide whether or not it is in favour of holding a secret ballot."
"You have made a proposal to organise our work."
"The Presidency takes good note of that, but our work is regulated by the Rules of Procedure and they provide us with sufficient guidance on how to proceed."
"Mr President, I just wanted to say that according to my reason – if not to the Rules of Procedure – I am against the secret ballot and ask colleagues from my Group – or some of them at least – to withdraw their signatures."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a debate on whether those who have signed have been right to do so or whether they should not sign."
"I am only giving the floor for points of order and I would ask you to respect that."
"Opinions on whether it is good or bad to sign or not to sign, on whether Members should vote one way or another, may be very interesting, but they have no place at this point in the procedure."
"Accordingly, if a point of order turns out not to be one, the President will cut off the speaker."
"– Mr President, I do not intend to take your job from you or to give you advice."
"However, even if a request for a vote by roll call has been made, under Rule 162(3) of the Rules of Procedure the request for a secret ballot shall take priority over the request for a vote by roll call."
"Mr President, all that I am asking is for you to implement the provisions of Rule 162(3), under which one fifth of Members of Parliament may call for a secret ballot."
"I should like to remind Mr Cohn-Bendit, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and you, Mr President, that the aim of this is to safeguard our utmost priority, namely freedom of conscience and expression."
"The debate, Mr President …"
"Mr President, I invoke the same article as Mr Wurtz."
"The right to a secret ballot is a traditional minority right which I defend, although I make no secret of the fact that I am voting against Turkey's accession."
"It has become perfectly clear that these are not points of order, but rather explanations of the attitudes of each Member towards the issue we are dealing with and I therefore see no need or reason to continue giving the floor for points of order."
"Nevertheless, we must organise our work and we must, of course, do so in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, which sometimes lend themselves to interpretations that must be clarified, as in this case."
"The Presidency has received three requests for secret ballots presented in accordance with Rule 162(2) of the Rules of Procedure, which says, and I quote – I will do so in Spanish and naturally it will have to be translated: ‘Voting may also be by secret ballot if requested by at least one-fifth of the component Members of Parliament."
"Such requests must be made before voting begins.’"
"With regard to the application of this provision, in this case, having heard those Members who have spoken under the guise of points of order and naturally having sought the opinion and the advice of the legal services of the House and the General Secretariat, which I am obliged to do, I can tell you the following: firstly, that the competent services have confirmed to me that these requests have been endorsed by a sufficient number of Members and that they have in fact been presented on time."
"Secondly, we have the issue, that some of you have raised, of the interpretation of whether or not we are obliged to hold a secret ballot, since Rule 162(2), which has been mentioned so often this morning, says that ‘voting may also be by secret ballot’ rather than ‘voting will also be’."
"There is, therefore, room for interpretation of what the Rules of Procedure say."
"Aware that this issue would be subject to debate, before this sitting, the Presidency studied the relevant precedents and judgments of the Court of Justice and, regardless of my own personal views on how things should be done, my obligation is to try to interpret the Rules of Procedure in a manner which is as close as possible to the Law and, to this end, I must point out to the House that there is the precedent of President Cox considering, in the meeting of 12 June 2002, that the term ‘may be secret’ implied that the proposal should automatically be accepted and that, if a sufficient number of Members requested it, their request should be granted."
"Furthermore, the Court of First Instance of the European Communities issued a judgment in October 2001 in which it also interpreted the term ‘may’ or ‘can’ as an obligatory condition in relation to a Rule of Procedure similar to the one we are dealing with now."
"In accordance with these precedents and regardless – I would insist – of the opinions of any particular person on whether matters should be done one way or another, the Presidency believes that, since a request has been presented on time and correctly, we must proceed to a secret ballot ..."
"... although this issue, for future occasions, must be considered by Parliament’s committee responsible for issues relating to Rules of Procedure."
"We shall probably have to clarify in the future whether or not the Presidency's interpretation is correct, but at this point in the procedure, the Presidency must take responsibility for the decision without having the opportunity to take the advice of the competent committees, and it is my feeling, having heard all the Members and the legal services, that according to a correct interpretation of the Rules of Procedure we must proceed to the secret ballot requested, and that is what we are going to do."
"With regard to how the vote will be taken, I must inform the honourable Members that I have decided that we shall use the electronic procedure in accordance with Rule 161(1) and there is, therefore, no reason to designate a college of tellers."
"It shall be secret, but electronic."
"Having said that, we shall begin the votes."
"Mr President, I should like to propose an oral amendment to Amendment No 71, as it mentions certain facts with which not everyone is familiar."
"On behalf of my group, I should like to suggest replacing the phrase ‘the re-opening to pilgrims of the Armenian National Mausoleum in northern Anatolia’ – in which the word ‘mausoleum’ is an inaccurate translation – with the phrase ‘the re-opening to pilgrims of the ruined Armenian churches of Ani, near Kars in Eastern Anatolia’."
"None of our Armenian friends were aware of this place or of its opening to pilgrims."
"The same can be said for the second oral amendment I would like to propose."
"There is doubt as to whether Turkish historians are in fact keen to carry out research into the genocide, and I therefore propose removing the reference to ‘Turkish historians’ in the plural, and merely including the name of the head of their school, or ‘Halil Berktay’, the Turkish historian who has done a great deal to further our knowledge of the Armenian genocide."
"Ladies and gentlemen, many of you have said that you were unfamiliar with this name, and that the amendment was out of place, but you should now be aware that it is a reference to Halil Berktay."
"The rest is to remain unchanged, as these were merely clarifications."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, vehicle theft is on the rise in Europe, as is a feeling of insecurity among our citizens."
"Europol tells us that of the 1 million-plus cars stolen in 2002, fewer than 39% were recovered."
"In Parliament we have adopted and recommended various measures."
"We did this as recently as March and I congratulate the Council for finally implementing some of them."
"Better late than never."
"The proposal submitted to us by the Netherlands is well intentioned but in the wrong form."
"The text submitted to us should have fallen under the scope of the first pillar and not the third."
"The Commission upheld our arguments in this regard."
"Some people in this House felt that it should be rejected for this reason."
"We saw it differently in the Civil Liberties Committee."
"We have removed from the text anything that should exclusively fall under the Community pillar and included anything that could be covered by the intergovernmental pillar."
"Mr President, we have proved that Parliament has acted in good faith and is sensitive to the growing problem of car theft and the criminality that goes with it."
"We should like to give one message to the Council: it would be good if, in the future, the Council and the Member States showed greater respect for Parliament’s prerogatives."
"One last word to thank all those Members of this House who contributed with proposals and advice, in particular the Members of the Transport Committee and Mr Jardim Fernandes and Mrs Wortmann-Kool."
"Mr President, our oral Amendment No 28 is intended to provide better and more effective protection for the rights we intend to protect and to do so in a realistic manner, not through utopian proposals."
"For the sake of realism, based on experience, what we are asking, Mr President, is that the expression ‘in the applicant’s own language’ be replaced with the expression ‘a language comprehensible to the applicant’."
"Mr President, in order not to be tiresome, I will simply say that my arguments are the same as those I put forward in defence of oral Amendment No 28."
"– Mr President, it is with great pleasure that I give an explanation of my vote on the report on Turkey’s accession to the European Union."
"I shall start by saying that I voted against Turkey joining the European Union, but I should like to explain how I arrived at that decision."
"Last week, on 9 December, I found myself in Reggio Calabria, where I had been invited by the Pensioners’ Party official Carlo Rositani to give a lecture at the Tommaso Gulli Teacher Training College."
"I asked a class of about 120 girls aged between 16 and 19 to vote for or against Turkey’s accession to the European Union."
"The ballot of these 120 youngsters gave the following result: 100 girls out of 120 voted against accession while the other 20 abstained."
"I have therefore willingly gone along with those young people’s vote."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey."
"This is a matter of principle for me."
"The European Union, founded in Rome in 1957, has always defined itself in Christian and democratic terms, based on Greek philosophy, Roman law and Christian faith."
"As a result of today's profoundly misguided decision by the European Parliament, we are abandoning this spirit of Rome."
"The former French President, Giscard d'Estaing, is quite right: it would indeed be the end of the EU as we know it."
"May God protect the West's Christian civilisation."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on Turkey and I believe we did good work today."
"We have given encouragement to those inside Turkey and indeed to those outside Turkey who have campaigned and worked hard for a secular Turkish state, a Turkish state based on democracy and a Turkish state that respects human rights."
"We have also sent a strong message to the 15 million Muslims who already live inside the European Union that this is not an exclusive Christian club."
"So all in all I am very pleased with the work we have carried out this morning."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to remind all Members of this House, both those who voted for and those who voted against, that the vote was not on whether Turkey should be accepted into the European Union or not."
"This may well be a good thing."
"What Parliament has done is to vote in favour of opening negotiations with Turkey."
"Whether Turkey joins the European Union or not will depend on the course of these negotiations and on their outcome."
"It is my impression that there are still Members of the House who are not aware of this."
"– Mr President, I am opposed to Parliament’s decision to begin negotiations on Turkey’s accession, because Turkey is not Europe!"
"In addition, we are running the risk of one day seeing a flag flying over these institutions – the Turkish flag – which is still stained with the blood of the Armenian people, whose holocaust is not recognised by Turkey."
"We have betrayed the spirit of Lepanto, a thousand-year tradition of a Europe that is and wants to remain attached to its Christian roots."
"Turkish society, moreover, is still closely tied to the principles of Islamic fundamentalism, and that is a grave danger of which Europe should be more aware."
"We are therefore proud to have voted against starting the procedures for Turkey to join Europe, and we consider that those European politicians who irresponsibly supported that decision should be ashamed of themselves, because the decision goes against the wishes of the majority of the people."
"We call for a referendum to be held in all the countries of the European Union so that the people can have their say, because the peoples of Europe are against Turkey’s accession."
"Mr President, in of 8 December, Mr Erdogan, the Turkish Prime Minister, stated that if the EU is not a Christian club, then it should be possible for an Islamic country such as Turkey to join."
"What this means is that Europe should abandon its individuality, or a large proportion of it anyway, while Turkey is allowed to stay an Islamic club."
"A few days later, Mr Erdogan, in alerted the European leaders to the fact that violence from Islamic extremists could escalate if Europe rejects Turkey as a candidate country."
"Since Mr Erdogan is himself from that background, we can consider this as a downright threat, as blackmail, pure and simple."
"We in the European Parliament no longer even have the self-respect to act against that kind of blackmail."
"Moreover, how will we in future reject applications from Morocco, for example, if we include a non-European country such as Turkey?"
"The public is being taken for a ride; we are told that Turkey is being assessed according to the Copenhagen criteria, but that does not appear to be the case."
"It is not a problem that in Turkey, torture is being carried out on a massive scale, that Turkey has its troops occupying part of the territory of an existing Member State and even refuses to recognise that state."
"I can only conclude that we in this House have become too pusillanimous to carry on protecting our own interests as Europeans."
"Mr President, let me focus on the positive aspects first."
"We have intensified our confrontation course on human rights issues – which is directed against the Turkish Government, not the Turkish people – by calling for rights and freedoms for the Kurds and for the genocide perpetrated against the Armenians to be acknowledged and properly examined."
"Another positive point is that we have not demanded Turkey's accession, but merely the opening of accession negotiations, which I voted against."
"Given that the Members who are in favour of accession negotiations include many who are ultimately opposed to accession, we appear to be on the right track."
"We were in the minority at first, but our course is now endorsed by the largest group in this House, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and we just need another 40 Members to adopt a clear position over the coming years."
"There will then be no majority in this House in favour of Turkey's accession to the European Union when we finally take a binding vote on this issue."
"That apart, it is a matter for the PPE-DE Heads of Government, at the Brussels summit in two days' time, to stop the onward surge of the lemmings, which inevitably ends in disaster."
". Our Europe is an open Europe, founded on the European public culture derived from our common values and standards."
"This ‘unity in diversity’ is both Europe’s most important characteristic and its greatest asset."
"The implication of such a political project is that there are limits."
"The Union’s further enlargement should not stand in the way of its becoming even deeper."
"After all, Turkish membership threatens to turn the Union into a merely economic cooperative which will no longer be able to carry out important supranational responsibilities in a coordinated manner."
"A Union devoid of any strength and spirit, paralysed by internal contradictions; that is not the outcome for which many had worked and about which they had dreamed."
"There is no doubt that Turkey has made an important journey over the past few years."
"These reforms and in-depth economic cooperation must definitely be continued."
"In this respect, a special partnership between the Union and Turkey seems to be the appropriate route, in which, alongside far-reaching economic cooperation, conditions can also be agreed in the areas of the Kurds, women’s rights and human rights in general."
"Since this latter element is not provided for in the report, I shall be voting against the report and the resolution."
". Although the Commission’s report was well-founded, its recommendations of 6 October no longer required Turkey to recognise the Armenian genocide of 1915."
"This genocide resulted in the death of over one million people, which was equivalent to nearly two thirds of the country’s largest minority."
"This crime, which was carried out with intent and which led to widespread and systematic destruction, was the first genocide of the twentieth century, and yet even today the Turkish State continues to oppose references to it."
"The worst possible course of action now would be to remain silent."
"The Commission’s silence could lead one to think that this tragedy does not concern it in any way, and that it is a problem for Turks and Armenians alone."
"This is something I find disturbing, not for reasons of religion, history or community, but because this is a political issue which has direct bearing on democracy and human rights."
"This is an issue which goes back to the very foundations of the European Union, laid after the Second World War when France and Germany affirmed their desire to bring peace to Europe. This meant that our continent’s most tragic hours were overcome, even though the full extent of the extermination of Jews would not be fully acknowledged until later."
"This is why the Armenian issue is crucial for a Europe seeking to become an area of freedom and anti-totalitarianism where a modern and secular citizenship flourishes."
". I abstained from voting on the European Commission’s 2004 regular report and recommendations on Turkey’s progress towards accession for the following reasons."
"I believe that the European Union’s inability to formulate, approve and construct a coherent political project is a major obstacle to the welcoming of Turkey into the Community."
"It appears to me to be questionable, if not irresponsible, to pursue a policy of never-ending enlargement at a time when the political dimension of the European Union and its social and tax harmonisation are far from a reality."
"At present, the European Union is not in a position to make political proposals of genuine integration to a country the size of Turkey."
"I would note that our position is not based on arguments relating to geographical, historical, religious or cultural aspects."
"It is not Turkey’s ability to meet a certain number of conditions which has caused me to hold such a view, but the European Union’s inability to provide the necessary framework to create a common future."
". – On behalf of the CSU Members of the European Parliament, I would like to clarify our position in relation to the possible opening of accession negotiations with Turkey once more."
"Today's vote has shown that the 'privileged partnership' model is endorsed by many of our fellow Members from all EU Member States and all political groups."
"This refutes the arguments, in particular, of those who claim that the CDU and the CSU are isolated on this issue in Europe."
"I hope that the European Council will also take this into account at its deliberations on Friday."
"We continue to take the view that the European Union's record of success would be massively jeopardised by Turkish accession."
"Anyone wanting Europe to degenerate into a free-trade area will achieve their objective through Turkey's accession."
"If, on the other hand, we want a strong Europe with the capacity to act, the special relationship established by a privileged partnership is the appropriate means by which to fulfil this aim."
"The European Council, at its meeting on Friday, must be mindful of this responsibility."
". I abstained from voting on the European Commission’s 2004 regular report and recommendations regarding negotiations on Turkey’s accession to the European Union for the following reasons."
"I believe that the European Union’s inability to formulate, approve and construct a coherent political project is a major obstacle to the welcoming of Turkey into the Community."
"It appears to me to be questionable, if not irresponsible, to follow a policy of never-ending enlargement at a time when the political dimension of the European Union and its social and tax harmonisation are far from a reality."
"At present, the European Union is not in a position to make political proposals of genuine integration to a country the size of Turkey."
"I would note that my position is not based on arguments relating to geographical, historical, religious or cultural aspects."
"It is not Turkey’s ability to meet a certain number of conditions which has caused me to hold such a view, but the European Union’s inability to provide the necessary framework to create a common future."
". I will be voting in favour of opening negotiations with Turkey for membership of the European Union."
"Turkey does not as yet meet the criteria for membership."
"Its record on human rights with respect to its Kurdish and Assyrian minorities is deeply flawed."
"Its record with respect to trade union rights is poor."
"It has failed properly to come to terms with the Armenian genocide."
"Yet none of these should be seen as barriers to starting a process that will enable the Commission and Parliament to press for their correction."
"A 'yes' vote today will support the campaigns of all progressive forces in Turkey to shed the last remnants of Turkey's authoritarian past."
"If together we can achieve these changes I will support Turkey joining the Union, as my Europe is based on shared values that are not limited to one particular set of religious values and beliefs."
"If we do not achieve this, I will vote 'no', even if the economic conditions have been met."
"I voted in favour of opening the process of Turkey’s accession to the EU. This does not entail making a final decision on this process, which will take years to negotiate."
"Furthermore, I voted against partnership status, because that would mean that the EU has not honoured its promises."
"I voted in favour, particularly in light of the testimonies of numerous Turkish human rights defenders, who have confirmed that there have been positive developments in Turkey."
"Those developments are not sufficient, of course; there are still political prisoners, there is still torture in prisons and there remains much to do."
"Stopping the process of opening negotiations at this time would have terrible consequences for the human rights situation in Turkey."
"I voted in favour, although we have not had the opportunity for serious contemplation as to where Europe should extend, and because I do not accept the political and cultural borders of the ‘Christian Club Europe’, nor the prophecies of the ‘clash of civilisations’."
"I voted in favour, provided that Turkey recognises, without delay, the EU Member State of Cyprus, and withdraws, without delay, from the part of Cyprus that it occupies militarily."
"I voted in favour of acknowledging the genocide of the Armenian people by Turkey, as I believe that this is essential for reconciliation with its neighbours and with its history."
"The June List does not view Turkey’s geographical position or its Muslim religion as obstacles to its membership of the EU."
"We welcome the fact that Turkey is drawing closer to the EU."
"We must not, however, close our eyes to the fact that both Turkey and the EU must change before full EU membership is possible."
"Turkey must acknowledge the Armenian genocide."
"It must give its minorities full human rights."
"It must achieve a level of economic development such that its membership does not release tensions that may threaten the internal market."
"The EU must also change."
"The common agricultural policy must be abolished, and structural policy must be revised before Turkey, large and poor as it is, can be absorbed."
"To ensure grass-roots support, membership negotiations should, moreover, only be embarked upon once the issue has been debated in the Member States’ election campaigns up until 2008."
"Finally, the issue of the EU’s Constitution must be solved before the EU adopts a position on the issue of negotiations concerning Turkish membership."
". I voted against this report."
"Our fellow citizens are concerned about these future enlargements, and above all about the continuing lack of responses to the crucial question of where Europe’s borders lie."
"Turkey does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus, a Member State of the European Union which it has occupied for 30 years, and it punishes anyone who refers to the Armenian genocide."
"Ninety-seven per cent of Turkey’s territory is outside Europe, and Turkey therefore has no right to join the European Union."
"Turkey’s integration into the EU would be tantamount to rejecting a political Europe straightaway, before it has even come into being, and to perpetuating the image of a Europe subject to blackmail and pressure."
"Would this be a sensible course of action?"
"Those in favour of Turkey’s accession hide behind the Copenhagen criteria under the pretext that Turkey could one day adhere to them, yet this is a trick."
"It is not enough to insist only on adherence to these criteria as an indispensable condition to be met before any new accession, because this would mean that any country in the world which adhered to them could, in its turn, join the European Union."
"This is why I hope that the Council will agree to the idea of a privileged partnership put forward by France."
". Today this House has finally reached a decision on Turkey’s membership of the European Union."
"This was a vote eagerly awaited by European citizens, who struggle to understand their governments’ attitudes on this issue."
"I voted against the draft report by Mr Eurlings, as it came to the conclusion that ‘the European Council [should] open the negotiations with Turkey without undue delay’, and that ‘the objective of the negotiations is Turkish EU membership’."
"The European project is a well-defined one, the aim of which is to share a number of competences between neighbouring and similar countries in order to build a new political whole."
"Integrating Turkey into this whole would be problematic for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, Turkey is not part of the European continent in geographical terms, as over 90% of its territory is in Asia, and 90% of its borders are with Asian countries."
"Secondly, throughout history Turkey has shared none of our values, with such values ensuring that Europe today is based on a foundation of common traditions kept alive by all of us."
"Finally, I should like to advance a weighty argument which directly affects our institutional structure; if Turkey enters the European Union it will have the largest population of any Member State, which will mean …"
". The European Parliamentary Labour Party strongly welcomes the clear recommendation in this resolution, that EU leaders should announce the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey without delay."
"We recognise the sensitivities with regard to issues surrounding Turkey's relations with Armenia, however these will be dealt with during the negotiations process."
"The report does not in any way imply that resolution of these issues is a precondition to opening talks."
"We also register our opposition to any permanent safeguards affecting free movement of workers."
"Turkey should receive equal, fair and proper treatment during the negotiations."
"– As Chairman of the European Parliament’s Delegation on the countries of the South Caucasus, I welcome the adoption by a large majority of the Eurlings report on opening accession negotiations with Turkey, and would reiterate how crucial it is for the peoples of Europe and for the stability of an entire continent to open the doors of the European Union to this country."
"I regret the fact that the European Union did not make the issue of lifting the blockade and opening the border with Turkey’s neighbour, Armenia, part of the discussions on Turkey’s possible accession from the outset, and I regret that Turkey has not taken this historic opportunity to show goodwill by opening its border with Armenia."
"Yet using the border issue and the Armenian genocide as reasons to refuse to open up to Turkey, as right-wing French political parties in particular have done, is unacceptable."
"They are wrong to brandish this argument so soon before the Council makes its decision on opening negotiations, and their only purpose in so doing is to hide their real reasons for rejecting Turkey’s integration."
"– More and more European nations, following the example of the French, Germans, Greeks and Austrians, are showing their opposition to Turkey, an Asian country which is part of the Muslim world, entering Europe."
"The leaders of the Europe of Brussels, in particular Mr Chirac, are well aware of this."
"That is why they are maintaining that opening the accession negotiations would not automatically lead to Turkey’s accession."
"This assertion, repeated in Mr Eurlings’ report, is an untruth: since the first enlargement of 1972, every negotiation process has been followed by the accession of the candidate country."
"It will be the same for Turkey, especially as its Islamist leaders have warned us that they will not make any concessions."
"If on 17 December, against the will of the people, the European Council decides to open accession negotiations with the Turkish Government, the referendum on the European Constitution will be France’s last opportunity to avoid being swallowed up in a union that is European in name alone, and in which Turkey, the most populous country, will play a prominent part."
"– I am against any further enlargement until the Union has achieved deeper political integration and created a powerful Europe and a social Europe."
"With each enlargement the prospect of a federal Europe fades."
"Turkey’s entry will further dilute the European project, and it is not desirable for it to be integrated into the EU in its present form."
"The issue that will arise for everyone has nothing to do with either religion or geography: the European Union has to be a political project."
"This project is now under threat because it is being limited to a free-trade area with less and less regulation."
"We need to overhaul the architecture of Europe and have a federal core, then a Union of 27 countries and then a zone of enhanced cooperation with neighbouring countries such as Turkey, and also other countries like the Maghreb countries, with which we enjoy close links."
"Approving the opening of negotiations makes this a more distant prospect and continues a policy of ongoing enlargement."
"Legitimate requirements are made of Turkey, but it goes without saying that if this country meets them it will be impossible to refuse it entry."
"Before any possible accession negotiations we need to define the future shape of Europe."
"We should reject enlargement and begin a different kind of cooperation with Turkey."
". As a Member of this House, I have belonged to the parliamentary friendship group with Turkey for as long as it has existed."
"No one, therefore, can accuse me of not being well-disposed towards Turkey."
"As things stand, however, I feel I am justified in asking whether all the conditions – especially as regards human rights – have genuinely been fulfilled."
"I gladly acknowledge that on the issue of women's rights, for example, more reforms have been introduced since Turkey was granted the prospect of accession than in the decades before."
"Nonetheless, they have largely taken place on paper; the reality still lags behind."
"I was recently confronted with information alleging that sterilisations of Kurdish women have been carried out in Turkey."
"When we signed an Association Agreement with Turkey in 1963, which offered the prospect of membership, the European Union did not exist; at that time, we were still the European Economic Community."
"Since a customs union with Turkey has existed since 1996, what we have now is very similar to an economic community in which any remaining trade barriers can be dismantled swiftly."
"From this perspective too, and because there is no question that Turkey must remain fully anchored in European structures, the option of a tailor-made special status instead of the discriminatory membership deal proposed by the Commission would appear to be a more accessible and honourable path for Turkey, aside from the fact that there are justified doubts …"
". – I voted in favour of the report by Mr Εurlings on Turkey's progress towards accession to the European Union, because it is the product of compromise between the various political groups in the European Parliament."
"However, I am in no way bound by the phrase in paragraph 38 concerning use of the Annan plan as a basis for efforts to settle the Cyprus question, in that this plan was rejected by 76% of Greek Cypriots and 67% of all Cypriots."
"As Article 38 rightly says, a solution can be found on the basis of the principles upon which the EU is founded."
"I also have reservations about the exact content of paragraph 39, which I consider to be incompatible with the report by Mrs Mechtild Rothe, which the European Parliament voted in favour of about a month ago (see: Rothe report, Amendment No 2, Recital 4a (new) (4a) page 6/15)."
". Since the Atatürk revolution in 1923, Turkey has been a typically European country, albeit of the old-fashioned, authoritarian kind, which we no longer want in Europe these days."
"The army’s power is immense; there are political prisoners; parties and newspapers are often banned and an electoral threshold of 10% keeps even most legal parties outside of parliament."
"Kurds, Armenians and Assyrians are given the choice between leaving the country or adapting to the language, the culture and religion of the Turkish majority."
"Turkey must change a great deal before we can welcome it, not only in its legislation but also in daily life."
"After more than 40 years, it is now proposed to open negotiations shortly with a view to full membership of the EU."
"That is also what the millions of Europeans of Turkish origin want."
"A decision as to whether Turkey may join will be made not before, but during, the negotiations."
"There is the risk that the Turkish Government may consider that after three or five years’ negotiations, Turkey deserves EU membership, without the problems of democracy, human rights and ethnic minorities having been resolved by then, with the potential for conflicts and an eventual rift."
"The Copenhagen criteria must not be replaced by Ankara criteria."
". I have voted for Turkey's progress towards accession despite having serious reservations."
"I would like to emphasise that my reason for voting Turkey's progress towards accession is because it is a Muslim country and will serve as an important bridge between Europe and the Middle East in particular."
"I have concerns, however, that Turkey still has a very large number of human rights abuses."
"I also have concerns that a country with such a massive number of people living in poverty will not be able to reach the levels acquired in the , and I fear that the emphasis has been on the market access to Turkey rather than the need for Turkey to conform to the social and environmental standards in the EU."
"I am not interested in seeing the enlargement of Europe simply in order to see a larger market."
"An equal emphasis must be placed on social and environmental considerations."
". – The delegation has voted for the Eurlings report on the opening of the accession procedure for Turkey, a procedure that will take several years."
"The opening of the procedure unequivocally heralds a change in the political course steered by the Turkish Government, not only in respect of the Community and the Copenhagen conditions but especially concerning the resolution of the Armenian and the Kurdish questions."
"The believes that the Council decision of 17 December should make it unequivocally clear that the opening of negotiations with Turkey requires the Turkish Government’s recognition of the State of Cyprus, a full Member State of the European Union, and consequently the resolution of the Cypriot question, which means the withdrawal of the 35 000 Turkish troops which, in occupying Cyprus, are occupying a territory of the European Union."
"The will watch to ensure that the guarantees and conditions included in the report are complied with, because a successful conclusion to Turkey’s journey towards accession will not be possible unless they are complied with."
". – Turkey’s possible accession to the European Union brings with it many benefits and a few risks."
"The benefits are more political than economic since, as well as being a member of NATO, Turkey has signed a customs union treaty with the European Union that already permits free trade."
"Its accession would not only fulfil the dream of millions of citizens of fully belonging to the secular western world, but it would shift the centre of gravity of political and economic influence towards the Mediterranean basin, confirming Europe as a world power no longer closed in within its geopolitical boundaries."
"On the other hand, the risks that should be taken into consideration are, first, the reduced likelihood of seeing the birth of a Europe with its own common foreign policy, as well as the possible difficulty of making two diverse religious and cultural identities coexist."
"Can it describe itself yet as a democratic state that respects its ethnic minorities?"
"Secondly, it would have a negative effect on the allocation of European funds to regions currently considered to be ‘lagging behind in their development’, such as Sicily, at least in the short term."
"Lastly, Turkey should withdraw from that part of Cyprus under military occupation, and it goes without saying that it must declare its willingness to square its account with history by acknowledging the errors it has made over the last hundred years ..."
"– I abstained from the final vote on the Eurlings report."
"It would, firstly, be reasonable not to consider any further enlargement before first deciding where Europe’s borders lie."
"Pushing back their limits indefinitely risks turning Europe into nothing more than a vast free-trade area."
"Such a renouncement is anathema to convinced federalists."
"Secondly, experience shows that once negotiations have been opened, accession inevitably follows once the candidate country meets the conditions laid down, and in particular the Copenhagen criteria."
"But although we might legitimately hope that Turkey will continue to build on the progress it has made, particularly on democracy and human rights, there is as yet no guarantee that Europe is prepared to provide the resources, not least the budgetary resources, to go ahead with such an enlargement in a mutually satisfactory way."
"My abstention is then a warning to the European Summit of 17 December: no more enlargement without deeper integration!"
"We have to stop presenting the peoples of Europe with and instructing them to ratify decisions taken in their absence several years earlier by the Heads of State or Government."
". This report updates Turkey’s development as regards its eventual accession to the EU, in common with the report by Mr Oostlander adopted on 1 April."
"As I had the opportunity to write then, I feel that Turkey was perhaps hastily recognised by the Council as a candidate for accession."
"In the same way, I believe that the Commission recently repeated the mistake when it deemed that the Copenhagen criteria have already been satisfied, while there are still situations such as those detailed in the motion for a resolution that are blatantly at variance with this position."
"I endorse the rapporteur’s position that this must be an open-ended process, without a predetermined outcome, albeit a process that does point towards accession."
"I also share his desire to see that, regardless of the outcome, Turkey presses ahead with and firmly establishes the welcome reforms that it has been carrying out. In so doing it will confirm its credentials as a fully democratic and responsible country and one that respects human rights."
"– I supported opening accession negotiations with Turkey, and I did so for one reason above all: I want a better world for tomorrow, characterised by stability and security."
"No one can see into the future, but I know one thing: sharing this area of peace and democracy on which our Union is founded is a unique opportunity that we cannot allow to slip away."
"Yes, we should stand firm in the name of historical truth, which is why I continue, as I have done in the past, to demand that the Turkish authorities acknowledge their part in the Armenian genocide."
"One truth and one history: we owe it to that same history also to remember that for 50 years Turkey has played an essential role as a loyal ally at the gates of Europe."
"Standing firm means sending out a strong message: the marriage will only take place if further considerable progress is made on respect for minorities and gender equality."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament supported my amendment to Paragraph 26 on zero tolerance with regard to crimes of honour."
"In conclusion, I would ask that the people have a say in the final decision: referendum or consultations …"
". Many advantages could be gained from Turkey’s accession to the European Union, above all an extension of the common market and a strengthening of transatlantic links."
"Yet both these goals can be achieved without Turkey joining the European Union."
"The European Economic Area is an excellent example of a platform for good economic cooperation with the EU."
"It could also be useful to propose a reform of security policy to Turkey, as the country is one of Europe’s major strategic partners in the field of security."
"A privileged partnership of this kind with Turkey would provide us with the chance of avoiding a crisis of agricultural policy and cohesion policy."
"If we wish to avoid migration-related conflicts, we should not be instrumental in a Muslim country becoming the European Union’s largest Member State in the near future."
"It is estimated that Turkey will have a population of around 90 million in 2020."
"The development of closer relations with Turkey should also be kept more in proportion to Europe’s policy of openness towards Ukraine."
"These are all good reasons why we cannot vote in favour of the Eurlings report."
"We consider it to be imprudent, as despite serious grounds for opposition to Turkey’s membership in the EU it continues to support such a membership."
"The ongoing discussion of Turkey’s chances of joining the European Union will fuel increased resentment in Turkey."
". I supported the Eurlings report and should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work."
"I will say this in public since we were unable to demonstrate our position in another way on account of the unfortunate secret ballot."
"My vote in favour of opening negotiations certainly does not mean that I cannot wait for them to start."
"My group rightly believes that it is actually too soon, and I share that view."
"At the same time, though, we would like to remain realistic, because after all, the train was put in motion in 1999 and in 2002."
"Moreover, we expect that the European Council will give the negotiations the green light."
"What matters to us in the ballot is that the Union should retain its credibility and that we send a clear message about the conditions under which these open-ended negotiations are to proceed."
"The conditions in the report are strict, but fair."
"We support them wholeheartedly, and that is why I have voted in favour."
". I voted in favour of the report before us because I feel that the initiatives concerned, which are intended to adopt a Council decision on vehicle crime with cross-border implications, addresses the concerns that we ought to have as regards combating crime."
"Furthermore, despite the fact that conferring direct access to SIS may appear to run counter to the rule that ‘data may not be used for administrative purposes’, the truth is that the necessary safeguards are in place to ensure that this cannot happen in this case."
". Vehicle theft makes up a significant proportion of crime and has cross-border implications for the EU, and as such is an issue requiring urgent action."
"One must also take into account the fact that this particular form of crime is more often than not only one element of broader criminal activity, encompassing various types of crime spread across an enormous geographical area."
"It is therefore crucial that the movement and registration process for vehicles from other Member States and, indeed, third countries is monitored extremely carefully."
"The rapporteur was right to observe that the new feature of the Dutch proposal is that of national contact points."
"I feel that it will be useful to monitor the effectiveness of their activities and periodically to review the methods and practices adopted."
"The Commission’s White Paper on the subject, as proposed by the rapporteur, will accord this issue a broader scope."
". We welcome the amendments to the current recommendation for a second reading on the proposal tabled in April, given that they largely correspond with our proposals, which were as follows: that priority should be given to public health and to protecting the most vulnerable groups such as children and the unborn; that maximum residue levels (MRLs) should be set for products, taking account of the variations in climate and on the basis of the best available agricultural practices; that health risks should be explained to the public; that the risks to consumers should be assessed; that the results of national monitoring of residues should be published on the Internet; that the scope of the proposal should be widened to include imported products; and that civil society might be involved in setting MRLs."
"It should be pointed out, however, that there is a long way to go on this issue, especially as regards implementing a common agricultural policy that respects the existing cultural diversity, whereby policies are put in place that promote small and medium-sized farming, in contrast with the current measures in place, which, if they achieve their aims, will sacrifice and penalise farmers with fewer resources."
"The creation of MRLs on pesticides in food for ..."
". I welcome this report and the objectives contained within it."
"However, we must remember that having established regulations for maximum residue levels of pesticides in food and feed of plant and animal origin, the main priority must be that it is properly implemented and regulated."
"Consumers deserve to be protected and thorough implementation can safe-guard their rights."
". I wholeheartedly welcome this report, because I consider that recasting and streamlining Community legislation in this area fosters trade within the internal market and with third countries, and does no harm from a Portuguese perspective."
". The proposal before us seeks to recast Community legislation on pesticides by replacing the four directives in force with one single regulation."
"The proposal also seeks to safeguard certain key objectives, such as establishing a homogenous level of consumer protection throughout the Community, by defining the role of the European Food Safety Authority, and by increasing the trade in foodstuffs within the EU."
"I believe that significant progress has been made between the first and second readings, namely the Council’s adoption of both the amendments tabled by Parliament and the introduction of amendments to its initiative, which have certainly improved the Commission’s original proposal."
"I feel, however, that there remain aspects that could be clarified, such as the distinction between residues – in the context of maximum residue limits (MRLs) – and pesticides."
"I agree with the rapporteur, however, that when MRLs are exceeded, those responsible must be held to account and subgroups that may consume more of a certain type of product must be fully protected."
"Mr President, I welcome the fact that we have made our position clear to Russia."
"Like Turkey, Russia is a country which is only partly European and will never join the EU, but it is an extremely important partner."
"However, precisely because it is an important partner, we must steadfastly oppose the systematic dismantling of democracy and the rule of law in Russia and the continuing genocide against the Chechen people in a colonial war."
"I therefore wish to send a clear message to President Putin from this House: we regard Russia as an important partner, but the statement which he has made against Ukraine, its liberation movement and the liberation of Central and Eastern Europe is an attack on free Europe."
"We are hoping for cooperation here, not for a continuation of this unacceptable confrontation course."
". I voted in favour of this motion for a joint resolution because I feel that the question before us – relations between the EU and Russia, which is an important international player and the most important neighbour of many of the countries covered by our neighbourhood policy – is crucially important for the future of the area that we share throughout the European continent, and as regards certain concerns at world level."
"Nevertheless, I must point out that, in spite of the reservations that I have expressed, I welcome the concern at Russia’s interference in countries that were previously part of its sphere of influence."
". The strategic relevance of relations between the EU and the Russian Federation is undeniable, and the ongoing initiatives to promote and institutionalise those relations are to be welcomed."
"Indeed, common borders and interests combine to create an enlarged area of understanding, given the mutual interest in maintaining permanent dialogue on the fields proposed for the four common spaces, the common economic space; the common space of freedom, security and justice; the common space of cooperation in the field of external security; the common space of research, education and culture."
"That is not to overlook the worrying signs in the area of human rights and civil liberties that have come to light in Russia, as regards political processes and procedures and the question of Chechnya."
"The same can also be said of Moscow’s disastrous interventions, recently in Ukraine and previously in Georgia and Belarus, which have done nothing to benefit the political processes of those countries."
"I note and appreciate the desire shown by Russia to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Second World War, but I completely reject the manner in which the victory for democracy and freedom is compared with the criminal totalitarian subjugation to which all peoples to the east of the iron curtain were subjected."
"The two Commission communications on the common asylum policy are most welcome. They are intended to raise the standard of application of the current directives in the EU, providing for the possibility of a review and to improve conditions for the vast majority of refugees within the region they are fleeing."
"I welcome these Commission proposals intended to improve the assessment process by adopting a single procedure, thereby simplifying the process for both the applicant and the administration."
"Improvements are to be introduced to training, in-country assessment and the related information and judicial procedures."
"I also welcome the additional measures proposed, which offer the means for managed, legal entry into the EU, not least if they help to reduce trafficking in human beings, along with the intention to develop high-quality protection regimes in receiving countries."
"I cannot agree, however, with some of the proposals put forward by Mrs Lambert in her report and shall, therefore, be voting against."
"One of the main reasons why I reject the report is that it plans to extend the scope of the Directive on minimum standards for procedures"
". I supported, spoke in favour and voted in favour of Jean Denise Lambert’s report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin (2004/2121(INI)) on Asylum."
"The overwhelming majority of the report was positive and in line with my own party policy."
"However I have strong reservations about point 19 when it states ‘Considers that a decisive common foreign and security policy committing the EU as a matter of priority to the resolution of long terms conflicts and conflict prevention…’"
"Sinn Féin believes that the EU through its member states must play a greater role in conflict prevention and resolution and in promoting dialogue and negotiation as an alternative to military intervention."
"However we are wary of the moves within the EU towards the development of a common foreign and security policy as this would undermine national sovereignty."
"The most appropriate vehicle for dealing with such issues is through member state cooperation and under the auspices of the United Nations."
"The EU should play a more pro-active role on conflict resolution and prevention within this context."
". Whilst we do not accept, and are in fact critical of, certain aspects of this EP initiative report, such as its supranational outlook and its support for the common foreign and security policy, we also appreciate its positive aspects."
"We feel that, as part of the current policies pursued at EU level, this resolution criticises very mildly, and does not condemn clearly, the impact of the current EU asylum policy. It does, however, among other points, highlight this threat to ‘the European humanitarian tradition’ and criticises what is termed the ‘outsourcing’ of the process of application by sending applicants for refugee status to a third country, and condemns the lengthy processing of asylum claims."
"The resolution contains a number of points that we welcome, such as its call for strict compliance with international standards, encompassing the principle that refugees may not be expelled (allowing the asylum seeker to enter the country in which the request was made); the rejection of any funding for detention camps or any other centre restricting asylum seekers’ personal freedom; and an end to the policy of repatriation and readmission aimed at sending immigrants back to their countries of origin, as our group had proposed."
"Hence our vote in favour."
"The report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin is part of establishing the first stage of a common European asylum system, and the aim is to apply one and the same procedure to international protection in all the Member States."
"The June List does not, however, wish to contribute to any Fortress Europe."
"An EU Member State must be able to conduct a generous refugee policy if it wishes to do so."
"We cannot therefore support the report."
"– This report is a further step towards the adoption of a single asylum procedure."
"Curiously, it does not apply solely to political refugees, who should nevertheless be the only ones entitled to apply for asylum under the Geneva Convention."
"It also applies to all of those who might benefit from ‘subsidiary protection’, that is those who cannot return home because of the general situation in their country of origin."
"The future European asylum application procedure will therefore cover all those who wish to migrate."
"It is true that in the borderless Europe of Brussels there is a political tradition of systematically fostering immigration."
"Moreover, Paragraph 25 of the report states that we need, ‘a common asylum procedure within the EU based upon high standards of delivery’."
"This report on the rights of migrants makes no mention of illegal immigrants, however."
"Furthermore, the return policy is strictly defined: the refusal to grant asylum has to be duly reasoned in writing in an ‘authenticated document’ in the applicant’s own language, and it is not possible to use charter flights."
"In addition, the report rules out the possibility of setting up detention centres in transit countries."
"I wish to congratulate Mrs Lambert on her important and timely report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin. I endorse the report, in particular where it proposes, in addition to the current European common asylum policy, the creation of measures both to develop orderly and better organised entry into the EU of persons in need of international protection and to step up protection capacity in the regions of origin."
"The aim is therefore to protect, at an early stage, political asylum seekers and refugees who, given the lengthy processing of asylum claims, especially in crisis situations, may resort to illegal means of travel, which may undermine their personal security."
"Statistics show that in 2003 some 70% of the world’s refugees remained in their region of origin."
"It is therefore essential to offer greater protection of better quality in those regions, but to be clear that this is in addition to the EU’s current responsibilities to offer protection under international agreements."
". I welcome this report as it stresses the need for a high quality asylum procedure that acts acquiescent and compatible with the Geneva Conventions in addition to other existing international legal instruments."
"I am in agreement with this report whereby the speed and administrative efficiency are important in assessing any system but they cannot be the only criteria when people’s futures are at risk."
"I commend the report for recognizing that although the intention to develop high quality protection regimes in conjunction with receiving countries is to be welcomed but should not become a means to enhance border control with the intent of preventing people moving on or a way of abdicating our own protection responsibilities."
". I supported, spoke in favour and voted in favour of Jean Denise Lambert's report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin (2004/2121(INI)) on Asylum."
"The overwhelming majority of the report was positive and in line with my own party policy."
"However I have strong reservations about point 19 when it states 'Considers that a decisive common foreign and security policy committing the EU as a matter of priority to the resolution of long terms conflicts and conflict prevention.........'"
"Sinn Féin believes that the EU through its member states must play a greater role in conflict prevention and resolution and in promoting dialogue and negotiation as an alternative to military intervention."
"However we are wary of the moves within the EU towards the development of a common foreign and security policy as this would undermine national sovereignty."
"The most appropriate vehicle for dealing with such issues is through member state cooperation and under the auspices of the United Nations."
"The EU should play a more pro-active role on conflict resolution and prevention within this context."
". My opinion of this report is based on the following main factors:"
"On the one hand, I am in favour of some of the essential issues raised, in particular where the report proposes to establish universal standards for applying existing directives, and advocates improving conditions for the vast majority of refugees in the countries of origin."
"On the other hand, I disagree on a key point: the application of asylum procedures to other situations of subsidiary protection."
"In the end, I voted against the report in light of the vote on certain amendments that I considered fundamental."
". The approach to issues relating to the granting of asylum has swung between two extreme perspectives, neither of which has, in practice, proved an effective means of resolving the problem."
"The truth is that neither the concept of Fortress Europe nor that of Sanctuary Europe has much to do with reality."
"They are both caricatures, distortions of a complex issue that is intrinsically linked to people’s rights and expectations and to the need to safeguard collective security and public order."
"At a time when the area of freedom, security and justice is being consolidated, I feel that it is appropriate to address this issue and the role of countries of origin and of transit in the problem before us."
"Whilst I understand the generosity underpinning the rapporteur’s proposal, I cannot vote in favour of it, because, as regards granting refugee status, the proposal does not only deal with the cases of individuals – it widens the scope to subsidiary protection, and this raises doubts as to the appropriateness and proportionality of the proposal."
". – The ΕU wants to remove by all possible means the victims of the intervention policy which it is following together with the USA in a series of countries."
"Anti-asylum legislation, the inhumane record numbers of asylum requests refused and mediaeval living conditions in immigration centres were not enough."
"Now it also aspires to keep anyone seeking asylum, seeking international protection, outside the ΕU."
"Only those who are obedient and organised are accepted as necessary at the altar of the 'competitiveness' of the European monopolies."
"The proposed 'Community-wide system of resettlement' is a mantle for public opinion to accept the creation of camps to round up immigrants outside the ΕU."
"Finally, the 'protected entry procedures' promote non-entry, in that asylum requests will be completed in a country outside the ΕU."
"Within the framework of the 'sharing of responsibilities' between the ΕU and third countries, the burden of keeping immigrants until the deportation decision is formally received is being passed on to them."
"The text is teeming with references to human rights, accompanied by proposals and policies which violate them."
"Coercive readmission clauses in agreements with third countries are advocated."
"There is not a word on combating the causes for the waves of refugees."
"A common foreign and security policy is advocated which will pay greater attention to 'conflict prevention'; in other words, which will fan the flames of the fire ignited by imperialism."
"This report contains proposals and wordings that reflect a liberal attitude towards drugs."
"We are thus voting against the proposal."
"We are opposed to drugs being classified as ‘soft’ or ‘hard’ and to the fact that drugs described as ‘soft’ are not regarded as addictive."
"The ‘alternative policy’ recommended in the report involves a more liberal policy towards drugs, emphasising harm reduction measures against drug use, rather than preventive work."
"We are opposed to a common EU drugs policy."
"Such a policy would involve countries with a restrictive drugs policy, such as Sweden, being forced to conduct a more lenient and liberal drugs policy."
"It is up to each national Parliament in the EU to make decisions concerning their national drugs policies."
"– Drug consumption is on the increase throughout Europe."
"Around 7 000 people die of overdoses every year in the European Union, and three times as many die as an indirect result of drug abuse (suicide, violence, AIDS, road accidents, and so on)."
"It appears that Brussels wishes to tackle this scourge."
"Great, except that what it is proposing in the fight against drugs is not to prevent young people from taking drugs or to give drug addicts the means to come clean, but to make drug addiction more hygienic."
"For example, it has tabled proposals for recovery rooms, rooms for injecting heroin under supervision and needle exchange programmes."
"We cannot accept such a policy."
"Prevention is of course essential in the fight against drugs, but so is repression."
"We should increase the penalties for drug dealers and introduce court orders for medical follow-ups for users."
"Finally, we should not draw a distinction between soft drugs and hard drugs, as neither are harmless."
"Moreover, this over-simplistic classification has led to a considerable increase in cannabis consumption."
"We must not forget that there is scientific evidence linking the use of these drugs and mental health, with the occurrence of schizophrenia being between 30% and 50% higher in cannabis users."
". I take the view that negotiations with Turkey should start as soon as Turkey complies with the political Copenhagen criteria, for example in relation to the protection of human and women’s rights, the combating of corruption, the punishment of torture and the outlawing of child labour."
"Turkey has made impressive progress in these areas, but it is apparent from the reports by non-governmental organisations that it has not yet achieved these objectives."
"The negotiations will be commenced with a view to acquiring Member State status, but if the conclusion seems appropriate that membership is not feasible, other forms of cooperation are possible."
". This is a commendable attempt to draw attention to the EU's increasing Drug problem and find solutions using a scientific and practical approach."
"Steps to combat the drugs trade would threaten one of the most important sources of income for organised crime and terrorist organisations."
"For example, according to the Europol report on organised crime, drugs production and trafficking continue to be the main activity pursued by criminal groups in the EU."
"No other field of organised crime is quite so profitable."
"I welcome the view that a Community project should be launched for the purpose of introducing alternative forms of detention, so that drugs repression ceases to focus exclusively on imprisonment."
"The anti-drugs strategy should be regarded as a form of social intervention concentrating on the reasons for social unrest with a view to preventing drugs use by refining a strategy of repression which is currently targeted solely at drug users."
". The European Parliamentary Labour Party voted for the Catania report on the EU drugs strategy because we believe it provides a comprehensive approach to tackling the harm done by particular drugs to individuals and to the spiral of crime, violence and trafficking caused by the trade in particular substances."
"It addresses harm reduction, addiction and crime."
"On Amendment 2 concerning the issue of the distribution of particular substances under controlled circumstances, the EPLP voted against both parts because we do not believe this amendment enhances the report or is in line with the UK Government's drugs strategy, which the EPLP fully supports."
"The issue before us is the EU’s anti-drugs strategy that the Council decided to establish in June 2004 and that is set to be adopted at the next European Council. This report goes against the grain of the EU’s fundamental concepts, as it chooses to take the view that the strategy currently being implemented is not bearing fruit, that in some cases it has violated citizens’ rights and, accordingly, that a different path must be followed; it even suggests that some drugs should be decriminalised."
"Furthermore – and this makes sense within the logic of the report – it takes the view that the subsidiarity principle is not very important in this area."
"This is not my understanding of what the anti-drugs strategy ought to be."
"I therefore voted against."
". The fact that this report was passed so narrowly in the committee concerned shows that the rapporteur deviated from the European Strategy against drugs, by proposing a solution that, to my mind, does not solve the problem, but rather exacerbates it."
"It is nothing new in this House to see Members try to put liberalisation forward as a solution, to see the notion of damage limitation as the be-all-and-end-all and to speak the language of surrender when it comes to drug trafficking."
"This practice already has a notable history, with the common thread being that it is up to the Member States to enforce it – at complete variance with the subsidiarity principle, which must continue to apply to this issue – despite the need to coordinate the fight against drugs."
"The slackness and decriminalisation that have been proposed are well known ways of removing responsibility from the public authorities and are a false ally of those whose drive and judgment have been subdued by the effects of drugs, and therefore constitute a deeply flawed message to give to the youngest members of society."
"It is ironic that the rapporteur cites fundamental rights and claims to fight against an ‘ideological approach’ to this subject, in order to justify a highly ideological position that, strictly speaking, runs counter to basic fundamental rights."
"– On 16 and 17 December, the Council will decide on the new European Union Anti-Drugs Strategy for 2005-2012."
"A political agreement has already been reached in the Council, with no transparency or democratic scrutiny by Parliament."
"Indeed the Council has been very reluctant to meet our repeated demands for information about the progress of negotiations, even though we were discussing the same issue in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Today I voted in favour of Mr Catania’s report, because the European Parliament has to show the Council what its vision of the new anti-drugs strategy is for the years to come."
"We note that the European strategy has achieved little to date, and at the same time, drug use has increased in Europe."
"We therefore want to step up coordination and cooperation at European level so that Europe can bring added value to the fight against the scourge of drugs while respecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"We must finally make the protection and health of drug users a priority."
"We must therefore step up prevention, provide better care and enhance health policy so as to avoid human tragedies and reduce exclusion."
". – The European Parliament recommendation has not taken account of the recent annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addition, which demolishes the so-called Dutch experiment and the argument that cannabis is allegedly harmless."
"In the name of a non-existent realism, the recommendation distorts the nature of the problem from a social to a medical problem, something which results in submission and defeatism."
"The rapporteur endeavours to achieve the general application of the Dutch experiment through the back door, adopting the dangerous approach of dividing drugs into soft and hard."
"He uses the word 'consumers' instead of victims/users and proposes the creation of official drug administration centres."
"As a consequence of this dangerous approach, all the proposals which detract from the primary concern – prevention – focus on damage limitation (substitution programmes) and look for solutions in the mechanisms and resources of the ΕU."
"The connection between drug trafficking and the funding of so-called terrorism gives arguments to imperialist propaganda and is becoming an alibi before the people."
"We do not demonstrate any tolerance of the drug culture."
"The reasons for drug addiction cannot be divided into 'hard' and 'soft'."
"Preventive and therapeutic measures and measures to reintegrate users are needed, together with a movement which will fight to overturn the social causes and the barbaric policy of capitalism which leads to drugs."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"The sitting is suspended."
"Madam President, I would like to make a personal statement pursuant to the provisions of Rule 145."
"In view of the fact that a Member of the European Parliament has been grossly insulted, I have submitted a request to the President of the European Parliament to conduct an enquiry into information, which has been deliberately circulated in my country, Latvia, concerning my activities here at the European Parliament."
"An employee at the Green Group secretariat has spread this false information."
"He has voiced the opinion in mass media publications that my activities aroused such indignation amongst Members of the European Parliament that, in protest against me and my personal views, they left the Chamber."
"This person described my accounts of my activities at the European Parliament as lies."
"Madam President, none of this information is true."
"I therefore request the leadership of the European Parliament to investigate this incident and to reinstate the truth about my European Parliament activities."
"A Member of the European Parliament’s job and duty is to work in the common interests of European democracy, truth and development."
"Every employee has these same duties regardless of their political convictions."
"Spreading lies or allowing them to be spread not only fails to promote the principle of legality, human rights and justice, but also discredits the European Parliament and its Members."
"This cannot be permitted."
"I request an investigation of these incidents."
"Thank you, Mr Kristovskis, for this personal statement."
"The parliamentary services will investigate the matter you have raised and ascertain whether it is appropriate to launch an inquiry."
"– The next item is the report (A6-0065/2004) by Mr Van Orden on Bulgaria's progress towards accession(COM(2004)0657 – C6-0150/2004 – 2004/2183(INI))."
". Madam President, it is almost nine years to the day since Bulgaria formally applied for membership of the European Union."
"Since then the country has undergone tremendous political and economic changes: it became a member of NATO earlier this year and is now well on course to join the European Union on 1 January 2007."
"I see no significant obstacles to this and I trust that the European Council, when it meets at the end of this week, will not only endorse this view but also set a date early in the new year for signature of the Accession Treaty."
"Bulgaria must be judged on its own merits and its progress should not necessarily be linked to that of any other candidate country."
"That is why a separate Accession Treaty for Bulgaria may be necessary."
"Let us look at some of the changes that have taken place in Bulgaria."
"On the one hand we can recognise that the accession criteria and deadlines set by the European Commission have provided an external catalyst for change."
"However, on the other hand, internal dynamics have greatly altered the political and social landscape in Bulgaria as it cast off its old mantle following the collapse of communism in 1990."
"These changes are taking place not just because the European Union is insisting on them, but because they are good for Bulgaria and they are what the Bulgarians themselves want."
"Bulgaria is now a fully functioning market economy and has been recognised as such since 2002."
"Macroeconomic stability has been maintained, including adequate price stability and sustainable public finances and external accounts."
"To take just a couple of key economic indicators, Bulgaria's GDP grew by 6 per cent in the first quarter of 2004, up from 4.3 per cent in 2003, and one of the highest rates among EU candidates and new Member States."
"The unemployment rate has consistently fallen since 2002: at 12 per cent it is still too high, but it is falling."
"Foreign direct investment is at record levels this year."
"Enormous progress has also been made on privatisation: 80 per cent of the economy is now in the private sector."
"I strongly support the ongoing reform of Bulgaria's public administration, with the adoption of amendments to the Civil Service law."
"Improvements have also been made in the judicial system: there have been positive developments with regard to the recruitment and appointment of judges."
"However, more needs to be done, in particular in relation to pre-trial procedures and the position of the Prosecutor General."
"However, it is not now just plain sailing."
"There are still areas of concern that I have been highlighting since 1999."
"Organised crime and corruption are an obstacle to reform in Bulgaria, having knock-on effects in all sectors of the economy and society."
"I have drawn particular attention to the need for more human and financial resources to be targeted to bring about major improvements in the welfare of children and in childcare institutions."
"I have called for a well-resourced, single government agency, with the power to ensure that child welfare reform happens."
"The same strategic approach must be adopted for the integration of the Roma community into Bulgarian society."
"Bulgaria, assisted by the European Commission, must make an even more determined effort to expedite the integration of Roma into mainstream society, particularly through educational and employment opportunities, improved living conditions and access to healthcare and family planning."
"There is also another side to this problem: the Roma themselves must adapt."
"This point may be unpopular in some circles but it is the only way that real change will be brought about on the ground for the Roma."
"Over the past four years over EUR 160 million of Community funds have been directed at Roma issues."
"However, change must happen from the inside as well as on the part of government."
"The European Union's enlargement to the east and south-east marks a momentous change in Europe."
"We have finally put an end to the hostilities and the divisions of the Cold War."
"History is being written as we speak – in Ukraine, for instance – and this morning Parliament gave its green light to the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey."
"Great changes are taking place on our continent."
"We are in a time of transition and we must all work hard to ensure that the tide of change shifts in the right direction."
"Within Europe this means refocusing the nature and objectives of the European Union."
"This means the EU doing less but doing it better."
"I wish to thank colleagues across Parliament for their support and assistance in my work as rapporteur."
"There will be an opportunity for a more comprehensive report on Bulgaria's accession early in the new year."
"My report this time is deliberately concise."
"Some amendments were included during the committee stage, but I do not feel that I can support any of the amendments now proposed."
"Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to highlight the plight of Bulgarian nurses incarcerated in Libya and now under threat of the death penalty."
"I urge all Members to sign Written Declaration No 61 calling for their early release."
"Bulgaria knows the challenges that lie ahead."
"On 17 December I trust the European Council will formally conclude Bulgaria's negotiations and set the date for signature of the Accession Treaty in spring 2005."
"This will be a great achievement, but reform and change must continue both in Bulgaria and in the EU itself."
". Madam President, it is a great pleasure to be able to inform you formally that on 13 December 2004 the General Affairs Council closed the negotiations with Bulgaria."
"We will now start the last, very important phase before entering the EU."
"The remaining two years should be used to prepare thoroughly for membership."
"The EU congratulates Bulgaria on this positive result, which has taken much effort and energy."
"It is a new step towards a truly reunited Europe, based on mutually accepted principles of democracy and the rule of law."
"The negotiations with Bulgaria closed at the technical level in June 2004."
"This reflects the progress that the Bulgarian Government has made in recent years, which resulted in strong confidence on the part of all those involved and the ability to assume all membership obligations by January 2007."
"Still, as the Committee on Foreign Affairs also states clearly in its motion for an EP resolution on Bulgaria's progress towards accession, we should closely monitor the progress which still has to be made by Bulgaria."
"The commitments made in the Justice and Home Affairs chapter might need an amendment of the Constitution, which is a long and difficult process."
"Other important areas, as the Committee on Foreign Affairs states, are the quality of border management, the fight against corruption, and the prevention of abuse of powers by State authorities against persons entering or transiting Bulgaria."
"The new penal code still has to be approved."
"Administrative capacity in a number of areas, including the agencies involved with the use of pre-accession funds, should improve."
"Both in Bulgaria and in Romania, improvements in the standard of living should be a priority."
"The economic growth that Bulgaria and Romania have seen in recent years has had a positive effect on purchasing power, but the effects at grass-roots level, especially for the elderly, have remained limited."
"There are at least two more years to go before accession."
"An historic step will be made on 17 December when the negotiations regarding the fifth enlargement have come to an end."
"Monitoring of the last part of the fifth enlargement will continue until 2007, in order to welcome the two new, long-awaited members then ready to join the European Union."
"As Mrs Kuneva said in October, she would like to publish the Monitoring Report on a big wall in Sofia in order to keep the process going."
"I think Bulgaria has made good progress, which gives us confidence for the numerous tasks still remaining."
"The Council looks forward to the finalisation of the Accession Treaty with a view to its signature in spring 2005, after the Treaty has been submitted to the European Parliament."
". Madam President, we have come a long way since Bulgaria applied for EU membership in 1995 and opened its negotiations in 2000."
"Yesterday the EU finalised the accession negotiations with Bulgaria in the accession conference, with a view to accession on 1 January 2007 and with the signature of the accession Treaty in sight in the spring of next year."
"I would like to thank the European Parliament for its constant and balanced support for Bulgaria's ambition to accede to the European Union and I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, for the sound and even-handed report he has produced."
"In the past few years Bulgaria has made steady progress in all areas in its preparation for accession and for meeting the Copenhagen criteria."
"Important and necessary decisions have been taken in this respect."
"Four units of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant are being closed on agreed dates for final decommissioning, showing Bulgaria's determination to respect commitments."
"Substantial support from the Union is being provided as assistance to these efforts."
"Overall, Bulgaria has consolidated and deepened the stability of its institutions."
"Continuation on its current reform path should enable the country to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the European Union."
"We will, however, need to keep a close watch on some areas."
"Our intention now is to intensify our monitoring of the commitments that have been made and of continuing preparations in general, in order to ensure that progress continues after the closure of negotiations and that Bulgaria will be effectively ready for membership in 2007."
"In this regard, solid efforts remain necessary concerning the reform of the judiciary, the fight against organised crime and the fight against corruption."
"Bulgaria has made progress in gradually building up its administrative capacity but further efforts remain necessary in this regard in a number of areas."
"As from November 2005 the Commission will issue yearly comprehensive monitoring reports for the Council and Parliament following the same methodology as was applied to the new Member States that joined the Union in May 2004."
"These reports will focus particularly on public administration, the judiciary and the fight against corruption, as well as the track record in economic reforms."
"It is also necessary to take account of a longer period between completion of the negotiations and the effective date of accession than in previous waves of accession."
"A specific safeguard was agreed, which allows the Commission to recommend to the Council to decide by unanimity, at any time, to postpone the date of accession by one year to January 2008 if there is clear evidence that Bulgaria is manifestly unprepared."
"Let me conclude by saying that I share the conclusions of the report of your rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, which are, by and large, in line with the 2004 regular report."
"The Commission will continue to keep the European Parliament informed of Bulgaria’s progress towards accession."
"Bulgaria is on track for accession on 1 January 2007."
"With the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the fifth round of EU enlargement will be concluded."
"Thus the Black Sea will become a new coastline for an enlarged and unified Europe."
". Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to begin by pointing out that the financial pre-accession aid granted to Bulgaria during 2000-2004 has amounted to approximately EUR 178 million per year from the PHARE Programme, SAPARD and the ISPA instrument."
"The Committee on Budgets also supports an additional sum from the PHARE Programme of EUR 200 million for 2000-2006 for the closure of the Kozloduy nuclear power station."
"It is also pleased that in Spring 2004 a new funding framework was established for Bulgaria and that the Commission has adopted a consistent approach by restricting the aid package to a period of three years from the accession of Bulgaria in 2007 so that we can adapt it to any future reforms of policies which may be necessary as a result of the new financial perspectives."
"The Committee on Budgets stresses once again that financial aid will depend on the new financial perspectives, but also on the adaptation of the annual Budget, in accordance with those financial perspectives."
". Madam President, unlike Turkey, Bulgaria is quite clearly a European country which has made tremendous progress."
"I was in Bulgaria in 1990, when the country first attempted to hold free elections."
"There was still some election-rigging, but the democracy movement was impressive."
"In many ways, it was reminiscent of the current situation in Ukraine."
"Bulgaria has succeeded, step by step, in overcoming these crisis situations, and must now be taken seriously as a very promising candidate for accession to the European Union."
"It has a rich culture and exerts a major stabilising influence over the entire Balkan peninsula."
"Although there is still a great deal to do – especially on the rule of law, justice and administration, where further reforms are required – Bulgaria is by far the most advanced of all the candidate countries, unless, that is, we forget a country which we should never forget, namely Croatia."
"I would like to take this opportunity to appeal also to the President-in-Office of the Council to accept Croatia at the forthcoming summit without any prevarication or special conditions, and to make massive efforts to ensure that the negotiations with Croatia are opened without delay."
"Both these countries should become members of the European Union before the decade is out, and Mr Van Orden's excellent report makes a major contribution to this process."
"One of Bulgaria's particular achievements is the cross-party cooperation established between Prime Minister Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and the Bulgarian President, which is a prerequisite enabling Bulgaria to bring its progress towards EU membership to a successful conclusion in the coming years."
"Bulgaria enjoys democratic stability at domestic level and is remaining resolute despite the crises affecting a number of areas, including the economy."
"I would like to say how gratified I am by this development, and that Bulgaria is well on track."
"I could sum up my speech in a single word: ‘yes’ to Bulgaria."
". I would like to congratulate Mr van Orden on his outstanding report, which I believe is the fruit of much hard work, and I would like to thank the Commission’s excellent work done with regard to candidate countries."
"Technically, Bulgaria has completed all the accession negotiation chapters and is clearly headed towards becoming a full member of the European Union in January 2007."
"According to the report, Bulgaria continues to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and the measures taken to successfully implement them have been effective."
"However, this report also emphasises that there are still deficiencies that will inevitably have to be dealt with."
"We believe that Bulgaria is on track for accession and will continue to make efforts to complete successfully the reforms it committed itself to in the near future."
"These mainly include judicial reform and further increased efforts to counter organised crime and corruption."
"The report welcomes positive changes implemented in the field of minority rights, as a result of which the so-called legislation on anti-discrimination was adopted on January 1, 2004."
"The report also emphasises the importance of the legislature’s practical extension, as discrimination against Romany people remains widespread there."
"The report acknowledges Bulgaria meeting the economic criteria and notes that it is a functioning market economy and at the time of accession will be able to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union."
"The European Parliament and the Socialist Group will continue the monitoring system while ensuring that operations are run efficiently and obligations are fulfilled."
"Based on Bulgaria’s reform efforts and progress, the Socialist Group hopes that Bulgaria will sign and ratify the accession treaty as soon as possible and will become a member of the European Union in 2007."
". Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, my group also views Bulgaria's progress towards accession as a success story, albeit with a few necessary caveats on points of detail."
"We therefore believe that this House can vote in favour of Bulgaria accession to the European Union in 2007 with a clear conscience."
"We support Mr Van Orden's report and speaking personally, I would like to thank him and Mrs Dobolyi from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for the good cooperation."
"As Mr Van Orden himself has said, he has deliberately kept the report brief."
"I therefore suggest that we discuss all the other tabled amendments, some of which are very detailed, next year when we deal with the longer report which will then be due."
"Bulgaria is well on track to join the European Union in 2007."
"I would therefore like to take this opportunity to highlight a fundamental problem, namely that of genuine compliance with the principle of merit."
"The Commission and the Council have both stated that each candidate's accession should be based on individual merit."
"However, this is incompatible with a situation in which a candidate country which fulfils the criteria is held back by the slower progress made by other countries."
"The countries making swifter progress thus accede too late while the candidates making slower progress join too early."
"To put it simply, the good performers are being penalised while the laggards are being rewarded."
"This situation must change."
"The credibility of the Union as a whole is damaged if its practices conflict with the principle of merit."
"Commissioner Verheugen amply demonstrated this with the 'big bang' enlargement in May this year, which damaged the Union."
"A better option would have been for well-performing candidates, such as Estonia and Slovenia, to have been able to join much earlier."
"For this reason alone, namely to preserve the European Union's credibility and not because there is any doubt about the European prospect of either of the two candidates, my group has always been in favour of separate accession treaties for Bulgaria and Romania."
"Mr Watson reaffirmed this position this morning in this Chamber."
"I therefore urge the Commission and the Council, but also my fellow Members in this House, to ensure, during present and future enlargement rounds, that the principle of merit is not just proclaimed with pomp and ceremony, only to be ignored in favour of package deals, but is actually implemented in practice."
"In this context, a gratifying sign is the Council's decision to adopt differentiated approaches to Bulgaria and Romania in the chapters on competition and justice."
"Simplifying the mechanism to invoke the safeguard clause in the case of Romania will enhance the credibility of the accession process and thus the credibility of the European Union itself."
"On a more general note, I believe that we should be conducting this debate not in Strasbourg, but in Brussels."
". Madam President, Bulgaria will become a Member State with many unresolved issues."
"Old environmental problems, resulting from mining and nuclear waste, are still left unresolved."
"Much damage is being done by construction work for new roads through protected scenic areas and by the expansion of the largest airport."
"These days, poor maintenance, decay and poverty are noticeable throughout Bulgaria."
"The Roma people are still lagging behind and disadvantaged."
"EU funding for the benefit of projects for this group of people is divided and spent in a contentious manner."
"In the minds of many Bulgarians, the nearby Greek and Roman coasts belong, in fact, to Bulgaria, just as do the greater part of the Republic of Macedonia and a few areas on the border with Serbia."
"The fact that the Bulgarian electorate still has not made any steady choices is apparent from the rapid changes within the two main rivalling political parties, and, above all, from the fact that a newcomer to the most recent general elections achieved almost the majority of the votes."
"Shortly after the surprising election as Prime Minister of the country’s former King, the candidate of the Communists’ successors was elected President."
"This instability has, however, produced one positive development in the form of greater involvement in political decision-making of the Turkish minority, which was discriminated against in the past."
"Unlike in Romania, the problems in Bulgaria are no bigger than those in a number of the present EU Member States."
"That is why it is right to allow Bulgaria full EU membership from 2007."
"There is a strong historical and linguistic bond between Bulgaria and the Slavonic-speaking part of Macedonia."
"In 1878, last-minute Western European intervention prevented the two from uniting."
"It would be useful if the negotiations about Macedonia’s accession – for which the Committee on Foreign Affairs has appointed me as rapporteur – were to run parallel with Croatia, which also has its roots in former Yugoslavia, so that we can welcome the Bulgarians and Macedonians to the European Union simultaneously."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope Mr Posselt will praise me as well shortly."
"I am not overly keen on the black-and-white film presented by the European Commission entitled ‘Romania the bad and Bulgaria the good’."
"Black-and-white films are not popular either in politics or in real life."
"Not everything is as bad in Romania and as good in Bulgaria as would appear from the picture painted by the European Commission’s amateur artists."
"It is true that Bulgaria has made progress and that it should join the European Union on 1 January 2007."
"At the same time, however, Bulgaria has not done many of the things it should have done."
"I should like to refer to a number of specific points."
"Firstly, what use is there in Bulgarian legislation complying with EU legislation, if implementation of this legislation continues to lag behind?"
"Secondly, trade in human beings, in particular in women and children, is still a serious problem."
"As a third point, the adoption system and its lack of transparency, as well as the situation in Bulgarian orphanages and special schools, continue to be a cause for concern."
"Fourthly, there are also concerns with regard to the situation of adults in psychiatric hospitals, and this is included in Parliament’s motion for a resolution."
"As a fifth point, the continuing lack of reform of the judicial system, which lags a long way behind European standards, is an Achilles’ heel for Sofia."
"The sixth point I should like to refer to is the widespread corruption, which is a thorn in Bulgaria’s side as it enters the EU, given that it affects various areas and levels of government and is apparent at every turn."
"During the past few weeks I have visited Bulgaria twice, and my remarks are by no means merely quotes from reports, but reflect what is plain for everyone to see."
"The seventh point is organised crime."
"The Bulgarian Government is acting like the choir in a Chinese opera, where the choir sings ‘let’s run away, let’s run away’ for three acts, but stays in the same place the whole time."
"The Bulgarian Government constantly repeats that it is taking measures to fight the mafia, but it would appear that it is mainly conducting a war of words."
"The mafia continues to be a serious problem."
"At the same time, however, the EU also sometimes takes measures that the Bulgarian public finds incomprehensible."
"For example, it recently demanded that a power plant in Kozloduj be shut down, even though enormous amounts of Bulgarian taxpayers’ money had been spent on modernising it in recent years."
"In conclusion, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite these reservations we should welcome the fact that our European family is to be joined by a nation with a history dating back over 1300 years."
"Bulgaria’s history is longer than many of the present EU Member States."
"I should like to bid Bulgaria welcome to somewhere it should have been for many years."
"I am sure Bulgaria will feel at home in the EU which is a Union of homelands."
"– Madam President, I should like by way of introduction to make the members of the European Parliament privy to the hostage-taking in Athens today, to the hijacking of a bus with innocent citizens on their way to work."
"I mention this in order to highlight the need to formulate an efficient policy at European level on urban security."
"Now to the subject in hand. Bulgaria made noteworthy progress in converting to a pluralistic democracy and functional market economy in keeping with European instructions at both political and economic level."
"The integration of Bulgaria into the European Union in 2007, in conjunction with its recent admission to ΝΑΤΟ, is a particularly positive development both for Bulgaria itself and for south-eastern Europe as a whole."
"I trust that the case of Bulgaria will also set an example for the countries of the Western Balkans as they move towards Europe."
"Nonetheless, it should be pointed out that there needs to be a constant and conscious effort on the part of the Bulgarian authorities to adapt pending full integration."
"Further efforts should focus on stamping out corruption and efficiently combating organised crime."
"I should like at this point to call on the European Commission, within the framework of the Community policy on border regions with candidate countries, to draft a new study on the repercussions which the integration of Bulgaria and Romania will have on the border regions of the Member States."
"I would remind you in this context that the European Commission itself, in the person of the competent Commissioner, Mr Verheugen, found that regions such as north-eastern Greece, which border on two countries, face by far the most difficult situation at European level."
"The policies and actions of the European Union to promote trans-national, trans-regional and cross-border cooperation and to combat the repercussions of enlargement on development and employment in border regions should be continued and reinforced."
"Similarly, special care must be taken when distributing resources and preparing programmes for territorial cooperation in the new 2007-2013 programming period."
"Madam President, it is the case that Bulgaria’s capacity to comply with the Community has increased considerably and is continuing to do so."
"Nevertheless, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy wishes to stress that in the sectors of research and development, energy, industrial policy and telecommunications policy an additional effort is required if we want the incorporation of Bulgaria to be an historic success, since the accession date is now getting very close."
"Furthermore, in order correctly to assess the progress made and thereby propose the changes still to be made, we should take account not just of the report of the European Commission, but also of the assessments of the different international bodies and other independent research centres, whose opinion may be of great assistance in analysing and evaluating Bulgaria’s capacity in these areas, with a view to its incorporation into the European Union."
"In any event, our current views with regard to each of the sectors which are the responsibility of our committee are as follows: with regard to energy policy, Bulgaria – as has already been said – currently depends on nuclear energy to cover its internal needs, but the reality is that its nuclear power stations are technically obsolete and the dismantling of some of them has been very expensive."
"As has also been pointed out, it is now proposed to modernise units 5 and 6 of the Kozloduy power station, and additional funds will be required for this, since the European Union’s contributions are clearly insufficient."
"Funds from international donors are required, though we are not seeing the government prioritise this issue as it should do."
"In the telecommunications sector, the independence of the regulatory authority should be guaranteed, and it should have the power to resolve commercial disputes and guarantee the principle of universality, in accordance with Community legislation."
"It is also necessary to reformulate industrial and business policy and improve the administrative capacity to facilitate the work of small and medium-sized businesses, which are the true creators of jobs and an extraordinary source of technological innovation."
"With regard to the research sector, despite Bulgaria’s participation in the Sixth Framework Programme, its presence has been very limited."
"Madam President, this is essentially the content of the amendment our committee is presenting to the report we are debating."
"– Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, congratulations to the rapporteur and congratulations to Bulgaria as well."
"It has closed all the chapters and is an example and an inspiration to all its neighbours."
"I repeat, to all its neighbours."
"It would be an even better example if it took just one more step in its relationship with its minorities and did the same for the other minorities living in Bulgaria as it has already done for the Turkish minority."
"‘The Balkans, that ancient mountain range’, as the Bulgarian national anthem goes, and the word ‘Balkans’ as a political problem does not apply in the case of Bulgaria."
"Bulgaria already belongs to Western Europe and it is the Western Balkans that we will have to deal with in the future."
"This is why I feel that it is important that when we are talking about Bulgaria, we should also pay some attention to Macedonia, which has already submitted its application for membership of the European Union and that the European Union itself should also take another step forward."
"The USA has recognised Macedonia by the name that it chose for itself."
"We still continue to use the name FYROM and it is high time we took another step forward because this would also be a great step towards the Europeanisation of this area."
"In an hour and a half's time, Commissioner, you will be meeting a delegation from Serbia and Montenegro."
"This is the delegation's first visit to the European Parliament and I believe that the example of Bulgaria should be used as an inspiration for all its neighbours to do more for the future prospects and stability of this part of the world."
"Therefore it seems to me that we could all learn more from Bulgaria and that Bulgaria's principal neighbour could learn a lot."
"I am talking about Turkey, a country we have supported today in saying ‘yes’ to the start of negotiations."
"Bulgaria is the last country on the road to Turkey and I believe that it is right and proper that all of us who have a task to perform in this respect, should support all of these countries so that they can participate fully both economically and politically and bring about a further enlargement of the European Union."
"–Madam President, both the resolutions and opinions of the Commission and the Council giving the go-ahead for the integration of Bulgaria and Romania in future years clearly set out the objectives of European capital, which are already being realised, to annex these countries, plunder their wealth and their economy, exploit their workers to an unbelievable degree and convert them to NATO satellites, so that they can serve its aggressive policy."
"The resolutions record, to a degree, certain aspects of the wretched and inhumane living conditions of the working classes in these countries and the poor grass-roots classes, but these are the result of the restoration of capitalism, which is eroding all the social rights achieved and, on the other hand, is concentrating wealth in the hands of a new plutocracy and foreign monopolies."
"There are in fact two Bulgarias and two Romanias: on the one hand, the countries of luxury for the new plutocrats in Bulgaria and Romania and the foreigners who are literally plundering these countries and, on the other, the countries of two proud nations literally being dragged into misery and humiliation."
"The consequences of the integration process and of the humiliating terms accepted by the governments of these countries are already visible."
"You spoke to us of successes."
"So listen to the successes: in Bulgaria, the minimum wage is EUR 61 and in Romania it is EUR 69, compared with EUR 1 173 in France and EUR 605 in Greece."
"The rapid increase in imports, in conjunction with plummeting exports, has resulted in increased deficits."
"Purchasing power in Romania is 60% of what it was in 1989."
"Industry has been destroyed and agricultural production is operating below par."
"The objective of the new direction proposed in the resolutions and the new measures is to create better conditions, an institutional framework and infrastructures for the most unaccountable action by capital, the complete selling off of public property and land and the abolition of any social rights achieved."
"The workers in these countries, together with the workers in Greece and other countries in Europe, must fight against the policy of the European Union and, more importantly, against the new tensions expected in the area as a result of the serious rivalry which is beginning to manifest itself."
"Madam President, this debate is, actually, a token of congratulation to Bulgaria, although it goes without saying that it still has many problems, and much remains to be dealt with."
"A great deal, of course, still needs to be done in the field of human rights and human trafficking, but they are doing their level best, which was not evident before. It is for that reason that I believe that Bulgaria should be able to join the European Union in 2007."
"They belong among us."
"I would also like to see more attention given to a debate about Bulgaria’s accession than to one about Turkey’s."
"After all, Bulgaria is a truly European country, straddling the old and new Europe, and deserves all our attention."
"I can foresee some problems with regard to its accession."
"While there are, of course, problems in Bulgaria itself, the biggest may well be in the European Union."
"The fact is that funding for its accession is not yet completely in place."
"After 2007, we will be talking about the financial perspective up to 2013, and I am surprised at the discussion that is being held in the Council and elsewhere, in which it is stated that we might be able to manage on 1% of the gross domestic product."
"If you look at all the forecasts that have been made, funding for Bulgaria’s accession is nowhere to be found."
"I should also like to address a critical comment to the Commission, which was right in saying that it needs more money than 1%."
"If, however, we look at the proposals for agriculture, for example, we notice that those do not include a budget for agriculture in Bulgaria, while the development of the countryside in Bulgaria will play a key role in the development of that country itself."
"Anyone who loves the countryside, loves the country itself and actually does something for the future of that country."
"I am therefore interested to hear how the Council intends to fund this accession and how we can ensure in a correct and proper manner that Bulgaria becomes a truly European country in 2007."
"I should like to finish off with another point."
"In the responses by the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left – which does, after all, comprise quite a few former Communists – I was struck by the fact that people have some difficulty with the major political changes in Bulgaria."
"To those people, I have this to say. The Bulgarians have a better grasp of politics than your group, and do you know why?"
"They judge politicians by their actions, which may lead to major shifts."
"I am pleased to see that the Bulgarians, in terms of democratic thinking, are further advanced than many Members from the GUE/NGL Group."
"– Madam President, I should like, now that accession negotiations have been concluded with Bulgaria, for us to start by highlighting and welcoming the huge efforts made by the Bulgarian people and the political forces in the country to push ahead with changes and reforms and incorporate the ."
"The accession of Bulgaria and Romania will close the circle of enlargement opened with the ten new countries."
"It is a development of strategic importance which unites the Balkans and Europe and will contribute to peace, stability, cooperation and development in the area as a whole."
"However, I should like to underline a number of crucial points both to the Commission and to the Presidency."
"During the next stage, Bulgaria will need to step up its efforts to apply the in four sectors which are of particular importance to the European Union and to Greece:"
"The first is the sector of environmental protection, nuclear safety, nuclear waste management and the quality of river water."
"Reactors 3 and 4 at the Kozloduy nuclear power station must close in 2006, in accordance with the commitment given by the Bulgarian authorities, and modernisation of nuclear installations with Community financing from the PHARE programme and from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development must continue normally."
"In the sector of labour relations and labour law, additional reforms are needed for Bulgaria to approach European standards and overturn social exclusion practices which affect Community – and especially Greek – undertakings in border regions, where there is a serious problem with relocations."
"Furthermore, deficits are recorded in the three sectors of combating organised crime, trafficking in human beings and controlling external borders and combating illegal immigration."
"Finally, I should like to draw particular attention to the fact that more efficient procedures and greater transparency in the sector of public procurement and public works are needed, as is the safeguarding of equal treatment of all Community undertakings, including Greek undertakings."
"The European Commission must use the mechanisms provided for, with annual evaluation reports and safeguarding clauses, to monitor closely the efficient application of the and safeguard Community interests, even after the accession of Bulgaria on 1 January 2007."
". Madam President, I appreciate the positive remarks from Members of Parliament with regard to the accession of Bulgaria."
"Mr Posselt, Mr Maat, Mrs Dobolyi and others were clear on that issue."
"Members said that there are still a lot of concerns."
"That is true."
"That is precisely the reason why we have the framework, the procedure, with extra monitoring and an extra benchmark and, if necessary, an extra sanction, an extra safeguard for an extra year before the moment of accession."
"With regard to the financial issue raised by Mr Maat and others, I do not think we need to be concerned."
"The financial consequences of accession are already covered in the so-called financial package for the years 2007-09."
"That is irrespective of the new financial perspective."
"An important issue that was raised again today is the importance of having an individual approach to different countries."
"You know the formal position – one treaty for Romania and Bulgaria."
"It is important, and necessary, to differentiate."
"That is precisely what we want to do in the wording of the conclusions next Thursday or Friday in the Council, concentrating on the different chapters."
"If necessary we can differentiate at the moment of actual accession, because there is the possibility of postponing accession for a maximum of one year."
"I thank the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, for his adequate and balanced report."
"I really welcome its conclusions."
". Madam President, I promise to speak slowly and unhurriedly."
"I wish to say thank you for the pertinent debate and those points of view expressed which, in the main, support the Commission’s recommendations."
"I will respond to just a couple of the most central issues."
"I will speak first about the coupling of Romania and Bulgaria."
"It is true that a joint Accession Treaty is being drafted for these countries."
"On the other hand, as Mr Nicolaï very clearly explained, each is being treated according to a differentiated approach, especially now the process is in its last stages and the monitoring system and safeguard clause are ways of ensuring that each country is assessed according to the extent to which they are able to implement the reforms and commitments that need to be fulfilled before these countries can accede to the Union."
"I would also like to emphasise that Bulgaria is not yet ready for membership either: much work is being asked of it, but, at the same time, Bulgaria has all the potential to fulfil its commitments to enable it to accede to the Union on 1 January 2007."
"I will speak next about corruption, which has attracted much attention in speeches. That is quite right and I agree with those views expressed."
"Bulgaria has recently drawn up a determined strategy to act against corruption."
"It is particularly concerned with improving border controls, developing the work of the traffic police and the institutions in general, and countering corruption in Bulgaria’s administration."
"This is in fact the main focus of Sub-Programme 4 under the PHARE programme and it will also become much more obviously the main focus over the coming two years, in 2005 and 2006."
"Thirdly and finally, I wish to talk about the status of minorities, and especially that of the Roma."
"In Bulgaria, new legislation against discrimination has recently been passed and has entered into force there."
"It took effect in January of this year and it is presently being implemented in conjunction with an anti-discriminatory action programme to improve the status of minorities."
"We are very closely monitoring this new legislation and the implementation of the action programme to support it."
"I am also pleased that other European organisations, such as the Council of Europe, in the building next to ours, is giving attention to this issue and working to strengthen the status of the Roma."
"We would all certainly have been present at the opening ceremony of the Council of Europe’s Roma Forum at 12 noon today, but at the same time we were debating, and you were voting on, the very important report on Turkey, so, unfortunately, we could not get there."
"I wish to thank the European Parliament for its support and counsel, and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, and Bulgaria, which hopefully will become an example to the entire Balkan region."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0061/2004) by Mr Moscovici, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on Romania’s progress towards accession [2004/2184(INI)]."
"I should like to invite Mr Moscovici to take the floor, and to inform him that he may speak for five minutes."
"– Mr President, the political context in which I am tabling this report has become clearer in recent weeks."
"Last week the Commission was able to close accession negotiations with Romania on the last two chapters, namely justice and home affairs, and competition."
"Moreover, legislative elections and then presidential elections have also been held in recent weeks, putting a different political party in power under conditions that have been recognised by all of the parties."
"This information obviously does not change the philosophy and general thrust of the report."
"I wanted to draft and submit a balanced report to the House, that is to say a report that was both rigorous and clear, because Romania’s situation poses many problems. Yet I also wanted it to be a friendly report, because we all want Romania and Bulgaria to join and because this country has worked hard to prepare for accession."
"On this basis, we are proposing that we both take note of Romania’s progress towards accession and also remain aware of its limits and shortcomings, and the extent of the work that remains to be done."
"These two aspects, the limits and the progress, are actually set out for each of the areas in question."
"They are presented first with regard to the political criteria, and it is there without any doubt that the main difficulties lie."
"There are limits to the progress made; for example, the reform of the civil service does not go far enough, the use of emergency ordinances is not desirable and quite excessive, and as for legislative procedures, everyone knows that they are not perfect."
"But over and above this limited progress, a number of problems, serious problems, remain as far as freedoms are concerned."
"I am thinking firstly of the freedom of information and expression, which is denied to a great many journalists."
"I am thinking of the judicial system, which despite initial improvements is unquestionably in need of further attention."
"I am thinking, of course, of corruption, which is still endemic in Romania, even at high levels."
"On all of these problems – freedom of expression, corruption, the judicial and police systems – I believe that the European Parliament has a duty to be absolutely uncompromising."
"At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that progress has undoubtedly been made."
"The Commission has recognised that Romania satisfies the Copenhagen political criteria; the country has embarked on public administration reform, and constitutional reform is also underway."
"The judicial system, as I have said, is starting to improve and we are also seeing progress on child protection – requested by our own Parliament, incidentally – even though it is possible to go further."
"Overall then, I believe that Romania has listened to the recommendations made by the Commission and Parliament, in particular those that were made at the instigation of the previous rapporteur, Mrs Nicholson."
"We find the same problem with the economic criteria: there are limits to the progress made, macroeconomic stability is not yet guaranteed and poverty remains at quite excessive levels."
"At the same time, we have seen progress in the fight against social exclusion, in the fight against poverty and in the adoption of legislation on social protection."
"The third and final area is everything to do with the ."
"As I said at the outset, negotiations on this are complete."
"Moreover, I do not believe that it would be wise to reopen them, although I have read that the newly-elected president intends to do so."
"For my part, I think that the treaty should first be ratified and signed before it is renegotiated."
"We need, however, to implement the legislation that has been adopted, in particular that relating to the free movement of goods and capital, financial control, the environment, industrial production, regional policy and issues of justice and home affairs."
"This assessment, which I hope is balanced, is the basis for the conclusions that I am recommending, and they are as follows: as things stand there is nothing to prevent a joint accession treaty – I repeat, a joint treaty – being signed for Romania and Bulgaria at the beginning of 2005 for accession in 2007."
"Clearly this is a political decision, but Parliament and the Commission need to keep a close watch on developments through all of the follow-up actions and other reports that we can table here."
"A final word on the amendments tabled: we did a good job, in my opinion, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which enabled the report to be adopted by a very large majority."
"The remaining amendments to the report fall into two categories."
"There are those that improve the substance of the report, in particular on social protection, human rights, the disabled, the protection of children and young people, and recommendations on industrial policy, and I am obviously in favour of these."
"Then there are other amendments that call into question the existence of a joint accession treaty or which change the nature and balance of the report, which clearly I do not support."
"This morning we made the historic decision to open negotiations with Turkey."
"I believe that concluding them with Romania and Bulgaria, and with Romania in particular, is, in contrast, a logical decision, and people would not understand if we did not do both of these things together."
". Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to be able to inform you here formally that on 14 December 2004 the General Affairs Council also closed the negotiations with Romania."
"As I said when referring to Bulgaria, it is a new step towards a really reunited Europe based on mutually accepted principles of democracy and the rule of law."
"I will elaborate briefly on the process of closing the last challenging chapters with Romania and focus on the monitoring system developed to ensure a proper start for Romania within the European Union."
"The two remaining chapters, which have been regarded as the most difficult ones – competition policy, and justice and home affairs – were technically closed by the General Affairs Council on 14 December 2004."
"I believe we have been able to find appropriate solutions for all the issues raised in those final weeks through close and constructive cooperation between the Commission and the Council."
"However, closing these two chapters means that the real work continues for the Romanians."
"Over the next two years Romania will have to make real and sustained efforts in order to be truly ready for membership."
"Good intentions are not enough: these must be matched by progress on the ground, in particular in the implementation of commitments."
"The EU will of course continue to support the preparations at all levels: the Commission will enhance the monitoring of progress commitments undertaken in all areas of the ."
"We learned from representatives of both governments that monitoring systems helped them very much in continuing, and even intensifying, the reforms needed."
"On competition policy, this chapter is at the core of the internal market and European economic integration."
"The proper enforcement of EU competition rules is a precondition for creating a reliable business environment and requires appropriate administrative capacity."
"This is a long-term process."
"It is for those reasons that competition discipline is also a key aspect of the Europe agreement."
"Other key aspects are legislative alignment and the institutional and administrative structures in Romania."
"What needs to be done to bring all legislation, including secondary legislation, into line with the requirements in the areas of antitrust and State aid, in particular in relation to fiscal aid?"
"The Romanian Competition Council should be given the powers, resources and the well-trained staff it needs to fulfil its role."
"This Council should prohibit any measures which would be in contradiction with the State aid and the Europe agreement."
"Let me turn to the steel sector, which is a sensitive sector across the EU."
"Romania has asked for a prolongation of the so-called 'grace period' under the Europe agreement for restructuring the steel industry."
"Again, we only agreed to this now it is clear that Romania will abide by all the commitments and all the conditions set out in the EU's position."
"These commitments include drawing up a national restructuring programme as well as an individual business plan, capacity reduction and dismantling of the installations."
"The European Union expects Romania to respect all its commitments and take all the necessary measures within the deadlines laid down in the EU's position."
"In this context, I should recall the safeguards we have at our disposal."
"In October 2005 the Commission will present to the Council a written report assessing Romania's progress in the area of competition policy."
"Any serious shortcomings observed in this report regarding Romania's obligations under the Europe agreement and/or the fulfilment of the commitments can form the basis for a recommendation by the Commission to invoke safeguards, in particular the one postponing Romania's accession by one year."
"Here the Council can decide by a qualified majority."
"On this understanding, I have come to the conclusion that this chapter does not require further negotiations."
"Let me say that it is now in Romania's hands to ensure that it meets all its commitments in this chapter, allowing Romania's smooth integration into the European Union."
"Turning to justice and home affairs, this is a chapter which is both extensive and complex."
"It is at the heart of our objective of maintaining and developing the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice."
"It has a direct bearing on the lives of every EU citizen, and is therefore a key part of the which must be respected."
"Negotiations on this chapter have been long and detailed."
"Romania has made a considerable number of firm commitments on all areas of the justice and home affairs ."
"There are several areas to which particular attention should be paid, such as implementation of the Schengen action plan; ensuring a high level of control and surveillance at the external borders of the Union; implementing the reform of the judiciary; stepping up the fight against corruption to ensure that corruption cases are dealt with in a swift and transparent manner; making considerable progress in filling the large number of vacancies in the police forces; as well as developing and implementing a coherent multiannual anti-crime strategy."
"These issues have also been addressed in Mr Moscovici's report on Romania."
"The Union will closely monitor Romania's implementation of all its commitments related to justice and home affairs, right up to the moment of accession in order to meet EU standards."
"This includes adhering to the planned legislative schedule and taking further measures to develop the institutional and administrative capacity of all Romanian law enforcement authorities and of the judiciary."
"We believe that this should be possible if the necessary political effort, as well as the required financial and human resources, are deployed to this end."
"If, however, any serious shortcomings are observed in the fulfilment by Romania of its commitments and in particular any of the specific commitments listed in the EU position, this can form the basis for invoking the safeguard clause postponing Romania's accession by one year."
"Here again, the Council can decide by qualified majority."
"The European Union will continue to monitor closely Romania's preparations and achievements, including the effective implementation of the commitments undertaken in all areas of the and in particular the areas of justice and home affairs, competition and the environment."
"To this end, the Commission will continue to submit annual reports on Romania's progress towards accession, together with recommendations if appropriate."
"I welcome the statement in the report by Mr Moscovici that the European Parliament will monitor the developments in Romania as well and encourage the new Romanian Government to fulfil all the commitments made during the negotiations."
"It is quite clear that the report adopted by the European Parliament in March 2004 has fulfilled its purpose as a wake-up call to the Romanian Government."
"That is how the Romanian Government has perceived it; and it has convinced it to intensify the accession strategy and policies."
"I was delighted to learn that Parliament, in its latest report about Romania, could subscribe to the recommendations of the regular report of the Commission."
"Since then – and I paraphrase the wording of the Commission – we all have made every effort to meet the European Council objectives to bring the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania to a successful conclusion in 2004, on the basis of its own merits, with a view to signing the Accession Treaty as early as possible in 2005, and we all expect Bulgaria and Romania to fulfil the economic and criteria and to be ready for membership on 1 January 2007."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank Mr Moscovici for tabling a report that is both balanced and in-depth."
"The Commission has always warmly welcomed the European Parliament’s constructive engagement in the process of Romania’s accession to the European Union."
"I should also like to thank the Council for its productive cooperation."
"Mr President, your report of March 2004 was a real 'wake-up call' for Romania."
"Being tough and very demanding, it finally helped to bring about further progress in the accession negotiations."
"It led, with the Commission's impetus, to a series of reforms, which were listed in Romania’s famous 'To Do List', under which the Romanian authorities put greater emphasis on improving political and economic governance."
"As Mr Nicolaï said, the Union will now finalise the accession negotiations with Romania on Friday."
"However, I underline that concluding the negotiations does not mean the end of the work."
"On the contrary, the two-year period to 2007 must be used by Romania to become a full-fledged Member State: plenty of hard work, commitment and especially delivery is needed."
"We will carry out an enhanced monitoring of compliance with the commitments entered into and of ongoing preparations in general."
"For Romania and Bulgaria, we have agreed a new safeguard clause covering the period between closure of the negotiations and actual accession."
"This clause provides for the postponement of accession by one year if there is clear evidence that Romania will be manifestly unprepared to meet the requirements of membership."
"The Member States could then activate the suspension clause by unanimity, on the basis of the Commission’s recommendation."
"Let me also point out that in the chapter concerning competition and state aids, the Commission was not able to propose a provisional closure of negotiations."
"However, the Council, due to earlier political commitments, chose to close the negotiations by the end of 2004."
"Moreover, in regard to justice and home affairs, the Council asked for more reassuring enforcement mechanisms."
"Therefore, in close cooperation with the Netherlands presidency, the Commission worked out a proposal for a reinforced monitoring mechanism linked to safeguard clauses in these two areas: justice and home affairs, and competition and state aids."
"In these areas, the suspension clause can be activated by a qualified majority of the Member States, which gives it stronger credibility than if it were only activated by unanimity."
"I would like to emphasise here that I fully endorse the provisions of this clause."
"Should the monitoring by the Commission show that Romania is not properly prepared for membership, we should not hesitate to recommend that the Council invoke this suspension clause."
"To be absolutely clear: the aim of this clause is not to penalise Romania, but to protect Romania and the EU Member States from any negative effects that Romania’s possible manifest unpreparedness for membership might entail."
"Before closing, let me briefly touch upon the political situation in Romania."
"I know that Parliament is concerned about alleged irregularities in the parliamentary and presidential elections that recently took place in Romania."
"I am also aware of the assessments made by several Romanian NGOs."
"However, I would like to recall that the OSCE election assessment team stated that overall the administration of the Romanian elections 'seemed professional and efficiently organised'."
"I also note that the OSCE has assessed the overall conduct of the election as satisfactory in the second round."
"Moreover, both presidential candidates accepted the final results of the presidential elections."
"I trust – and this is important for the European Union as well as for Romania – that the new president-elect and the forthcoming government in formation will be determined to continue with the reforms that are needed for Romania to accede to the European Union."
"That is very much in the interest of Romania and Romanians."
"Let me conclude by saying that I endorse the conclusions of the report by your rapporteur, Mr Moscovici, which are, in general, in line with the 2004 Regular Report."
"The Commission will continue to keep Parliament informed of Romania’s progress towards accession."
". Mr President, the Committee on Budgets would like to point out that the financial pre-accession aid granted to Romania in 2004 has amounted to EUR 825 million, which comes from the national PHARE programme and the SAPARD and ISPA instruments."
"I would also like to point out that the total volume of this aid is approximately equivalent to 1.4% of the country’s GDP."
"As in the case of Bulgaria, the Committee on Budgets is pleased about the establishment in spring 2004 of the new funding framework for the accession of Romania."
"It is also pleased that, as for Bulgaria, the Commission has proposed restricting this package of aid to a period of three years in order that it may be adapted to the future political needs stemming from the new financial perspectives that are going to be approved."
"All of the financial aid will depend on these new financial perspectives, but from 2009."
"Unlike what happened in the case of the report on Bulgaria, in this case the Committee on Budgets wishes to stress the need to make sustained efforts to enhance Romania’s administrative capacity with regard to the essential fields of customs, VAT and statistics on gross domestic product."
"This means having appropriate capacity to collect and control VAT and customs duties, and to calculate gross domestic product credibly, precisely and exhaustively, in accordance with the SEC 95 rules."
". Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Moscovici, on the excellent work he has done on this report on Romania."
"I would also like to thank him for his open attitude and his spirit of compromise."
"Mr President, in the last two years, Romania has made very significant progress on its journey towards integration with the European Union."
"I naturally welcome this progress."
"A decisive step has been the conclusion of the negotiations at the accession conference held yesterday."
"The closure of these negotiations is expected to be confirmed at the European Council this week, but it is clear that the work is not over."
"In fact, Romania has important work to do before the accession scheduled for 2007 can take place."
"I am not only talking about the procedures necessary for full ratification of the Treaty; it must also intensify its efforts in a series of essential areas."
"To this end, it must carry out the reforms in the field of public administration, it must improve judicial administration and ensure that it is independent – a field in which it adopted an important legislative package a few months ago; it must enhance the fight against corruption, a serious problem which continues to affect the country."
"And efforts are also needed in the field of preserving the environment."
"In short, the report which will be presented to plenary tomorrow specifies in detail many areas in which the Romanian authorities must continue to make efforts."
"Mr President, my position and the report essentially consists of the following: on the one hand, an open and positive view of Romania’s accession to the European Union within the scheduled timescale."
"On the other hand, a demanding position in relation to the efforts Romania must make, which will require determination and perseverance."
"I believe that this is the clear twin message that the Romanian authorities now in office following the elections of recent days must receive."
"Through this report, the European Parliament is saying yes to the integration of Romania, but it will be monitoring that country’s compliance with all of its commitments."
"This Parliament must follow the efforts the Romanian authorities must make very closely."
"We are also counting on the information that the Commission must send out regularly to us in this regard, as the Commissioner has pointed out."
"Finally, on this journey Romania still has to make towards accession, it can count on our vigilance, but, of course, it can also count on our assistance and our impetus."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good and well balanced report."
"The report mentions both the positive and the negative aspects, the strong points and the weak points, which Romania will have to address."
"On the positive side, the report clearly states that Romania meets the Copenhagen political criteria, that it has strengthened the stability of its institutions that guarantee State democracy and human rights, and that the situation has improved in the field of protection of human and ethnic rights, with regard to both the Hungarian minority and the Roma minority."
"On the positive side, Romania also fulfils the criterion of a functioning market economy and, moreover, has implemented and is continuing to implement a programme of structural reforms."
"If we look at the economic results, the economic statistics for Romania, we can see that the country has one of the strongest growth rates in the whole of Eastern Europe."
"Naturally, Romania still has to make considerable efforts and make significant progress, however, before it can be accepted into the European Union."
"Both Mr Nicolaï and Mr Rehn have referred to certain aspects in detail."
"I should like to mention a few of them: the areas of justice and internal affairs, like everywhere in Eastern Europe, the fight against corruption and against organised crime, and also border controls."
"Problems also remain in the fields of economic competition, of state support and, of course, of protecting the natural environment."
"In spite of everything, however, I believe that Romania is well on the way."
"It is up to Romania and Romania alone as to whether it will manage to eliminate all the weak points in the coming months."
"If it does succeed, I am of the opinion that the treaty should be signed in 2005 so that Romania, along with Bulgaria, can be accepted into the European Union in 2007."
". Mr President, it has been a pleasure to work with Mr Moscovici on this fine report."
"Indeed I enjoyed and valued his work in his earlier capacity as a minister."
"It is just as much of a pleasure to work with him as a rapporteur."
"I thank Mr Moscovici for this fine work."
"I believe that President Iliescu – as he retires from his second and final term of office – and his government, as well as Prime Minister Nastase, have concluded their work on a high note."
"They should be proud of their successful achievement of the enlargement process for Romania."
"It is easy today to damn Romania with faint praise, to say that she has done well but has a huge amount more to do."
"That may indeed be true, but let us recall the low position from which she has come and has advanced so rapidly."
"None of us would have dreamed five years ago, when the Helsinki Council declared Romania to be one of the 'regatta principle' countries, that she could have completed the chapters so rapidly and indeed so well."
"All the chapters are closed."
"Of course, implementation must be high on the agenda of the new government and it will have to have very competent people to implement this matter."
"They have to apply the properly and respect the deadlines."
"A great deal of capacity-building has to happen."
"Administrative capacity is vital in applying the as well as ongoing training of staff."
"However, let us remember what an enormous amount has been achieved."
"One of the ways in which we could help is by trying to stop the brain drain."
"Romania needs its young people very badly."
"We should do all we can to strengthen the position of higher education in Romania, to help the country offer jobs, training and workshops to young people."
"It would be very easy, as Romania comes ever closer to the Union, for us to be a magnet for her young people to leave the country."
"That would be a very great pity."
"It is those young people who will assist Romania in implementing the correctly and improving the absorption capacity for the funding that the Commission is putting in."
"I congratulate the Commission too for the very dedicated work which colleagues and I have seen carried out over the last few years."
"I have put forward one amendment, at which I would ask Mr Moscovici and other colleagues to look carefully."
"They have acknowledged that I have been concentrating in particular on the issue of children."
"While I understood and respected Mr Moscovici's support for Prime Minister Raffarin's request for an international commission to re-examine certain sensitive cases on humanitarian grounds where there have been problems with inter-country adoption, nonetheless, I wonder if colleagues might consider accepting my amendment to paragraph 17."
"Mr Moscovici's report requests an international commission."
"That is one outside the European Union."
"My own amendment asks the Commission to take up this matter with the Romanian Government – which is right and proper – and also to report back to the government of Romania and – since I know that colleagues are concerned about this – to the European Parliament as well."
"Perhaps Mr Moscovici and I could discuss this."
"I am sure he would find that it is more in keeping with the spirit of the Treaty."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let it be clear that this is not a debate between those in favour of Romania’s accession to the European Union and those who oppose it."
"My group does not have any fundamental objections to Romania’s membership either, not even on 1 January 2007."
"This is a debate, however, between those who think that, except for a few loose ends, Romania is ready, and those, myself included, who think that it is not, and see that as a reason why we cannot give the go-ahead right now."
"I am, in all honesty, surprised at the position of some groups."
"The very same Members of this House who rightly attached great importance to human rights during the vote and discussions about Turkey, a country that is on the very threshold of negotiations, are, in the case of Romania, a country that is completing them, prepared to overlook just about anything where the same Copenhagen criteria are concerned."
"There are yet other Members in this House whose view of reality has, quite honestly, been somewhat clouded by the fact that members of their parties are probably involved in reprehensible affairs, or because they hope that, after the recent elections in Romania, everything will be very different overnight."
"Hope for improvement is fine, but we should not be naive."
"The problems in Romania are immense, so much so that there is no doubt in my mind that we cannot give them the green light."
"I will give you two examples."
"Over the past few years, there has been no improvement in the situation of journalists and the media in Romania; indeed, it has changed for the worse."
"The number of attacks on critical journalists has increased and the criticism levelled at them was often connected to cases of corruption."
"All NGOs, all the organisations that we always praise so highly – Transparency International, the Open Society Institute, the OECD – all have one message: corruption is still rife in Romania and should not be underestimated."
"Of course, everyone here will state that corruption is to be combated, but how seriously can we take a party which has a majority in the Romanian parliament and a member of which – also a former minister – had to step down a few years ago on account of corruption, and is now vice-chairman of that same party and a candidate for the senate?"
"In my view, this, together with Amnesty International’s reports about the truly abominable treatment of psychiatric patients, can only lead to one conclusion, namely that Romania should wait for a little longer."
"That is why I should like to ask the Commission why it should not draft a separate report next spring, for example, on the aspects which everyone, including the rapporteur, worry about, namely freedom of the press, corruption, independence of the judiciary?"
"The Commission does compile a report on possible problems concerning competition, but refuses to devote a fresh report to human rights problems."
"Why should state support be a stumbling block and human rights not?"
"To those who say – and that is also a comment with regard to the Commission and the presidency – that we still have the suspension clause at our disposal, which enables us to delay Romania’s accession by one year, I should like to state clearly that this suspension clause can only be invoked if there is a unanimous vote in favour of it."
"In other words, if one country in the Council refuses to cooperate, then it will not happen."
"What about qualified majority?"
"Regrettably, that can only be applied to a number of specific areas, and freedom of the press is not one of them."
"In my view, Parliament should not relinquish its power by giving the go-ahead now and, logically, doing the same thing in March."
"Parliament must take itself seriously."
"I would like to quote from a major Dutch newspaper: 'With friendliness that lacks honesty, Europe may become big, but it is growth without substance, greatness without inner strength’."
"The strength of the European Union is to be found in principles that apply universally, including to political allies."
". Mr President, Romania has a long tradition of authoritarian and undemocratic government, Left-wing and Right-wing alternately."
"This tradition goes hand in hand with an intolerant attitude towards its ethnic minorities – Hungarians, Roma and Germans."
"A great deal of attention is always paid to major dam projects, enormous factories and monumental buildings, but not to vagrant children menaced by glue sniffing or prostitution, or to serious environmental pollution."
"In Rosia Montana, there is still the risk of a gold extraction project going ahead, which will use chemical substances capable of seriously polluting the soil and river water in the long term."
"In the cities, the monumental facades hide decay, neglect and poverty."
"Freedom of the press and independence of the judiciary do not meet European standards."
"In neighbouring Moldavia, which came under Russian rule in 1940, there was initial support for reunification, but, as Romania has little to offer at the moment, that support has now ebbed away."
"At present, many Romanians look up to America and the dollar above all, and, to a lesser extent, to Turkey, which is regarded as a major economic partner and an example of a self-assured country."
"At international level, Romania is currently, like Turkey, a close ally of the United States, so much so that it is hindering cooperation with the International Criminal Court in The Hague."
"Complaints about election fraud were lodged again recently."
"I do not expect the careless interpretation of parliamentary democracy to disappear following last weekend’s election of a president from the other side of the political spectrum, who is also likely to determine the composition of a new government."
"This new government will probably take the view that the previous government was too meek in its negotiations with the European Union and that it had allowed itself to be humiliated."
"In its previous composition, this parliament was extremely critical about the possibility of Romania fulfilling in the short term the current EU criteria in terms of democracy, human rights and the environment."
"That is why it seemed certain that Romania would be joining later than Bulgaria, together with Croatia at the very earliest."
"I am surprised at the recent U-turn within the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the rejection of a number of critical amendments."
"The fear that Romania might be humiliated and the EU’s ambition for speedy territorial expansion now appear more imperative than solving problems."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left would like to welcome Romania to the European Union as quickly as possible, provided that, as is the case with Turkey, solutions have been found to the problems in the areas of democracy, human rights and the environment, and this is still a huge obstacle at the moment."
". Mr President, as a former ship’s captain, the newly-elected President of Romania, Traian Basescu, knows a thing or two about choppy waters, which gives him a considerable edge, for the ship of state of his native country, where he will be taking the helm, is currently facing rough seas."
"Moreover, Basescu will be the first to admit this frankly."
"In an interview with the of 26 November, Basescu, who is at present the mayor of Bucharest, gave this explanation of why he is striving to turn his country round politically: ‘The problem is corruption which, in this country, has been elevated to a form of government’."
"The report by Mr Moscovici is just as clear about Bucharest’s failings as it makes its way to Brussels, and we sincerely appreciate the way in which he has done this, quite rightly tracing Romania’s shortcomings in terms of all the accession criteria, including the political conditions."
"In the discussion of previous reports of this House about Romania as a candidate country, I asked for attention to be paid to violations of the freedom of the press."
"Unfortunately, this report mentions these violations again in Paragraph 8."
"It is as plain as day that there is physical aggression against investigative journalists, and that the government exerts pressure on financially weak media."
"In his recent book ‘Threatened journalists, beaten journalists’, the author and journalist Malin Bot confirmed this depressing image."
"The book is an outright indictment of the prevailing press restraint in Romania."
"Mr Basescu and his political sympathisers therefore have their work cut out."
"Incidentally, in our regions, in Western Europe, we should take note of what Malin Bot has to say about the dubious role of Western publishers who have bought up many Romanian papers, and who, in his words, ‘do not come to Romania to defend democracy, but simply to make money’."
"I hope that a new Romanian Government takes the European accession criteria entirely seriously from the word go."
"In the final analysis, it is not fair to blame them for the commitments that have not been complied with by the Nastase government."
"This list is long and weighty."
"Moreover, time goes on; it is fortunate, with the desired accession date of 1 January 2007 in mind, that the incoming President Basescu realises this all too well."
"That is why he deserves all our attention and support in this undoubtedly difficult period."
"This House expects the Commission to strictly enforce the security mechanism agreed upon with Bucharest."
"To finish off, I should like to draw Bucharest’s attention to one paragraph in the Moscovici report: ‘calls on it to speed up the restitution of property and adopt legislation on the restitution of churches’."
"At the same time, I would ask the Council and Commission to closely monitor the implementation of this long drawn-out issue."
"The Dutch Presidency has already made a pledge to that effect to its own parliament."
"In a fine review in a German quality newspaper yesterday, I read a razor-sharp satire on the political degeneration of Romania under post-Communist rule."
"The author aptly parodied the title of Prime Minister Nastase’s campaign document entitled: ‘From Karl Marx to Coca-Cola’, claiming that a document entitled ‘From Karl Marx to Al Capone’ would be just as truthful."
"We very much hope that Romania, under President Basescu, will break this persistent political spell."
"The surprising outcome of the second round of the presidential elections appears to be an encouraging sign of this."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the New Italian Socialist Party wishes the incoming President Basescu all the best in his work."
"The countless young Romanians who have supported him over recent months and are jubilantly filling the squares and streets of Bucharest and the rest of the country are, regardless of their political affiliations, pinning on him their hopes for change and for a different, new and better future."
"Mr Basescu has a difficult and yet rather exciting task ahead of him: to steer his country on the new courses of modernisation, anti-corruption measures and full compliance with human and civil rights, as well as the permanent adoption of democratic structures."
"We hope – or rather, we are sure – that the end of that journey can only be the total integration of Romania into the political and socioeconomic bloc of the European Union."
"While we note with satisfaction the goals that have been achieved, our task over the remaining two years will be to ensure that concrete, real and significant improvements are made in the many areas that still fall short of European standards."
"I refer in particular to the qualitative leap that is urgently needed in the field of human rights, especially with regard to the requests of the Roma minority, which often suffers discrimination with the acquiescence of government authorities."
"The Roma make up 2.5 million citizens who live on the edges of society in totally unacceptable conditions."
"I also refer to the requests and aspirations of the Hungarian minority, which consists of 1.5 million people; the treatment of the disabled; the shameful condition of the health infrastructure, especially those facilities housing patients with mental problems; the violent methods and actual physical abuse practised by the forces of law and order; a judicial system that fails to meet the criteria of efficiency and independence; as well as media that are still not entirely free."
"On visiting the country, I was struck and disturbed by the many – too many – children wandering the streets alone."
"We must demand a concrete commitment from the government on this issue."
"It is a legal and moral obligation, not an option."
"Everything possible has to be done, then, to ensure that every child in Romania, as in Europe and the rest of the world, has the right to a peaceful, happy childhood and the right to smile with hope for the future."
"Mr President, I have been a Romania-watcher for five years now, ever since I took up the case of a London constituent of mine, Prince Carol Mircea."
"He demonstrated clearly to me that the Romanian Government, through its Prosecutor General, had repeatedly intervened on one side – allegedly under instructions from President Iliescu – of the civil case against Carol's half brother, ex-King Michael of Romania."
"I was therefore particularly delighted at seeing the independence of the Romanian justice system."
"Not only has Romania now abolished the Soviet-era right for the state to intervene in civil cases, but recently, when the previous government tried to circumvent the royal palace's property claim dispute by a bill of compensation in the Parliament, the Senate threw it out, citing the fact that it was before the Supreme Court."
"So, things are improving in terms of the independence of Romania's justice system."
"Clearly, Mr Basescu's victory in the presidential elections shows that Romania is also moving rapidly forward in reform terms."
"The surprise result definitely scotched all the allegations that the election would be stolen by cheating by the authorities."
"Romania is far from perfect and the fight against corruption and organised crime will be priority number one for the new government."
"More work needs to be done on minority rights, including the large Roma population and the Hungarian population."
"Also let me make a plea against a rigid imposition of the moratorium against foreign child adoptions, as many families from countries as diverse as Italy and Israel have developed bonds with children in orphanages."
"It would be cruel and inhumane to terminate the process arbitrarily at this late stage."
"I welcome the Romanian Government's decision to establish an international committee to resolve this delicate issue."
"As Vice-President of the Ukraine Delegation, I believe that outstanding disputes such as the issue of territorial claims by Romania over tiny Snake Island in the Black Sea, which is currently under Ukrainian control, need to be resolved before 2007."
"Here, the ownership of the exclusive economic interest zone is essential, as oil is believed to be present."
"Good relations with Ukraine, which is now establishing itself as a fully-fledged European democracy, are important for the future."
"Another issue is the border area of the Danube Delta, where there are concerns that a Ukrainian-built navigable channel is upsetting the surrounding wetlands and hence also the unique local habitat for rare bird species."
"More distant is the whole issue of cooperating with and stabilising Moldova and the Transnistria question that goes with it. Interestingly, if Mr Yuschenko comes to power in Kiev on 26 December, the days for the Tiraspol regime of Transnistria are numbered, hence the Russians' desire to deny Mr Yuschenko victory."
"Has anybody investigated whether the Tiraspol regime may also have had a role to play in the poisoning of Mr Yuschenko?"
"I believe Romania will be ready to join the European Union by 1 January 2007 with Bulgaria."
"I welcome both as EU Member States, although I do not see the two as chronologically coupled automatically."
"Lastly, of course, there are the safeguard clauses which allow date slippage if Romania falls short of its requirements under the ; but nevertheless I fully support the Moscovici report and look forward to Romania joining us in the 25 Member States by 2007."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Moscovici on his very objective and well-balanced report."
"I fully agree with Mr Rehn and Mr Nicolaï, who I feel have expressed very objective opinions."
"Romania’s accession is beneficial to Hungary for two reasons; on the one hand, good neighbourliness, and on the other, the issue of the minority Hungarian community, with more than half a million Hungarians living in Romania."
"That is why I can say that it is in our national interest for Romania to accede in two years’ time."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Nastase Government, which has done a great deal to bring about the historic reconciliation between Romania and Hungary."
"Today we have a strategic partnership."
"It is true that in all honesty much remains to be done, but considerable progress has been made over the last ten years."
"I should like to stress three key issues that need to be resolved."
"The first is genuine decentralisation, and a real devolvement of power to the regions."
"The next is the protection of the environment, as clean rivers are a cross-border issue."
"Finally, there is the question of the minorities, the Roma and the Hungarians."
"I do not wish to make the implementation of different forms of autonomy a prerequisite to Romania’s accession, but it would be helpful to open negotiations with the new government, namely tripartite negotiations between the Romanian Government, the Hungarian parliamentary party and the Hungarian Government, as was done in the case of South Tyrol and the Åland Islands in Finland."
"The European Union offers helpful precedents here."
"It would therefore be desirable to start the negotiations, and I fully support Romania’s accession without delay."
"It is perhaps Romania that has the worst legacy of all the former communist countries."
"Ceaucescu and his associates destroyed the country, ruined its economy, fragmented its society and intimidated its citizens."
"The last fifteen years are far from being a success story as the postponement of reforms wasted several valuable years."
"I therefore hope that the newly-elected leaders, President and Government of Romania will set about facing the challenges before them with redoubled effort."
"There are two tasks that I especially would like to mention."
"The first one, where there are considerable deficiencies, is the social integration of the Romanian Romany minority comprising of over two million people, who are in a very difficult situation."
"The second one is giving a higher priority to environmental issues, since the state of the environment in Romania is far behind that of the other candidate countries."
"Regulations not only have to be adopted, but they have to be implemented as well."
"Let me remind you of the very dangerous mining project of Rosia Montana, threatening us with severe environmental disaster."
"The road that leads to the completion of negotiations is long and rugged, and I congratulate Romania’s leadership on their success."
"From now on it should focus on adopting the ."
"I hope Romania will fulfil the obligations and will become a member state in 2007."
"This is in our interest and in Romania’s interest."
"I therefore think that Mr Basescu’s demand that two chapters should be reopened for negotiations is highly risky."
"It jeopardises Romania’s accession in 2007, and delay is not in the interest of either Romania, or the European Union."
"Romania has made great sacrifices in order to be able to work towards becoming a member of the Union."
"I firmly believe that it is in our best interest that Romania joins as soon as 2007, and Romania must realise that several obligations simply must be fulfilled on the way."
"This is why I find this topic so crucial and ask the Commissioner and the Commission to continuously monitor Romania’s progress in this matter, as it is not only in our best interest but also in the interest of Romanian citizens."
"Mr President, in the environmental sphere, Romania at present lags very far behind in terms of what is required by EU legislation."
"In spite of the fact that it has been given very long transitional periods where important environmental regulations are concerned, it has not implemented different legislation."
"Where, in a number of areas, such legislation has in actual fact been enacted, it has been so on paper but not in practice."
"Last year, we sent a delegation from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to the Department of the Environment in Bucharest."
"The delegation examined quite a few of the more controversial projects, and our view was confirmed: the pace of reform in the environmental sphere needs urgently to be stepped up."
"There is a special project I think the Commission should keep a particular eye on over the next few years."
"It concerns Rosia Montana, a proposal to construct Europe’s largest gold mine in Romania."
"It is a project that will have huge environmental repercussions."
"Among other things, large quantities of cyanide will be used in this sensitive area."
"The issue is that of whether Romania will comply with current EU legislation, for example the provisions governing environmental impact assessments and the water directive."
"The issue is also that of whether Romania will successfully comply with the forthcoming new directive on waste from mines and its environmental repercussions."
"I should like to call upon the Commission to examine the Rosia Montana project particularly carefully to see if there really is successful compliance with the EU’s environmental requirements, which I consider to be minimum standards and ones with which compliance is also being demanded by the local population in the area."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I join in with the many positive comments made to the rapporteur, Mr Moscovici, regarding the balance of his report. While not ignoring any of the critical areas in the process of Romania’s preparation to join the European Union, the report shows a clear appreciation of the notable efforts made and the results – albeit still partial – achieved by Romania in that process."
"This morning, with great aplomb, this Parliament gave the green light to the procedure for Turkey’s preparation to join the European Union."
"I am in favour of Romania’s accession for exactly the same reasons that have led me to express my strong hostility to Turkey’s entry. Romania is Europe;"
"Romania has a civil and political society based on values which, despite their undeniable highs and lows, have to be regarded as perfectly comparable to the values on which the European Union is based."
"Certain areas in which basic measures are still needed certainly deserve encouragement and support."
"They include the multiannual anti-crime strategy, the state aid issue (a subject particularly close to the hearts of us liberalists), the sensitive question of the return of property and churches, as well as the modernisation of a judicial system that does not appear to be compatible with a society such as Europe’s, which is characterised by systems that are not subject to direct influence and control by the state."
"I have just listened to the speech by a spokesman for a political party that voted for the accession of Turkey, who repeated the harsh remarks made by NGOs about respect for human rights in Romania."
"I should like to have heard the same observations made about Turkey as well: in that case they would have been decidedly more justified."
"It is, however, absolutely necessary to call the Romanian authorities’ attention to the urgent question of illegal immigration."
"One Member has referred to the children, who understandably had an emotional effect on him during a visit to Romania."
"I do not need to go to Romania, because you just need to drive around the streets of Turin, Milan, Genoa and Rome to see Romanian children exploited by criminal organisations."
"We have to put a stop to illegal immigration, and Romania has to defend its external borders and actively collaborate in stamping out this activity, which does no credit to the civilisation of Eugen Ionescu, Mircea Eliade and the many other great writers and thinkers of a civilisation that we feel is close to us and which we share."
"Romania’s citizens have a place in the European Union, there is no question about it."
"One of the reasons why we mutually need each other is because through accession, the underlying principles of the Union, decentralisation and local self-government may help improve prospects for the future of the Hungarian minority there, including one and a half million people."
"The question is about fulfilling commitments: will Romania be able to adopt the that all Member States are obliged to fulfil?"
"The Union seems to be more lenient towards Romania than it was towards those countries that joined in May."
"Mr Moscovici’s report critically examines how Romania has met the criteria so far."
"I would like to compliment him on his skill at compromise, as he included several of my proposed amendments into his report, making his arguments firmer."
"The report examines areas of severe deficit: the independence of judicial proceedings, the discriminatory legislation on election rights and the return of ecclesiastical goods."
"Let me take this even a step further and point out some of Romania’s deficiencies in fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria, highlighted by the election-related abuse on November 28."
"As a Hungarian delegate, I feel obligated to list the temporary exemptions in the field of environmental protection that Romania asked for."
"Hungarians are apprehensive about these exemptions, as they would have a direct effect on the quality of water in Hungary and thus have requested that the Hungarian Government reopened chapters of environmental protection, which have just recently been closed."
"It is exactly because of the uncertainties of such commitments that I would like to emphasise how important it is to monitor strictly the period between signing the accession treaty and the actual time of accession."
"If necessary, the processes of the two candidate countries should be separated and they should receive individual performance-based evaluation."
"Regular progress checks are very important, and Parliament must also take part in this process, so that by the time Romania joins the Union, we can feel reassured and confident as to their preparedness."
"I belong to those who most sincerely hope that our doubts will be scattered by Romania’s positive performance in the near future."
"Mr President, in my view, last Sunday's presidential elections have indeed demonstrated that democracy in Romania is very vibrant and is also working well."
"This has not always been the case, and so we have every reason to be gratified."
"Let us hope that the dynamic forces which have now been released will genuinely be channelled into driving forward the reforms and that the political process in Bucharest will not be obstructed."
"All we can do is hope."
"I was a member of the Delegation to the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee from 1999 to 2004."
"If we compare 1999 and today, the country has obviously made substantial progress."
"Notwithstanding all the criticism in specific areas, it must be said that the previous government under Anastase achieved a great deal for Romania."
"Major progress has genuinely been made in many areas."
"However, we cannot ignore the fact that the Romanians still have a lot to do."
"Not enough has been done to achieve the standards that apply throughout the European Union."
"I can only repeat what many of my fellow Members have said: an independent judiciary – which means a judiciary which is independent of the executive and individual political forces – is in fact a prerequisite for Romania's cooperation within the EU."
"There is still some ground to be made up here."
"I also hope that corruption can be combated more effectively."
"Corruption is robbery at the expense of Romania's citizens, and the new President has pledged major anti-corruption measures which will hopefully target not only the 'small fry' but also the big fish."
"Corruption must be tackled irrespective of position or status, for it is theft from the Romanian people."
"In my view, it would be quite wrong for Romania or the EU to create new obstacles at this point in time."
"The negotiations should be concluded, and I would like to thank Mr Moscovici, the rapporteur, for presenting such an excellent report."
"2007 must be the date when we welcome Romania into the European family, and thus integrate it into European standards as well."
"Mr President, let me be clear."
"I am very much in favour of Romania acceding, but all in good time and preferably in accordance with the agreements made."
"In order to complete the negotiations, it simply needs to fulfil the prescribed conditions and criteria, so it is quite beyond me why the Commission should, with a straight face, claim that Romania meets the Copenhagen political criteria, while at the same time it reports extensively on the influence the executive power exerts over the outcome of court cases and confirms that corruption is still rife and discrimination – including that against the Roma – is still very much on the agenda."
"It appears that this House’s rapporteur, too, does not have any problem with stating in the first paragraph of his report that Romania meets the political criteria, while going on, later on in the report – and rightly so – to express his concern about a few crucial points."
"The rapporteur goes on to draw the conclusion – which I regard as improbable – that a satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations before the end of 2004 is both desirable and feasible."
"My common sense leads me to a completely different conclusion, namely that Romania has not gone that far yet and, consequently, negotiations cannot be concluded satisfactorily before the end of 2004."
"We have tabled Amendment No 7 for that purpose."
"Our Amendments Nos 6 and 25 are also important;"
"Amendment No 6 underlines that the progress of all candidate countries is dependent on the assessment of their own merits and that it is for this reason that the use of individual accession agreements as a basis for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is recommended."
"Amendment No 25 does the necessary job of bringing paragraph 1 of the report back into line with reality."
"I sincerely hope that we can count on your support so that we can get through to the European Council before it is too late, because it has just been confirmed again that the Council has now completed the formal negotiations with Romania."
"It follows that this debate and tomorrow’s vote are staged performances, but, before the accession agreement is signed in the spring of 2005, Parliament must give its express approval, and I do not see that as being by any means a ."
"I would see it as a good thing if this House were to speak out clearly about the premature and artificial closure of the negotiations with Romania, if it were to be able to put a stop to the considerable arbitrariness in the enlargement process and if it were to keep to the agreements made."
"The working method that we now see in the process with Romania will, sooner or later, result in the erosion of our community based on the rule of law and in the weakening of the Union."
"Mr President, the June List will welcome Romania and Bulgaria as Members of the European Union, just as we shall welcome Turkey, the countries of the Western Balkans and, in time, Ukraine and, hopefully, Belarus."
"At the same time, we wish to warn of the problems that will be faced by the EU if we accept a large number of countries as Member States in the very short term – poor and economically undeveloped countries with limited experience of democracy and the rule of law and with large problems involving corruption."
"The EU is constructed for economically developed countries with stable democracies and only moderate problems with corruption."
"The enlargement involving ten countries that has just been carried out and of which the June List was a sincere supporter is, already for its part, causing problems."
"Accepting poor countries such as Romania into an EU that continues to operate an absurd agricultural policy and a poorly managed structural policy and that is itself wrestling with difficulties in preventing waste and corruption in its own system would be dangerous for the future of the European project."
"It might also prove dangerous for Romania."
"There would be a significant risk of a brain drain."
"Entering the EU’s agricultural system and being locked tightly into an economic structure without a future would also be a big disadvantage."
"The election that has just taken place was, however, a big success for democracy in Romania, but both Romania and the EU countries have reasons to wait and see and not to push for premature accession."
"It may be in the interests of both parties not to rush into full membership."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Moscovici, for giving us a balanced report, which points out the advances made by Romania in recent years."
"Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne did well to recall the position from which Romania started and the reasons that have made progress so difficult for that country."
"Even so, Mr Moscovici has also pointed out the limitations and shortcomings that characterise Romania’s situation today."
"Some Members from countries that joined the European Union on 1 May this year have called for greater severity."
"I should like them to reread what was said in this Chamber before their countries joined, when we were looking at how far they had progressed on their path towards joining the Union."
"In all likelihood they still had considerable shortcomings at that stage but, even so, it was thought appropriate that they should be allowed to join at the agreed time."
"In the case of Romania, we also have a safeguard clause, which was not provided in the other cases."
"I therefore believe it is only fair to give that country the chance to do its utmost over the next two years so that it can be ready when the time comes to actually join our Union."
"There is no doubt that there are topics about which our fellow citizens are concerned, the most important of which is the inadequacy of the fight against organised crime."
"If we were to ask people in the streets of our countries to say how afraid they often felt of criminal gangs, we would surely be inclined to encourage the Romanian Government to do more in that direction."
"As Mr Leinen rightly recalled, the fight against corruption is widespread in the countries joining our Union."
"I should also like to touch on the topic of children."
"This is a subject that I have addressed extensively in recent years, together with Baroness Nicholson."
"Child protection issues need to be placed at the heart of our thinking."
"I believe, however, that the proposal put forward by the rapporteur of having an international commission is a good solution."
"If we want to prevent those children from spending their adolescence and youth on the streets of our cities or shut up in institutions, we have to take into account the dozens of families that have already made contact with them and would love to be able to give them affection."
"Let us therefore welcome Mr Moscovici’s suggestion to that effect."
"Lastly, Mr President, we need to consider the importance of stability."
"We shall see whether the outcome of the recent elections in Bucharest will lead to political stability."
"I believe that that is what we all wish for, because only with stability can there be any hope of seeing Romania ready to meet its commitments."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Nicolaï, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate Mr Moscovici on his excellent report, which is indeed, as he said, both honest and clear and does not ignore the shortcomings and failings that we can all still see in the case of Romania, like those associated with the freedom of the press, which is seriously deficient – and I am choosing my words carefully – the delays in ensuring that the judicial and police systems function independently and the corruption which is still all too prevalent."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I started my career as a teacher of modern languages, and when I was marking exams or homework I realised that I would become increasingly harsh as I went on, and that I would be much tougher on the last papers than I had been on the first – to such a point that I would take another look at the first ones to make sure that I had been sufficiently fair."
"Listening to this debate and hearing what some Members have to say, and also recalling this morning’s debate, I wonder whether we are not experiencing something similar here, because it seems to me that we are becoming increasingly harsh with each enlargement."
"Is this to say that there are no problems?"
"Of course not."
"I mentioned them and our rapporteur has clearly indicated where they lie, and said that considerable improvements are essential."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am fairly well acquainted with Romania and have had the opportunity on several occasions to urge those in positions of authority from all political sides to speed up work on implementing the reforms and transposing the necessary legislation and regulation."
"Like the majority of the members of my group, I will be voting in favour of the recommendations in the Moscovici report."
"I will be doing so not only because of my feelings for Romania, where I have many excellent friends, but also because, having visited the country as long ago as February 1990 and seen fresh evidence of the violence of the end of the previous year, I can fully appreciate how far it has already come."
"We owe our friends understanding and friendship, but not weak or almost indifferent indulgence."
"This has always been my attitude towards Romania, and it remains my attitude today."
"My positive attitude remains fundamentally an attitude of vigilant friendship."
"I hope that Parliament will adopt the same approach."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that more honesty is called for."
"I am most grateful to Mr Lagendijk for his demand in this respect, even though we have arrived at different conclusions for Turkey."
"He is absolutely right: we must demand honesty in relation to Romania as well."
"In my view, this obviously means that we must dispense with a few of our dogmas."
"The first is that deadlines which have been mooted at some point in the past are now regarded as more sacred than the progress made or the realities of the situation."
"Let me be blunt. We will not do ourselves any favours if we abide by 1 January 2007 as a date for Romania's accession."
"Secondly – and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am directing these remarks specifically to you, as we had the pleasure of discussing the budget, among other things, with you – we are talking about a period for which we still have no budget, as we have yet to adopt a new Financial Perspective to cover the period from 1 January 2007."
"If you cling to your second dogma, namely the figure of 1%, we will be unable to cope with this financial burden."
"We cannot argue that Europe is continually expanding and its agenda is becoming longer, while money is becoming increasingly tight."
"Please be honest and make it clear that there is no funding."
"We need to negotiate the Financial Perspective first, and then we will see whether everything adds up."
"Thirdly – and again, let me be blunt – I have heard every speaker talk about the problems which we still have to overcome, not us, that is, but Romania, namely corruption, democracy and the rule of law."
"Just what do we mean when we talk about membership of the European Union?"
"Is this not the precondition, as we learned today at noon?"
"According to the majority of Members of this House, this is not the precondition for the opening of negotiations."
"I take a different view."
"Ultimately, however, before we are handed an accession treaty – and we have been told that this will be available within the next six months – everything has to be in place."
"We are deceiving ourselves if we proceed on the basis that monitoring processes and clauses which are built in but will never come into force because they require unanimity in the Council are enough to justify our confidence and convince us that everything will work out just fine."
"That is why I am appealing to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in relation to the drafting of the presidency conclusions on Friday."
"I realise that you have a problem in that you have little to show for your presidency."
"However, no one is reproaching you: during the six months in which you held the presidency, Europe was operating below par."
"We had the European elections, and then it took some time for the Commission to be appointed and confirmed in office."
"No one can blame the presidency for this."
"However, you are responsible for ensuring that we do not deceive ourselves every six months."
"That means that we should not claim, in Council documents, that significant progress has been made and improvements have yet again been achieved when this is not the case."
"I therefore appeal to you to be honest when you draw up the presidency conclusions on Friday."
"I appeal to the House as well: let us take an honest vote on this issue tomorrow."
"Mr President, we like to talk about a Europe of values."
"How does this fit with the decision to admit Romania to the European Union in just two years time unless by some chance there should be a deferral of just 12 months, which hardly seems likely given that we have heard today that the Council has overridden the Commission's concerns in closing chapters, a deplorable example of over principle of which the Dutch presidency should be ashamed."
"One of my colleagues said that we are being too severe on Romania."
"How soft does she want us to be?"
"On the Commission's own admission, Romania suffers from serious and widespread corruption; it has a judiciary which is neither efficient nor independent; it does not possess genuine media freedom; it cannot implement the at local and regional level; it fails to prevent money laundering; it permits the ill-treatment of prisoners in custody; it fails to enforce laws against child and sexual trafficking."
"Yet this is a country apparently now so close to meeting EU values that we are putting it on a certain course to accession."
"It is not surprising that the EU may stand accused of being unable to say 'no' to anyone when it sets its sights so low."
"The Commissioner says, and I quote from his recent parliamentary answer: 'It seems likely that Romania's future progress will be accelerated by its accession to the EU'."
"However, neither he nor any of us know whether that will prove true."
"So far we have been lucky: membership of the European Union has tended to make bad apples wholesome but perhaps we will reach the point where the bad apples infect the rest."
"You only have to look at Lithuania, near the top of the world league for corruption, or to the United Kingdom, locking up people without charge or trial, to realise that Europe can very easily allow its values to be betrayed from within."
"We do not have in place an effective mechanism for dealing with existing Member States that quietly reject the principles of good governance."
"Perhaps the Commissioner can take a lead in building such a mechanism."
"I wish the new Romanian Government well."
"The results of last Sunday's election give hope for reform, although the result was no thanks either to the Commission or the Council, both of which played right into the hands of the former cynical government."
"Romania's problems run deep."
"Once applicants are allowed through the EU door, the Commission is deprived of its best weapons to secure change."
"Instead of using the opportunity to apply maximum pressure to gain reform, we seem determined to set it on a conveyor belt to automatic accession."
"Romania should join the European Union, but it should do when it meets the values of the EU."
"It would be a grave mistake to set a date for accession now."
"– Mr President, maybe Bulgaria and Romania are being wronged by our debating Turkey's accession prospects over the last few days in the European Parliament – and shall also be doing so in the European Union, at the European Council, in a few days' time."
"I believe that forecasts on the subject of Turkey are overshadowing both the expression and the weighting of our political word."
"I should like to start by referring to a topical matter, the finalisation yesterday of the results of the elections in Romania."
"The new President has been named and the results of the election have been accepted by his fellow candidate, putting an end to any disputes relating to the electoral process."
"Nonetheless, the new President will have to achieve the strong backing of parliament if he is to honour immediately the commitments which Romania has given to the European Union."
"Given the almost balanced presence of the main political forces in the Romanian parliament, cooperation amongst everyone and serious joint efforts will be needed for the successful continuation of European integration."
"Ladies and gentlemen, by my reading, Romania has made significant progress, especially in such a short space of time, in coming into line with political and economic accession criteria."
"Nonetheless, we should not overlook the need for further radical reform, focusing on the efficient combating of corruption and changes in the public administration and in the judicial system, in the aim of securing truly independent justice."
"In addition, further measures need to be taken in the sectors of border controls, asylum and immigration policy and more drastic action to combat organised crime and corruption."
"At economic level, it is considered necessary, , to safeguard macro-economic stability, rationalise the role of the state in the economy and introduce efficient regional and rural development policies and policies for greater regional integration and cooperation with the countries of south-eastern Europe."
"My personal appraisal is that, with the support of the European Commission and with the precondition, of course, of more intense effort, it is feasible that Romania will be able to comply more fully with the criteria and the values and principles of the Union and sign an accession agreement at the same time as Bulgaria."
"Mr President, firstly I wish to thank my colleague, Mr Moscovici, for an excellent report, and one that takes account of different points of view."
"Candidate countries must be treated equally and fairly."
"Romania must fulfil the conditions imposed on it, just as the others did when they acceded to the Union."
"We are not striving for perfection here: none of the present Member States of the Union is perfect."
"Problems have been mentioned here today relating to Romania’s home affairs and issues of justice."
"Mr Basescu, winner of the Romanian presidential elections, promised the Romanians in his victory speech an unsullied administration and an independent civil service."
"This promise must be taken seriously and must be fulfilled."
"We have to encourage Romania to bring about reforms."
"I wish to emphasise the importance of promoting human rights in the future."
"Attention should not just be paid to the viability of public administration: human rights issues are at least as important, if not more so."
"Trafficking in human beings is something for which there must be zero tolerance, both in Romania and elsewhere in Europe."
"Unfortunately, even the credibility of the present Member States suffers on this issue."
"We cannot establish a margin of tolerance for trafficking in human beings: it has to be completely prohibited."
"Romania also needs support in its implementation of the new law on child protection."
"Finally, I wish to express my thanks to Commissioner Rehn, as he has promised to keep Parliament very well informed."
"In my opinion, that is a very important point."
"Romania should be ready for membership, but the current Member States should also be ready to accept Romania as a member, and dialogue between the Commission and Parliament can only further that endeavour."
"– Mr President, the Romanian people have just voted a different political party into power for the second time since the revolution."
"Does this not prove that democracy is working in this country, which has suffered under both dictatorship and communism?"
"That is why Romania cannot be compared to other countries, because the after-effects of this twofold oppression are still being felt."
"It will take several more generations before the insane decisions of a dictator and a secret police, the , cease to affect how people behave."
"Our report does not mention the issue of the , which nevertheless presents a significant problem in terms of human resources."
"In fact, Romania has not yet emerged from this difficult period."
"Mr President, have we considered that the young people who were born after the dictatorship have not yet reached the age of majority?"
"Where is this nation to find untainted, independent staff, who have not been close to the dictator, who have not belonged to the communist or been part of the to fill posts in these administrations and thus ensure that they are independent, which is what we require?"
"The progress made towards accession to the European Union should be considered from two different viewpoints: the desire of the political classes for change and the ability to achieve it in practice."
"The proposal to delay Romania’s accession that has been made by the very same people who were in favour of Turkey this morning is something with which I have difficulty, and I actually find it extremely arrogant."
"It is only 15 years since the revolution in Romania, which could just as easily have led to a civil war."
"We must therefore hope that President Basescu succeeds in forming a coalition that has the national interest at heart, rather than the profile of the different political parties."
"Although President Iliescu and President Constantinescu, a one-time member of this European People’s Party, have not managed to put in place all of the necessary reforms, we must nevertheless acknowledge that they have brought relative institutional stability to the country."
"Let us then, rather than playing the schoolmaster, have some respect for the efforts already made and accurately assess what remains to be done."
"Mr President, 2007 will in any case be a great year for Romania because in 2007 a Romanian city, Sibiu, will share the title of European Capital of Culture with Luxembourg."
"This proposal was made by the Luxembourg Government, and was the subject of a joint decision by the Council of Ministers and the Commission."
"The rich multicultural and multiethnic Romanian heritage will certainly enrich the culture of Europe, and Romania should also be seen from the point of view of its cultural riches and the potential of its population, which has been badly bruised by the madness of a dictator and the damaging effects of a totalitarian ideology."
"Mr President, this morning I voted in favour of starting negotiations with Turkey."
"I am also in favour of Romania’s accession, and will seek to ensure that we do all we can to make this a reality."
"I believe that our rapporteur has drawn the right conclusions in his report, and I am grateful to him."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mr Moscovici for his excellent report."
"With the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, the fifth round of enlargement will have been implemented, creating a larger, democratic Europe, which will take its place on the world political stage as a place of great promise and profound concerns, distinguished by being the Europe of citizenship."
"Europe is thus not just a free-market and free trade area with a single currency, but above all it has the ability and desire to peacefully export the model consisting of the rule of law, protection of minorities and human rights, sustainable development, as well as an economy and finances that are efficient and designed to promote cohesion."
"That is what the spirit and the letter of the Constitutional Treaty and the Nice Charter affirm."
"We therefore welcome the successes and steady improvement that Romania has achieved in meeting the Copenhagen criteria in the various fields, as Mr Moscovici has indicated, emphasising, , its respect for its minorities, both Hungarian and Roma."
"Romania must, however, make rapid progress to fulfil all the accession commitments, especially in the area of the Community ."
"Structural measures are not enough to combat poverty."
"Corruption also needs to be fought through preventive measures and all laws need to be enforced."
"Lastly, we feel that the improvement of legislation on child protection and international adoptions is a positive step."
"Regarding the latter area, I would call on the Romanian authorities to find an immediate solution to the problem of adoptions hit by delays, which are depriving children of the families to which they are entitled."
"In the name of that universal right, which is one of the strong points of the Constitutional Treaty, and in addition to the creation of an international commission to start work straight away, I call on the newly-elected Romanian authorities not to waste precious time and, for Christmas, to give those children the parents that already love them and with whom they can build a better future in a peaceful Europe."
". Mr President, I will be brief."
"I have heard many positive remarks, most of which I agree with."
"Of course, there were also many concerns expressed, many of which I also agree with."
"There were some critical remarks, with which I do not agree, from Mr Ferber, Mr Lagendijk and others, that Romania is not ready to close the negotiations."
"I emphasise that we, as a presidency and as a Council, base our position on the assessment of the European Commission."
"Romania is not ready for accession, which is why we feel it is important to have two more years to achieve the whole framework for the negotiations, as we discussed before, with extra guarantees and extra safeguards."
"In response to Mr Lagendijk's remarks, we do not need unanimity in the Council for using this extra safeguard clause – the possibility of postponing the accession for a maximum of a year."
"No, precisely in the area of justice and home affairs which he mentions – as many members did – and also in the sensitive area of competition, we only need a qualified majority for using the extra safeguard clause."
"The rapporteur, Mr Moscovici, Mr Meijer and others made some remarks about signals from Romania that the president-elect wants to renegotiate the results."
"The president-elect seems to have noticed critical remarks about the idea of reopening some chapters."
"We learned from Bucharest that Mr Basescu is emphasising the efforts to be made before January 2007, which leave no room for reopening the final results of the negotiations."
"In a short reply to Mr Ferber about the financial consequences of accession, I repeat what I said about Bulgaria."
"The financial consequences are already arranged in the financial package for 2007-2009, irrespective of the new financial perspective."
"Let me conclude with my compliments to Mr Moscovici."
"His report addresses all the important areas in a constructive and even-handed way."
". Mr President, I wish to join the President-in-office of the Council in thanking Mr Moscovici, and I would like to make one or two comments and reply to those questions that have been raised in this debate."
"Firstly, Mr Tabajdi said he appreciated the Commission’s objectivity and impartiality."
"I thank him for this and I wish to stress that in future this should be a guiding principle in all enlargement policy."
"My view is that after last year’s major setback we shall now be proceeding gradually and steadily in terms of the enlargement of the European area of peace and democracy."
"Our negotiations with the candidate countries will be gradual, steady, careful and thorough."
"In this regard, I understand in general the views expressed by Mr Ferber."
"It is a pity he did not have time to hear my reply."
"As Mr Ferber demanded honesty of the EU, that is to say ourselves, I agree that we should assess the effects of all decisions taken on enlargement and that we need to adhere to the criteria."
"It is for that very reason that we have proposed a safeguard clause in the chapters relating to justice and home affairs and competition."
"This safeguard clause may be adopted by qualified majority, which makes it credible, and it will encourage Romania to work and strive to achieve results."
"Several speakers have also quite rightly given attention to the challenges that lie ahead for Romania, including improving the environment and the status of minorities as well as promoting the fight against corruption and crime."
"These are areas we continually monitor and will return to in detail when the Monitoring Report comes out next autumn."
"It is then that we shall evaluate the progress that has been made over the months to come."
"Romania’s new government will have a golden opportunity to demonstrate that it can genuinely fulfil its commitments and reform the country’s society and institutions."
"Mr Davies and Mrs Jäätteenmäki pointed out that the current Member States also have much to do to develop the rule of law."
"One can only agree with this."
"These issues, however, do not fall within the competence of the Commissioner for Enlargement. Rather, it would be better to address these problems via the infringement procedure or present a case using the machinery of the European Court of Human Rights."
"In conclusion, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Moscovici."
"I agree with the view expressed by both him and Mr Szent-Ivány that it is in the interests of both the European Union and Romania that Romania is ready by 2007."
"This in the first instance depends on Romania’s willingness and ability to reform the country and its society."
"The Commission, for its part, will give all the support it can to ensure that Romania strengthens its efforts so as to pre-empt the use of the safeguard clauses referred to just now."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow."
"The next item is questions to the Council (B6-0136/2004)."
"We shall consider a number of questions."
"I should first like to clarify the following: according to our Rules of Procedure, when a Member who is scheduled to ask a question cannot be here, he or she must personally request a replacement to speak on his or her behalf."
"Accordingly, the Bureau cannot accept replacements by third parties, such as political group secretaries-general."
"The requests for replacement by the Members who asked Questions Nos 4 and 7, Mr Aylward and Mr Ryan, are therefore not accepted, and if at the time of the questions concerned those Members are not here, the questions will be deemed to have lapsed."
"Before you answer the first question, Mr Nicolaï, I should in any case like to remind the House what Mr Vidal-Quadras told us this morning – that this sitting must finish today at 6.30 p.m., due to commitments that the Council’s representative cannot postpone."
"Many businesses from the new Member States which import aluminium from Russia and the CIS have appealed to their MEPs for action be taken to drop or reduce the 6% duty, given that the economic situation in this branch of Polish industry has deteriorated significantly as a result, with higher production costs and higher product prices, leading to a fall in the competitiveness of Polish companies in the harsh environment of the European market."
"The option of buying duty-free aluminium from countries which have appropriate agreements with the European Union is unprofitable for small and medium-sized companies."
"Will the Council take urgent action to protect Polish businesses threatened with closure?"
". The Council would refer the honourable Member to the answer it gave to question H-0399/04, by Ryszard Czarnecki, during Question Time on 17 November 2004, in which it suggested that the honourable Member should put his question to the Commission."
"– Mr President, Mr Nicolaï, I should like to inform you that I put my question to the European Commission, but regrettably I did not receive a satisfactory answer."
"With your permission, I should like to make known my dissatisfaction at the alarming muddle that exists with regard to this issue, as well as the bureaucratic hurdles, which may well be intentional."
"It is no easy task to identify exactly which body is competent to take decisions regarding aluminium imports from Russia and the countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Independent States."
"Poland has repeatedly applied to the European Commission for these customs duties to be reduced, yet unfortunately its applications have been rejected without adducing any clear or material reasons."
"This is why, Mr Nicolaï, I am appealing to you and asking you to take action on this issue, so as to help both Polish entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs from other countries."
". This issue, I repeat, is really the exclusive competence of the Commission, so I cannot answer the question."
"On 29 October 2004, the Pyrenées-Mediterranean Euroregion was established, comprising Catalonia, Aragon, the Balearic Islands, Midi-Pyrenées and Languedoc-Roussillon, as an area of inter-regional cooperation on railway infrastructure, aeronautics, logistics, innovation and research, and with the stated intention of opening its doors to new regions."
"The Euroregion does not have, nor will it have, any political content whatever, since this is alien to the very concept of the new legal entity created, whose efforts are directed towards the kind of cooperation described above."
"What role will the European Union acknowledge this Euroregion as having, and more specifically, what involvement will the EU give it in joining up Community policies?"
"What management and monitoring powers will the EU grant it with regard to Community funding already granted and to be granted to the regional promotion and development of the Pyrenées-Mediterranean Euroregion?"
". The Council recalls that Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, laying down general provisions on the structural funds, sets out the Community initiatives as one of the instruments of regional policy within the framework of the structural funds."
"In the current programming period of 2000-2006 there are four Community initiatives."
"One of them is Interreg."
"This covers cross-border transnational and interregional cooperation intended to encourage a harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of the whole of the Community area."
"Interreg III has three sections dealing respectively with cross-border cooperation: the promotion of integrated regional development between bordering regions; cross-national cooperation, contributing to an integrated and harmonious territory across the European Union; and interregional cooperation to improve the policies and techniques of interregional economic development."
"Therefore, the Pyrenees/Mediterranean Euroregion could benefit from the support of this Community initiative, subject to the procedures established by the Commission."
"The Council also recalls that the Commission has proposed the creation of an instrument called 'European groupings of cross-border cooperation'."
"This would be given a legal personality to overcome the obstacles hindering cross-border cooperation."
"This proposal is currently being examined by the preparatory bodies within the Council and also has to be considered by the European Parliament within the framework of the codecision procedure."
"I would like to point out that there are more than a hundred Euroregions in Europe and that, in fact, through the impetus of INTERREG, the Community initiative which is right now going also to become an objective, they are of particular interest."
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether he believes that Euroregions such as the Pyrenees-Mediterranean are fundamental, both in terms of promoting the disappearance of the borders which represent barriers to economic and social development, and in terms of giving substance to the principle of territorial cohesion, which is now enshrined in the European Constitution, which has been signed by the 25 representatives of the Governments of the Member States, and which therefore deserves every possible support from the Union?"
"Mr President, we have, on occasions, received complaints from the European regions that it is the Governments of the States that distribute the Cohesion Funds and also the regional element of the Structural Funds, and on occasions those regions of the same political colour as the Government of the State receive favourable treatment."
"Mr Barnier, then Commissioner responsible for Regional Policy, announced to us an instrument which the regions could access directly without having to go through the Governments of the States."
"I do not know whether the initiative on European cross-border cooperation groupings, which is on the table in the Council and will also come to Parliament, is the instrument Mr Barnier was referring to."
"Would the Council agree that the regions should have the possibility of accessing the funds directly without having to go through the Governments of the States?"
". I tried to be comprehensive in my initial remarks, but I will add that Member States and regional and local authorities have experienced major difficulties in carrying out managing actions of cross-border cooperation, transnational cooperation and interregional cooperation within the framework of differing national laws and procedures."
"That calls for appropriate measures at EU/Community level in order to reduce the difficulties."
"Harmonious development of the entire Community territory and reinforced economic, social and territorial cohesion imply enhanced cross-border cooperation and the adoption of measures to improve the implementation conditions for cross-border cooperation."
"One day after the presidential elections, the USA unilaterally and unexpectedly recognised FYROM as the 'Republic of Macedonia', totally ignoring the European Union and Greece."
"The result of this action is to undermine the dialogue being conducted on the basis of the 'interim agreement', under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General, to find a mutually acceptable name for FYROM."
"Given that the European Union supports the process of dialogue on the basis of the 'interim agreement', what measures will the Council take to ensure the effective continuation of that dialogue to find a mutually acceptable solution to the problem?"
". In reply to the honourable Member the Council stresses that it has not altered its position following the US decision to recognise the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name."
"At the first meeting of the Stabilisation and Association Council between the EU and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of September 2004, the Council noted that the differences over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia persisted and encouraged the search for a mutually acceptable solution, within the framework of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 817/93 and 845/93, by Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"Indeed, in a joint press statement of the EU-Western Balkans Forum of November 2004, the foreign ministers of both the EU and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia recalled the need for all participants to agree on finding mutually acceptable solutions and concluding agreements on outstanding issues with neighbouring countries."
"– Minister, allow me to respond with a supplementary question: does the Council consider that this long-outstanding issue of the name might create problems in the desirable further of this country towards the European institutions?"
"What further action does the Council intend to take in order to persuade the government of the FYROM to maintain during talks in New York a more constructive stand in the negotiations to find a mutually acceptable solution?"
". That is more or less another question and I have nothing to add to what I have just said."
"As the author is not present, Question No 4 lapses."
"Could the Council indicate what efforts the European Union will make in the coming months to lobby the American Administration so that it complies fully with the political obligations of the Kyoto Protocol?"
"Can the Council indicate clearly what international efforts will be undertaken by the European Union to ensure that all countries in the world comply with the clear and unequivocal commitments of the Kyoto Protocol?"
"If the European Union is to become more competitive, access to new technologies must be available to all communities in Europe."
"The European Union is committed to implementing what is called the IDABC Programme, which is designed to promote the use of the Internet in public and government services."
"This is part of the pan-European eGovernment Services Initiative."
"Can the European Council indicate what progress has been made in implementing this programme, which is such a central component to improving the availability of information technologies in Europe?"
". The Council would like to inform the honourable Member that the implementation of the IDABC Programme falls within the remit of the Commission, which is assisted in this by the pan-European eGovernment Services Committee."
"The Council would also like to remind the honourable Member that the IDABC Programme decision will only enter into force on 1 January 2005 and thus the implementation of the programme as such has not yet started."
"The Council invites the honourable Member to refer this matter to the Commission for more details regarding the preparation of the programme."
"The Council is aware of two studies launched by the Commission under the IDA Programme."
"One study aims to establish the needs and benefits to businesses and citizens of pan-European eGovernment Services in order to reinforce a properly oriented approach to the delivery of a pan-European service."
"The second one aims to identify future infrastructure services needed to support the pan-European eGovernment Services."
"Likewise, in the preparation of the IDABC Programme, the Council also acknowledges the organisation of by Commission of a conference due to take place in Brussels on 17 and 18 February 2005, which will focus on the requirements for pan-European eGovernment Services for citizens and businesses and on the factors needed to implement them."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his response."
"The reason I put the question to him was because when this was originally discussed as a programme, it came from the Council, and the Netherlands Government was one of the governments, together with the Irish Government, the Luxembourg Government and the Italian Government, which were putting it forward as a proposal that should be pushed at Commission level."
"Following on from what you have said and what you know that the Commission is undertaking, are there any particular initiatives that the presidency wants to see carried forward from its presidency to the Luxembourg presidency to ensure that the role of this programme is fully implemented?"
". Apart from these major actions, the IDA Unit is preparing to launch the programme fully during the first half of 2005."
"To that end, anticipated activities are being analysed and formats for work programme entries, project implementation plans, etc. are being developed."
"Can the European Council indicate what measures have been taken to improve maritime safety and security in Europe since the Erika disaster, and can it clearly indicate what measures it is seeking to implement so as to improve maritime safety and security in the next few years?"
". As the Council has repeatedly said, safety and security lie at the heart of the European Union maritime policy."
"Measures to improve them, as well as to protect the marine environment, represent the bulk of legislation adopted in this area in the five years since the disaster."
"In its response to this and other similar incidents, the Council has consistently supported a dual approach: on the one hand, incorporating the provisions of international conventions into Community law and thus ensuring stricter compliance with the highest global standards and, on the other hand, adopting specific Community provisions wherever IMO standards are lacking or insufficient."
"In this way a comprehensive body of maritime safety legislation has been built up and is continuing to expand."
"Amongst the specific measures adopted in the intermediate aftermath of the disaster, were firstly those under the Erika I package aimed at enhanced port state control to combat substandard shipping; stricter monitoring of the classification companies use to conduct safety checks on ships; and the accelerated phasing-out of single-hull oil tankers."
"Secondly, there were those under the Erika II package aimed at the establishment of a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system and the creation of a European Maritime Safety Agency whose main role is to monitor the effectiveness of the EU maritime safety rules in general."
"Other measures include those designed to improve the safety of ships other than oil tankers, such as passenger vessels, to ensure a minimum level of seafarers' training and to reduce pollution from ships."
"For improving security in the wake of a number of terrorist outrages, a regulation on enhancing ship and port facilities security was adopted earlier this year, incorporating the SOLAS ISPS measures into EU legislation and expanding them to include domestic traffic."
"Currently under consideration by the Council are measures to implement the IMO International Safety Management Code within the Community, so penalties can be imposed for certain pollution offences and port security enhanced."
"Finally, looking ahead, a new package of maritime safety measures is expected to be submitted for examination by the Council in spring 2005."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"Could he give assurances therefore that in the future, depending on the financial perspectives, there will be provision for maritime safety measures from the Union in the coming years?"
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the proposal for a directive to impose sanctions for marine pollution remained pending during the Dutch Presidency because certain countries expressed disagreement, including Greece."
"I am aware of the fact that Greece proposed certain amendments in order to accept this directive."
"Can the Council describe to us the content of these amendments which were tabled by the Greek Government?"
". The last question was a more or less new question."
"This first question is also on another issue."
"We will be having many discussions on the financial perspectives and this is one of the many issues we will discuss."
"As you know, the Council has not decided anything on the new financial perspectives."
"We have only taken an overview of the so-called building blocks and these building blocks reflect the different positions of the Member States to the Commission's proposals."
"As the author is not present, Question No 7 lapses."
"Can the Council indicate what funds have been disbursed by the European Union with a view to halting the cultivation of drugs in Afghanistan for the year 2004 and what funds the European Council envisages that it will disburse in this specific policy area over the next two years?"
"Following the adoption by the Council of the Regulation on Administrative and Legal Cooperation for Consumer Protection, does the Council have any plans to coordinate progress on Member State cooperation on stamping out cross-border fraud and rogue traders operating dishonest prize draws, misleading marketing and similar cross-border crime?"
". Mr President, the adoption of the regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws – the so-called Regulation on Consumer Protection Cooperation – does not, as such, have any bearing on law enforcement cooperation between Member States."
"Member States' police and judicial authorities are already actively cooperating in the fight against all types of crime."
"The Council has adopted various instruments on cross-border cooperation in the fight against crime, notably in the context of mutual recognition and enforcement."
"These instruments, in principle, have a general scope and are not limited to specific types of crime."
"That answer illustrates why I asked the question."
"This kind of crime affects citizens from across the European Union; it is an accelerating form of crime."
"Members in this House will know of people who have been scammed, very often vulnerable European citizens – the elderly, for instance."
"Will the presidency recognise that there are certain forms of crime which are naturally cross-border issues?"
"For example, I represent London, where much of this crime takes place, but people are being scammed across the EU."
"I should like to ask the Council to take seriously a form of crime that is not being dealt with across borders."
"There is too little cooperation between Member States on this kind of growing crime and we know that our European citizens expect us, as parliamentarians, to question you on how effective you can be in solving this kind of cross-border issue."
"I want to reinforce the points just made by my colleague."
"As an MEP I receive many letters from concerned constituents who have been defrauded by people operating in other Member States of the European Union, particularly through fraud through fax machines, sending false contracts and falsely announcing prize-draw winners."
"A lot of these are based in Luxembourg, which will hold the next presidency of the EU."
"Frankly it brings the EU into disrepute when we are told that there is nothing that can be done about this situation."
"If citizens are to gain any advantage from EU cooperation, it should be precisely in tackling these sorts of problems."
". We understand the problem and I take note of your remarks."
"Unfortunately I have nothing to add to what I said before."
"In Darfur, hundreds of people are dying each day from hunger, disease and continued violence, which shows no signs of abating."
"70 000 people have already lost their lives and hundreds of thousands of lives are still at risk."
"Innocent civilians continue to be attacked and the number of displaced people is growing as people flee the violence."
"The civilians live in constant fear of attack and rely on humanitarian assistance for food, water and means of survival."
"The ongoing violence and insecurity is seriously hampering the humanitarian effort, preventing access to many areas, thus augmenting the suffering and further risking the lives of these innocent people."
"In light of the seriousness of this situation, what is being done by the Council to ensure that this crisis is placed and remains high on the agenda of the EU?"
"What is the Council doing to ensure that the Sudanese Government is heeding international law and the agreements signed with UN agencies?"
". From its outset, at the beginning of the year, the Darfur crisis has been one of the absolute priorities on the EU agenda."
"Throughout the year the European Union has been at the forefront of international efforts to contain and resolve the conflict in Darfur, to stop the massive human rights violations taking place there and to prevent an already very serious humanitarian situation from deteriorating further."
"Member States and the Community have contributed to the humanitarian relief efforts with more than EUR 325 million."
"The Union has also strongly supported the African Union's leading role in addressing the crisis."
"The EU has thus played a key role in support of an AU-led ceasefire monitoring mission and is now actively supporting the deployment of the expanded mission."
"Almost 60 per cent of the total cost of the expanded AU mission is financed by a contribution of some EUR 80 million from the peace facility, and several Member States are providing additional financial and logistical support for the mission as well as planners and military observers."
"The Council has repeatedly, most recently on the occasion of its meeting on 22 November, confirmed its readiness to continue to provide support for the deployment of the mission in terms of financing, logistics and material, as well as personnel if requested."
"The Council considers that the deployment of the expanded AU mission in Darfur, together with the EU-led negotiations between the parties to find a political solution for Darfur, offers an opportunity for a comprehensive solution to the Darfur conflict."
"In parallel to these efforts, the EU has contributed to the pressure from the international community on all parties to guarantee free and unconditional access for humanitarian aid and to ensure the security of the civilian population."
"The Council is closely monitoring compliance by all parties with the demands expressed by the EU and the rest of the international community and the commitments it has undertaken with the UN."
"To this end, the EU collaborates closely with the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for the Sudan and actively takes part in the work of the Joint Implementation Mechanism that evaluates the implementation of the joint communiqué which consists of the commitments of both the Sudanese Government and the United Nations."
"In line with Resolutions 1556 and 1564 of the UN Security Council, the Council has also on several occasions reiterated its willingness to take appropriate measures, including sanctions, if no progress is achieved on the commitments made by the Sudanese Government."
"Mr President, I thank you for your outline of the situation in the Sudan."
"Just today we have had news from the relief agencies operating out of Ireland that the situation is worse, not better."
"I should like to ask you to indicate when we might actually implement sanctions, as opposed to just threatening them."
"Over half a million people are now in dire circumstances in the Sudan."
"It may have gone from the headlines, but the problem is still there."
". I agree."
"As you may know, last Monday the Council also discussed the situation in Sudan and we are seriously concerned about the deterioration of the security and humanitarian situation in Darfur."
"The Council therefore called on all parties to abide in full by their commitments."
"We also encouraged them to conclude the negotiations between the Government of Sudan and the SPLMA before the end of the year."
"The Council will continue to monitor the situation in Darfur and will consider taking appropriate measures, which could include sanctions in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1565 if no tangible progress is achieved in this respect."
"Hence the situation is and remains high on the agenda of the European Union."
"A tragic event recently took place in Sweden when a truck-driver who had just left the ferry in Trelleborg severely under the influence of alcohol drove against the flow of traffic and five people in two oncoming vehicles were killed."
"Different approaches to alcohol and different blood-alcohol level limits in different European countries make it more difficult to deal with drink-drivers and to prosecute them, especially in the case of cross-border traffic."
"In 2001, on a proposal from the Commission, the Council decided to recommend that all Member States introduce a maximum blood-alcohol level of 0.2 promille for professional drivers."
"The recommendation was adopted instead of a directive on a common upper limit for drivers."
"Which countries have introduced that upper limit to date?"
"Is the Council of Ministers re-evaluating its recommendation and what is the outcome of the follow-up at Community level provided for in that recommendation?"
". The Council would like to point out that, from a general point of view, in the conclusions that the Council adopted after its meetings of 4 and 5 April 2001 on a recommendation from the European Commission on the maximum permitted blood-alcohol content for drivers of motorised vehicles, the Council encouraged the Commission to monitor closely and evaluate the effects of its recommendation for a period of three years, paying specific attention to the proposals in the recommendation on legal blood-alcohol content and, if appropriate, submit new legislation in that respect."
"Up until now, the Council has not been informed of the outcome of such an evaluation."
"That being so, the Council underlines that these conclusions do not call specifically for the introduction of a maximum permitted blood-alcohol content of 0.2 mg for professional drivers."
"Furthermore, the Council would like to inform the honourable Member that it does not have any information on how many Member States have introduced the aforementioned BAC levels so far."
"However, the Council would like to draw the honourable Member's attention to the Commission recommendation of 6 April 2004 on enforcement in the field of road safety, which, in Recommendation 6, calls for an intensified application of random breath testing with an alcohol screening device as a leading principle for surveillance of drink driving."
"The Council wants to ensure the honourable Member of its strong and ongoing commitment to improving road safety and to tackling all potential sources of road accident fatalities."
"In this context it refers to the Council conclusions on road safety from June and December last year, both of which explicitly refer to stricter enforcement, in particular seatbelt use, speeding and drink driving."
"In the light of this ongoing commitment the Council had an exchange of views during its meeting on 9 and 10 December 2004 and adopted the Council conclusions on road safety, in which it agreed on the need to focus road safety policies in four important areas, namely enforcement and best practices, vehicle safety, improving safety on European roads and funding road safety."
"In this context the Council underlined that, with regard to road safety enforcement, priority should be given, notably, to driver behaviour that causes high accident risks or could have severe consequences such as driving under the influence of alcohol."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the Council for its answer, but I am clearly unhappy to hear that the issue is falling into a black hole between the Commission and the Council."
"There is every opportunity in this case for the Council to take the initiative."
"We know that approximately 10 000 people die on the roads each year because of driving under the influence of alcohol."
"We also know that commercial driving is an important area when it comes to getting to grips with drink-driving."
"That is why this recommendation is important, and I see no reasons why the Member States should not take these initiatives."
"The conclusions also include a paragraph about follow-up, which would permit further discussions about enabling alcohol screening devices to be introduced into cars."
"This is a technical invention with which industry too works. I should like to hear whether discussions are being conducted in the Council about the possibility of introducing alcohol screening devices into vehicles."
". I am sorry my answer did not satisfy the honourable Member."
"I thought I had explained the many actions and things we, as a Council, have done to show our commitment to this issue."
"We have to put our formal position into effect, as well as the formal position of the Council towards individual Member States."
"As I tried to explain before, the matter is now in the hands of the Commission and we await its evaluation and proposals."
"The EU's aspiration to transform itself into the most competitive economy in the world (Lisbon Agenda) calls for a significant increase in funding for European research policy."
"Research spending is strategic for the EU in the sense that it constitutes investment in its survival in a fiercely competitive international environment."
"However, the declared intention of developing an ambitious European research policy is difficult to reconcile with the restrictions imposed by the Stability and Development Pact (SDP), which prohibits Member States' public expenditure from overshooting a budget deficit of 3% of GDP."
"If the Member States are to have an incentive to set aside 1% of GDP for public funding of research policy, that percentage should not be included in calculating the ceiling of 3% of GDP laid down by the SDP."
"Does the Council agree that public spending on research constitutes top priority strategic expenditure for the EU and, as such, can justifiably be excluded from the criteria under the Pact?"
"The argument that such a decision will pave the way for a host of other exceptions (e.g. military spending) is not tenable since the strengthening of research is an established European strategic goal which has no analogy with any other national or European objectives"
". The Council notes that increasing overall expenditure on research is indeed a central element in the Lisbon strategy and one of the keys to making the EU more competitive in the global economy."
"The Council and Member States have repeatedly committed themselves to achieving average research and development expenditure of 3% of GDP by 2010."
"The recent Kok report once again highlighted the need to make good the under-performance in relation to this target."
"Notwithstanding this general statement, the Council does not share the honourable Member's view that it is the Stability and Growth Pact which is preventing Member States from achieving the Lisbon objective."
"Perhaps more fundamentally, the Stability and Growth Pact should be used as a tool to encourage national expenditure on individual budget components over and above others."
"Firstly, it is clearly possible to fund research while respecting the Pact."
"This is a very important point that leads on to the second point that the Pact is not the factor limiting investment in research."
"Research funding is rather a matter of national priorities."
"Thirdly, I would note that the level of R[amp]D expenditure is not solely dependent on public finance."
"The target covers privately-funded R[amp]D as well, which can be encouraged by a number of means in addition to public expenditure."
"The key to reaching the 3% target is the two thirds of R[amp]D spending that should be privately funded, not the one third that should come from public funds."
"Finally, I would like to recall that the Pact is a framework for the management of budgetary policies at global level, with a view to ensuring the sustainability of public finances over the longer term."
"All expenditure has to be paid for, even if in the longer run we would hope that investment would have positive returns."
"When the Ecofin Council discussed the Pact on 16 November 2004 and this precise issue was raised, there was a broad majority of Member States against pursing the possibility suggested by the Member and excluding certain categories of expenditure from deficit calculations."
"In the analytical assessment of the reasons for an excessive deficit, the Council will always take into account the type of expenditure and the likely long-term impact."
"But the Council does not share the honourable Member's assessment regarding the exclusion of R[amp]D expenditure from deficit calculations."
"– Mr President, I might have agreed with everything Mr Nicolaï said if I did not believe that we cannot achieve the Lisbon objectives unless research makes a great deal of progress."
"Thus, if the reply concerned any other subject, I would agree with you."
"However, I regret that I must disagree because research is the cornerstone of Lisbon."
". Only two EU Member States have already reached the Lisbon goal of 3% of GDP spent on R[amp]D – Finland and Sweden."
"They have achieved this by running budgetary surpluses."
"It is clearly possible to fund research while respecting the Pact."
"That is an important point."
"Second, even Germany and France with their well-known budgetary problems have already achieved rates of 2.5% and 2.2% respectively."
"Again, it appears that the Pact is not the factor limiting investment in research."
"It would appear to be a matter of national priorities."
"That brings us to the end of Question Time. We are also coming the end of the Dutch Presidency."
"I believe that this is the last time that you will be with us for questions to the Council, Mr Nikolaï, and I should like to offer you my best wishes and thanks for your work with Parliament during your Presidency. I wish you every success at the end of this period, particularly during the next few days, which, I have no doubt, will be extremely demanding."
"Questions Nos 12 to 31 will be answered in writing."
"Firstly, I must inform you that, following the invitations for the presentation of the candidatures for the post of European Ombudsman, the deadline for which was 30 September of this year, four candidatures have been presented, of which two will be put forward, namely, those of Mr Nikiforos Diamandouros and Mr Giuseppe Fortunato."
"The candidates appeared before the competent committee on 29 November and the election will take place on 11 January next year, according to the procedure laid down in our Rules of Procedure."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr McMillan-Scott on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 976/1999 laying down the requirements for the implementation of Community operations, other than those of development cooperation,which, within the framework of Community cooperation policy, contribute to the general objective of developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law and to that of respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms in third countries."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at my hearing before the European Parliament some weeks ago, I spoke out in favour of developing the closest possible working relations between the Commission and the European Parliament on human rights and democratisation."
"I would like to renew this voluntary commitment wholeheartedly today."
"The European Parliament is an extremely important partner for the Commission in this area of work, and so I am keen to follow in the footsteps of my predecessor, Mr Patten, in pursuing a comprehensive and regular dialogue with you on shared issues and concerns."
"The purpose of today's decision is to safeguard the legal basis for the continued existence of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights beyond the end of the year."
"This necessitates what I hope will be Parliament's positive vote on the Commission's longstanding proposal to extend Regulation (EC) No 976/1999 for a further two years."
"There are just two weeks to go before the Regulation expires, creating the risk that no funding will be available for projects and programmes under the European Initiative in the coming year."
"It will only be possible for the Council to adopt a positive decision before the Regulation expires if the European Parliament votes in favour of the draft resolution proposed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs today."
"In my view, this is in everyone's enlightened interest; it is also in the political interests of the three institutions involved in the legislative process, and, above all, it is in the practical interests of those whom the projects supported by the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights are intended to benefit, namely civil societies and citizens in numerous countries around the world."
"The European Initiative is a well-functioning instrument: this is borne out by the statistics on the use of its budget funds as well as by almost all the human rights organisations which pay tribute to the Initiative and its valuable work."
"The Initiative supports numerous innovative and relevant projects, such as the abolition of the death penalty, torture prevention and rehabilitation of torture victims, the advancement of the rights of women – an issue which is especially dear to me – as well as campaigning for the rights and interests of children, indigenous people and other marginalised groups, and strengthening international law."
"This focuses, for example, on the International Criminal Court."
"It also aims to foster freedom of expression and promote democratic development through election observation missions."
"I believe that the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights is a vibrant expression of our shared values and, above all, the European Union's identity in the world."
"I agree with the House, Mr President, that the Initiative must be effective and well-managed."
"The Commission will therefore scrutinise with attention and interest all the proposals put forward by this House which aim to achieve greater efficiency, the simplification of procedures and the effective use of resources."
"To this end, let me give you my assurances that a meaningful, open and, above all, regular dialogue will take place between Parliament and the Commission."
"I believe that this dialogue will offer us the opportunity for joint discussion of the political and objective priorities of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights."
"After all, Parliament's and the Commission's priorities are largely identical; they include, for example, the need to support the European Union's Neighbourhood Policy via the Initiative or to reinforce democratic development in a number of countries."
"It is therefore important, in my view – and this applies both to my own and the working level – for us to focus on the same priorities, examine the needs arising in our Neighbourhood Policy together, and set the best possible priorities on a joint basis."
"As parliamentarians, you have acquired particular expertise which I would like to draw on."
"Your support for the democracy movement in Ukraine or the forthcoming EU Election Observer Mission to Palestine, the West Bank and Gaza are eloquent examples, and all I can say is that I believe we will work well together here."
"Let me conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by expressing my hope that Parliament and the Commission will agree on the modalities for this further dialogue as swiftly as possible in order to develop genuinely fruitful cooperation in this field in everyone's interest."
"I look forward to our positive cooperation, and I gladly put my services at your disposal."
". Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for her opening remarks."
"I am very pleased to see in the Chamber Mrs Morgantini, the chairman of the Committee on Development, Mrs Flautre, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, the shadow rapporteur and my co-rapporteur on the Committee on Development, Mr Fernández Martín."
"There were two regulations, one of which has already been adopted by this House."
"The one we are dealing with now is that covering third countries."
"Twelve years ago I was rapporteur and, as Mr Patten has described me, 'father' of the European initiative for democracy and human rights, which proved to be instrumental in helping the transitional ex-Soviet bloc countries."
"It was considered by many as the European Union's flagship scheme for democracy promotion."
"It gave meaning to the preamble to the Maastricht Treaty concerning the EU's foreign policy priorities."
"In its initial phase it was administered by a small foundation based in Brussels, with both the European Parliament and the Commission playing an active role in the allocation and supervision of projects."
"At its height in 1997, the initiative was financing and administering around 1 200 projects."
"In 1999 I visited some of them in Belgrade, including key pro-democracy media, such as Radio B92."
"The same year the initiative was taken in-house by the Commission."
"I have been concerned for a long time that the initiative has become bureaucratic and safe and that the European Parliament, as the only democratically elected institution, should once again play a greater role."
"Although the initiative currently has a budget of some EUR 137 million, it lacks visibility and effectiveness."
"I am all the more convinced of this following meetings on the ground and discussions with more than 30 organisations."
"Most recently, I spoke to the Association of Belarusian Journalists – currently here to receive the Sakharov Prize – as well as the Eurasia Director of a US pro-democracy agency."
"They were not even aware of the existence of the European democracy initiative."
"This is a very valuable programme and one that needs to be made more effective."
"An important point to make is that unlike routine EU assistance, the European initiative does not require the host government's consent."
"In a country such as Belarus, not to speak of Tunisia or Iran, in which operating through government channels is difficult and often impossible, this cannot be underestimated."
"In a paper on the EU security strategy in 2003, Javier Solana outlined the importance and sensitivity of Europe's new neighbourhood."
"The resulting policy invites our neighbours to the east and south to share in the peace, stability and prosperity that we enjoy in the European Union."
"It aims to create a 'ring of friends' around the borders of the new enlarged European Union."
"Sadly, the only visibility of the EU's democracy activities in the new neighbourhood seems to be short observation missions by Members of the European Parliament, such as those undertaken recently in Ukraine."
"I believe that all significant elections in the new neighbourhood should be the subject of full EU observation missions."
"There is a feeling in Brussels that democracy cannot be exported and that change must come from within."
"However, the United States National Endowment for Democracy has shown since 1982 that the two can be combined."
"It operates as an independent expert agency, using NGOs on the ground, and is much respected for its programmes and methodology."
"As well as the United States activities, the Westminster Foundation, for example, or the German and other NGOs have higher visibility and much less bureaucracy than the European initiative."
"I recently put together a document detailing the European Parliament's pro-democracy activities, both within the EU and externally."
"As Members, we participate in a myriad of interparliamentary delegations, consultation committees and informal groups."
"Valuable work is being done, but the work is fragmented."
"The same can be said about the European initiative."
"To my mind, our involvement should be coordinated in a democracy centre, based in this House, mandated to act as a research unit, an oversight body on all the EU's pro-democracy activities."
"To take an example, the website of the State Department's Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor boasts that the United States has overseen the transition of 87 countries to democratic states."
"Is this a statistic that the EU wishes to leave in the hands of the United States alone?"
"Last weekend's G8 Conference in Rabat – and I am delighted that the Commissioner was present – co-financed by the European Union, further developed plans for the Forum for the Future, first introduced at the Sea Island Summit in June 2004, to promote democracy in the Middle East and North Africa."
"Despite the financial contribution of the European Union to such an important event, it is the Americans rather than the European Union who are leading this activity."
"We recognise that the United States programme essentially echoes the principles of the Barcelona process and now the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"In 2005, the United Kingdom will take over the presidency of both the G8 and the European Union."
"I sincerely hope that there will be a greater focus on the 250 million Arabs who want democracy, as illustrated by the 2002 United Nations Development Report, as well as the manifestly failing countries to our east."
"Lastly, while I do not propose that the European Parliament should reject the regulation or the associated budget lines for any longer than strictly necessary, I find the response from the Commission – the letter from the Commissioner relating to the new arrangements on this programme, which does not reference working level contacts – and the Council – which is still using a working party consisting of development ministers – to the concerns I and others expressed about the democracy initiative to be lacking in substance and completely unfitted to the needs of our time and the needs of millions of unfree people on our doorstep."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to welcome you on the occasion of your first speech in a debate on human rights."
"You will always be welcome."
"Mr McMillan-Scott has gone over this Regulation, a regulation that clearly demonstrates all our virtues – our many virtues – and also many of our problems."
"It is a modest regulation in terms of its budget, but very ambitious in terms of its objectives; we all agree on the need to approve it but, nevertheless, we have spent a year and a half – perhaps much more – dealing with procedural and bureaucratic issues which have nothing to do with the fundamental issue, which is to approve it on time and properly so that the Commission may have an instrument allowing it to maintain the Regulation."
"It has been a very complex process."
"At the end of the last term in office we approved a regulation similar to this, by means of co-decision, relating to third countries."
"And now we are approaching the entry into force of the necessary extension, which begins on 1 January and ends at the end of 2006."
"The Commission and the Council are well aware that this regulation is highly valued by Parliament."
"I would point out that the budget line that provides for its funding – as Mr McMillan-Scott has just said – under the heading ‘European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights’, was created on the initiative of this Parliament – many of us who were present at that time are still here – and the Commission points out in its explanatory statement the full validity and the proper application endorsed by the impact assessment, which stresses the positive results concerning the development of the capacity of the NGOs specialising in human rights and concerning civil society organisations."
"The rapporteur has considered it appropriate to restrict himself to producing a report that expresses support for the Commission’s proposal, modified by the Council with the clarifications and explanations it has thought it appropriate to include, but I would point out that a Regulation, with the same content and an identical purpose, for which I myself was rapporteur, was approved at first reading by means of co-decision and that we in the Committee on Development were entirely flexible and raised certain reasonable and simple issues so that it could be approved at the end of the last term in office."
"What we have reiterated now in the amendments that in the end have not been voted for are very simple things which at that time we found it difficult to make understood."
"Parliament wishes to be informed and to know the results and the progress of the application of this project and wants these programmes to provide funding, as the Commissioner has pointed out, for peace missions and missions of electoral observers."
"Furthermore, it would like the Commission to present, on an annual basis or at intervals it considers appropriate, an analysis of the progress and results of the application of this project."
"I suspect that the agreement reached at the end of the last term in office by means of co-decision, with the Committee on Development responsible for the main report, has been modified unilaterally."
"I hope that this will now be corrected, on the basis of the application of the Regulation, which provides the Commission with the funds necessary for the application of an effective instrument, as this one is, for promoting democracy and human rights."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, promoting democracy and human rights in the world should be one of the priorities of the EU’s external relations."
"We feel empowered by our own, widely-held understanding of the concept of the human race and of every human being, and also by the knowledge that the democratic world is also a freer world, a world that can be fairer, a world capable of building justice in freedom and, consequently, a more peaceful and safer world."
"By firmly committing ourselves to the European initiative on democracy and human rights, we are promoting democracy, peace, the human race and security, all at the same time."
"We must never lose sight of this, as we fine-tune the instruments that we establish and as we administer the resources that we allocate directly to this action area."
"After a number of years’ experience, I should like to make some observations."
"Firstly, Parliament should be more involved in programmes specifically developed and supported in this field."
"The amendments that have been proposed to the regulation will address this question sufficiently, provided, of course, the Commission accepts them in the right spirit and makes a broad and extensive interpretation of the new guidelines, thereby taking relations with Parliament to a more open and closer level."
"This is what we are calling for."
"It is also necessary, however, to express our opinion on other issues that concern us more."
"Firstly, are we going to dilute these instruments into more and more areas, more lines and more themes, or are we first going to set out a clear strategy, and then concentrate on a guideline that drives us forward and on fundamental priorities?"
"I believe that the latter is the right way."
"The concept of human rights is increasingly broad and also sometimes more vague. There is also the temptation to use those instruments for anything and everything."
"This to my mind would be the wrong way; it would reduce the effectiveness of what we do and lead to a waste of scant resources, or to the duplication of instruments."
"There are many other instruments for policies on cooperation and development with third countries, but these instruments of the European initiative for democracy and human rights are highly political and should be focused primarily on promoting democracy and that fundamental nucleus of civic and political rights, freedom of conscience and religion, freedom of expression and debate, the separation of powers and the rule of law, freedom of organisation and activity of political parties and civil society, the opportunity to hold free and fair elections and the vitality of open and plural societies."
"We must also be capable, however, of setting out priorities as regards the regions of the world or countries with particular strategic impact on the actions that we support, for various reasons: firstly, because the country concerned is our immediate neighbour and therefore our most immediate security is at stake; secondly, because these are situations that can have a positive snowball effect at local level, in terms of establishing democracy and stability; thirdly, because in those areas of the world with particularly knotty problems we can find the weak spot that can be unravelled into democratic transformation; fourthly, because there are special historical links and cultural ties that bring us together; and fifthly, because our help can make all the difference in the short term and can have an instantly positive impact."
"To conclude, we must also ask ourselves if we are going to take the path of increasing bureaucracy and officialdom in carrying out these policies, or will we be able to make those instruments more agile?"
"This, more than anything, is what I ask of the Commission; that it be capable of taking risks and that it set out the most adventurous, most daring and most incisive lines of action."
"Bureaucracy and officialdom would lead to those instruments being totally unused for one simple and intuitive reason."
"We cannot rely on dictators to encourage and promote democracy in their countries."
"We must therefore be more agile and must know how to take our help to exactly where it is needed, exactly where it is lacking and exactly where it will make a difference."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome the Commissioner on behalf of our group."
"Let me come straight to the point."
"This evening Parliament is being asked to approve the extension of the specific human rights and democracy programme for two years."
"Our group has no objection in principle."
"During the recent months of dialogue with the Commission, however, we have placed some political conditions on our assent: that is to say, we want a clear signal from the Commission that you represent to commit to a structured dialogue with Parliament."
"It is not a question of our claiming management responsibilities that do not fall within this Parliament’s remit, but rather of claiming the power to carry out a political evaluation of this measure and, more generally, of all initiatives relating to the development of democracy and action on human rights."
"We ask to be able to carry out an evaluation of the priorities of the initiatives and an evaluation of their quality and the degree to which they have succeeded in advancing democracy in real terms."
"In other words, Commissioner, this Parliament is asking to be involved in defining the guidelines for our actions and in judging the effectiveness of the results we obtain."
"In recent years, many questions have remained unanswered and a great deal of information either has not arrived or has been supplied in a highly summarised form."
"We do not know the extent of the funds actually spent through this programme, which projects have been concluded, where they were carried out or with what concrete results – because in some countries the funds have been frozen – or indeed what is being done to unfreeze the funds."
"We do not want to break the sacred rules of comitology, but it is a question of finding a for a relationship that is not just based on a verbal expression of good will."
"Commissioner, we appreciate your offer of collaboration, and our willingness to extend the life of this programme should be interpreted as an act of trust."
"It is important to make it clear that Parliament must not be regarded, as it often is, as a notary who is called in to formally approve the accounts but who has to confine himself to that alone."
"That is not in the interests either of Parliament or of the Community institutions."
"In this regard, we believe that this programme should be streamlined and speeded up as much as possible. Greater responsibilities should be given to local non-governmental organisations on the ground, and more emphasis should be placed on microprojects and on certain campaigns that in the past have made some headway in the difficult area of democracy in some countries."
"We have to work a little harder on democracy, as we have neglected it up to now while focusing our operations on the area of human rights."
"Naturally, it is also necessary to develop a capacity for dialogue, for which, Commissioner, Parliament will place our trust in you and give you our vote."
"We hope, however, that from tomorrow this will become a daily dialogue – not just a formality but a dialogue of substance – to assess the decisions that have been made and to define the objectives that we set ourselves."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps we should start with the very timely question posed quite rightly by Mr Fava regarding the dialogue between our institutions."
"It is a recurring theme, which by the way makes this late sitting at this late season of the year worthwhile."
"On this subject, Commissioner, we have heard you say and we have read – and you also said in your hearing – that you wanted to maintain a dialogue that people can describe as they see fit, but which I in any case understood to be regular, relevant, open and prolonged, or, in short, structured."
"This proposal, the offer of dialogue, is clearly one that Parliament will jump at, because, as you know, the Members of this House are eager to have the opportunity to engage in in-depth discussions about the direction and ongoing monitoring of this initiative and to receive information about programming."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the ball is in our court and I am sure that the Commission would be delighted to see a proposal emanate from our ranks, from our committees and groups, in short from our Parliament, so that this dialogue can get underway very quickly, because it is urgently needed, with a group of Members who are well-motivated and have some expertise on this issue, and there is no shortage of such people in this institution."
"Let us return to the initiative."
"I think that we need to reiterate the extent to which it brings added value to all of the actions that the European Union might undertake on democracy and human rights."
"It has perhaps not been said often enough that it is the only means at our disposal to support, against the will of governments that are often autocratic or dictatorial, civil society, activists and NGOs working in conditions that are often extremely complicated."
"It is the only instrument that enables us to act in this way, and it is extremely precious."
"In addition, I would add that the aid that is given to NGOs in this way is perceived on the ground as being neutral, that is to say that the European Union is not providing these grants in a bid to dominate or take over and is not perceived as doing so, contrary to the claims made when American agencies work on the ground, with such claims very often heard in Maghreb, in any case."
"It is a very precious asset, made possible by the quality of the European Union’s intervention."
"Of course there is still room for improvement."
"One of the issues, and we all know of many examples, is that some NGOs cannot, for one reason or another, be supported under this initiative."
"The governments of third countries which do not wish to see democratic movements develop in their midst are not lacking in resources or imagination."
"We have cases of legal NGOs being granted support under the initiative and then being quite simply banned from receiving the grant by a political decree or by direct censure."
"All of the decisions have been taken, but these NGOs are prevented from benefiting from the funds granted to them."
"We have other examples of associations which quite simply do not legally exist."
"In such cases we have to resort to subterfuge, and we therefore need the ability to be flexible and find ingenious solutions on the ground to achieve our goals."
"I should like to conclude by saying that this debate would serve no purpose if we were not already thinking beyond 2007."
"And there, as other Members have rightly done, I would draw attention to the fact that we will need to work within this Parliament to ensure that this precious asset, that we can always improve, is able to endure beyond 2006."
"That is what is at stake in the debates that we are going to have to hold at various different levels within this Parliament."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to welcome the Commissioner and I particularly appreciate the fact that she is a woman."
"I fully agree with the need to extend the implementing arrangements relating to human rights, development and democracy."
"I congratulate Mr McMillan-Scott and I especially share the opinion of Mr Fernández Martín – in line with the vote I cast in committee – particularly on the amendment specifically calling on the Commission to produce an annual report setting out the programming and to report back to Parliament on the implementation."
"I have, however, in the words of Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, seized upon the Commission’s willingness to collaborate and also to hold a serious and in-depth dialogue not only on the general guidelines but also on project execution."
"I truly hope, amongst other things, that this dialogue will also take place directly with the Committee on Development, which I chair, since the issues of human rights, the empowerment of women and democracy are in fact closely linked to the question of development."
"I should like to say to my very likeable fellow Member Mr McMillan-Scott that I understand his frustration and I agree about this precious project, as Mrs Flautre put it."
"In fact, parents cannot always bear to see their children grow up."
"Quite frankly, I would not want to emulate the United States, because their actions have very often led to the rise of dictatorships – I am thinking of the Pinochet regime, for example."
"I believe the great plan for democratic development in the Middle East has already been repudiated by many in the Middle East because it is seen as an act of power and not as genuine help."
"I should therefore like us to retain our own individual character and also to value the important work that we are doing."
"We do not actually want to export democracy, but we want democracy to grow and to have the ability to grow, and we can provide the tools for that purpose."
"Through visiting conflict zones and seeing the huge number of projects, I have realised that the ability to act without going through the authorities is fundamentally important."
"The questions of torture, training and recovery, as well as the question of the empowerment of women have been extremely important."
"I think we really need to continue along this path, but obviously in the knowledge that there are many limitations and many shortcomings, including in the area of finance."
"I should not like us to confine ourselves to election observation missions, which very often cannot actually be taken very seriously if you consider that they only last one day."
"I should really like us to continue operating along lines whereby our aid and our actions can truly be a tool for helping democracy to grow and not for imposing our values."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to say that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is the right person in the right place."
"This cannot be said of all her colleagues, but that is no fault of hers."
"The European Parliament’s role is becoming ever more important within the EU institutions, and its authority is becoming ever greater amongst the public in the Member States."
"After 25 years as a directly-elected body, Parliament’s importance is now at its height."
"Yet we should not derive satisfaction from the strengthening of Parliament’s role as a result of battles of competence or procedure within the European Union."
"To a greater extent than previously, the European Parliament’s role must be to promote democracy in the world and to provide information on values and standards."
"These values and standards ensure that, although our societies and political systems are not ideal, there are fewer wars and more dialogue on our continent, less violence and more compromise, and less institutional aggression and more international and institutional cooperation."
"This is not a matter of promoting European values."
"It is a matter of informing people about a style of politics based on a search for the common good and on widening participation in government at every level."
"This is the role of both the European Union and the European Parliament today."
"Is EUR 100 million too much to spend on promoting democracy in the world?"
"It is undoubtedly not enough, yet even a sum five times greater would still be much cheaper than going to the expense of repairing the effects of a lack of democracy."
"It would cost a great deal more to provide assistance to the victims of civil and international wars that break out because politicians in many countries do not understand the meaning of democracy."
"They only know it as a notion found in foreign language phrase books."
"If more than EUR 100 million were to be granted, it would of course be necessary to monitor both our own institutions and the organisations receiving the funding."
"In conclusion, I should like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr McMillan-Scott, the rapporteur, for his work."
"I hope the House will continue to work together on this issue, regardless of political divisions, and that it will work towards the goals referred to by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and the rapporteur."
"Mr President, I join with others in welcoming the new Commissioner to this debate."
"We look forward to working with her and, indeed, we look forward to the Commission's plans in 2005 and 2006 on this budget line, the legal base for which we expect to confirm tomorrow."
"I support the fact that this is a budget line that reaches the grassroots and that civil society in the countries has a priority in receiving the monies."
"I also support the fact that the Commission is planning to make conflict prevention a permanent priority for this budget line."
"Surely democracy is the best instrument of conflict prevention in our world."
"I support what the Commission has done in terms of improving the contacts and support from its own delegations in third countries for projects under these lines, and also their plans to extend funding for micro-projects, in particular for local NGOs in third countries who are most valued by us in this Parliament."
"If I have a word of criticism, it is that every year the Commissioner's predecessor used to speak about human rights and then come in with a preliminary draft budget that cut this line – last year from EUR 127 million to EUR 105 million."
"Perhaps the Commissioner will choose not to do that in forthcoming years."
"Indeed, as Mrs Flautre has said, I hope that, whilst there are proper objectives for simplification of the budget, this particular line has symbolic importance and will be maintained in the medium and long term."
"I also draw to her attention the increasing demands from international organisations, like the ad hoc tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the International Criminal Court."
"However, if these are to be funded from this budget line there must be a significant increase or NGOs will fail."
"I oppose the attempt to reduce the priority given to projects worldwide under this budget line and refocus on near Europe."
"That is a mistake: human rights are universal in our world."
"Finally, I express my respect for the rapporteur, Mr McMillan-Scott, and his sincere interest in this budget line; but I am pleased that he withdrew his amendments, which I believe represented micro-management of this budget line."
"The Commission's commitment to structured dialogue, as it put it, is one that we should welcome, and, with my colleagues on Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights, I very much look forward to engaging with the new Commissioner on that."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for this debate."
"Firstly, let me say to the Vice-President, Mr McMillan-Scott, that if he had not already invented this interesting procedure, we would have to invent it now."
"I am absolutely convinced that it is a good thing, for I have always been highly committed to human rights."
"In other words, you can count on the fact that you are dealing with someone who really believes in what they are doing."
"Let me say again that there will be genuine dialogue, not only at my level but also at working level."
"I would like to reiterate this point unequivocally."
"I do not agree that all we have done is observe elections."
"I can cite a host of examples demonstrating that this is not the case."
"We need only think of Ukraine, where a variety of projects is under way."
"Let me cite a few examples to show you that we really cannot view the situation in such narrow terms."
"The Commission is already providing support here: for example, it has given EUR 300 000 to the European Centre for Common Ground, EUR 334 000 to the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights: Improving the Human Rights Situation in Ukraine through Legal Aid Provided by NGOs, EUR 787 000 to the European Roma Rights Center: Defending the rights of Roma in Ukraine, EUR 685 000 to the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, and so on."
"These are just a few of the projects. Let me turn to another region of the world which is very important to you and, indeed, to me, namely the Southern Mediterranean, the Arab region, although this does not only include the Arab countries, it also includes Israel, of course."
"One example is the project entitled Palestine: Democratization from the Grassroots, Media and Networking as a Tool for Community Development, which is important in that it focuses primarily on civil society."
"Let me reiterate: I am particularly pleased – and I think this is a fortunate coincidence – that I was able to present seven action plans recently to the Commission and again here in Parliament on Monday."
"The Commission and the Council have adopted the proposals and everyone spoke about them in very positive terms."
"Why?"
"Because these action plans will enable us to bring our values, namely human rights and everything with which they are associated – namely the rule of law, human rights and democracy – to these countries, such as Ukraine, as soon as free and fair elections have taken place there."
"After that, the implementation begins."
"However, they also focus on a poor yet important country like the Republic of Moldova, where we also need to take action."
"Belarus is a separate case which I will come back to in a moment."
"Then, of course, there are the major countries in the Middle East which are ready for this process, notably Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Palestine and Israel."
"The presentation of these seven action plans at this time offers a really good opportunity, in my view, to work together with and on these countries."
"Naturally, the action plans also offer opportunities for us to present our priorities alongside the countries' own priorities and promote democracy and human rights."
"I would like to outline some of the campaigns which we are carrying out within our human rights programme."
"I admit that they do not amount to a massive sum, but it is still considerable, and I believe that there is a great deal that we can discuss in detail."
"Campaign 1 is entitled 'Promotion, justice and dignity'."
"This targets criminal justice, supports universal abolition of the death penalty, and supports the work of international mechanisms which monitor and report on respect for human rights and related international treaty obligations."
"Campaign 2, which is especially dear to me, is entitled 'Fostering a culture of human rights': human rights education, training, monitoring and awareness-raising by targeting advancement of rights of marginalised or vulnerable groups – that means the rights of women and children – including female genital mutilation, trafficking of women, human rights defenders; torture prevention and rehabilitation of torture victims, programmes of higher education and training for professionals, support for human rights dialogues."
"So, on the whole, it is a very important campaign."
"Campaign 3 is entitled 'Promoting democratic process'."
"This is essential for all these societies, especially for the Middle East or the broader Middle East, which I will come to later."
"So there is a lot of development of participatory democracy, fostering informed pluralistic discourse with civil society, targeting freedom of association, freedom of expression, independent press, broadcasting, unimpeded access to the Internet, and election observation missions."
"Campaign 4 is entitled 'Advancing equality, tolerance and peace', embraces the issues of racial discrimination, xenophobia, rights of minorities, indigenous peoples."
"Then there is the selection of regions and countries and matching them with each of the four campaigns."
"All that is foreseen for 2007, and in the next financial perspective there will be only six finance regulations, four of which are very important ones: enlargement, development, good neighbourhood policy and stability."
"In all of them, democracy and human rights are in the mainstream, which is a real achievement on the basis of which we can work."
"There is thematic programming here."
"Returning to Belarus, which we spoke about in the Council recently, I explained that I wanted to work specifically with the NGOs."
"We then received an invitation from Lithuania to hold a workshop there."
"So we will have three phases: firstly, two phases in the Commission, and then we will confer with Parliament."
"Then there is also an invitation from Lithuania, because Lithuania, Poland and many of these countries know where we have to start with NGOs."
"You are right: we can only work with civil society there, because we cannot work with governments at this stage."
"On the broader Middle East, I was very interested in this new possibility for cooperation."
"It is true that we have been working for ten years with the countries of the Middle East, the southern basin of the Mediterranean."
"The United States is now doing something similar."
"It is a good initiative, because the more we can work in parallel and thus bring more democracy and easier access to democracy to the region, the better."
"I now turn to some other more formal questions."
"According to the information I have, for reasons of juridical coherence, the Council has now reintroduced the amendments tabled by Parliament when Regulations (EC) Nos 975/1999 and 976/1999 were at the drafting stage."
"I hope this information is welcome to the Members who raised this."
"In order to work better with NGOs it was essential to have deconcentration, as we call it."
"That means that we have given a lot of responsibility to the delegations, that are also in a much better position to conduct a survey on what NGOs are doing."
"This is also why we will follow developments much better."
"I hope that there will be better control because I know that while, on the one hand, we should have a speedy means of action, on the other hand we also have to be very careful and to control things properly."
"This is what I wanted to say."
"Indeed, it is an offer of dialogue on my part."
"I thank you for taking it."
"We are not perfect, but there is a positive offer and I hope that Parliament will take it in this positive spirit to work together for the major values of our European Union – that is, human rights."
". Mr President, as the Commissioner will find, the European Parliament always has the last word."
"I am pleased that the Commission is beginning to examine the possibility of doing some work in Belarus."
"I mentioned Belarus, and also Tunisia and Iran: two other countries where nothing is happening."
"I am grateful for the good will and the commitment of the Commissioner in her new post, and we welcome her into it."
"I also welcome her commitment to establish some working-level cooperation between Parliament and the Commission."
"I advise the Commission that this week the European Parliament, through the good offices of the Human Rights Subcommittee, is commissioning a study by independent experts into the operation of this programme."
"It is something I asked for last year from the Commission, but it was unwilling to give it."
"This will be completed by February."
"May I make one final remark, since I know the Commissioner was in Rabat at the weekend and we are dealing with a vast and important agenda: the process of reform in the Middle East."
"When I began working on this report, the funds available from the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights to the entire Middle East were four per cent of the total."
"Given the circumstances of the last three years, that was an extraordinarily low figure."
"I am pleased the Commission is now adjusting that, and we need to refocus the programme."
"Notwithstanding what Mr Howitt said, we have strategic objectives and strategic priorities."
"I am pleased to see the Commission is now beginning to focus on those."
"I thank the Commissioner for her words and for her commitment, and we look forward to working together constructively and practically, but on the basis of equal interest in the development of democracy, particularly in our neighbourhood."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Papadimoulis on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 1999/847/EC as regards the extension of the Community action programme in the field of civil protection."
". Mr President, I am pleased that Parliament supports the Commission's proposal for the extension of the Community action programme on civil protection for the years 2005 and 2006."
"I very much appreciate the efforts that have gone into this report, in particular the work of Mr Papadimoulis, the rapporteur."
"Before I go into detail on this report, I think it is worth recalling the work done under the auspices of this action plan since its adoption in December 1999."
"The objectives of the civil protection action programme are to help to ensure better protection for people, the environment and property in the event of natural or technological disasters across the Community."
"The action programme has funded a range of useful projects, exchanges of experts and workshops that build invaluable cooperation and also mutual assistance between the Member States' civil protection services."
"The action programme supports and supplements efforts at national, regional and local levels."
"Emphasis has been put on major projects concerning prevention, information of the public, crisis management, disaster medicine and networking among the different volunteer associations active on the ground."
"In recent years we have seen major disasters."
"You will recall the floods in central and eastern Europe in the summer of 2002, the oil spill, also in the same year, the unprecedented heatwave and devastating forest fires in southern Europe in the summer of 2003."
"This year we were shocked by the violent terrorist attack in Madrid and saddened by the earthquakes in Iran and Morocco."
"These events clearly illustrated the need for further action to strengthen prevention and preparedness measures and also to enhance our ability to respond rapidly and in solidarity as a European Union."
"The Commission believes that major progress has been made in recent years in the contribution and role of the EU in civil protection."
"The rapporteur has rightly highlighted some issues in the report, and these are both valuable and constructive remarks that we will take into account in our future work."
"I would like to react immediately to a number of points."
"The report recommends 'better sharing of information on available resources, expertise and successful strategies and practices at national level'."
"The Commission agrees that our database of resources should be further upgraded and contain more data on responsive capacities, associated costs and available equipment."
"The Commission is currently working with Member States on these issues."
"The report argues for an improved operational framework for volunteers and for the establishment of guidelines for their work."
"This is a helpful suggestion and echoes the emphasis that the Commission is now putting on the work on this subject, which was and will remain a priority for financing in 2005."
"Let me turn to the issue of financing assistance during emergencies."
"This is an issue of concern to us, but depends on having a sufficient level of funding available."
"For the time being the budgetary resources available only permit financing of experts who travel to the scene of disasters to assess needs for assistance."
"Additional financing depends at present on the donating and receiving Member States."
"I should like to add that there is also, as you know, the possibility to use the EU Solidarity Fund to provide compensation to a country suffering severe damage from a disaster."
"Finally, the report asks the Commission to provide a report on the programme in 2006."
"We have no difficulty in accepting this request."
"With these remarks, I reiterate my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament as a whole for this thoughtful and constructive opinion."
"May I add that my colleague, Commissioner Dimas, sends his apologies for not being here."
"He is in Buenos Aires and asked me to replace him."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on this report comes, as the Commissioner noted, after a series of major natural disasters in recent years which raise the question of the need to strengthen the Community action programme: floods, heat-waves, forest fires, earthquakes, serious pollution incidents from toxic waste or oil spills, such as that from the , as well as serious industrial accidents and also terrorist attacks."
"My country, Greece, is currently experiencing immense anxiety as the result of the hijacking of a bus with several hostages whose lives are in danger."
"These dangers and these disasters have many victims and cause ever greater economic losses; they disrupt the economies of the countries affected, hitting in particular the poorest and most vulnerable sections of the population."
"That is precisely why action also needs to be taken by governments, preventive measures need to be strengthened and response capacities need to be extended."
"The Community response to this problem is the Community action programme in the field of civil protection."
"This programme expires in a few days, on 31 December 2004, and we need to approve this proposal which I have prepared, in order to avoid a gap until such time as the new programme is prepared."
"That is why I support the Commission proposal to prolong this programme for the next two years, just as I support the Commission proposal on the necessary increase in the budget for the action programme in the field of civil protection from EUR 1.5 million annually, which was the amount in 2004, to EUR 2.4 million annually for the next two years."
"You may say it is not a big increase."
"I agree, but it is absolutely essential in order to finance increased needs due to enlargement and to finance the action programme to combat marine pollution which has been decided in the meantime."
"Unfortunately, it would appear that the Council of Ministers does not have the same perception as we have in the European Parliament and in the Commission, and the Council also needs to understand that the decisions which we take in order to do certain things also need the money necessary for their implementation."
"Otherwise, we shall not be consistent in our obligations towards the citizens and it is precisely at times of natural disasters that those who voted for us and sent us here need to see the European Union and the European Parliament by their side."
"This programme therefore needs to proceed and, at the same time, certain points in it need to be improved on the basis of experience obtained to date."
"In studying the problem, I have identified seven sectors in which improvements are needed in practice, because on paper the system looks good, but on the ground experience to date has shown that it has serious shortcomings."
"One, better sharing of information on available resources, expertise and successful strategies at national level."
"The database, its data and the capacity for fast communication and coordination need to be improved, in other words the computer database needs to be upgraded."
"Two, more training for intervention teams."
"Experience has shown that more regular training is needed for better cooperation and interoperability."
"Three, better communication, coordination, in-time information systems for the prompt information of the public and links with other networks."
"Four, funding: not simply increasing funding but safeguarding speedier response with the release of the source of funding and concentrating all the appropriations needed under one heading."
"Five, strengthening social partnership with a more active involvement of civil society and local authorities."
"Increasing the number of volunteers."
"Six, empowerment of research and development of emergency systems for a more efficient management of disasters."
"And seven, implementation of the principle of subsidiarity and reinforcement of the drawing up of national plans for emergency coordination, a sector in which numerous Member States have serious shortcomings."
"For the reasons which I have described to you and so as not to be too longwinded, because it is already quite late, I call on the European Parliament to approve this report with the greatest possible support, as did the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which approved my report almost unanimously."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Mr Papadimoulis’s report regarding the absolute necessity of extending the Community action programme for the two-year period of 2005-2006 in order to facilitate cooperation, especially cross-border cooperation, on the exchange of expertise and mutual assistance among Member States in this field."
"Cross-border cooperation and a cooperation culture are fundamental, because the security of the countries in the European Union is closely linked to what happens on their borders."
"To that end, we must invest heavily in volunteers."
"In addition, we agree on the seven areas that need to be strengthened, in view of the deficiencies revealed at the level of individual nations."
"The European People’s Party also believes that the Commission ought to evaluate the implementation of the current programme before it ends and prepare a report to be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council."
"I would point out that the Community action programme is being extended to the years 2005-2006 without Parliament having been sent the mid-term report or the final report provided for by Decision 1999/847/EC establishing a Community action programme in the field of civil protection for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004."
"To date we have not even received any justification for the delay."
"That is a very serious failing, because it violates Parliament’s prerogative to give its opinion and forces it come to a decision without seeing any qualitative or quantitative information on the actions taken or the results achieved."
"Our confidence in the new Commission, however, leads us to hope that these reports will be forwarded by the requested date of 30 June 2006, precisely for the purpose – and in the hope – of promoting full cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission."
"Those documents should give us an evaluation of the extent of the Community action programme in the field of civil protection, together with the actions planned under the other two ongoing Community programmes, which will provide Parliament’s Committee on the Environment with useful suggestions for inclusion in the single action programme that we hope the Commission will put in place for 2007-2013."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, happily we all agree on this issue and, consequently, I also share what has been said by previous speakers."
"We feel that it is crucial to extend this action programme and we also deem it important that in the two years concerned, 2005 and 2006, the Commission can make an accurate assessment of the current programme and can prepare a new and more ambitious instrument of action, taking account of the Financial Perspectives for 2007-2013 and any needs identified in the meantime."
"New problems require new solutions."
"We also, therefore, endorse Mr Papadimoulis’s report – and I compliment him on his work – and we naturally support the Commission’s proposal to extend the programme. We do feel, however, that, bearing in mind the programme’s objectives and its enlargement to ten more countries, funding should be stepped up even further."
"The importance of civil protection continues to grow. Persons and property must be protected and this is an area that requires greater resources."
"In recent years, as has been pointed out in this House, a number of natural disasters and criminally-motivated disasters have occurred, which have affected both the people and the economies of the countries concerned. Such was the case of the accident, the floods in the South of France, the terrorist attack on Madrid and the forest fires in Spain and Portugal."
"As I have said, greater funding would be desirable so that we can better prevent and remedy situations of this nature."
"In Portugal alone, for example, in 2003, 400 000 hectares of forest were burnt and approximately 170 000 hectares in 2004."
"It is therefore essential that the next action instrument provides for greater financial support."
"The environment is priceless and our forests cannot continue to disappear."
"We have an obligation to preserve them so that we can leave them to future generations."
"We cannot forget that the Earth does not belong to us, it has been borrowed for our children."
"We must therefore step up measures aimed at prevention and cure."
"As far as prevention is concerned, there must be greater EU involvement, in conjunction with national, regional and local administrations, along with technical and financial support, to prevent these disasters, which occur year after year."
"Prevention is better, and indeed more effective and cheaper, than cure."
"With regard to restorative measures, coordination and monitoring must be stepped up, particularly in terms of reforesting the areas affected by the fires."
"It is worth remembering that the restoration of the Mediterranean forest has taken almost a hundred years."
"There are sectors in which we cannot make savings."
"As for civil protection, making savings might mean becoming irredeemably poorer and our collective future being severely compromised."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall say straight away that I am in favour of extending the Community action programme on civil protection by two years."
"To me it seems not so much a free choice as a mandatory solution, without any alternatives."
"We have reached the end of the current programme without a lasting, concrete solution to the problem."
"That very fact shows just how marginal the subject of civil protection in Europe is."
"I feel I have developed some modest experience in this field, as I chair the civil protection committee in Catania, the province of Italy most exposed to seismic and volcanic risk, and also because I coordinated the emergency measures for the Italian Government during the terrible eruption of Mount Etna in the summer of 2001."
"Over the years I have come to the conclusion that civil protection is not just an agreeable topic for a round table or a pleasant, convivial get-together, but is a subject that is indissolubly linked to people’s safety and, as you know, safety is a physiological right before it is a constitutional right."
"I believe I can say that the European Union is seriously and scandalously dragging its feet in this area."
"The subject was first addressed only five years ago with a number of initiatives that appear good in theory but in practice suffer from serious deficiencies – as was pointed out by the rapporteur himself, whose work I admire."
"In fact, the approach seems schizophrenic not only at a logistical level but also because of the inadequate financial cover."
"Commissioner, what results have the information monitoring centre, the solidarity fund and the Community mechanism achieved in terms of risk forecasting and prevention, rather than of emergency and post-emergency management?"
"What qualitative results have they had on European Union territory?"
"Can we find out what their effect has been?"
"Can we have a detailed report?"
"Will people understand that a disaster may not always coincide with the borders of an individual state, thus becoming a supranational problem, as the oil slick from the demonstrated?"
"How can civil protection capabilities in Europe be allowed to remain fragmented among the areas of responsibility of the environment, health, territory, agriculture and internal affairs?"
"A European civil protection agency needs to be set up, something I asked the Commission to do two years ago."
"Apart from the fact that an operational structure can undoubtedly increase involvement, especially in Member States that are less sensitive to the problem, such a solution would have the advantage of operating above the territorial level to develop and harmonise procedures and methods for analysing and mitigating the risk of natural and technological disasters, and it would establish a proper task force."
"In conclusion, I believe we need to promote the action of civil protection volunteers and to support it with structured training, equipment and funds, so that it can become an essential resource for dealing with emergencies and natural and other disasters."
"I hope that the Commission will find the strength, the will and the courage to work with Parliament in this area."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his clear and specific comments on the Community action programme in the field of civil protection."
"His proposals on integrated management and more efficient operation of the relevant mechanism and the extension of the programme, which we support, are also to the point."
"Over recent years, all of us in the European Union and the world at large have experienced disasters with the broadest, direct consequences on the lives of a large number of our fellow men and on society and the economy as a whole."
"In response to these events, we adopted the Community action programme."
"As we all recall, we were overtaken by events and reacted after them."
"Let us take proper stock today, quantitatively and qualitatively, and let us look with the experience we have acquired at how we can improve the existing mechanism in all its functions and at all stages, from prevention to combating of disasters and the restoration of and return to social life."
"This relates both to the monitoring mechanism and to the Solidarity Fund."
"The rapporteur proposes better exchange of information and best practices, more training for intervention teams, mobilising volunteers and better coordination between the agencies involved at European, national, regional and local level."
"As far as increasing the budget is concerned, it is necessary but, at the same time, the procedure also needs to be simplified."
"I trust that the issue we are debating tonight will receive the assent of the Council, because it is a very important issue."
"It not only resolves daily problems, but is also of major symbolic importance."
"The citizens feel the European Union in their lives with this sort of intervention."
"European nationality thus acquires a specific and deeper meaning."
"This sort of programme brings European institutions, national and local agencies and local authorities into direct cooperation, something in which we are lagging behind, both at national level and in terms of coordination between the European Union and the national agencies."
"To the outside world, this sort of programme gives the European Union visibility and, more importantly, projects an efficient and humane face, something which, listening to you on the previous report Commissioner, you intend to make a reality."
"Mr President, I wish first of all to welcome the proposal by the rapporteur, Mr Papadimoulis, to extend the action programme in the field of civil protection."
"Coming from a country which has benefited in the past from EU funding in order to cope with natural disasters, I fully appreciate the importance of the programme."
"Indeed, as a former minister in my own government, I visited Brussels in 1995 seeking assistance to alleviate the effects of substantial flooding throughout the length and breadth of Ireland."
"I succeeded in obtaining considerable financial assistance."
"I note the increase in the budget from the action programme in the field of civil protection for 2005 and 2006 but, like other speakers who have contributed to this debate, when I examine the increase I note that it is a mere EUR 0.9 million for each of the years 2005 and 2006."
"I read the report in some detail and the justification for the increase is 'EU enlargement'."
"When one considers the fact that we are increasing the size of our Community and welcoming the accession of 10 new Member States to our Community, in real terms the so-called increase is actually a decrease; that is without factoring in inflation."
"I would like to see an emergency fund – I know you mentioned the Solidarity Fund – for civil disasters, where direct aid would be given to the regions of the new accession states, in the same way as Ireland was helped in the past."
"These states have freed themselves from the iron grip of Moscow."
"They all qualify for Objective 1 status; their economies are still largely embryonic."
"Just as Ireland found itself in civil disasters, these new countries will inevitably find themselves in situations where natural disasters will occur."
"I fundamentally believe that we should set aside each year a substantial fund to assist such countries by way of direct relief aid."
"I commend the rapporteur for his systematic approach and recommendations."
"He went through each area in detail."
"Prevention, where possible, is desirable; preparedness is vital; protection, emergency measures and recovery are all essential."
"I believe the scheme that he has prepared is excellent, but it is totally underfunded."
"We cannot foresee earthquakes, floods or forest fires – they are natural disasters."
"In conclusion,"
"I am not speaking Swahili, it is my own native tongue, Irish, which unfortunately is the only official language not included in the Community."
"A happy Christmas and a happy New Year to each and every one of you."
". Mr President, I have listened very carefully to what has been said."
"First I wish to thank you all – the rapporteur and all the Members of Parliament who have spoken – for your support for this programme for civil protection, which we all feel is important."
"I also thank you for your cooperation."
"In answer to the question about how will this go forward, I can tell you that there will be no problem, there will be a prolongation."
"Coreper discussed the Commission proposal on 15 December, and it will go as an 'A' point – that is, one where there are no problems – to the Environment Council before Christmas."
"Let me also say that, in the meantime, the Commission intends to present a proposal for a new legal instrument with a view to its entry into force in January 2007."
"That means that this new proposal will be based on the provisions of the new constitutional Treaty for greater possibilities to develop European cooperation in the field of civil protection; and thus we will be working particularly in the field of prevention that you all mentioned, but also in the field of response."
"The next two years will be a transitional period to prepare in the best possible way the venue for the new Treaty, which will include many of the items and elements mentioned here."
"You all spoke about prevention and nearly all of you mentioned the importance of contributions of volunteers and also of social partnership and the question of financing, which depends on the financial regulations."
"Again, we are ready to make the preparations, and in the next few months the Commission will come up with a proposal."
"I hope that my colleague Commissioner Dimas will then be able to discuss this very closely with you."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the transport of animals."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my gratitude for the opportunity which I have today to convey to you the Commission's views on such an important and emotional issue."
"I understand and share the concerns and interest of the European Parliament on such an important issue."
"Allow me to assure you that I know full well how important this issue is, not only to the European Parliament, not only to the European Commission, but also to our millions of citizens and, of course, to farmers and to all the agencies involved."
"I have no doubt that the European Community has a very important role to play in improving conditions under which animals can be fed, transported and slaughtered."
"The need to ensure that animal welfare is improved during transport as a matter of day-to-day reality and not just on the statute book is an important objective for me."
"I have long been aware of the unsatisfactory way that the current legislation on transport is being applied and of the apparent lack of priority given to this area of legislation by national authorities."
"The correct and full enforcement of animal welfare legislation is essential, as is the immediate improvement of the conditions of animal transport."
"This is why the Commission, despite its desire to do more to restrict transport-by-road times and reduce stock intensity on vehicles, accepts the presidency's step-by-step initiative in the Council."
"We felt it was important to make the significant progress that was already within our grasp, rather than to defer the whole dossier to a later indefinite date."
"This, as I will point out later, is without prejudice – and I would like to emphasise this – to any improved future solution."
"In doing this, we have opted for much stricter rules, significantly improving current conditions, to be applied as soon as possible."
"They will cover matters such as long-distance transport or new, substantially upgraded standards for vehicles."
"These will be enforced in the shortest possible time within EU standards."
"I wish to point out that the vast majority of Parliament's amendments have been integrated and incorporated into the final text and I thank Parliament for its important contribution."
"I have no problem in admitting that it is unfortunate that there was no agreement on the issue of restrictions on the travel time and the transport density."
"There was no chance – and I have to be frank about this – of such provisions being supported in the Council, and the failure to reach agreement at the April 2004 Agricultural Council was a clear warning."
"But failure to reach agreement at the last Council would have meant an indefinite continuation of the existing unacceptable conditions and a significant delay in their improvement."
"This does not mean, however, that the Commission does not believe that all possibilities for reinforcing the provisions on travel time should and will be exploited in the future."
"Firstly – and this is not the only possibility – the final text provides for the Commission to report back to the Council within – not after – four years of the date of implementation on the issue of travel time and loading densities and possibly to modify its approach on the basis of the experience acquired from the application of the new rules."
"However, in addition – and this is important – regardless of what the regulation provides, the Commission will carefully analyse the situation, including the prevailing political conditions, and will avail itself of its power of initiative."
"I retained this right when giving our consent to the compromise."
"Let me briefly list some of the improvements that this new regulation will introduce in the near future."
"I have a list of four pages and I will not read them all."
"Before I do so, I want to remind honourable Members that the regulation states that Member States have the right to adopt and implement stricter rules within their territory than those provided for in the regulation."
"Therefore, this is a challenge for the Member States, and it is a challenge for you."
"If enough Member States adopt stricter rules then the political pressure – the peer pressure – on the rest would be much more evident and effective."
"However, we need the improvements in the existing regulation."
"Firstly, a satellite navigation system will be used on road vehicles from 2007."
"There will be forced ventilation and temperature monitoring inside the trucks, with improvements in water facilities and drinking facilities, individual stalls for the transport of horses and other conditions in relation to horses."
"There will be stricter conditions for the training of drivers and a ban on transporting pregnant, sick and wounded animals."
"There will also be administrative provisions to ensure consistency between checks by officials in different Member States."
"This will apply to all journeys."
"As you will be aware, the use of satellite navigation systems was promoted by the European Parliament last month and supported by the Commission."
"This represents an innovative and promising tool to monitor animal transport, and the Commission is ready to invest immediately in this."
"The proper use of this technology will contribute to the promotion of a more transparent and high-quality approach to animal transport in Europe, in tune with the wishes of our citizens but also enabling better enforcement."
"This is extremely important."
"It is not enough to regulate or adopt rules, we must have the means to enforce them and to supervise their enforcement."
"European citizens have pointed out on innumerable occasions and in many ways that the lack of effective enforcement has been an appreciable weakness of the current system."
"I fully agree with that."
"I am determined and committed to ensuring better enforcement of animal welfare rules and to insisting that Member States report precisely on the state of play of the controls carried out."
"We will continue to press Member States for this information and I am pleased that the new legislation will allow us to do so in a more efficient way."
"To sum up, we stated in the Council that the Commission reserves the right to respond in accordance with the rules of the Treaty, with due regard to the welfare requirements of animals."
"Therefore, the Commission will continue to be vigilant and will closely monitor the situation on animal transport in Member States."
"We are prepared to take a legislative initiative at any time in the future should animal welfare conditions need further improvement."
"I would like to comment on two more issues."
"First, the improvement of animal welfare is a continuous process."
"It is not just a regulation, we are already working on other improvements on poultry and on microclimates within the transport vehicles."
"Therefore it is not the end, it is just the beginning."
"At the same time, I have looked at what the options were at the last Council meeting."
"They were not between the optimum maximum and the compromise, they were between the compromise and continuing indefinitely with the present situation, with all the unacceptable conditions that prevail at this point."
"I am certain you will understand that if one has the responsibility of taking a decision, one has to weigh the pros and cons and decide in which direction to go."
"I can assure you that the Commission's only concern on this issue was the welfare of the animals and how to make practical improvements as soon as possible."
"It was not just to insist on a principle which eventually would harm the animals, because it would not enable us to improve the existing conditions in any way."
"I repeat, the present compromise significantly improves the present situation without depriving the Commission of the right to come back to these very important issues."
"Believe me, it was a Commission proposal."
"We would have been much happier if these provisions were included and accepted in the compromise."
"But, unfortunately, there was no possibility of such an agreement."
"If I may, I suggest talking to the various NGOs."
"They were not happy but they accepted this compromise because they realised that it is a significant step forward."
"Finally – and I would be interested to hear your comments as I feel that Parliament will be a significant ally of the Commission in this matter – I can assure you that my intention is, before the end of this Commission's term and definitely before the end of this Parliament's term, to come back with a new proposal and have a new discussion."
"The Commission is committed to this."
"But, the big question and the big challenge will be to convince the Member States to accept this new proposal when it comes."
". – Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Kyprianou most warmly for the openness with which he has raised this issue once more."
"You have only just assumed your duties, and I think that your position at all events opens up the possibility of a very good future working relationship between Parliament and the Commission on this, too."
"I am saying this with good reason: you hit the nail on the head when you said just now that the main problem regarding animal transport in Europe is the lack of priority given to it by national authorities."
"This is our sticking point, and remedying it would represent tremendous progress."
"I should like to give an example by way of illustration."
"I note that, at the present time, the Austrian government, in particular, is doing a good job and is exercising good supervision."
"This is resulting in a large proportion of the international transport of stock for slaughter travelling to Italy by routes other than Austria all of a sudden."
"This is the kind of situation that arises when a number of other Member States neglect their duties."
"In that regard, the Austrian model should become the European model: with effective legislation and effective enforcement."
"This is the way to put an end to all the unpleasant debate."
"However, the Council has come to an agreement, and has made a corresponding amendment without giving prior notice to Parliament, which I find very disconcerting and also blameworthy on the part of the Council."
"On the other hand, I must add that we should have been even worse off without this initiative, because we cannot deny that the agreement does constitute an improvement on the existing legislation."
"You know Parliament’s line of thinking."
"I myself was rapporteur on the subject of a maximum journey time for stock for slaughter."
"This has now proved unattainable in the Council."
"Nevertheless, I note that the introduction of the satellite tracking system has become a reality, at all events, and that enforcement of the existing rules is to be improved."
"In that regard, I should like to hear how the Commission intends to enforce this at Member State level."
"Are other instruments necessary in this regard, including on the part of Parliament?"
"I should also like to know how the Commission intends to support this in the context of improving training."
"Finally, I note that farm-to-farm transport has been liberalised."
"We should have liked to see 100 kilometres, but this was evidently unattainable in the Council."
"Nevertheless, we have taken a small step forward."
"I should like to mention two other points."
"First of all, there is still a great deal of criticism of the means of regulation of the transport of breeding stock and the rest periods stated for this."
"Animals must be transported as quickly as possible, and introducing the minimum possible number of rest periods for the transit of breeding stock, too – which is undertaken in the main in very favourable conditions – would be a step forward."
"This means that animals can also be transported over medium distances."
"The same goes for the roll-on/roll-off system on ferries."
"Telling Member States in plain language that this is normal rest time would also be a great help."
"All this would represent another few steps forward in improving the quality of animal transport."
"As a former rapporteur, I am a little disappointed that no maximum journey times for stock for slaughter have been agreed."
"Nevertheless, I see that this package as a whole does represent a genuine step forward."
"I am extremely curious to hear what proposals the Commissioner intends to make before 2009 for the establishment of a good working relationship with Parliament, and also, in particular, for making Member States comply with the European rules."
". – Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his words. I share his disappointment over the Council’s compromise."
"It brings no improvement in the journey times for animal transport, none in the rest periods and none in the maximum stocking density, and that could endure for years to come."
"I wish the Council every success in attempting to explain this compromise to the European public."
"It is an extremely bad one, including for the image of the whole sector, and one that is unacceptable from an animal welfare point of view."
"I therefore support the proposal by my fellow Members to limit the maximum journey time to eight hours."
"Only a decision of this nature would demonstrate that Europe is really serious about sustainable agriculture, one of the priorities of which must be animal welfare."
"Europe is built in small steps, as we all know, and indeed that is a very good thing, in many cases even the best way."
"Whilst the EU is taking excessively small steps here towards improving animal welfare, animals in Europe are being dragged back and forth for thousands of kilometres in atrocious conditions."
"It will be nice and reassuring for them to know that they are being watched by satellites all along."
". Mr President, I agree with the Commissioner's statement."
"This is a very important issue."
"I also agree that the EU has played an important role in regard to the way that animals are fed, transported and slaughtered."
"As the Commissioner stated, the EU has ensured many improvements in animal welfare during transportation."
"Some of them have been mentioned already: proposals for satellite tracking systems, ventilation and temperature monitoring, stricter conditions for driver training and a greater number of official inspections in different countries."
"Progress has been made."
"I also want to nail my colours to the mast because I am an MEP who represents a constituency that is both rural and urban."
"Agriculture continues to play a very important economic role in the north and west of Ireland."
"Indeed, the agriculture business has for many years been well supported by the EU."
"Live animal exports are a hugely important, legitimate business for Ireland."
"We export 90% of our animals and about 10% of those, or 200 000 live cattle, are exported every year to markets in France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands."
"This trade is worth over EUR 150 million annually."
"Therefore, a vibrant export trade is essential for Irish agriculture and for the entire livestock sector."
"I believe we must have access to the single market."
"There is an important market for Irish weanlings in Europe and I believe this market should not be hindered."
"Surely, free access to the market is one of the cornerstones of EU policy."
"We also need to balance animal welfare with market access and support for agriculture, not just in Ireland, but also in the EU as a whole."
"Again, I agree with the Commissioner."
"We need enforcement and no one has a problem with that – consumers or farmers, it is in all our interests."
"Another issue regarding live export is that the trade provides competition in Ireland."
"This is another cornerstone of EU policy."
"I believe we have made progress; there is probably further to go, but the Commission is doing useful work."
"Mr President, I took the initiative regarding this extra debate following the Council decision in November."
"A number of technical improvements were at the cost of up to six years’ blocking of the issue of protecting our animals."
"This would mean that, throughout their periods of office, neither Parliament nor the Commission would be given an opportunity to improve the conditions of animals, a state of affairs that is quite unreasonable."
"The Council decision departed so completely from the proposal that I even doubted its legality."
"Mr Kyprianou, I hope you realise your ambition of coming back with density figures and transport times as soon as possible."
"I also hope that you make use of the Treaty’s articles concerning transport, consumer issues or health as a legal basis so that Parliament can participate through the codecision procedure."
"We could then together break the Council’s resistance to providing animals with reasonable conditions."
"Unfortunately, the Council listens more to lobbyists than to opinion."
"The maturity of a society is shown by the way in which it treats those who are defenceless."
"If the rules governing the transport of animals are an indicator of Europe’s maturity, we are unfortunately still barbarians."
"I invite all ministers to travel, together with myself, between Stockholm and Brussels under the conditions that apply to the transport of animals."
"They might then understand what they have done."
"If we are regarded as 75-kilo sheep, there will be ten of us in an area as large as a double bed."
"If we are regarded as chickens, we shall see how faeces from those above fall down onto those below."
"If we are regarded as pigs, we shall, in accordance with the Council decision, be given nothing less than electric shocks if we refuse to move."
"We shall also be given water only after 14 hours before continuing for another 14 hours."
"We must also try to ensure that, in accordance with the Council rules, the temperature is kept above five degrees Centigrade during the journey."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if we are to believe what the Council says about this European Union of ours wanting to encourage sustainable development, and if we look at the reality of where this could be done and the way in which the Council goes about doing it in practice, we see that the Member States really cannot summon up the will to do it."
"Yet again, animals have lost out when there is a choice to be made between protecting them or the profits of the firms that fatten them up."
"I will nonetheless concede that the Commission has made an effort, and I will not deny that a number of changes have been made for the better, but the underlying principle has remained the same as it was before."
"There are those of you in the Council who have decided not to have a limit on transport times for animals and that the permitted density should not be specified, and I am absolutely convinced that you would be quick to introduce other rules if your domestic pets were to be transported the length and breadth of Europe."
"If we want to defend the right to life and the rights of animals, then we need to approach this from a different angle."
"The introduction of the GSP satellite navigation system does, of course, achieve something; it means that checks can be better carried out."
"There is no disputing that."
"Likewise, if it is ensured that the animals are given water and improved ventilation, that is of course a small advance, but it does not solve the problem."
"If you want regional development, this is a real opportunity to demonstrate it, for you can raise animals, fatten them up, and process them on the spot or within the local area without having to organise these transports from one end of the European Union to the other."
"I really cannot understand how Mr Maat can describe this as tremendous progress."
"I cannot see it as such."
"It patches things up, without doing anything to deal with the main problems and remove the main causes of the torment these animals undergo."
"Mr President, I am a severe critic of the damage the EU has done to Britain and a passionate advocate of Britain's withdrawal from it."
"The European Union destroys jobs – as Tony Blair said in his 1983 election address."
"It has also passed legislation that has led to the closure of hundreds of local abattoirs."
"However, this toothless Parliament passes resolutions that are then ignored by both the Council and the Commission."
"The decisions made by this Parliament on the transportation of animals have been repeatedly ignored and horrendous suffering continues."
"Over 3 million animals every year endure journeys lasting 30 hours or more in unacceptable conditions and many die in transit."
"Were this not bad enough, even more suffering is now being planned by the European Union under the REACH Directive, and we will see millions more animals moved around for live testing."
"To those in the outside world – the real world – who are as appalled as I am by all this, I have a simple message."
"I wish the European Union would interfere and legislate less, for if the European Union is the answer it must surely have been a very stupid question."
"Mr President, the welfare of animals during transit has been a matter of continuing concern for Parliament over recent years. I venture to suggest it has given rise to more concern than the plight of the millions of children dying of starvation or living in unacceptable conditions in contemporary Europe."
"If the humanitarian organisations acting in the interests of those individuals had shown the same determination as their counterparts promoting the cause of animals, something could probably have been done to help the European children dying day after day."
"I shall be more specific. Parliament has issued two opinions on animal welfare in transit over the last three years."
"I do not believe it is appropriate to devote any more time to the matter, as fortunately it was finally settled this November, following the agreement reached in the Council of Ministers of the European Union."
"In my view, the compromise proposal tabled by the Irish Presidency was better. It contained a reasonable restriction on journey times, taking account of both the animal welfare and the question of freedom of movement of goods within the European Union."
"I would remind the House of the times in question, namely nine hours of journey time plus twelve for rest and a further nine hours of journey time."
"The agreement reached today under the Dutch Presidency does not imply any change to existing regulations on journey time."
"The decision on this crucial issue in the debate has been postponed for six years."
"The postponement is due to the differences of opinion that still exist between the Member States."
"It amounts to stalemate."
"Nonetheless, I would like to clarify one aspect I feel many of those following the debates have overlooked, and which should be brought to the notice of the citizens. Existing regulations already impose a maximum travel time of eight hours when vehicles that do not comply with the welfare standards laid down in the regulations are used."
"In addition, these standards have been tightened up by virtue of the agreement reached in the Council of Ministers."
"Mr President, I can understand why the Commission has gone along with this solution, because it is a pragmatic one."
"The Council was not going to agree to anything more at this stage."
"However, it is extremely disappointing – as everyone has said – that we could not get something on journey times, one of the key issues; or on stocking densities."
"Member States can adopt tougher legislation."
"We in this Parliament want a bigger say on these issues, but at the moment we do not have it."
"I will certainly press my own government to go further on this."
"I am pleased, Commissioner, that you mentioned enforcement."
"That is one area where this legislation has fallen down in the past."
"You will be aware of the NGOs that have given us video evidence of how this legislation has been by-passed and ignored."
"You said that in four years you are going to come back with more legislation."
"I hope that you do."
"I hope you will keep Parliament informed of what happens in the interim."
"We want to hear about what is happening with regard to reinforced monitoring."
"I can guarantee that Parliament will back you when you bring forward your legislation."
"We already have a written declaration on journey times."
"I am sure that our commitment will remain the same."
"Mr President, animal protection should be moved immediately from the agricultural heading and from Article 37."
"It could, of course, be transferred to health and consumer protection because it would then be Commissioner Kyprianou who would be responsible for the matter, which sounds more reassuring."
"In Denmark, it is the Justice Ministry that is responsible for this matter."
"We regard animal protection as legal protection, but Article 37 is exclusively about increasing production and earnings."
"The poor animals must suffer heaven knows what kind of mistreatment when protection itself is subject to greed."
"It is actually grotesque that export subsidies are paid when horses, cows and sheep have to be sent out of the EU."
"Animals that are to be slaughtered should only be driven to the nearest abattoir and for a maximum of eight hours."
"We have a majority in favour of this view in Denmark."
"Animals that are not to be slaughtered should only be transported for eight hours without rest, food and a change of air, and the accommodation must be in order."
"That is also something favoured by a majority in Denmark."
"Of course, the previous Parliament stated this too, and it has to be asked why the Commission did not go to the Council and insist on these conditions being respected."
"When we obtain the new Constitution, Parliament will have the right of codecision and, if animal protection had no longer been subject to Article 37, Parliament would now already have had this right."
"Regarding another matter – namely transparency – our Ombudsman expressly stated that the provisions of the new Constitution could properly be used when there was such large support for doing so, so there is a double opportunity for involving Parliament in this procedure right now."
"What has happened is that a strategy has been chosen whereby a decision has been hurried through, almost as if it were a question of keeping both people and Parliament remote from the decision-making concerned over the next six years."
"We, indeed I, have noted that the Member States must implement decisions that go further ..."
"– Mr President, the problem at issue is of a cross-border nature and cannot be solved by national legislation alone."
"For this reason, it is a matter for the European Commission and the European Parliament."
"For years, Parliament has been inundated with petitions from people rightly calling for attention to abuses in animal transport."
"This applies in particular to horses that come to the end of their useful life in the East but are destined to be slaughtered and eaten in the South."
"Many animals spend a very long time in transit in lorries, with little to eat or drink, foul themselves, start to panic and suffer injury."
"The only way to prevent this is to drastically reduce the distance and time permitted for the transport of live animals."
"At the start of 2004, the dispute in this Parliament was a question of eight hours versus nine hours of continuous transport and of limited, cheap protective measures versus further-reaching, more expensive measures."
"At that time, Parliament made a very moderate choice, but even that went too far for the governments of a number of Member States."
"As a result, there is still scope for allowing those abuses to continue."
"The key question is whether we accept this unnecessary animal suffering in anticipation of a resulting reduction in the costs of the livestock trade and of road transport companies, or whether we consider this suffering to be completely at variance with our civilisation and our responsibility for the welfare of our fellow creatures."
"My choice is emphatically in favour of civilisation and responsibility."
"What the Commissioner is now announcing is the failure of decision making in the European Union."
"We have shown ourselves to be unable to do what is urgently needed."
"National economic interests are taking precedence over our shared civilisation and responsibility."
"Listening to Commissioner Kyprianou speak, I have no doubt as to his good intentions."
"I support his announcement of new initiatives by the European Commission."
"I also agree with his view that it would be better to start quickly on the basis of a woefully inadequate result than of no result at all."
"Satellite monitoring is cold comfort for the animals."
"Let us not trust solely in new technologies, but rather build on the political will to genuinely eliminate this abuse."
"That is what is important."
"I hope that we are able to achieve real results by the end of the term of office of this Parliament and this Commission, because what is currently taking place is an absolute disgrace."
"Mr President, the transport of animals within the EU and from the EU to countries outside it has on quite a few occasions been comprehensively criticised."
"Most recently, we have received information about the disgraceful conditions under which animals have been exported from the EU to Lebanon."
"That worries us."
"Will the Commission prioritise this problem?"
"We hope so, but are not completely convinced."
"Another matter that gives rise to concern is the reports on financial fraud issued by OLAF at regular intervals."
"Recently, these concerned complaints relating to financial fraud in connection with the transport of animals to Lebanon."
"In purely financial terms, subsidies for the export of animals from the EU to third countries total approximately SEK 60–100 million per year."
"Does this amount to properly used tax revenue?"
"We hope that the Commission will take animal protection seriously and that we do not have to read further reports concerning misused export subsidies."
"Mr President, I thank the Commission for raising this important issue for animals and humans."
"There is a failure of implementation, not a failure of regulation."
"In fact, in many cases we have over-regulation but also non-implementation."
"This has led to problems for farmers and those engaged in what is a very legitimate trade."
"One of my Irish colleagues has mentioned the importance of this trade for Irish farmers."
"The new agriculture support system urges farmers to opt for market-led farming."
"There is a legitimate market in mainland Europe for young cattle from Irish farms."
"Are we going to tell farmers that they cannot engage in this legitimate trade?"
"I do not think we can, because it is vital for the success of Irish farmers."
"However, animal welfare must of course also be a priority."
"One colleague raised concerns about Lebanon."
"Irish cattle go to Lebanon."
"Again, it is a case of implementing the regulations that are there."
"If we stop that trade, animals will still move to Lebanon, perhaps from Australia and other areas."
"If our concerns are for animals, we must have concerns for animals across the world and not just European animals."
"As for reducing journey times and stocking densities, I urge that we be guided by science and not emotion, because this debate has been too much guided by emotion."
"I wish to refer you to independent research carried out in Ireland on the transport of animals from Ireland to Spain."
"I shall read one paragraph from the report: 'The study concluded that transport had no adverse effect on animal welfare based on the physiological, immunological and haematological measurements made'."
"Finally, I would just support Mrs Herranz Garcia, who spoke of human welfare concerns in this House last night."
"I raised the issue of over half a million people in the Sudan who are starving."
"The issues are not linked, but we need to put our priorities right."
"MrPresident, I too would like to warmly welcome the political agreement to be presented to the Agriculture Council for formal approval next week. I believe this agreement has one very positive aspect."
"It postpones the most controversial issues until 2011. I refer to the issues instrumental in the failure of negotiations last April, namely journey times and stocking densities."
"Some of the honourable Members present today will recall the debate in the last Parliament with Mr Maat. It emerged then that, as Mrs McGuinness just stated, there is no solid scientific basis regarding the two issues of journey time and density."
"In addition, larger Member States and the peripheral ones were seriously penalised. All this economic background was presented as an animal welfare issue, as if Members from large and peripheral countries were not concerned about animal welfare."
"Commissioner, I believe the political agreement makes good many of the shortcomings identified in current provisions. This is its most positive aspect."
"It improves control systems, it introduces technological features facilitating control, it provides for a clear and transparent system of registration and it improves systems of cooperation between Member States. In addition, it spells out the duty of setting up training systems that will also improve the transport of animals."
"I particularly welcome Article 32, because it lays down clearly the basis for future reviews of these provisions."
"For all these reasons, therefore, I am bound to congratulate the Council for moving the issue forward, and I look forward to successful implementation of the new text."
"Mr President, the Commissioner spoke of the emotions that are present in this House."
"That this should be so certainly has to do with the subject matter, but also with the fact that what we are dealing with here is a never-ending story."
"This is not the first time, not the second, and not even the third, but perhaps the umpteenth time that we have had to give this our attention."
"For well over ten years, we have sought to make improvements in this area, and there has always been talk of progress, but the crucial progress has not materialised."
"We will, I believe, achieve a real breakthrough only when this House acquires the right of codecision in agricultural matters as well."
"I believe we are more likely to get that than the satellite navigation system."
"It is there that I have greater confidence in our ability to get our way."
"Turning to the matter in hand, I would like to say that this is, of course, also about transport times, but what is of the essence is whether the conditions are right, that is, whether the animals are carted off in torment or whether they travel as our fellow-creatures."
"If someone goes to the Middle East and buys an Arabian stallion for stud purposes, they do not need to worry that it will arrive here in a poor condition."
"Likewise, if our animals travel to the Olympic Games, they will arrive in a fit and proper state."
"It follows that it is the conditions that matter."
"What matters, I think, is that we should comply with what the consumers want."
"In Germany, we have set up programmes for quality meat in which transport time is among the quality criteria."
"Organic farming is another example, with the nearest slaughterhouse being the one that is used."
"Where that is a measure of quality, it will also become accepted practice."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, terrible things occur during the transport of animals."
"Animals suffer from human callousness and thoughtlessness, and improving their fate is a challenge to our humanity."
"It is not merely sensitivity to the harm done to animals that makes action necessary, but also the awareness that it is only a small step from cruelty to animals to cruelty to humans."
"The regulation under discussion moves in the right direction."
"It introduces higher standards for the protection of animals in transport, although these standards are still inadequate, and it leads one to hope that animals will suffer less."
"As an MEP whose voters include Polish farmers, I am delighted at this."
"In Polish family-owned farms, which are mainly small, animals are treated with great affection, and even as individuals."
"It breaks farmers’ hearts when the animals they cared for are treated brutally after being sold."
"The regulation we are discussing will bring progress, but it is not a solution to the problem."
"Legal regulations must be accompanied by effective implementation, which can be fraught with difficulty."
"Poland, for example, is a large transit country and it experiences problems with the transport of horses."
"Legal standards have been put in place, but the monitoring bodies, police and veterinary inspectors are often helpless when faced with the problem of what to do with illegal transports, carrying injured animals for instance."
"There is a need for a network of stopover points where transported animals could be provided with food and drink or given necessary veterinary care."
"In urgent cases, the animals could be put down at these points if necessary."
"The European Union should provide financial support for the setting up of such a network, and Poland at any rate requires such assistance."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a genuine breakthrough in the transport of animals will only come about when long-distance transports are fully abolished."
"Animals should be slaughtered close to where they have been bred."
"Humanitarian considerations are not the sole reason for this."
"Sanitary considerations are also at issue."
"I would remind you that as shown by the recent report of the Court of Auditors, control is practically lost over animals transported abroad."
"Ladies and gentlemen..."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that this is an area that makes a big impression upon the European population."
"Last year alone, one animal protection organisation collected 500 000 signatures in Denmark, that is to say half a million signatures in a country with only just over five million inhabitants."
"All the more reason for criticising the way in which this proposal has been hurried through."
"As a Member of the European Parliament, I could not obtain access to the proposal until a few hours before it was in actual fact adopted."
"It might well actually have been the case, Commissioner, that if there had been a little more time in which to debate this issue and if there had been a public debate surrounding it in the individual countries of Europe, the ministers would have been rather more amenable."
"I actually think you should be serious about the statements you have made in this House today."
"I think you should have the matter put on the agenda again as quickly as possible so that we can have a public debate and so that the politicians and ministers can be put under pressure."
"The big problem in this case is that we think too much about the internal market."
"The internal market is of course a splendid and commendable thing but, once in a while, we must also pause and bear some ethical considerations in mind."
"We are now treating animals as if they were commodities."
"Animals are not commodities."
"Animals are living beings and must, of course, be treated as such."
"I would also question whether the proposal that has now unfortunately become legislation is at all tenable in purely legal terms."
"In purely legal terms, can there be any defence of Parliament’s being deprived of influence, as it has been?"
"When this legislation is revised, or in other words re-examined, it will be possible to bypass Parliament."
"As I see it, that alone is a good enough reason for investigating whether this decision is at all sustainable in legal terms."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous speaker mentioned the internal market, but the internal market must be judged by whether or not it operates in a humane way, and by what its effects are not only on human beings but also on other creatures."
"Where animal transports are concerned, the issue is clear: whom does it benefit when animals are transported over long distances?"
"It is to the benefit of mass livestock farming, a form of livestock farming that will get Europe nowhere."
"What we need is not just the right measures, but also stringent checks, and this is where the attitude of the Member States cannot be described as anything other than truly shameful."
"If we are to have these checks, we need an infrastructure, and this infrastructure also means resting points, for which we must make provision, and loading stations where vehicles must be obliged to dock when the provisions on the protection of animals in transit are breached."
"That must be enforced, and we – this House and the Commission – must together require the Member States, once and for all, to implement in practice a new strategy for agriculture."
"Mr President, I think Commissioner Kyprianou has a difficult task in front of him in trying to persuade us that the November Council compromise is a genuinely positive step forward when it comes to live animal exports."
"We know it is not, and I think you know it is not, Commissioner."
"It is a great shame that the Council is not here to be held to account."
"I have to say as well that I am disappointed that my own government voted in favour of this shabby deal; because a few technical improvements are now completely overshadowed by the failure to make any progress on journey times and stocking density."
"As a result, it seems this shockingly cruel practice will continue for many years to come."
"I notice, however, that you explicitly reserve the right to bring forward better proposals."
"I welcome that, and strongly urge you to do it as soon as possible, and in particular to introduce a maximum eight-hour journey time for both slaughter and further fattening animals."
"You can be sure that Parliament will be an ally on this, even more so if we have codecision."
"It is crucial that we send out a strong signal to all Member State governments that support for live exports is unacceptable in a civilised society."
". Mr President, I have noted with great interest the views expressed by Members."
"I share most of your concerns and most of your views."
"However, as I have already said, the Commission felt that there was a need for immediate action."
"Some of you said that this compromise has been rushed through."
"But at the same time, some of you said that this has been pending for more than ten years."
"I believe, therefore, that we had an obligation to find a solution as soon as possible, without just saying that we would not continue these efforts for improvement."
"It is true that Member States can do more."
"They can adopt stricter rules, not just for animals originating from their territory but also for transit animals."
"So there could be, through this, a possibility of stricter regulations covering a much wider area and affecting much more transport."
"As far as the subsidies are concerned I must remind Parliament that even though we do not have the right – because of various international agreements – to legislate on movement of animals outside the territory, nevertheless the European Union has linked the export subsidies to animal welfare requirements during transport."
"Therefore to link the two is a substantial step as it brings compliance to a great extent, even though not through immediate legislation."
"I agree that implementation is very important."
"We will put greater emphasis on the issue of travel times, including all the other improvements that need to be made."
"We will gather enough scientific evidence to be able to convince even those who are reluctant at this stage."
"Therefore we will continue to monitor the situation and get this evidence that can be used in a future proposal."
"On the staging point, this regulation has increased both the welfare situation and the bio-security situation."
"Even though I understand and share the disappointment of many of you with regard to this regulation, at the same time, we must not, through this emotional approach, disregard significant improvements that have been made to the regulation."
"Travel times are very important – that is why they were included in the Commission proposal; but conditions during travel are just as important."
"They are being improved and dealt with in the regulation."
"The Commission examined the legal problems referred to in the way in which the decision was taken."
"I can assure you that we checked with the legal services and everything was done in a proper legal way."
"While I share your concerns, we feel that this was a good compromise."
"It has gone the right way."
"Some of us might have wanted to go one step further, or take one step less, but it is nevertheless going in the right direction."
"The Commission will continue to monitor and follow the implementation."
"Implementation is in the hands of the Member States."
"Agreement on any future proposal coming from the Commission will again, in the final analysis, be in the hands of the Member States."
"Therefore it is something on which Parliament and the Commission have to work together."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report by Sérgio Ribeiro (A6-0037/2004), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 850/98 as regards the protection of deep-water coral reefs from the effects of trawling in certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean (COM (2004) 0058 – C5 – 0074/2004 – 2004/0020 (CNS))."
". Mr President, I thank Mr Ribeiro for his report on the proposal to protect deep-water coral reefs from the effects of trawling in certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean."
"This is the first time I have addressed the plenary of this Parliament and it is satisfying that the first proposal that I am dealing with is focused upon the protection of deep-water coral reefs – an issue of great importance to us all."
"Doubtless, we will have many an occasion in future, both within this plenary and within the Committee on Fisheries, to discuss issues not only relating to conservation and the preservation of fish stocks but also relating to issues such as deep-water coral reefs."
"Having studied the scientific evidence and considering the irreversible damage that certain fishing gear can cause to these unique habitats, we propose in this regulation to ban the use of bottom trawls and similar trawl gear in the areas concerned."
"With this proposal, we fulfil the commitment given at the Fisheries Council of 23 October 2003, when the new 'western waters' regulation was approved to ensure protection for these habitats."
"I am happy to note that the rapporteur recommends that Parliament approve these measures, as does the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in its opinion."
"The Commission welcomes the adoption of measures to minimise the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems."
"They show our determination to work for the integration of environmental concerns in the common fisheries policy, as envisaged in the reform of 2002, and as repeatedly called for by public opinion."
"I turn briefly to the amendments proposed in the report before us."
"I can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3."
"However, I have difficulty in accepting Amendment No 4, since it is not in line with the legislation on the mandate that is given to regional advisory councils."
"These councils are to be consulted on the development of proposals for legislation, but consultation of them is not envisaged on the implementation of such legislation."
"As for Amendment No 5, the Commission has difficulty accepting the substance of this amendment as it is currently worded."
"The Commission is bound to review all proposals in the light of new scientific evidence."
"Hence, obliging the Commission to do so in a specific timeframe could also work against the spirit and purpose of the proposal."
"Furthermore, we need to be conscious of the fact that the production of scientific evidence is very much dependent on the Member States and, therefore, the Commission is not in a position to guarantee its availability as prescribed in the amendment, that is, within a specified timeframe."
"On Amendment No 6, the Commission notes that while it could find such an amendment acceptable, it is not really necessary since the geographical application of the regulation is well known and already established."
"As for Amendment No 7, in accordance with scientific advice, the main threat to the very fragile deep-water habitats is bottom trawling."
"Damage caused by other gear, in particular specific gear such as gillnets and longlines, may be real, but is very minor compared to the erosion effects of trawls."
"Furthermore, extending the prohibition on trawling throughout the European economic zone would appear to be excessive, i.e. would appear not to be proportionate since the majority of this area does not have submarine features threatened by fishing."
"In these circumstances, the Commission is not in a position to accept Amendment No 7."
"Finally, the Commission has difficulty accepting Amendment No 8, because it would create a duplication of effort."
"Comprehensive revisions of the status of deep-water features are currently being carried out by the International Council for the Exploitation of the Sea, ICES."
"This is considered to be sufficient."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the process of drawing up, discussing and voting on this report in committee was quite a surprising learning process, showing that it is never too late to learn and to carry on learning."
"I tackled an activity with which I was only superficially familiar and, in particular, I supplemented all the theoretical knowledge that documents and studying could provide."
"By contacting and receiving information from those connected with the activity, those who make it their difficult livelihood, those who study it thoroughly and seriously and those who have responsibilities within it, I learnt a lot and I know that there is still a lot to learn."
"I started with the idea that we need to protect the environment, which is subject to attacks that are likely to get worse, and I found three questions taking shape: which predatory activities should be moderated or banned?"
"Within what limits?"
"Under what jurisdiction?"
"After much listening and considerable thought, I became convinced that a ban on bottom trawling would not be enough to protect coral reefs and other formations, among which I would highlight thermal vents."
"It was proved to me that bottom gill-netting was equally predatory or even more so."
"That is why I explicitly included it. Why is there such resistance to its inclusion?"
"Is it because powerful interests use that method?"
"The Commission argues that it is because there is insufficient scientific evidence to prove the evils of the technique."
"Even if that were so, however, the precautionary principle should apply."
"The delimitation of the areas to be protected is defined in the Commission’s proposal by the criterion of degrees of longitude and latitude."
"I consider this option to be political and not technical, or at least not only technical but with a strong political meaning."
"Not using the criterion of miles offshore means that the connection with national exclusive economic zones can be ignored or minimised as something to be forgotten."
"In view of the negotiations, after the period that ended in November 2003, to change the regulatory limits from 200 to 12 and then to 50 and finally to 100 miles, the failure of the Commission proposal to consider the situation created in the zone between the 100 and 200 mile limits is, in my view, serious and needs to be remedied."
"All that brings us to the key issue of jurisdiction, starting with the simple omission of the national jurisdictions of Spain and Portugal, which was not omitted even in the previous proposal dealing with the United Kingdom’s jurisdiction over the reef formations of the Darwin Mounds off the Scottish coast."
"Might that mean that jurisdiction is attributed to the United Kingdom but is denied or forgotten – or hidden – in the case of Spain and Portugal?"
"We are thus arriving at some really sensitive, fundamental issues, of the kind that life imposes when we get down to practicalities."
"The principle of the European Union’s exclusive competence over the conservation of marine biological resources is thus enshrined in this proposal even before the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty."
"Such a decision is highly debatable and, for us, unacceptable, insofar as it represents the replacement of national and regional competence over part of the national territory, albeit under the sea, with exclusive Community competence."
"The points that are clearly under discussion here are as follows: firstly, the balance between the exploitation of resources and their conservation."
"Secondly, this balance was achieved when and where fishing was not industrial and predatory and the conservation of marine biological resources was under national and regional jurisdiction on the basis of proximity, and there are therefore no grounds to replace this jurisdiction in order to remedy incorrect or lax practices."
"Thirdly, there are two kinds of fishing – costal fishing, which is, more or less, or still is almost traditional, and industrial fishing. The former is penalised, with a terrible impact on society and the regional economies, by the predatory nature of the latter, which, because of its economic and political power, will more easily continue its activities."
"Fourthly, the negotiations that are starting on total allowable catches and quotas are an indictment of equal treatment for what is different and a refutation of strategies which, on the pretext of protecting the environment, help the ‘big fish’ to swallow up the ‘little fish’ – and the word ‘fish’ can be replaced with others such as ‘boats’, ‘fleets’, ‘interests’ or ‘countries’."
"My report and the draft amendments that I have submitted to the House for approval have the same intention as I have tried to make clear in this speech, in the hope that this House will vote for it."
"I am grateful for your vote and I am also grateful for all the help and collaboration that I have had in tabling this report."
"Mr President, I shall present the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on behalf of Mrs Hassi."
"When we discuss this issue, we need to imagine how it would be if the destruction taking place on the sea bed were instead to happen on land."
"Imagine if forests were to be uprooted, if all the animals in them were to die and if the birds were to become silent."
"People would be up in arms."
"We would all drown in letters from anxious people demanding that the forests be protected."
"Now, this is happening on the sea bed."
"The forests of the sea are coral reefs at the bottom of the sea, among fish that are unable to cry out."
"We here in Parliament must therefore speak on behalf of these bio- and eco-systems without a voice."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has tried to express this voice in the form of amendments."
"I wish therefore to emphasise that the House should support Amendment No 8, which was adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety but which, unfortunately, was rejected by the Committee on Fisheries."
"We must investigate what other deep-sea habitats need to be protected so that we might obtain a complete list of these."
"We must, of course, do this in cooperation with the ICES to avoid duplication of effort, but we must take responsibility for this list’s being compiled."
"I also wish to speak up for Amendment No 7, which picks up on the important aspect of there being equipment other than trawl nets that can damage the sea bed."
"That is why the rules should, of course, cover all equipment that may damage the sea bed, and it is wise to use the precautionary principle in these sensitive areas."
"I think, however, that we should retain the Commission’s proposal concerning zones and thus vote against the second half of the amendment."
"The zones have a scientific basis we are able to accept."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal, which has been adopted by this Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries, seeks to prevent the use of a fishing technique that is highly damaging to the extremely fragile marine systems of deep-water corals, which not only contribute their own richness to biodiversity but are also important ecological habitats for various organisms at various stages in their life cycles."
"According to the Commission, protection is given to the areas around Madeira, the Azores and the Canaries, outermost archipelagos where the traditional fishing methods that have been used for centuries up to the present day have made it possible not only to preserve species but also to maintain thriving fishing communities."
"At a time when we are witnessing growing concern about the maintenance of fish stocks and when various recovery plans are being set up in areas devastated by overfishing, the sustainable fishing practised in those archipelagos deserves that we should all encourage it and adopt a position to support and safeguard it."
"Besides, we are talking about areas where there is no continental shelf and therefore the places where fishing is possible are confined to small seamounts generally associated with those deep-water corals."
"It can be said that there is a lot of water around those archipelagos but there are not many fish or fishing areas."
"It is therefore essential to safeguard and protect those areas from the destructive – highly destructive – activities of industrial fisheries."
"The emergency measures put in place are already a help but we have to have lasting solutions, and for that reason this Commission proposal is laudable."
"Nonetheless, the proposed amendments to widen the ban on nets to include bottom gill nets make complete sense to me."
"Because of the anchors used and the risk of loss, they can cause ghost fishing and also seabed erosion, threatening the ecological balance of the deep-water corals."
"I therefore believe that the proposal for a ban should be widened to include gill nets and also to include the 200-mile zones, because this proposal is based on maintaining what existed until very recently."
"With my knowledge of the situation, I can guarantee that by adopting these proposals we will be helping to protect the environment and the sustainable kind of fishing that we think should be based more on prevention than on cure."
". – Mr President, I should like to address a special welcome to the Commissioner on the occasion of his first speech and to offer him our best wishes for the extremely important and difficult job that he has to do."
"I should also like to tell him, however, that I find it quite incomprehensible in this report that, after the mistake was made to liberalise bottom trawling and bottom gill nets a year ago in Regulation (EC) No 1954/2003, this mistake is not being corrected in respect of bottom gill nets."
"Having read the documents produced by the Commission, which are quite specific in indicating that bottom gill nets are extraordinarily harmful and damaging to the environment, we are at a loss to understand why the Commission wants to impose this practice in the Autonomous Region of the Azores, where it has never been allowed."
"That is a backward step in nature conservation imposed by the Commission and by the European institutions, which makes no sense at all and is totally unacceptable."
"Commissioner, I ask you to think this matter over more carefully."
"Mr President, Mr Ribeiro's excellent report is on the second Commission proposal seeking to protect deep-water coral reefs from the effects of trawling."
"The first concerned reefs off the north-west coast of Scotland, the Darwin Mounds, for which I was fortunate enough to be rapporteur."
"As with that report, it is essential to appreciate just how important deep-water coral reefs are for the marine ecosystem."
"They can maintain hundreds of different species of wildlife, including many species of deep-sea fish, and they are a vital focus for fish reproductive cycles."
"In the case of deep-sea fish, gestation periods are extremely long and thus any negative impacts on the habitats will have serious effects on stocks, both in the short and the long term."
"We are still gathering research on the full impact of trawling on deep-sea coral reefs, but it certainly appears that in the short span of time since deep-sea trawling began, hundreds or possibly thousands of seamounts and coral reef systems may have been devastated."
"The ALDE Group therefore fully supports the proposal and the amendments adopted in committee, particularly Amendment No 4 emphasising the role of regional advisory councils."
"We commend to you the other amendments as adopted in committee."
"We endorse plenary Amendment No 8 as well, since it is important to examine what other areas of deep-sea coral within the EU should be closed to harmful fishing methods."
"We can also support Amendment No 6 and the first part of Amendment No 7, since that fits with the precautionary approach."
"After considerable thought, we cannot support the second part of that amendment because it could have the effect of leaving some of the coral unprotected."
"That is with real regret, since the motivation of the whole of that amendment is essentially one of conservation."
"We hope very much that the Commission and the Council will both appreciate the seriousness of the concerns being expressed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the excellent report by Mr Ribeiro on the proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of deep-water coral reefs from the effects of demersal fishing, more generally termed ‘trawling’, is timely and borne out by many studies in this area."
"As we all know, the impact on these environments – and this is also true for all types of marine environment where indiscriminate fishing methods are used – affects not only pelagic and edible sessile species, but also inedible sessile organisms and, more generally, it seriously damages key breeding environments."
"This leads to resource depletion and a resulting loss of economic potential, with serious consequences for local communities, particularly small-scale traditional fishing businesses."
"In addition to the reasons given in the international agreements referred to in the report, the protection of such environments is therefore an important way to achieve not only environmental protection but also stable social and economic prospects for the communities which persevere in the areas in question."
"This is true in general for all regions where fishing is a traditional resource which, as such, ought to be safeguarded, not only by limiting the industrial catch by fleets from other countries, but also by ensuring the continued existence of breeding habitats."
"To that end, it is vital to involve the local communities, and especially those people involved in the sector."
"I therefore believe that the authorities, local firms and associations in the sector, with the help of the Community institutions, in addition to watching over the protected areas should also be responsible for the regular scientific monitoring of habitats, as well as for providing eco-friendly information and ensuring the professional conduct of those involved in fishing."
"It would certainly also be a good idea to encourage the productivity of small traditional businesses by giving them modern tools for researching, identifying and catching their resources, so as to promote greater catch selectivity in the marine environment and to make it possible for businesses like those to survive competition from industrial fishing fleets, particularly Japanese and US ones."
"Mr President, I must begin by saying how surprised I was to hear Mr Ribeiro, the rapporteur, speak in favour of amendments rejected by a majority of the Committee on Fisheries."
"I should now like to make it clear that our group will support the Commission’s proposal, namely the Ribeiro report, as it was adopted in the Committee on Fisheries."
"We shall be voting against the amendments tabled, for the reasons I am about to give."
"We are opposed to the inclusion of bottom set gill nets because, as everyone is aware, these are static nets. By their very nature, they do not erode the sea bottom."
"The amendment concerned refers to a possible biological disaster. At most, this could be linked to the loss of these nets and subsequent so-called ghost fishing As the Commissioner stated, there is no scientific data relating to areas or species."
"This is why I think it is somewhat flippant and a bad precedent to ban or attempt to ban gear of this kind in the areas in question."
"Indeed, to follow the arguments through, the gear would have to be banned from all Community waters. It would be interesting to see if those who are in favour of a ban in this case would also be in favour of a more general ban."
"On the basis of criteria derived from marine geology and biology, this amendment calls for the protected areas proposed by the Commission to be replaced by the 200-mile political criterion. It should be pointed out that, rightly or wrongly, that criterion is no longer relevant to fisheries management under Community law."
"I must emphasise once again that coral reefs are not located exclusively within a 200-mile radius from the Canary Islands, Madeira and the Azores. The scientific community accepts that coral reefs are generally found around a 1 000 metre bathymetric line."
"In accordance with the precautionary principle, the Commission has therefore gone up to the 1 500 metre bathymetric line These lines do not of course tally with political and administrative demarcations. In addition, in this particular instance, the zones designated by the European Commission extend beyond the 200-mile limit in some cases."
"Mr President, these are the reasons why our group will not support the amendments tabled."
"Mr President, I welcomed the Ribeiro report when it appeared, and recognised the rapporteur’s effort. This was because, along with the whole House, I believe it is important to protect deep-water coral reefs."
"I am bound to say, however, that I have been very surprised at some of the comments made by the rapporteur subsequently. I endorse what Mrs Fraga has just said, and can only hope that little flags similar to those evident elsewhere in the Chamber do not suddenly appear in front of Mr Ribeiro."
"I must emphasise that we do not support either the first or the second part of Amendment No 7."
"We certainly support the Commission’s proposal, but we cannot agree to the addition of bottom set gill nets without any scientific justification. The Commission’s proposal makes a reference to bottom set gillnets or similar gear."
"We believe that the addition of bottom set gill nets with no further qualification could be very detrimental to certain fleets. It could also act as a dangerous precedent."
"We do not support the second part of the amendment either. This is because it seeks to replace maritime locations established by the Commission on the basis of scientific criteria with a reference to waters under the jurisdiction of Member States."
"Mr President, deep-water coral reefs are a resource which deserves our protection."
"According to the United Nations, deep-water coral reefs are a vulnerable habitat which require special attention."
"ICES advises that the only way to protect cold-water habitats from fishing damage is to map the habitats precisely and to close those areas to the forms of fishing that cause damage."
"The only way to protect deep-water coral reefs is to prohibit the use of bottom trawls and similar gears."
"It was early this year that this House recognised deep-water coral reefs, when the Darwin Mounds, off the north-west coast of Scotland, were given special status as an area of conservation."
"Now we turn to the other deep-water coral reefs off the Canary Islands and around Madeira and the Azores, and I hope there will be continuation of protection to those areas on a permanent basis."
"Deep-water coral reefs should not be destroyed by bottom trawling, but should be protected for future generations to enjoy."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too essentially want to express my support for Mr Ribeiro’s report and the proposals it contains."
"Ensuring the sustainability of marine biological resources is also the best way to protect the most threatened of all species in certain parts of the Union: the human species itself."
"Many of the fishing communities in some coastal areas of the Union, such as the Azores or Madeira, do not have any other alternatives at all for their livelihoods or their survival."
"In this case, it is the Commission itself that acknowledges that we are dealing with very sensitive ecosystems that are highly endangered and require urgent protection, particularly since there is a considerable lack of information about them."
"The simple acknowledgment of such facts is more than enough reason to adopt any preventive measures that might stop the destruction of those habitats."
"The proposals put forward by the rapporteur are a step in that direction."
"They will therefore gain my vote and I appeal to this House to vote for them as well."
". Mr President, I welcome the generally positive comments on the proposal, and will respond very briefly to some of the criticisms made."
"On the possible damage by fishing other than trawls: according to the ICES 2003 report, trawls are the main cause of damage to deep-water coral reefs."
"There is little evidence of passive gear damaging coral reefs, although ICES mentions some of these effects."
"The Commission is ready to amend its proposal if there is new scientific evidence or if the Member States agree on such an amendment."
"With regard to the point concerning the extension of the protective zone to the whole EEZ, I would underline that the proposal delimited an area that includes most of the submarine mountains that have been kept in good condition."
"Extending the zone of prohibition would add insignificant protection and would therefore run counter to the principle of proportionality."
"Having said that, I would also refer to the question of the exclusive competence of the Commission with regard to marine resources, which is found in the Constitution and to which reference has been made."
"This is a principle which was already established by European Court of Justice case law, and all the Constitution does is to codify it."
"However, the Commission does not deny the rights of Spain and Portugal over their European Economic Zone."
"It is just that there is no need to mention these rights of jurisdiction since the area of prohibition is delimited by topography and by geographical features."
"On the point made by Mrs Attwooll concerning the role of the regional advisory councils, there would be a legal problem and in order to accept that amendment the regulation on RACs would itself have to be amended."
"On another point made by Mrs Attwooll, the Commission has recently tabled a proposal on conditions for deep-water fishing, which will lend protection to these important resources."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"I should like to welcome a delegation from the parliament of Serbia and Montenegro, who have come to Strasbourg in order to take part in their first interparliamentary meeting with the European Parliament, and who are seated in the official gallery."
"The delegation is led by the parliament’s president, Mr Zoran Sami."
"I hope that this event marks the beginning of fruitful cooperation between our two institutions."
"The next item is the vote."
"(1)"
"Mr President, I should like to give notice of some technical amendments before the vote. I have been mandated to do so by the Committee on Budgets."
"I refer to Budget Line 15 03 01 02 – Leonardo da Vinci Programme, where the amount shown under commitments should be modified to read EUR 205 366 880."
"In Budget Line 19 09 03 – Aid to displaced persons in Latin American countries, the relevant amount from the reserve should be entered, namely EUR 54 500 less than the amount given in Document 12."
"I trust the House will agree to these amendments."
"If there are no objections, Mr Garriga Polledo’s technical amendments are accepted."
"Mr President, there is nothing secret about the statement I now make on the basis of Rule 157; on the contrary, I make it openly."
"Our group has had a discussion about the amount to be approved under item 3."
"This has to do with a great gathering in the Rhineland, from which I come, where the Catholic Church, among other bodies, is organising a great gathering of young people."
"I myself am familiar with this meeting, having once been able, in another capacity, to take part in it."
"It is a good thing."
"This meeting is to include a state visit by the Pope."
"His Holiness will be attending this meeting, and what we would like to be certain of is that the gathering’s organisers are asked to provide the EU institutions with documentary confirmation that none of this money will be used to fund the Pope’s state visit."
"The Vatican itself will have to pay for that."
"Mr President, this is a point of order under the same Rule under which you allowed Mr Schulz to speak."
"I should like to note that this is a clear violation of the Rules of Procedure, as well as of the principles of good taste."
"Mr Schulz appears not to understand that the spirit and ethical and moral principles exist alongside the law."
"I should like to remind Mr Schulz of this fact."
"The budget is approved."
"Does the Council wish to comment, or is it satisfied with Parliament’s approval?"
". Mr President, you have proceeded to your second reading on the 2005 budget – the first full budgetary year of the European Union of 25 Member States and of the implementation of the new Staff Regulations."
"I am pleased to note that the agreement reached between our two institutions during the conciliation meeting on 25 November 2004 has now been included in the 2005 budget."
"It is very important that for the first year of the new term of this Parliament the two arms of the budgetary authority were able to reach global agreement last November."
"It is a positive signal for the future, both for interinstitutional cooperation and for a good budget for the European Union."
"That is why I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lewandowski, and the two rapporteurs, Mr Garriga Polledo and Mrs Jensen."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner, Mrs Grybauskaitė, whose role I have appreciated very much."
"The Council can accept the maximum rate of increase resulting from your second reading."
"Thank you very much, Minister."
"Mr President, I should like to table an oral amendment to Recital A very briefly – . The amendment involves entering the relevant amounts."
"I shall read it in Spanish:"
"‘A. whereas the Budget for 2005 as adopted by the Parliament amounts to EUR 116 554 135 698 in commitments, which represents an increase of 6.1% on the 2004 budget; and EUR 106 300 000 000 in payments, which represents an increase of 4.4% on the 2004 Budget; whereas this level of payments represents 1.004% of estimated GNI for the year 2005, compared to 1.08% as established by the Financial Perspective, a difference of EUR 7 935 million,’"
"Mr President, could you slow matters down, because the translations, which are being relayed, are reaching us at the time of the following vote?"
"Take account of the translations intended for the new Member States, which are not done as quickly as those for the old Member States."
"(2)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give a very brief explanation of why our group has withdrawn its support for this joint motion for a resolution."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament was opposed in principle to this procedure, it being our belief that the Commission should first present its programme, with Parliament then stating its position with respect to it."
"We did not manage to get this accepted by the Conference of Presidents and the procedure was adopted."
"Up to a certain point, we were able to support the wording of the resolution as it stands; it also includes many points that we can live with and accept."
"There are, however, a number of essential elements in this text that lead us in this Group – after a long debate yesterday evening – to believe at present that it is the Commission that should first state its position on these points rather than Parliament."
"We therefore want to adopt the procedure that is normal in every Member State, under which the government first presents its programme and the parliament then states where it stands on it."
"That is what should be done in this instance too, and so we now expect the Commission to present its programme."
"We will not be participating in this vote."
"Mr President, if the Socialist Group has been able to say what it thinks about this procedure under Rule 152, then other groups should also be allowed to do so."
"We are very disappointed that the PSE Group has withdrawn its name from the joint text, even though it was negotiated by two of their vice-chairmen."
"We also hope that the PSE Group realises that by voting against the compromise it is taking the risk that Parliament will not have a position on the new Commission's strategic policy objectives."
"Does the PSE Group really want this to happen and spoil the reputation of the European Parliament?"
"I think the House has been enlightened by the positions expressed by Mr Schulz and Mrs Ek."
"We support the idea of having a flexibility instrument in the EU budget in order to obtain a budgeting margin for purely unforeseen expenditure."
"The objectives must then be dealt with under separate arrangements."
"They may in themselves be of quite different kinds."
"For example, the Peace II programme is something justified in terms of its being an internal matter for the EU, while we are opposed to the EU’s being involved, as an organisation, in funding the reconstruction of Iraq."
"The Member States themselves must decide about such efforts in accordance with democratic decisions in each of those States."
". – As we all know, the flexibility instrument, which has a ceiling of EUR 200 million, is intended to allow financing in a given financial year of specifically identified expenditure which could not be financed within the ceilings available for one or more other headings."
"It is an extremely important mechanism for solving emerging needs."
"In the specific case of this year, I also consider it essential that the European Union should mobilise the flexibility instrument to finance the Community’s involvement in the rehabilitation, reconstruction and stabilisation of Iraq, as pledged at the Madrid Ministerial Conference, and also to support the peace consolidation process in the Republic of Ireland, which has been experiencing growing instability."
"With regard to the issue of the decentralised agencies, I believe the time has come to find a structural solution to the ever-increasing volume of funding that they need, and to reconcile their funding with the needs of internal policies."
"Overall, I voted in favour."
". – This proposal to reject the budget for 2005, which my group put forward and to which I made a significant contribution, is not only appropriate but also consistent."
"It helps to clarify the responsibilities of those political forces which deal out criticism but do not match it with action."
"I therefore regret the rejection of the rejection."
"The proposal for rejection is appropriate, because this is the first full year of the enlarged EU, with its additional cohesion requirements, and a key year in the debate on the Financial Perspectives for 2007-2013."
"It is therefore unacceptable to produce a Community budget for 2005 that has only been set above 1% of the Community GNI (by thousandths of a per cent) for psychological reasons, while it hides its clear concordance with the objectives of the signatories to the ‘Letter of the Six’ to continue the 2004 budget, the lowest in relative terms since 1987."
"It is consistent, because we previously tabled a rejection of the budget for 2000 at the beginning of the current financial framework, and five years later our criticisms have been confirmed: insufficient funds for economic and social cohesion; underfunding and a lack of suitable programmes in the employment, social, environmental and cooperation fields; problems of execution and lack of transparency; and especially a budget subordinated to the dictates of the Stability and Growth Pact and to making ‘savings’, so as to finance enlargements as well as other priorities, such as war and propaganda, with the same financial resources."
"Many thanks, Mr President."
"I should like to explain that I voted in favour of Amendment No 127 in Section III on funding for World Youth Day, because this does not form part of an official state visit. Instead it is a meeting of young European Christians with the most noble of goals."
"If it were not for Mr Schulz’s ideological obstinacy, he would be able to see how much Europe could benefit from a meeting between its young people and the Holy Father."
"If it were not for Mr Schulz’s ideological obstinacy and reluctance to take an honest approach to the issue, he would not have confused it with an official visit by a head of state, namely the Pope’s visit to the Federal Republic of Germany."
". – I took an active role in the conciliation meetings which reached agreement on the European Union budget for 2005."
"That is good reason to feel proud and satisfied."
"Failure of the negotiations on the enlarged EU’s first budget would have been a terrible political signal to send out to Europe’s citizens."
"It would have been a sign of our inability to govern ourselves with 25 Member States."
"All Community policies will be duly funded in 2005, in accordance with the established priorities."
"Compared with 2004, this budget will have an increase of 6.5% and will rise above the symbolic value of 1% of GNI."
"The Council, Parliament and the Commission have agreed to a statement by which the level of payments will be examined in mid-2005 and, if necessary, the budget lines in question will be supplemented."
"Portugal’s priorities are taken into account financially in 2005."
"There is greater provision for regional and cohesion policy, as well as for the common agricultural policy with its pilot projects, and there are more funds for concluding agreements on fisheries."
"A budget is evidence of the credibility of the objectives that have been set out."
"It is pointless to make grand political statements without providing the funding to put such intentions into practice."
"The budget for 2005 is therefore a credible instrument."
"The budget resolution states that the European Parliament regrets the Council’s comprehensive reduction in payments in the agricultural sphere."
"We, Mr Andersson, Mrs Hedh, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, Mrs Segelström and Mrs Westlund, do not agree with this."
"We see no reason for wanting, in the agricultural sphere, to increase payments further in relation to the Council’s proposal."
". The Moderate delegation has today abstained from voting in the final vote on the resolution."
"The resolution contains much that is laudable in our view but, because we voted against quite a few of the proposed expenditure increases in the vote on the figures for the budget, it was impossible for us fully to support the resolution’s conclusions."
"We do not agree with the general criticism made of the Council for having reduced the size of the budget."
"That is particularly the case regarding agricultural aid. We are pleased that the Council is taking a step in the right direction by reducing this."
"We believe, however, that agricultural policy is in need of radical reform and we should therefore have preferred there to have been further reductions."
"We chose to vote in favour of Mr Garriga Polledo’s and Mrs Jensen’s report in spite of paragraph 2, which regrets the Council’s reduction in payments to agriculture."
"That is a paragraph we cannot support."
"It is unacceptable for the same budgetary line to contain two items of funding as distinct as that for the sixtieth anniversary of the end of fascism and that for the Pope’s visit to Cologne."
"I dare to hope that this bizarre collusion is not the result of any shameful bargaining."
"The gathering of young people that the latter event would attract must not be funded from the European budget, but by the Catholic Church, which the event will serve to promote."
"I am voting against this expenditure at a time when so many other spontaneous initiatives by young people do not manage to benefit from European credits."
". – Our position is clear and well known: we are against the war and the US-British occupation in Iraq and we demand the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces from that country."
"That position justifies rejection of the proposal that the European Union should finance the reconstruction of Iraq out of its Community budget."
"Of course, we support the increase in humanitarian and food aid to the Iraqi population, but we cannot accept that our aid should be used to legitimise what happened or to benefit the aggressor."
"Leaving aside positions of principle, it is unacceptable that that aid should be financed to the detriment of the European Union’s cooperation and development policy – in other words, at the expense of the less developed countries – just as it is also unacceptable that there should be no multiannual framework programme, as there was in the case of the Balkans."
"We are aware that this report deals with the kind of funding to adopt or, in other words, how to mobilise an extra EUR 185 million which would otherwise have to be found by redeployment from other budget headings."
"We are also aware that the additional amounts will be used to finance the PEACE programme and the decentralised agencies, and that the agreed amounts are less than what is needed and will not solve the funding requirements."
"The June List rejects Parliament’s draft budget for 2005, which involves the EU’s commitments increasing to 1.24% of the EU countries’ anticipated gross domestic income."
"We believe that the commitments for 2005 definitely should not exceed the Commission’s proposal of 1.14%."
"Even though the payments still do not exceed 1% of gross domestic income, these will gradually increase to the level of the commitments in the 2005 budget."
"This forms the point of departure for the long-term financial framework."
"That is why it is important to come down to a lower level by no later than 2005."
"The aim should be to come down below the expenditure ceiling of 1% of gross domestic income."
"Below is a selection of proposed cut-backs:"
"* We believe that the EU should begin cutting back on agricultural aid by no later than 2005."
"* The subsidy to EU political parties should be completely abolished."
"* The subsidy for tobacco cultivation should be abolished."
"It should be the responsibility of the individual countries successfully to help the farmers concerned convert to other crops."
"* The subsidy for information provision can be reduced because we believe it to be difficult, politically, to provide objective information prior to the referendums on the Constitution."
"We believe it is the responsibility of the individual countries and of the political parties in these countries to provide such information."
"The EU should avoid interfering in the democratic process in the Member States."
"The Danish Liberal Party’s Members of the European Parliament – Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, Mr Busk and Mrs Jensen – voted against Amendment No 3, tabled by the Independence and Democracy Group."
"The Liberal Party is in favour of reforming the payment of travel expenses in such a way that all reasonable and necessary travel expenses are refunded."
"That is not something that will be guaranteed by this amendment."
". – Consistent with our proposal to reject the Community budget for 2005, we voted against this report, which reflects the degree of hypocrisy and whitewashing that has run through the budgetary procedure that is now ending."
"Parliament is criticising the Council, complaining that it is reducing payments in agriculture, that it does not accept its proposals, that it is unwilling to assess the needs of the European agencies and that it has forced it to make cuts compared with first reading; more than enough reasons for rejecting it."
"Despite this scenario, Parliament welcomes the agreement reached with the Council at the conciliation of 25 November and whitewashes the procedure by claiming that, thanks to its efforts, ‘drastic cuts were avoided’ and its traditional priorities were retained, which is manifestly untrue."
"Unfortunately, that has been the story of all the budgetary procedures since 2000. In that time, the flexibility instrument has been used five times in a row, thereby justifying the Portuguese Communist Party’s proposal to review the current financial perspective."
"Every year, Parliament accepts terms that call even its budgetary powers into question, for the sake of the sacrosanct Stability Pact."
"That begs the question, then, of why it wants to strengthen its powers if it does not make use of them."
". – I wish to reiterate the comments already made at first reading, regretting that this draft budget for the financial year 2005 should, overall, total only 1.004% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the 25 European Union Member States."
"I should like it to be more ambitious, as is essential after the accession of ten new Member States, and to make sense of the discourse of those who say they want to develop institutional Europe by moving into new policies and areas of responsibility."
"In view of the negotiations as a whole, however, and the real economic and financial difficulties of the current situation, I would highlight certain results that were achieved in the difficult conciliation process. I believe it is significant that we have got past the psychological threshold of the 1% imposed in the ‘Letter of the Six’, even if only by a tiny amount."
"I consider certain advances to have been positive, namely in the area of maritime safety (particularly pollution) and the maintenance of the framework of structural policies and external policies, especially in development aid; I also welcome the special relationships with ACP countries."
"The rapporteur’s comments are realistic and point to a certain inconsistency in the project announced in the Commission’s proposal, that this would be the budget of ‘competitiveness and cohesion’."
"I expect something much better from the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013."
"We believe that the European Union’s policy on fisheries agreements needs to be revised."
"Over-exploitation of fishing waters forces people into even greater poverty and robs the marine environment of a vital link in the food chain."
"It would be better if those countries with which the EU enters into fisheries agreements were instead to be given assistance so that they themselves might develop their own fishing industries."
"We do not accept amendments whereby the Commission would be given an independent source of income."
"We believe that, if the EU concludes a fisheries agreement with a third country, the total amount of financial compensation for this third country must be funded by those EU Member States whose fishing vessels make use of what is offered under the agreement in question."
"The Member States should pay in proportion to the size of their catches."
"These Member States must then each decide for themselves whether they, in turn, will fund this expenditure by taxing their respective fishing vessels."
". – I voted for this report because of the importance of the issue of fisheries to Portugal, specifically in the case of international fisheries agreements in which the Portuguese fishing industry has a direct interest."
"My vote was also based on the fact that an extension of the existing protocol is on the table and the suggested amendments do not damage national interests in any way."
". – This proposal is about addressing the period between the expiry of the protocol attached to the fisheries agreement between the European Union and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros and the date by which the Commission believes the assessments needed to renegotiate the agreement will have been completed."
"In view of the considerable activity by the Community fleet in that marine area (40 tuna seiners and 25 surface longliners), the proposed solution is to extend the previous agreement until a new fisheries protocol has been concluded."
"Extension will not mean any change to the terms and restrictions of the previous protocol, and the financial compensation and fishing opportunities for the Member States will be maintained."
"As the Portuguese fleet has fishing opportunities for five surface longliners in that area, it is important that Portugal should support this extension and press for a favourable renegotiation of the agreement."
"I voted for the report."
". – I am delighted at the decision that Article 67 of the Treaty can be fully implemented, so that topics under Title IV, such as immigration, asylum and border controls, can be decided by qualified majority voting under the codecision procedure."
"We improve efficiency and we strengthen the role of this Parliament, guaranteeing the principle of democratic legitimacy, which is fundamental for the adoption of legislation on topics as sensitive as asylum and immigration policy and others that involve people’s fundamental rights."
"I support Mr Bourlanges’s report as well as the two concrete proposals that he makes, because:"
"- codecision and qualified majority voting on legal immigration are essential for the management of the Union’s migration policy."
"With the signing of the Constitution on 29 October 2004, it was made clear that the measures laid down on legal immigration must not affect the Member States’ right to determine the number of third country nationals they can admit to their territories for the purpose of seeking work there."
"- the restrictions on the Court’s competences in Title IV that were introduced at Amsterdam, as there were fears of too much work and excessive delays, do not make sense either, given the introduction at Nice of Article 225(a)…"
". Legislation on asylum and immigration policy has for years been profoundly undemocratic."
"One thing the Treaty of Amsterdam did was to transfer legislative powers in this area from the Member States to the EC, thus taking it out of the hands of national parliaments; another was to hand it over to the Council exclusively, and hence to the assembled national executives, with Parliament’s involvement limited to the stating of positions."
"In an area such as this, with such considerable implications for fundamental rights, it is untenable that the executive should make law in this way."
"This draft Council decision on the adoption of the codecision procedure is thus a long overdue step towards giving Parliament a greater say in legislation."
"At the same time, though, the Council is planning to reserve again certain areas exclusively to the executive."
"This is precisely what the Bourlanges report criticises, and that is why I endorse the report."
"What I see as problematic about this report, however, is that it insists upon a provision in the Constitution whereby Member States can unilaterally bar third-country nationals from gaining access to the labour market."
"When I was a member of the Constitutional Convention, I was critical of this rule, which was introduced into the Constitution by the German Government."
"Not only does it reflect national egoisms, but also – and this is a much more serious matter – it runs counter to the principle that workers should enjoy freedom of movement in a common Europe."
"In my judgement, this provision is one of the first things that should be submitted to scrutiny after the Constitution has entered into force."
". – The rapporteur sought to propose that the Court of Justice should have its competence broadened through the revocation of Article 68 of the EC Treaty. That was an addition to the proposal for a Council decision, in that several areas of Title IV, Part III of the EC Treaty (visas, asylum, immigration and other policies concerning the free movement of persons) would then be governed by Article 251 of the EC Treaty."
"As I have already argued on other occasions, I think that the Union should gradually consolidate its competences and practices rather than try to satisfy a constant appetite for new competences."
"Every proposal deals with sensitive material, and the report’s addition suffers from the maximalism typical of a centralising Europe, even though that path does not enjoy popular support."
"I am not sure that the proposed revocation would strengthen the legal protection of European citizens and third country nationals in the slightest, as Mr Bourlanges claims it would."
"I believe, rather, that it would have exactly the opposite effect."
"I think Parliament would do better if it confined itself to supporting the proposal for a decision as presented – which in itself represents a major, ambitious advance for the area of freedom, security and justice – and if it could refrain from embarking on this unhealthy, voracious pursuit of ‘what lies beyond’."
"The measures proposed in the report – those designed to strengthen democracy, human rights and the function of the constitutional state in third countries – are badly required and often necessary."
"We wonder, however, whether these measures should be implemented by the EU."
"With its long experience and global importance, the UN is better placed to implement them."
"We also object to the large sum of money – approximately EUR 225 million – appropriated for these efforts for the period 2005-2006."
"The objectives and the efforts concerned are not clearly defined or limited, and experience of the EU’s ability to use such money is not encouraging."
"For these reasons, we choose to vote against the report."
". – The subject of the Commission’s proposal, which the rapporteur endorses, is to maintain until the end of 2006 a legal basis and a financial framework for operations to protect and promote human rights and democratic principles in developing countries and other third countries."
"I voted for it because I consider that to do so would be both extremely useful and thoroughly justified at a time when very important questions regarding the Community’s foreign policy are at stake."
". – Community funding under the present regulation takes the form of subsidies or contracts, which the Commission is proposing should also be extended to corporate bodies where appropriate. I agree with that."
"Participation by civil society should be supported, regardless of the kind of the institutional structure involved in each individual case."
"It is imperative that the European Union should continue, improve and intensify the actions described in the Commission communication of 8 May 2001 entitled ‘The European Union’s role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries’."
"The European Union is the last window of hope in the eyes of many people."
"As the Committee on Foreign Affairs demonstrated (with only one abstention), we must therefore provide the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) with all possible instruments to fulfil its objectives, focusing primarily on support for democratisation, good governance and the rule of law."
"For the rest, I refer to the speech I made yesterday during the debate in the House."
"I voted for the report, of course."
"Mr President, I will be very brief."
"I wanted to say that I voted in favour of the report and that I hope we will be able to make considerable progress in this area in future."
"I also addressed a question to the new Commission about this, suggesting the introduction of civilian service for young people in the European Union – whether male or female – primarily to create the right conditions in such situations, resulting in a greater sense of responsibility and awareness among the people in the European Union, not only when disasters strike, but also during a civilian service designed to increase solidarity."
"As I have said, I am generally in favour of this report and am glad that further work is to be done along these lines."
"I have voted against the Papadimoulis report today. A look back reveals this to be consistent with my past voting."
"The reason is that, in my opinion, the Community action programme does not pass the subsidiarity test."
"The Member States all have their own civil-protection programmes and their own coordination, training and assistance programmes."
"Some European cooperation is in order, but a separate European centre with its own powers and 24-hour monitoring is unnecessary."
"Besides, the financial basis for the proposal is flawed, which is a second reason for me to withhold my support for this proposal."
". Natural disasters such as floods, heat-waves, forest fires, earthquakes, environmental disasters caused by toxic waste release, toxic industrial accidents, serious industrial accidents and terrorist attacks are, by nature, extremely unpredictable, and consequently claim countless victims and cause significant economic damage."
"What we must do is work together and exchange information, streamline resources, carry out research and seek technical solutions that limit the damage as far as possible, but most importantly, we must pursue a policy of investing in prevention and education involving political institutions at Community, national, regional and local level and all civil society organisations in a unified, responsible and differentiated partnership."
"People say, in their infinite wisdom, that ‘prevention is better than cure’, and this dictum aptly applies to the forest fires that devastated Portugal in the summers of 2003 and 2004 and to the oil spills from the and tankers."
"We welcome the fact that the Community action plan in the field of civil protection has been extended and that its budget has been increased, but we also feel that this is an issue that, in light of its permanent nature, should not be subject to time constraints."
"Civil protection intervention also falls under the category of mainstreaming: based on new agricultural models and land-use planning that humanises urban and industrial growth..."
"There is a significant risk of the financial resources provided going on administration and of the resources thus not being coordinated efficiently enough."
"Although we are very well disposed towards different countries showing solidarity with one another when disasters occur, we do not believe that this is primarily an issue for the EU, but that the Member States’ respective national parliaments should decide what financial resources should be provided when a serious accident occurs in another Member State."
". – We would like to observe that financing of actions for natural and man-made disasters is so limited that, essentially, it cancels out any possibility of material intervention and efficiency."
"For us, damage prevention is more important than cure, by which we mean supporting policies, actions and infrastructures which limit damage and losses in the event of disaster."
"However, how can this happen when everything is judged by depressing financial criteria and the interests of big business?"
"When a series of public competences is transferred to private individuals, how can anyone talk seriously of the adoption of a fundamental policy of protection against any sort of disaster?"
"When no money is available for anti-flood works, when anti-earthquake standards are not met, when forests are left at the mercy of arsonists and land cannibals, when shipowners remain unaccountable and unpunished after huge ecological disasters, what protection can we talk of?"
"How can efficient civil protection be organised when public goods and services needed in critical situations, such as the fire brigade, are being transferred to private individuals or turned into repressive mechanisms?"
"And then, what use is being made of even these crumbs of so-called 'restitution?"
"If you want a silencing answer, ask the victims of the 1999 earthquake in Greece still living in containers."
". I should like to congratulate Mr Papadimoulis on his excellent report on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 1999/847/EC as regards the extension of the Community action programme in the field of civil protection."
"The aim is to ensure continuity in this area until a new legal instrument enters into force."
"The purpose of this programme is to protect the citizens, the environment and property in the event of natural or man-made disasters throughout the Community, by making available additional support from the other participating countries when national response capacities are overwhelmed."
"Since this programme was adopted, we have seen its effectiveness and the need for action at European level, not least when the was shipwrecked and during the fires of summer 2003."
"Furthermore, the report highlights seven areas in which the programme could be improved, most importantly those of cooperation, exchange of information and increased resources."
"I should also like to express my support for increasing the annual budget for this programme to EUR 2.4 million per year in 2005 and 2006."
"Given that the Community’s civil protection programme currently in force expires on 31 December of this year, I believe that it would be entirely appropriate for the programme to be extended for two years to fill the gap between the expiry of the existing programme and the entry into force of the new instrument. I regret, however, that the programme is to be extended without the necessary reviews of the period 2000-2004 being carried out."
"On the other hand, the increased funding requested by the Commission is realistic and, in the case of Portugal, particularly important."
"I therefore voted in favour."
". Various disasters, such as the accident, the forest fires, particularly in my country, and the floods in the South of France have demonstrated the need for action at European level."
"The scale of some disasters often overwhelms national response capacities. Mechanisms at European level, such as the one created by the current programme, are therefore becoming increasingly justified."
"The proposal takes a step in this direction, providing for an increase of EUR 1.5 million in 2004 to EUR 2.4 million per year in 2005 and 2006."
"I welcome this development, which forms part of the strengthened cooperation in the area of civil protection, which the EU began to address in the first Community Action Programme in the field of Civil Protection adopted in 1997, the most significant development of which was the creation of the Solidarity Fund for major disasters in November 2002."
"The Monitoring and Information Centre is very important, as it provides Member States or third countries with somewhere to send requests for assistance."
"A permanent network of contacts has thus been set up within the Commission aimed at establishing uninterrupted contact between the civil protection centres in the participating countries and at promoting the exchange of information."
". The Commission’s proposal is to ban the use of bottom trawls in certain areas that include the seamounts with the most sensitive habitats in the 200 miles around the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands."
"Similar restrictions are already in place in an area of Northwest Scotland."
"I feel that we must go further, and also ban the use of bottom gillnets."
"Indeed, this type of net also causes serious damage to ecosystems, particularly in the Azores exclusive economic zone, due to the volcanic and rocky nature of its seabed."
"Various studies have confirmed the sensitive nature of deep-water habitats, such as the deep-water coral reef, thermal vents and feeding grounds for fish of sea banks and seamounts."
". I wish to offer my wholehearted support for the Commission’s proposal amending Regulation (EC) No 850/98, of 30 March, as regards the protection of deep-water coral reefs from the effects of trawling in certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean (COM (2004)58 F)."
"I applaud the Commission for tabling this proposal, because in so doing the Commission is keeping its promise to propose an amendment to the technical measures in force in the Community aimed at banning the use of bottom trawl gear up to at least 200 miles around the outermost regions of the Azores, Madeira and the Canaries, with the aim of protecting ecosystems in some of the most sensitive areas located at the ‘seamounts’ outside 100 miles."
"The deep-water habitats that the Commission’s proposal is targeting were until recently protected from trawling (use of bottom trawl or similar towed nets operating in contact with the bottom of the sea), due to the special access regime laid down in accession negotiations."
"This regime ceased to apply in August 2004, and so it was essential to guarantee the continuity of the protection of these areas as part of Community legislation."
". The protection of the deep-water coral reefs in the Atlantic Ocean is, naturally, of special interest to Portugal."
"The proposal is to ban the use of bottom trawling in the waters of the Azores and Madeira, as well as in the Canary Islands, in order to protect deep-water coral reefs, which are of enormous importance in terms of protecting biodiversity."
"It is estimated that 65% of fish species in the sea are dependent on reefs at some point in their life."
"In light of this need for effective protection, we are in favour of extending the ban to bottom gillnets, which also cause serious damage to those ecosystems due to ghost fishing."
"Whilst I am not satisfied with the final result of the vote on the amendments, I wholeheartedly welcome what this report has achieved, and therefore voted in favour."
". The proposal for a regulation before us seeks to ban the use of bottom trawling in the most environmentally sensitive areas in the first 200 sea miles around the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands."
"I broadly support the proposed measures and feel that it is vitally important that the specific characteristics of each area are properly taken into account."
"Accordingly I also supported the amendment proposals aimed at also banning bottom gillnets, and deeply regret that this measure was not incorporated into the final version drawn up by the committee concerned, contrary to the rapporteur’s recommendation."
"Along with various Members of this House, I have campaigned for it to be reinstated and adopted in plenary."
"It is well known that this kind of net is extremely harmful to ecosystems, particularly given the overwhelming probability of ghost fishing."
"In the particular case of the Azores, the risk is all the greater given the volcanic nature of the seabed."
"It therefore made no sense only to go halfway towards protection."
". This is yet another resolution in which the Portuguese socialists (PS), social democrats (PSD) and popular right (CDS-PP), using language sprinkled with obfuscations and omissions, reaffirm – together! – their policy options and the EU’s fundamental axes, namely neoliberalism, federalism and militarism."
"Not surprisingly, they reaffirm – all together! – the ‘promotion of ‘increased competitiveness’ as its ‘top priority’ – or, to spell it out, capitalist competition; their support for the ‘Lisbon Strategy’ – alongside Europe’s major employers; ‘the improvement of labour markets’ – the cynical name for attacks on workers’ rights; ‘the reform of the pensions scheme’ – in other words its gradual privatisation; ‘the achievement of the single market’ – or to put it more succinctly, the liberalisation of energy, transport and telecommunications, among many others."
"It is a package that is ‘nicely’ wrapped up in the language of concern for social issues and of good intentions, a package that seeks to cover up its contradictions and the true nature of the right-wing policy effectively pursued at EU level, with the devastating impact that it has."
"The PS, PSD and CDS-PP can try all they like to deflect attention from, or hide, their broad understanding, yet reality is giving the game away."
"Let us keep that in mind, in Portugal, on 20 February of next year."
"There are a number of sensible points of view in the motion for a resolution, but also a number of proposals that it is impossible for us members of the June List to vote in favour of."
"In particular, we are opposed to the following four paragraphs of the motion for a resolution."
"Paragraph 20: ‘The European Parliament highlights the continuing need for action to strengthen the EU’s external borders, backed by the creation of a European corps of border guards’."
"Paragraph 21: ‘[The European Parliament] urges that a European Agency for fundamental rights be established to monitor their application effectively’."
"Last part of paragraph 33: ‘[The European Parliament] urges continued parallel reform of the common fisheries policy, including the creation of a European Fisheries Fund’."
"Paragraph 40 states: ‘[Parliament] believes that the Commission should draw up, as a matter of urgency, an appropriate communication and campaign strategy which presents the new Constitution to Europe’s citizens in as clear, fair and understandable a way as possible’."
"We would note that there are various views of what an ‘appropriate strategy’ is in this context."
"In view of the above, we definitely cannot vote in favour of this motion for a resolution."
". I voted in favour of the compromise motion for a resolution on the Commission’s political orientations and wish to highlight in particular the pact on the economic, social and territorial cohesion policies."
"As I have said on many occasions, I feel that cohesion policy is a guiding principle and the very backbone of the entire EU, without which the EU would lose its raison d’être."
"Without cohesion policies, the EU would be no more than a ‘hyper-market’, an instrument of subordination to the big and the dominant, in all fields."
"As one of the EU’s founding principles, the principle of cohesion is, moreover, a fundamentally Christian-Democratic concept."
"The Left is welcome to join us in this interpretation, but we must not leave it to the Left to advocate and defend principles that are ours."
"In other words, we must develop competitiveness, but without damaging cohesion; rather, we must make cohesion stronger."
"Mr President, as a substitute member of the Delegation to EU-Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee, I want to congratulate Mr Van Orden on his report and to note the very positive progress Bulgaria has made towards membership of the European Union."
"We hope they will be members in a few years' time."
"I want to enter one caveat: there is still serious evidence about the lack of professionalism of the Bulgarian judiciary and of its lack of independence."
"I would urge the Bulgarian Government to address those issues within the next year so that they can become members in 2007."
", . As we have repeatedly pointed out, the intrinsic economic and political aims of the current enlargement are there for all to see, and once again expressed in the resolution voted on just now."
"The resolution glosses over the fact that implementing neoliberal policies is a prerequisite for, and a backdrop to, EU accession, although it does mention the deified ‘functioning market economy’, which means capitalism and the domination and exploitation of an increasingly sizeable portion of that country’s economy by the large financial and economic groups."
"It also mentions ‘direct foreign investment’, which, to some people’s delight, has reached ‘record levels’, which means even greater domination of the Bulgarian economy by the large financial groups."
"Applauding Bulgaria’s efforts is at variance with the EU’s much-trumpeted aims."
"Economic and social cohesion cannot be built on the foundation of competition and the relocation of capital as a function of increasingly unbridled exploitation."
"That activity, which leaves unemployment and poverty in its wake – as evidenced by company relocations in Portugal – does not create genuine wealth in the country concerned."
"The resolution itself mentions that many people have not detected any improvement in their economic situation and that emigration continues."
". In common with the Commission, and with the report before us, I feel that Bulgaria has made the necessary progress towards EU accession, both at economic and at judicial level, although it should be acknowledged, among other similarly important issues, that crime, corruption and the trafficking of human beings must be combated more effectively."
"Against this backdrop, and given that the ongoing reforms can be achieved in time, I am in favour of the idea of Bulgaria joining the EU, depending on ‘own merits criteria’, and therefore feel that the Accession Treaty must be concluded in 2005 so that accession can take place in January 2007."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"Mr President, again I congratulate the rapporteur on his report and note with satisfaction the progress that Romania has made towards membership of the Community."
"However, I enter a different caveat this time: the situation of orphans and young children."
"The state of the homes in Romania is still unacceptable."
"I would again ask the Romanian Government to address this before membership."
"Finally, Mr President, I thank you and your excellent staff for all the cooperation through the year, and wish you a Merry Christmas."
". The report before us – following on from the previous ones – assesses progress from the perspective of the overwhelmingly neoliberal and capitalist nature of the enlargement process."
"It offers us a fairly extensive presentation of the criteria to be met and of the progress already made. It makes criticisms and offers praise in such a way that these countries end up viewing everything in terms of, and moving ever closer to, adopting and implementing a legal/institutional framework, the ‘Community ’, which acts as the foundation of the EU’s neoliberal model."
"Those who advocate this policy are so keen that they have no compunction about tabling proposals that clearly attempt to settle old scores with the history of the people’s struggle, and so here comes, for the thousandth time, the tired old devotion to ‘market economics’, ‘structural reforms’ within the framework of ‘competition’ and ‘market forces’, ‘implementing the process of privatisation’ and ‘dismantling unviable businesses’ and ‘creating an atmosphere that is conducive to business and to foreign investment’."
"These demands are constantly reiterated, albeit accompanied by hypocritical regret for their devastating impact on workers and the people."
"The Dutch delegation from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports the Moscovici report, with explicit reference to the strict agreements that have been made on monitoring the progress of reforms and their application, particularly in terms of the political criteria: human rights, corruption and the independence of the judiciary."
"The Dutch delegation from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will not hesitate to call on the Commission to apply the safeguards defined in the pre-accession strategy if Romania’s progress gives cause to do so."
"The Dutch delegation from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament reserves the right to adopt a different position in spring when it comes to the definitive decision on Romania’s accession, for instance if it should emerge that Romania’s new government has not kept its promises."
"That could mean ending the link between the accessions of Romania and Bulgaria."
". In February 2004, Parliament adopted a report that expressed regret that, despite some progress, Romania still had not completely satisfied the Copenhagen criteria."
"In the meantime, as we approach the end of this year, the consensus of opinion is that progress towards accession has been made, although it is recognised that there are still many areas in which this objective has yet to be met in full."
"It therefore makes complete sense for us to seek to negotiate the terms of the Treaty in 2005 and that a safeguard clause be inserted in case Romania’s accession has to be postponed until January 2008, which does, indeed, appear probable."
"Consequently, I voted in favour of the report."
". I should like Romania to be in a position to conclude negotiations as soon as possible, with a view to signing the EU Accession Treaty."
"I welcome the rapporteur’s recommendations and warnings. It is important that the Romanian authorities and the Romanian people are aware of the potential stumbling blocks of the accession process."
"Let me point out, in particular, that safeguard clauses can be implemented in the event that Romania falls well short of meeting conditions and that accession can be postponed for one year if the is not being implemented and the Copenhagen political criteria are not being complied with."
"I feel, however, that such warnings make no sense unless they serve to encourage good behaviour and good performance and never to set impossibly high thresholds."
"I particularly agree with the rapporteur’s idea that the Commission must create a permanent mechanism to closely monitor and assist Romania on this road and the Commission must, in my view, continue to provide Parliament with detailed information on how the country is progressing towards accession."
"The adoption of this report is particularly timely, following the way in which the presidential elections were conducted in Romania last Sunday."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"I should like to welcome the delegation from the Assembly of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, chaired by Mr Zaid bin Al-Muhsin Al-Hussein."
"The importance we attach to this visit, which is the first to the Chamber of the European Parliament since 1995, should be emphasised."
"This visit comes at a very significant moment, especially in view of the fact that Saudi Arabia will be holding its first local elections in February 2005."
"This visit constitutes a new stage in the deepening of relations between the Saudi people and the European Union."
"Mr President, we are very pleased about the holding of local elections in Saudi Arabia, but very much deplore the lack of participation by women."
"I declare the sitting resumed."
"The Minutes of yesterday’s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Just two brief points, Mr President, the first of which has to do with the vote on Turkey."
"During the vote on Turkey – on the Eurlings report – I voted in favour of Mr Langen’s Amendment No 16."
"That has not, however, been recorded; perhaps the machine was not working."
"I would ask you to correct that."
"Secondly, we voted yesterday on the EU-Russia summit."
"In so doing, we said that all sectors of Chechen society should be integrated into the peace process."
"I have learned today that the family of President Maskhadov, whose election took place under OSCE supervision, has been abducted and interned by the Russian secret services. They include his siblings, who are between 69 and 75 years of age."
"I would ask that you have this information verified and, if it proves to be accurate, protest to the Russian authorities about this."
"Your comments have been noted, Mr Posselt."
"If there are no further comments, the Minutes are approved."
"The next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, Zimbabwe is a land of tragedy and a land of tyranny."
"It is a country rich in natural resources and rich in the resources of its people."
"Both are being devastated by the political tyranny of the Mugabe regime."
"People are suffering from hunger and health problems as a result of food and medical aid being withheld from areas that are covered by the opposition parties."
"Some 9 million people, 75% of the Zimbabwean population, are now said to be living below the poverty line, but the World Food Programme is only able to provide food for 1.6 million people this December."
"That is the first reason why this is an urgency."
"The second reason is that on 3 March there is supposed to be an election in Zimbabwe."
"That election, on the present prospects, will be neither free nor fair."
"It is not up to us to decide who the people of Zimbabwe should elect."
"That is entirely for them, but they must be free to elect whomsoever they wish."
"It is up to the neighbouring countries of Africa and to the African Union to make sure that international standards of democracy pertain throughout Africa and throughout the country of Zimbabwe."
"It is up to the European Union to make sure that we support the monitoring of those elections, giving technical support and financial support, so that we can play our part in the international observer missions."
"That is also why it is an urgency today."
"The third reason is the intolerable attack on the liberty of Roy Bennett, one of their members of parliament, a man who has suffered, whose family has suffered and whose workers have suffered over the months."
"Mr Bennett pushed a government minister because he was making racial remarks about Mr Bennett and his family."
"He was then sent to prison, not by the courts, but by a vote in the parliament based on the political division."
"I urge that the AU and the EU act today to bring a semblance of justice to the people of Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, I have just returned from a private visit to Zimbabwe."
"It is interesting to note that the situation on the ground does not appear desperate."
"However, according to the statistics, the situation is probably worse in other parts of the country which I did not visit."
"When debating such countries as Zimbabwe, where human rights are not even discussed because of fear of repression, we must consider the right attitude to take in order to try to influence the powers that be."
"We know we are dealing with a regime that is not democratic, that has taken tried to use almost all its powers to take away the democratic and fundamental rights of part of its population."
"On the other hand, we have seen recently that there is a silver lining."
"The courts, for instance, are striving from a very difficult position to try to retain some form of impartiality."
"Sometimes I wonder whether a carrot-and-stick policy might be more appropriate and more fruitful than just passing motions of condemnation."
"We may pass this motion but what effect will it have?"
"Very little, I think, with a regime like Mugabe's."
"We must start to think in different terms if we are to be effective when dealing with a regime of this sort."
"Mr President, political oppression in Zimbabwe casts a long shadow; it is a cloud that lies over not only those living in Zimbabwe itself but also those who have left to seek asylum in Europe."
"In my constituency in the north-east of England, there are Zimbabweans who fear summary death if they are forced to return to their native land."
"I hope that Member State governments like my own, which think it is safe for asylum-seekers to be returned to Zimbabwe, will take note of the resolution tabled here this afternoon and revise their position."
"The situation in Zimbabwe is getting worse, not better."
"On 9 December 2004, the Non-Governmental Organisations Act came into force."
"This Act bans foreign human rights organisations and gives the government powers to intervene in the operations of any NGO in Zimbabwe."
"Meanwhile, the quality of life for Zimbabweans has plummeted."
"Life expectancy is now 35 years."
"Zimbabwe could be self-sufficient in food, but last season it produced only a third of the maize it needs; yet the Mugabe regime is interfering with the international distribution of food."
"In the light of this deteriorating situation, it is high time to tighten up targeted sanctions against the regime."
"A final point: as we have heard, next March Zimbabwe is due to hold a general election."
"There are worrying indications that this election may not be held in free and fair conditions."
"Electoral legislation passed earlier this month did not meet international democratic standards."
"Good observation of the elections is going to be a vital part of ensuring that they are free and fair."
"Therefore I hope that we in Parliament, and the Council and the Commission, will provide the maximum possible support for election-observer missions at all levels."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Zimbabwe has always experienced periods of complexity and profound division, whether under colonialism, at the time of Ian Smith’s Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 and the ensuing UN embargo, during the war of liberation from 1972 to 1978 and then, following independence, in the first democratic elections, which were won by ZANU under Robert Mugabe."
"For me, though, as an East German, it is always striking how often leaders who take office full of lofty ideals then, so to speak, distance themselves from their own original goals and visions and take less and less account of the people’s interests the longer they are in power."
"Zimbabwe does, of course, even today have massive problems to contend with. I believe that the only thing we can recommend to Zimbabweans today is to look around them and see how their neighbours have managed it – to look at what South Africa is doing, at what Namibia is doing, at how Angola and Mozambique are trying to establish a balance between the various vested interests in their countries."
"If there is to be peace, there must be an attempt at mutual understanding, with the use of peaceful means and every interest, even the most diverse, taken into account."
"Zimbabwe needs land reform, but there are other ways of going about it."
"The European Union should not always be, as it were, making recommendations to all and sundry on the basis of our values."
"Very often, that goes wrong; perhaps you all still recall the European Union’s staunch support for Russia’s President Yeltsin at a time when he was an alcoholic."
"In this actual instance, we can be confident that the SADC will have influence and find opportunities, and that the African Union can act to move things forward."
"I am convinced that we, if we support these countries in their efforts to influence Zimbabwe, will be very likely to be able to help the elections scheduled for March to be fair and democratic after all."
"– Mr President,the Mugabe regime’s strategy of forcing political opponents into line is continuing unabated."
"For example, the Zimbabwean authorities have forced two newspapers expressing critical views to close in the past 18 months."
"In addition, Mugabe’s supporters have made, and continue to make, life as difficult as possible for the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change."
"Undoubtedly with a view to the approaching parliamentary elections in March 2005, the Mugabe regime is increasing the pressure on independent organisations, judging by the Non-governmental Organisations Act adopted in Harare exactly a week ago."
"In future, these shall no longer be permitted to receive any funding from abroad."
"If a Zimbabwean civil liberties or human rights organisation has so much as one foreign employee on its staff, it is henceforth termed foreign."
"Pursuant to the new Act, foreign NGOs cannot be registered and will therefore be banned in the near future."
"The aim of this new legislation is clear."
"After all, numerous Zimbabwean civil liberties and human rights organisations rely on foreign donations."
"It is obvious that the intention of the Zimbabwean Government is to silence them."
"According to reports, the NGOs concerned are unwilling to submit to the Government’s attempt to gag them."
"That is an extremely courageous attitude."
"The Council and the Commission will have their work cut out to advise and assist them in this."
". – Mr President, Mrs Grybauskaitė, ladies and gentlemen, Zimbabwe is unfortunately one of the topics that figure most regularly, most frequently, in these Thursday debates that we hold on pressing human rights problems."
"This tells us two things: firstly, that the situation remains serious and, secondly, that the measures that we have adopted have not been working."
"What we must first condemn is the destruction of a country by an appalling authoritarian regime."
"As has been mentioned in this House, the poverty statistics are increasingly shocking; Zimbabwe used to be a country that, if properly managed, could not only have fed its entire population, but could also have helped to solve the problems of hunger and need on the African continent and in other parts of the world."
"The Mugabe regime, however, despite warnings from the EU and from further afield, continues to increase political oppression and we view the elections scheduled for March with great concern."
"Either the country undergoes a rapid transformation and offers even the slightest opportunity for debate or those elections will not be free and fair and one doubts whether it will even be worth observing them."
"Such is the case of Roy Bennette, of persecution perpetrated against Tsvangirai after his visit to this House, of the negative influence – and I wish to draw your attention to this – that the regime can have in the region, where regimes can choose to follow the path of democracy or to slip back into authoritarianism."
"I was recently in Mozambique, for example, where elections have been taking place. The count has yet to be completed."
"We became aware, however, that during the election campaign Mozambican voters voted abroad and that opposition parties – those opposed to FRELIMO – were persecuted in Zimbabwe."
"The conditions are in place, however."
"Zimbabwe’s destiny can decisively contribute towards consolidating the democracy that we hope for in the region, following the example of South Africa, thereby consolidating democratic aspirations in Mozambique and Angola. It may, on the other hand, represent a step backwards into forms of authoritarianism."
"I wish to point out that we have put increasing pressure on neighbouring countries and that we have developed dialogue with the African Union. This demonstrates the important role that that organisation has to play in exerting its form of pressure on Mugabe’s appalling regime."
". – Mr President, the Zimbabweans are a strong people, and Zimbabwe is a strong country."
"Following independence, it was also an economically promising country."
"It is sad to see that around 60% of the population is currently in financial crisis and frequently lives below the poverty line."
"That clearly says something about the administration of the country and what has gradually gone wrong with it."
"The sad thing is that Mugabe and the ZANU-PF party, particularly Mugabe’s inner circle, are the perpetrators."
"There are many in the ZANU-PF party, of course, who are very well aware of the need for outside help, of the need for the economy to develop in a different direction, if the country is to survive."
"We know that neighbouring countries have produced many informal contacts and endeavours to achieve a solution, and I think that it is precisely with these that the opportunities for the European Union lie."
"With the support of the African Union, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), President Mbeki and all the other contacts, we must increase the pressure, because it is only via the African route and the European Union’s connection with this that we stand a chance of achieving any kind of result."
"There is no doubt that the March elections have largely fallen into and been shaped by the wrong hands already, and it will be very difficult to make them fair and open."
"This renders observation close to pointless."
"Nevertheless, it is in that democratic process and in civil society that strength is to be found."
"That strength is still great in Zimbabwe, still non-violent and still oriented towards peace and democratic solutions."
"I hope that, by using smart sanctions, by taking the path that we, the European Union, are taking, and in consultation with those other countries, we shall do our utmost to take that democratic step there."
"The alternative path, bloodshed, offers no prospects."
"I sincerely hope that we can use all our diplomatic means to increase the pressure to such a degree that Mugabe is surrounded by people who set the dominoes falling."
"This is necessary if the democratic path is to stand a chance of success there."
"Indeed, it is my hope that Europe will make full use of all the means at its disposal to this end."
". – Mr President, a legacy of colonial Southern Rhodesia is that much of the Zimbabwean farmland is in the hands of a small group of farmers of European origin."
"My group supports the wishes of the black majority of the population for the return of most of the land to them."
"Unfortunately, that wish is being seriously abused by Robert Mugabe, the man once popular as the leader of the successful war of liberation against the colonial occupiers and the racist minority Government of Ian Smith."
"It was not until the electorate had almost lost its trust in him that he made the long-promised land reform a priority."
"For Mugabe, the expropriation of large farms is now principally an instrument to reward his old following of freedom fighters at last after decades of delay."
"Still more, it forms part of a campaign to eliminate political opponents by means of slurs, intimidation and coercion."
"If Europe isolates this regime, it must do so not on the basis of old colonial interests and old colonial arrogance, but because we want to help every country in the world promote human rights and democracy."
"That is what this is all about."
"– Every nation has the right and responsibility to resolve its political problems and no-one, let alone the European Union, Britain or the United States of America, has the credentials to intervene politically, economically or militarily either in Zimbabwe or in any other country."
"It is precisely because the people of Zimbabwe managed, through huge, bloody battles, to gain their independence from Britain and because they are claiming their land, the richest part of which still belongs to foreigners – mainly Britons – as a result of colonialism, that a new plan of intervention is being prepared, the aim of which is to turn Zimbabwe into a modern colony."
"On the pretext of any problems which exist, most of which are due to long-term delays as a result of colonialism, the governments of Britain and other countries are bankrolling the opposition, the leader of which, it should be noted, is accused of the attempted murder of the elected president."
"A network of so-called 'non-governmental organisations' is being set up, most of which are front organisations which have nothing to do with the grass-roots and social movement; they are there to prepare the ground for intervention."
"For the Communist Party of Greece, this motion is unacceptable; even the accusation of arms trading by British agents has been withdrawn."
"The sanctions must stop. We need to support the people of Zimbabwe in their fight to maintain their independence from neo-colonialism."
". Mr President, we in the Commission understand and take a very serious view of the preparations for the elections in March 2005."
"The Commission reiterates its attachment to the holding of free and fair elections in that country."
"The recent introduction by the government of Zimbabwe of a set of electoral reforms which are currently under discussion in the Zimbabwean parliament is an important step."
"It will have to be assessed whether this will lead to a genuine incorporation into domestic electoral legislation of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) principles and guidelines governing democratic elections, as unanimously agreed in the SADC Summit in Mauritius last August."
"The Commission remains deeply concerned about the current political and human rights situation and the respect for fundamental freedoms which at this stage would hardly allow for free and fair elections."
"A specific matter of concern is the approval by the Zimbabwean parliament, on 9 December, of the NGO Bill, which heavily restricts NGOs' room for action and activities."
"The Commission fully supports the proposed EU in Harare and other SADC capitals as well as the issuing of an EU declaration expressing concerns regarding the implications of the bill."
"The Commission is also worried about the risk of politicisation of the distribution of food aid, mainly in the context of the upcoming parliamentary elections."
"In the event of clear verification of partisan use, the Commission, together with its partners, including the WFP, may have to envisage suspending food aid operations."
"After the March elections the Commission will reassess the situation."
"Any lifting or easing of EU measures against Zimbabwe cannot be justified at this stage."
"The Commission is aware of the deliberate attempts by the Zimbabwean authorities to undermine the visa ban's credibility by multiplying their travels to Europe and has always advocated a strict application of the exemptions provided for in the Council common position of 19 February 2004."
"The Commission will continue to explore all avenues to influence the government of Zimbabwe and to pursue an enhanced political dialogue with neighbouring SADC countries, notably South Africa."
"Continued international pressure on Zimbabwe and especially regional peer pressure is necessary."
"The vote will take place this afternoon, after the debates."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the situation in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"Mr President, comparisons can be drawn between Congo’s present situation and that of Germany during the Thirty Years’ War – a large country in the middle of a continent broken up, with various groups allying themselves with an assortment of neighbouring powers, and decades without peace."
"That is precisely what has been going on in Congo for decades, with people dying in their millions, vast stretches of land lying waste, and the economy crippled."
"As was the case in the aftermath of the Thirty Years’ War, there will be no resolution unless – as happened with the religious groups then – the ethnic groups can be brought into a peace process that also involves all the neighbouring states."
"That is why we see it as important that massive pressure should be brought to bear on the states bordering this country of great lakes, and especially on Rwanda, in order that it may bring stability once and for all and may be deterred from active intervention in Congo, which is already suffering so much."
"We will not, however, succeed in that by words alone, and so Mr Langen and I have started to develop a holistic strategy which finally interlinks economic policy, foreign policy and development policy."
"Words alone will be no use to us in this situation;"
"Europe will be able to use its weight only if it makes simultaneous and strategic use of the economic, political and diplomatic options available to it and really gets actively involved in this peace process."
"Commissioner, you might well ask yourself what the use is of having this debate on a Thursday afternoon in a Chamber that is not exactly full."
"I can remember a time when this House debated how Lithuania could become more than a colony subject to Soviet oppression, and today we have a Lithuanian Commissioner in our midst."
"Of that I am glad, and I am sure that you are well able to handle this issue of peace and human rights in Congo."
"Mr President, the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most lethal since the Second World War."
"The International Rescue Committee reckons that 3.8 million people have now been killed and over a million of those are children."
"Apart from those killed, 3.4 million have been displaced."
"Congolese and foreign military groups continue to use violence to conceal the plundering of gold, timber, ivory, tin and other natural resources."
"Meanwhile, the fragile and ineffectual transitional Congolese government stumbles from political stalemate to military crisis."
"Both the transitional government and its international partners have failed to deal with the root causes of the conflict."
"Natural resource exploitation has funded and fuelled the instability in the country and, indeed, has fuelled instability and violence in the Congo for over a hundred years."
"What should have been a blessing to that country has turned out to be a source of deep sadness and regret and, indeed, a curse."
"The Congo's natural wealth has been a source of private funding for military and political elites instead of benefiting the vast majority of the Congolese population."
"Our resolution rightly calls for a package of measures to tackle this situation."
"We must take action to ensure respect for the arms embargo; the UN Security Council must impose sanctions, travel restrictions, a ban on financial services, etcetera, on individuals who have participated in the pillaging of Congolese assets; the EU and its Member States must act against companies involved in exploitation; we need a peacekeeping force in the east of the country; and action must be taken to disarm all illegally armed groups."
"Only if such measures are taken can we hold out any hope that the elections due next year will make any difference to the tragic situation in that country."
"The problem in the Congo is neither ethnic nor racial."
"It is about economics, and only if we tackle economics will we solve the problems."
"Mr President, I speak in place of Mr Van Hecke, who has had to leave Strasbourg early as he is travelling to the Democratic Republic of the Congo tomorrow."
"The current situation in eastern Congo shows that the Congolese peace process is still very fragile."
"Indeed, there have been reports of new exchanges of fire yesterday."
"The ALDE Group warmly welcomed the initiative to draft an urgency resolution on the Congo."
"Ultimately, however, our group decided not to endorse the compromise resolution."
"We feel that the compromise text fails to identify the core problem of the continuing instability in the region and of the difficult relationship between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its neighbouring countries, especially Rwanda."
"The issue is this: since the end of the Rwandan genocide in 1994 a large group of extremist Hutus have been hiding in a remote area of the Congolese rainforest in the east of the Congo."
"After all these years they have still not been disarmed."
"The presence of these heavily armed militias is a constant threat to the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to security in the entire Great Lakes region."
"The massacre at the Burundian refugee camp of Gatumba last August was only one in a long series of provocative actions."
"MONUC, the UN Peacekeeping Mission in the Congo, was supposed to disarm and neutralise the rebels, but has failed to do so."
"Although MONUC's mandate has been strengthened and there are extra troops, they are poorly trained and there is a serious lack of information and technical assistance."
"We feel that the joint resolution does not acknowledge that if Rwanda is crossing the border into the Congo to put an end to the activity of the armed gangs, it is happening in the context of MONUC having failed to do the disarming."
"We would suggest that the European Union and the Member States need to get more actively involved in the DRC and the Great Lakes region, focusing very much on rapid disarmament of the rebel forces."
"Perhaps European troops could be used to strengthen the UN peacekeeping forces."
"The troops from Pakistan, Nepal, Uruguay and other countries that are in the Congo at the moment simply do not have enough experience with military operations in sub-Saharan Africa."
"Europe has that experience."
"We have to consider all the options in order to make disarmament happen."
"It is by far the most important prerequisite to get the peace process back on track."
"In summary, we feel that although the resolution has many points that we support, it is unbalanced."
"So, with regret, I will abstain."
"Mr President, my Group welcomes the opportunity to discuss the current situation in the DRC, but like others deeply regrets the need to come back to this."
"In the report on asylum and sustainable solutions that Parliament adopted yesterday, one of the things we agreed was that the European Union's common foreign policy and common security policy needed to focus on conflict resolution and prevention, paying special attention to long-term conflict situations."
"This is exactly what we have in the DRC where, as has already been pointed out, the desire to control natural resources plays an absolutely key role in the massive displacements of people and in the massive numbers of deaths."
"We stress the need for an effective means of arms control and an effective disarmament programme to be put in place."
"We would also endorse the call made for the UN to deal with those profiteering from the pillage of natural resources, not least through the freezing of bank accounts and actions against companies."
"We feel perfectly able to do this in the case of what we believe to be terrorist organisations, but seem totally incapable of doing it with those who cause massive numbers of deaths elsewhere in the world."
"We also regret the need but welcome the fact that the UN Department of Peace-Keeping Operations has set up a special investigative team to look at the cases of sexual abuse and exploitation perpetrated by some of its own members in the UN organising mission in the DRC, particularly in Bunia."
"We know, since this Parliament has discussed it on many occasions, that rape is used as a means to demoralise opponents by demonstrating the people cannot even protect their own families."
"This Parliament has recognised on many occasions that victims of rape, child victims of sex abuse, are particularly vulnerable."
"So we consider it despicable that such crimes are also being committed by those sent to protect an already traumatised population."
"We look for the perpetrators to be brought to justice, as well as those profiteering from the tragedy in the DRC."
". – Mr President, Mrs Grybauskaitė, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Great Lakes and in particular in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is an ulcer, a volcano in the heart of Africa that is, sadly, always liable to erupt."
"Following a conflict that, during its six years, claimed three million lives, but that continues to claim 31 000 lives every month, according to the International Rescue Committee, the signs are that the situation remains unstable and unfortunately extremely unpredictable."
"Our meeting opened, curiously, with the good news of the Dar-es-Salam Conference and of the commitment made there by all Heads of Government to end the conflict. By Thursday, however, when we ended the meeting, our joint Chairman, Glenys Kinnock, had brought us the sad news that the Rwandan army had crossed the border into the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"We must therefore be more effective in this area in order to stabilise the region."
"Mr Posselt’s comparison with the Thirty Years’ War was most apt and I hope that he is right, because if so the conflict will come to an end and those regions of the African continent will be as prosperous, stable and modern as Germany is today."
"This is what we strive for."
"The African continent must be stabilised in open and democratic societies."
"What must we do in this House?"
"We must acknowledge that we are not doing enough as regards the militias of the former government of Rwanda. They are a source of instability and an excuse for permanent instability in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and we must take stronger action to disarm them."
"We must make it clear that any invasion is unacceptable and that respect for a country’s borders is a principle that must be applied by all countries in the region."
"We must complete the democratic transformation of the Democratic Republic of Congo and do what we can to stabilise the country; the Congolese army must be reunified, for example."
"We must strengthen the resources available to the United Nations’ mission in order to guarantee genuine peace and stability in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and to succeed in creating conditions on the ground that do not take us backwards; in other words, conditions that lead all sides to honour the 2003 peace agreements, that lead all sides to honour agreements undertaken in Tanzania on 20 November of this year and that lead all sides duly to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions."
". Amongst the many examples of violation of human rights and democratic principles in Africa, the involvement of children in armed conflicts stands out as an extremely serious problem."
"I wonder whether any debate, even one held in this House, can help to counter poverty in developing countries."
"Over 5 billion people in such countries live on one or two dollars a day, and a bloody children’s war is being fought in Congo, where over 300 000 children are fighting in military interventions which have killed more than 3 million people in recent years."
"Does such destruction of childhood through enforced labour, recruitment to the armed forces and sexual exploitation not demonstrate lack of responsibility and failure on the part of the various humanitarian and international organisations?"
"In order to take measures to prevent tragedies of this kind, it is necessary to begin by identifying their causes."
"The most fundamental of these is the long-term and wide-ranging exploitation of developing countries by a number of world powers, including European countries."
"The latter profit from such exploitation while the looted colonies are left even poorer."
"Congo is devastated, having become the victim of exploiters for whom the country’s abundant natural resources are more important than human lives."
"I believe that a person’s level of civilisation should be measured in terms of how responsible their attitude is to the weakest, and the same is true for those in power."
"Yet the weakest among us should not be provided with aid that is merely a sham, and takes the form of moral devastation, contraception and abortion."
"Much more is needed."
"Comprehensive care should be provided, and development facilitated."
"In addition, malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS, which are prevalent in the country, should be treated, and family units helped to develop soundly."
"I also believe that instead of sending armed forces and instructors to Iraq, we should take steps to ensure that peace finally prevails in Congo."
". Mr President, the European Commission shares the concerns of Parliament about the increasing tensions between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo and their consequences for the human rights situation in the region."
"Indeed, we are very concerned by the threats of Rwanda to use force against the territorial integrity of the Congo in order to neutralise the ex-FAR and Interahamwe troops, and by the multiple reports of military operations by the Rwandan army in the eastern Congo."
"The humanitarian crisis that these actions generate is an additional reason for our concern."
"It is essential to the stability of the region that Rwanda withdraws without delay any forces it may have in the territory of the DRC, and refrain from any action or statement that contravenes international law."
"The European Commission is deeply convinced that until the problem of the presence of ex-FAR elements in the eastern DRC is definitively solved, it will undermine peace and security in the region, be a source of instability and a threat to civilian populations."
"In this context, the European Commission is convinced that the local government should make use of existing mechanisms, including the Joint Verification Mechanism and the Tripartite Commission, to find a peaceful solution."
"Furthermore, the Congo should implement without delay its plan, established with the support of the United Nations Organisation’s Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), aimed at accelerating the disarmament and demobilisation of foreign armed groups."
"It should also speed up the integration and the training of its national army in order to effectively disarm the ex-FAR militias."
"Indeed, the establishment of peace and security in the region through bringing together the countries is our priority."
"In this context, we see the resolution of the ex-FAR issue as essential and inescapable."
"The Community is actively supporting the Congolese authorities in the reconstruction of the country through development projects for an overall amount of EUR 0.5 billion."
"The European Union is and remains the largest humanitarian aid donor in Congo and will continue its assistance."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The vote will take place after the debates."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is thedebate on six motions for resolutions on Bhopal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in today’s debate we are discussing issues we do not usually touch upon."
"The issues we generally debate are important, but they relate to financial perspectives, communications solutions and economic matters."
"These are all extremely important issues, but they are not tragic."
"The three items on the agenda for today’s afternoon debate, and in particular the third item on Bhopal, concern one of the greatest tragedies to have occurred during the past few decades."
"This item relates to a tragedy in which a gas explosion caused the immediate death of several tens of thousands of people."
"The consequences of this explosion are unfortunately still being felt today."
"The institutions and persons to be named shortly are responsible for this sad state of affairs."
"The organisations which are to blame for what happened have admitted their guilt, as they have paid out compensation for the deaths of 15 248 people."
"They have also paid out compensation to 554 895 individuals who have fallen ill or become disabled, whilst attempting to pay such compensation to as few people as possible."
"Broad estimates suggest that over 100 000 people have suffered as a result of the gas explosion in Bhopal 25 years ago, and millions are still suffering to this day due to environmental pollution."
"What happened in the aftermath of the event?"
"Following an agreement and various court rulings, the guilty party, Union Carbide Corporation India, paid out USD 470 million in compensation."
"This would appear to be no mean sum, but the victims of the explosion received less than 10% of the money."
"The rest went to the lawyers."
"In passing, it is worth noting that even in Dickens’ tales of 150 years ago, in which he enjoyed describing predatory lawyers, there are no instances of a victim receiving virtually nothing."
"The money vanished, because in addition to paying the lawyers’ fees, large amounts were allegedly used to pay off corrupt officials."
"It is intolerable that everyone has made money from this tragedy except its victims."
"We are witnesses to a conspiracy, and action must be taken to put things right."
"This is the aim of the motion for a resolution we are to adopt today."
"We must endeavour to reassess the damage, so that compensation is paid to those entitled to it."
"We must ensure that bodies are appointed which can resolve this problem fairly."
"Mr President, today we remember one of the worst industrial disasters in history."
"As we have heard, in the dead of night on 2 December 1984, a deadly 40 tonnes of known and unknown poisons leaked into the air."
"The people of Bhopal tried to escape the poisonous cloud."
"Their efforts were, however, futile and nearly 4 000 people died instantaneously; to date 25 000 innocent people have died."
"These are the bare brutal facts and today the people of Bhopal are still suffering from this horrifying legacy."
"That is why we cannot just remember, but must act as a community to help another."
"We need to ask why after 20 years the pursuit of justice has been so difficult for the survivors."
"We need to ask why the transnational corporation involved denies any continuing liability, either for the state of the Bhopal site or the victims' health."
"We need to ask why the site has not been cleaned of toxic waste and continues to pollute the water the surrounding communities rely on."
"We need to know just how Dow Chemicals can close the door on what was one of the worst industrial disasters in this century."
"We also need to ask why so many people are still awaiting adequate compensation."
"I appreciate the issue of compensation is mired in endless arguments as to the calculations, but this is not a sufficient reason for the people of Bhopal to have to relive the experience day after day."
"Whilst I support the major part of the resolution and the sentiment behind it, I do not believe the proposed amendments add anything constructive to this resolution."
"It is vital when we talk about disasters such as Bhopal that we do not descend into polemics and irrationality."
"The allocation of blame is all too often misplaced and we often condemn all agents without establishing all the facts."
"As chair of Parliament's South-Asia SAARC delegation, I would urge you to keep all these matters in perspective, and the budget of each country is particularly relevant."
"We must recognise the limitation of certain countries, which may not yet have developed the technologies or know-how to deal with such disasters as quickly and as safely as we have come to expect in our own countries."
"We must also attempt to see each angle of an issue such as the Bhopal disaster, and we should acknowledge the work that has already been done by the Indian Government and the Madhya Pradesh Government with regard to medical care, economic and social assistance, environmental clean-up, and finally financial compensation."
"This short list goes to prove that a lot of work has already been done."
"I feel it would be unproductive to vilify a government that has made efforts to remedy and address the plethora of problems stemming from Bhopal."
"Rather, we need to employ all our diplomatic efforts to keep the pressure on the Indian Government to maintain its current efforts in providing compensation and working on detoxification of the area."
"Nevertheless, if we demand that action is taken and money is spent, we should also be prepared to help in any way we can, including offering technical and financial support."
"We must not condemn without first examining what we, as a community, can do to help."
"We should continue to be constructive and offer the humanitarian, ecological and medical expertise we have to the Government of Madhya Pradesh."
"This is a role for the Commission, Member States and governments alike."
"I would urge you, therefore, to pressure all those who can bring any relief to those who have already suffered in Bhopal."
"Mr President, while Dow Chemicals and the Indian Government argue over who is to blame for the Bhopal disaster, the people continue to suffer and die from their two-decade legacy."
"More than 7 000 people died within days, but inaction has seen 15 000 further deaths which could have been avoided."
"Even today, 20 years on, neither side seems to care about the suffering, only about their reputations."
"As many as 100 000 people are suffering chronic and debilitating illnesses, with 10 to 15 people a month continuing to die."
"The survivors still wait for justice: compensation and medical assistance in many cases."
"The plant site, which continues to pollute, will cost an estimated GBP 15 million to decommission, compared with Dow's yearly sales of GBP 16 billion and India's GDP of GBP 320 billion."
"The Indian Government has also yet to spend USD 330 million of the original compensation given to them by Union Carbide."
"The pollution in the water supply in nearby slums is also 500 times above the maximum recommended WHO levels."
"How can the international community, a multinational company and one of the world's main countries, stand by and watch this happen?"
"Just now it should not be about who is to blame, but who is going to stop the suffering."
"Bhopal resident, Abdul Jabbar Khan, who runs the Bhopal Women Gas Victims' Industrial Association, said in the Guardian newspaper in the UK: 'In New York after 9/11 there was compensation, punishment and clean-up in just a few months."
"In Bhopal, after 20 years, we have nothing.'"
"– Mr President, since colonial times, the countries of the developing world have been supplying cheap products from the agricultural, mining and small-scale craft sectors to rich countries."
"They rely on the rich countries in the North for imports of expensive products based on new industrial technology."
"That makes these countries extremely dependent on imports and exports and results in a trade balance very unfavourable to them."
"Just like the time when European countries exerted administrative power through military force, this distribution is still leading to permanent poverty and underdevelopment in the Developing World."
"It is easy to see, then, why the governments of these countries thought that all new industries were to their advantage, in particular large-scale metal and chemicals industries."
"These countries had held little attraction for this kind of industry in the past, not only because the workforce was still insufficiently trained, but chiefly because most customers were in richer parts of the world and transporting finished products was expensive."
"The only industry that took root originated from State-owned enterprises or served only the local market and the tourists."
"The need for stronger industry in these countries was and is abused by industries from the rich North because, although these industries want to expand, the southern countries are still not very important as markets whilst their purchasing power remains low."
"Investment in the South does become an attractive prospect for them, however, if wages are low and, in particular, if environmental and safety requirements there are less exacting or very poorly monitored."
"This makes it possible for disasters in which many people suffer incurable illness or lose their lives to occur."
"This danger threatens not only the employees of those enterprises but also the people living in the neighbourhood."
"Where disasters do happen, enterprises are not willing to bear the costs."
"The gas explosion twenty years ago in Bhopal and the way in which this was dealt with have a great deal to do with this."
"Neither Union Carbide nor Dow Chemical nor the Indian Government are willing to produce sufficient compensation for the 20 000 or more people killed, for more than 100 000 people left with permanent injuries, or for cleaning up the contamination of soil and ground water."
"A solution must be found, and disasters of this nature must never happen again."
"Let us Europeans take our responsibility, let us join in making payments if necessary, and most importantly let us lay down rules to ensure that this kind of error is not repeated by European enterprises."
"Mr President, 20 years have passed since toxic gas escaped from a fertiliser plant in Bhopal. Nonetheless, its harmful effects and environmental pollution are still affecting the lives of thousands of individuals."
"A further 15 000 people died later as a result of it. The leak is also responsible for chronic illnesses affecting more than 100 000 people."
"The Indian Government and Union Carbide or Dow Chemical, the current owner of the fertiliser plant, have assumed responsibility for the impact of the accident on the lives of thousands of people and the environment."
"They should visit India and consider the consequences of Union Carbide’sactivities and the Bhopal disaster in terms of pollution of underground waters and the environment. Clearly, this also has consequences for human rights in the affected areas and communities."
"In addition, the tragic case of Bhopal highlights the need to require companies to assume the same responsibilities as states in today’s globalised world economy."
"Companies must be party to international agreements and conventions. Impact assessments need to be undertaken, both as regards respect for human rights and situations of armed conflict and tension."
"This is the rationale underpinning the amendments proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"I appeal to honourable Members to study them carefully before deciding how to vote."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to publicise the proposal made by the School of Peace Culture of the Autonomous University of Barcelona."
"Accordingly, I call on the House and the European Union to promote 3 December as an international day of corporate responsibility and human rights."
"The aim is for companies to commit to the promotion and protection of human rights the world over."
"This special date should be an opportunity for states, international bodies and civil society, amongst others, to reflect on their shared responsibility. All international actors share the duty of creating a fairer and more sustainable world."
"Mr President, if you go to Bhopal today – not 20 years ago, but today – you will see thousands of tonnes of toxic waste in piles, pools of mercury, skips of poisoned waste and bags of chemicals lying in the open air, seeping, whenever the rains come, into the puddles, streams and groundwater; and you will see people suffering because they drink that water."
"They suffer from pains in the stomach, headaches, anaemia and gynaecological problems because they have no alternative but to drink from those wells."
"That is the problem we are facing in Bhopal today, and we are facing it 20 years after that catastrophe, when so many people died."
"The figures range from 3 000 to 7 000 on one night; 15 000 later on and 100 000 people still suffering from debilitating diseases."
"We are talking about 15 years after the settlement which gave US$500 million to the Indian Government to disburse for compensation and rectification of that landscape."
"It is still a picture of desolation and danger for those people."
"We in this Parliament do not do well when we seek to be judge and jury in these cases."
"That is why I cannot accept the Green amendments that have been referred to."
"The motion itself stands well because it calls on the European Union to work with the Government of India to use the money that is available to make sure that there is a clean-up of those sites, treatment of affected people and compensation to those affected; and now, not in another 20 years."
"That is our message to all those affected: to the European Union; to the Indian Government; by all means, to Dow Chemicals and its responsibilities and to the courts which will be looking at that."
"But today we seek justice for those people and renovation of the environment in that part of the world and the health of its people."
". Mr President, I am glad to be able to speak immediately after Mr Bowis, who has impressed upon us where we have got to 20 years after 3 December 1984, when gas from a 35-tonne cocktail of highly toxic substances caused 7 000 people to die when their hearts and lungs failed."
"To this day, some 25 000 have gone down in history as the victims of the biggest chemical accident ever recorded, and some 500 000 are still crippled as a consequence of it."
"What, though, was done for the victims?"
"Research has shown that, 15 years ago, compensation to the tune of USD 470 million was agreed on by Union Carbide and the Indian Government."
"So far, the 100 000 officially registered as victims have received USD 300 each."
"There are 2 500 houses for widows along with seven hospitals, and many facilities have been built, but what has happened to the rest of the money, some USD 400 million?"
"I have to tell Mrs Gill that we really do have to ask who is to blame for that."
"The ground is still contaminated."
"The ground water is heavily contaminated with mercury, and that is not going to go away."
"Toxic residues are stored in the open air."
"Small wonder, then, that we end up with the situation that Mr Bowis has described, with chronic illnesses, brain damage, and children born with deformities."
"If there is to be any substantial improvement in medical provision for the victims, then the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Singh, will have to intervene, and the government should comply with the Supreme Court’s ruling and finally release the funds and enable full compensation to be paid out."
"Many chemical companies still have production operations in India and in other parts of the world where labour and environmental standards are far below those that apply in the European Union or the USA."
"As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs’ rapporteur on the REACH programme, I can do no other than reiterate the demand made in the working paper: if there is to be comparability, we need rules made by the European Union, and, in the same way, rules laid down as standards by the WTO."
"Those whose desire for increased profits leads them to allow the minimum environmental requirements without exception are accepting the likelihood of a second Bhopal one day, and that is something that none of us can afford."
". – Mr President, it has been twenty years since the tragedy in Bhopal in India, with its huge humanitarian and ecological consequences, and I believe that the initiative by the political groups for the adoption of a motion in plenary by the European Parliament is particularly important."
"However, it is not enough to jog the memory, it is not enough to condemn what is often the unaccountable operation of multinational companies in developing countries, it is not enough just to state our humanitarian awareness in words."
"This sort of tragedy may be experienced again by people in some other part of the world if the international community does not move to introduce international mechanisms for controlling the operation of multinational companies, for protecting the environment and for protecting human rights and the rights of workers."
"This is where the role of the European Union within the framework of the UN and within the framework of other international organisations may be more efficient."
"The motion records the problems which still exist and numerous honourable members spoke about them in the area of Bhopal as a whole."
"However, in my opinion, it does not fully reflect the efforts made by the federal and regional authorities in India over recent years in the fields of medical, economic, social and environmental restitution."
"Important policies have been implemented which we should not overlook."
"To close, I consider that the best way for us to express our sympathy with the victims and their families is for the European Commission to take initiatives in cooperation with the World Health Organisation on the implementation of medical and environmental restitution programmes."
"– Mr President, Mrs Grybauskaitė, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs Grybauskaitė on her assumption of office, and to wish her the best of luck."
"As Ernest Hemingway once said, ‘never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee’."
"It is to be welcomed that the European Parliament is concerning itself with regions of the world that are far removed from Europe, and that it is doing so without regard to the requirements of political interest."
"On the one hand, the European Union has declared a strategic partnership with India, and yet on the other hand, Parliament’s resolution states that the Indian Government has done little to protect people from the effects of the Bhopal disaster."
"We are discussing the negligence of the Indian authorities, and rightly so, yet we should also make known our views on the liability of the US company that imposed savage nineteenth-century capitalism and failed to observe any of the safety requirements that were mandatory in the USA."
"The figures are as follows; 7 000 deaths in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, and up to 30 000 deaths over the 20 years which followed, with over 100 000 having fallen ill to date."
"Obviously these statistics cannot express the human suffering, and merely conceal the pain and tears."
"Bhopal must act as a warning for governments to put in place rescue systems, and for them not to abandon people."
"It must act as a warning for international companies to ensure that the desire to make a profit does not replace the desire to promote safety."
"It must act as a warning for international structures and organisations to provide support to regions hit by disasters."
"In conclusion, Mr President, it should also act as a warning for us to call to account those who have taken such assistance from us or from anyone else."
". Mr President, the Commission welcomes Parliament's initiative to launch an urgent debate on this issue."
"It is an important opportunity for us to reflect on the way in which we can offer help to the victims and how to prevent that set of disasters from occurring in future."
"Let me assure Parliament that the Commission has been ready to support India in dealing with this tragedy and will do so in the future."
"Through our decentralised cooperation budget line, we have supported local non-governmental organisations in Bhopal with rehabilitation and skills training for victims of the disaster, as well as giving support to women’s self-help groups."
"Through our Health and Family Welfare Programme, we have supported the Bhopal District Hospital, as well as patient welfare societies of district hospitals and community centres in the region."
"Special assistance was given to the Municipal Corporation of Bhopal for the preparation of an urban reproductive and child health plan."
"In addition, the Commission has provided a grant of EUR 10 million for the funding of the Government of India's National Disaster Risk Management Programme."
"At the recent EU-India summit held in The Hague, India reconfirmed its interest in pursuing an environment dialogue with the European Union and proposed the organisation of an EU-India environment forum."
"This forum will be a first step in tackling the enormous environmental problems that threaten both India and the European Union."
"Let me finish by expressing our deepest sympathy for all the victims and our firm hope that such a catastrophe will never occur again."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"We shall now proceed to the vote on these draft resolutions."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, I simply wished to point out that there is a mistake in the voting list circulated to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. As regards the amendments on Bhopal, we voted against the first of these and in favour of the other three."
"I should like to note that my card has still not been registered and is refusing to work."
"I wished to vote in favour."
"Your comment has been noted."
"Mr President, I would like to raise another point of order. Yesterday, we were voting until 2 p.m."
"It has in fact always been the custom of this House to vote between noon and 1.30 p.m., because we do of course have a lot of lunchtime commitments and we end up keeping our guests waiting."
"I would therefore ask the Bureau to make it a rule – as it was in the previous legislative period – that voting ends at 1.30 p.m."
"I would also like to take the opportunity to wish all those present in the Chamber a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year."
"Thank you for your comment, Mr Rübig."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned, and I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year 2005."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0070/2004) by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 2004/2129(INI)."
". Mr President, the enlargement of the European Union means we are having to upgrade from driving a minibus, capable of taking 15 passengers, to a full-sized bus, capable of taking 25, with some spare seats to take on new passengers in due course."
"This larger bus needs a stronger motor if we are not to slow down, and one that enables us to cross the difficult hills that lie on our path."
"If we are to have a stronger motor, we will also occasionally need stronger brakes – perhaps an emergency brake – and better safety features too, such as a safety belt on each seat."
"Since we are upgrading, we should also have more comfortable seats so that every passenger feels at home and comfortable in this bus."
"Also, while we are at it, why not have a geo-satellite positioning system so we always know exactly where we are on the roadmap and can better plan the journeys we want to take together by the most efficient and comfortable route?"
"That is why we need a new set of rules for the European Union: a new Constitution to replace the current constitutional order and the set of overlapping Treaties."
"In concrete terms this means a set of improvements that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and your rapporteurs have identified as falling into four main categories."
"First, it means greater clarity as to what the Union is, how it works and functions."
"Under this heading one can identify a single Treaty instead of the several overlapping Treaties – a single, clearer document that spells out more clearly the objectives and the values of the Union and its competences, what it is responsible for and what it is not responsible for, and how it works, with fewer and clearer procedures."
"This will make it easier for citizens to see and to understand what our Union is about."
"We will get rid of the distinction between 'Union' and 'Community', which nobody except lawyers understands, creating a single legal entity."
"It makes it clear that we are not creating some huge monolithic monster – the mythology of the superstate that some people seem to fear."
"It is clear that we are not creating a centralised Union."
"Second, it will provide for a more effective Union – a Union capable of deciding and acting with 25 Member States."
"It will make for more qualified majority voting and more continuity in the chairmanship of the European Council."
"There will be a single foreign minister to speak for the Union to the outside world, instead of the Commission speaking on some issues and the High Representative of the Council on others, which meant that third countries never knew whom they had to deal with. Those posts will be merged into a single position."
"Third, and most important in my view, it will provide more democracy and accountability in the Union."
"Under the Constitution, all legislation will be subject first to the prior scrutiny of national parliaments, and then the double control of the Council and the European Parliament at European level, such that both have to approve virtually every item of European legislation."
"Frankly, this makes the European Union the most democratic international structure, or supranational structure, that exists in the world."
"Compare the EU to the IMF, to the World Bank, to the WTO or to any other international structure: none of them have or will have this degree of parliamentary input and of parliamentary scrutiny."
"We should be proud of the democracy that exists at the heart of this Union."
"The Constitution will significantly reinforce that democracy by extending codecision, by giving Parliament the right to elect the President of the Commission and by improving parliamentary control over the Commission and the so-called comitology system for delegated secondary legislation."
"Fourth, the Constitution introduces greater rights for citizens through the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has been incorporated into the Constitution."
"This, of course, applies only in the field of competence of European Union law, but that is a significant field of competence, and all European legislation henceforth will have to comply with that Charter."
"All of this has led us to conclude that the Constitution is, to quote the committee's report, a 'vast improvement'."
"It is a vast improvement on the current Treaties and on the current constitutional order."
"It merits our support."
"These improvements are due in no small part to the input of the European Parliament into the Convention and the IGC."
"We can be proud of our results."
"It is a compromise."
"It is not a Utopian treaty."
"All of us would have written it slightly differently had we had to write it ourselves, but as a compromise package it is a distinct improvement."
"I am confident that tomorrow Parliament will endorse it by an overwhelming majority."
"This Parliament, elected by citizens across the whole of Europe, with parties from left to right across the political spectrum, parties in government and parties in opposition, will send a powerful signal if it endorses the Constitution tomorrow by an overwhelming majority."
"I am confident it will."
". Mr President, when at the last plenary session of the last term in office I had the honour of speaking on behalf of my group at an event held by this House in homage to Monnet, Schuman and Spinelli, I wondered what the founding fathers, the visionaries of Europe, would have thought of the point in European integration we were at and what they would have thought of the European Constitution."
"I believe – I said it then and I repeat it today – that they would not have believed that what was happening was real, because, leaving behind a Europe divided by fratricidal confrontations, this Constitution sanctions peace on our continent and, to use Mr Geremek’s beautiful expression, this Constitution stitches the two Europes together."
"We are moving on from a Europe desolated by totalitarian regimes to a Europe – and this is sanctioned by the Constitution – based on democratic systems in which fundamental rights are respected."
"After a Europe of ration books, this Constitution sanctions a Europe of prosperity and material well-being."
"Overcoming a Europe which had disappeared from the world, this Constitution sanctions a Europe of solidarity, as demonstrated by the enormous wave of solidarity which has arisen on our continent to deal with the effects of the other terrible wave that struck Asia."
"This Constitution will have, and does have, instruments which will allow Europe to play a greater role in the world from now on."
"I believe that the Constitution marks a point of no return and, just as, not so long ago, the Constitution of my country was the Constitution of harmony, which allowed us to move into the future, this European Constitution is going to allow all of us Europeans to move forward together within a project of common civilisation."
"The value of the European Constitution is that it removes the ambiguities; it is the first document to define what the European Union is, as a Union of States and citizens, and does not weaken the Member States, far from it, because the Union’s competences are competences that come from the Member States, and it does not weaken national Constitutions, quite the contrary: it strengthens them, because the strength of the European Constitution stems from the strength of the national Constitutions."
"With this Constitution, Europe is demonstrating that it is much more than a market; it is a market as well, and that is important, but it is much more: it is a project of common civilisation based on our religious, cultural and humanist heritage."
"This is acknowledged in the first sentence of the preamble, based on the values of freedom and human dignity, founded upon the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It is also a Constitution that opts for a particular economic system: a capitalist system with a social dimension."
"If we look at the history of Europe, we see that that was not so obvious fifty years ago. Today it is."
"For all of these reasons, I believe, Mr President, that many of the flags that this Parliament has unfurled over recent years are today standing as proud as those we have behind us."
"I joined this Parliament 13 years ago, when it was a consultative assembly; today it no longer is."
"I joined this Parliament when there was talk of the European Union’s democratic deficit;"
"I believe that the European Constitution will put an end to that democratic deficit, because this Constitution introduces more democracy, more efficiency, more clarity and more transparency, as my friend, Richard Corbett, has quite rightly pointed out."
"Mr President, this work has been done by many people over many years."
"I would like to acknowledge them today."
"I would like to remind you of the names of Emilio Colombo, Marcelino Oreja, Fernand Herman, Giorgio Napolitano, Olivier Duhamel, Antonio Seguro, Dimitris Tsatsos, Antoinette Spaak, and so many people who, seated here in this Parliament, have defended what today is going to become a reality."
"They have often been called utopians or dreamers; well, today, these dreams, these utopias, are becoming reality."
"We in this Parliament can feel very proud of the work we have done."
"Mr President, eight years ago in this very Chamber, a young Member of Parliament defended the opinion on the Treaty of Amsterdam and said that it was not perfect, as we knew, but that it was not the final destination, and cited, as I am going to do again today, a Miguel de Cervantes disenchanted with life in his final days, who said that there were occasions when we had to choose whether to be a road or an inn."
"That was a road, and that road has led us to where we are today and I believe that today, in this comfortable inn represented by the European Constitution, over the coming years we Europeans are going to find it to be an effective instrument to move Europe forward in peace, freedom, justice and solidarity."
"I would, therefore, be delighted if tomorrow this Parliament votes in favour of this document, and this is very important, since it ushers in a new era on our continent."
"Mr Schmit has the floor on behalf of the Council, and I would like to thank him in particular for being here, and also express our condolences to him and the people of Luxembourg, who are in national mourning following the death of the Grand Duchess."
"Mr President, I should like to thank you for these expressions of solidarity with the people of Luxembourg at a time of great sorrow."
"I am very grateful indeed."
"Personally, this is the first time that I have had the honour of appearing before Parliament and it is therefore a great honour and a great pleasure to be able to speak in this House, on the Council’s behalf, on a matter as important as the draft European Constitution."
"I had the opportunity to work with some of you in the Convention and I feel that I can say that the work done in the Convention was historic, remarkable work that underlines the importance of the process that we are currently pursuing."
"In this context, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work."
"The message that you all wish to send out tomorrow by means of an overwhelming vote in Parliament is also intended for the citizens, because this Constitution is primarily a constitution for the citizens; it is they who will derive the greatest benefit from it."
"It has been said that this Constitution democratises our Union."
"It strengthens citizens’ rights, through the Charter of Fundamental Rights; it confers new rights on Europe’s citizens, by giving them the opportunity to interact with the institutions and in particular the Commission."
"This Treaty confirms that we are no longer an economic Union and that we are more than a political Union in the making; we are, first and foremost, a Union based on common values."
"In this respect, the Constitution is a crucial step in the integration process."
"Once Parliament has had its say, it will be the citizens’ turn to speak, either directly, through referendums, in countries where referendums are to be held, or indirectly, through parliamentary ratification."
"The Council is committed to channelling all the necessary energies for this Constitution to be adopted in all Member States."
"Each Member State, each government and each parliament now has the responsibility to take us over this hurdle so that the Constitution can enter into force, and, I should add, on the scheduled date."
"The European Parliament, national governments and national parliaments share a great responsibility in this respect."
"We must work together if we are to meet this challenge."
". Mr President, the Constitution before us today would not have been possible without the European Parliament."
"This House has played a crucial role in strengthening the foundations of our common enterprise, not least through the substantial contributions made by Members of this Parliament during the European Convention."
"It would also not have been possible without that European Convention, which provided such a dynamic, open and innovative means of negotiation."
"The involvement of the European Parliament in this unprecedented process culminates today with an excellent and well-written report, which sends a clear message on the benefits of the Constitution and the need for its ratification."
"I wholeheartedly congratulate Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the two rapporteurs, Richard Corbett and Íñigo Méndez de Vigo."
"The Commission fully supports your resolution."
"We firmly believe that the Constitution allows the Union to make significant improvements."
"In simple terms, for the first time the powers, competences, rights and duties of the Union are set out in a single Constitution."
"The Constitution consolidates and simplifies half a century of treaty changes, allowing us to move from 12 basic treaty acts to a single text."
"It makes the Union more open and simpler to understand."
"The Constitution modernises the institutional structure."
"It increases the powers of the European Parliament and provides for citizens actively to participate in the decision-making process through a petition with one million signatures."
"We will have more democracy."
"The Constitution sets out, in 54 concise articles, the fundamental rights we will guarantee to our citizens."
"For the first time the Union will accede to the European Convention on Human Rights, so there will be more rights for our citizens."
"These three simple concepts – more rights, more democracy and more openness – explain why this Constitution should be ratified."
"We would certainly have wished to be more ambitious in certain policy areas, but the final result is the best possible compromise in the current political situation."
"I also accept that people have fears and criticisms regarding this Constitution."
"It is not a perfect text and we should not hide from responding to these concerns."
"Our latest Eurobarometer survey shows that 68% of our citizens support the idea and principle of having a European Constitution."
"Other opinion polls show that many feel they are inadequately informed about the content of the Constitution."
"Your report has made a good start by rejecting some of the misconceptions and scare stories about the Constitution."
"It provides a range of good reasons for the Euro-specialists to be voting yes, but these are not always the reasons that will persuade a single mother in Gdansk, or a shipyard worker in Spain to do so."
"The ratification of the Constitution is an opportunity to debate the kind of Europe we want."
"I welcome this opportunity to remind ourselves of what Europe has achieved and what Europe stands for, as has so elegantly been explained by others."
"In the mid-1980s, the vision of creating a genuine single market seemed a bridge too far."
"And yet it happened, bringing in its wake an economic dynamism from which we still benefit."
"To cite one simple example, the fact that we do not have to go through customs at borders has dramatically reduced costs and delivery times."
"In a single step we removed the need for 60 million VAT documents per year."
"Today, the younger generation treat as a right the idea of a zone of free movement, in the same way that they expect the Union to ensure a clean environment and cross-border cooperation on public health."
"Today, in 12 countries of the EU, we have a piece of Europe in our pockets, with the euro being taken for granted across the Union and with new Member States joining the queue to introduce it."
"Finally, first through membership of Greece, Spain and Portugal and now with the 10 new Member States, we have helped guarantee and consolidate democracy and the rule of law across the whole continent."
"We must now turn to the ratification of the Constitution."
"While we respect our different constitutional roles in relation to the national ratification processes, we cannot tolerate the debate being confused by myths or misconceptions about the content of the Constitution."
"All of us have a duty to make available clear and reliable information on what the Constitution does and the benefits it can bring."
"In so doing we must compare the results of the Constitution with the current situation."
"Lithuania and Hungary have already ratified the Constitution."
"I would, in particular, like to pay tribute to Lithuania and the speaker of the Lithuanian Parliament, who is here in the Chamber today."
"We must now start to show what concrete impact the Constitution can have on the daily lives of the people we represent."
"Indeed, there is no shortage of good examples in this respect."
"As I said earlier, the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is far from a symbolic innovation."
"Citizens will have a catalogue of rights and principles whose respect by the public authorities – be they European or national – they will be entitled to invoke before the courts."
"The possibility of concrete participation in the functioning of the Union is extended far beyond the election of the Members of the European Parliament."
"The citizens' initiative will, for the first time, make European citizens protagonists in the legislative process."
"Modernisation of the area of freedom, security and justice will allow the Union to respond to the growing demand for more effective European action in the fields of border controls, asylum and immigration."
"The same is true for judicial and police cooperation."
"The Constitution lays the foundations for a single area of liberties and guarantees."
"The new provisions on public health will provide higher quality standards with regard to safety."
"The Union will be able to intervene in a more effective way to prevent and fight cross-border health threats such as avian flu or BSE."
"Today, we cannot avoid thinking about the tragic events in Southeast Asia."
"The Union is already playing a key role in providing humanitarian aid and contributing to the political, economic and social reconstruction of that region."
"The new provisions on civil protection, which entrust the Union with the task of promoting consistency in international civil protection work, will allow us to make our international action even more effective in the future."
"We have, of course, already put in place a number of initiatives aimed at informing the public about the content of the Constitution."
"The Commission has produced written and audio-visual material, developed a website, promoted and financed information relays, and sponsored seminars and other public initiatives."
"The European Council has supported our efforts, calling on the Member States to improve their capacity for communication about European issues in the context of the ratification of the Constitution."
"It is now time to move up a gear."
"I seize this occasion to call on you to examine the possibility of putting in place joint communication initiatives with us that can maximise the impact of our initiatives."
"I refer, in particular, to the possibility of organising media events at both European and national level during a 'European week', around 9 May 2005."
"In the meantime the Commission will not refrain from developing other ideas that can assist the Member States in drawing up and implementing their national communication strategies."
"I can also assure you that the Commissioners themselves will be active in the debate on the Constitution and the future of Europe."
"Securing the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty is the main concern for the Member States and for the European institutions."
"However, while we do not intend to anticipate application of the Constitution, we must also devote some effort to ensuring a smooth entry into force of the Constitution once the ratification procedures have been successfully finalised."
"That is why we need to open discussions on preparing for implementation of the current provisions."
"The Commission has been engaged in this process from the start."
"We are proud of the text of the Constitution and will do our utmost to ensure that it sees the light of day."
"I remain committed to dialogue with the European Parliament."
"Our work will not stop today."
"In fact it is only just starting."
"I look forward to debating these issues in more detail with the Constitutional Affairs Committee and joining you on different platforms to present our case."
"In conclusion, I return to my three simple concepts: more rights, more democracy and more openness."
"This year we will celebrate the 15th anniversary of the rebirth of democracy in Eastern Europe."
"Setting aside all other provisions of the Constitution, these three concepts alone underline why countries have joined the European Union and why the Commission will defend this Constitution."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have come a long way, and those of us who were Members of the previous Parliament will be able to remember how, in this Chamber, we debated the Treaty of Nice."
"At the time, many of us were unsatisfied with it, and we said that our stance on the Treaty of Nice would ultimately depend on what new method of reform we might have in the future and on what the efforts at reform added up to."
"The result of that is in front of us today: the Treaty on a Constitution for the European Union."
"Unlike in December 2000, when we discussed Nice in the absence of the Central European countries – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia (which is now the Czech Republic), Slovakia, Hungary, and Slovenia, not to mention Malta and Cyprus, none of whom had yet joined us, it is a particularly happy circumstance that today, the day when we are debating the Constitution, we have among us Members from these countries, particularly from those European countries that were once Communist."
"I think that is a wonderful symbol of the future we share on the continent of Europe."
"I would like to extend very warm thanks to Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo for the outstanding work they have done together with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and also to all those who assisted them in it."
"Today, I would also like to thank the Chairman of the Convention, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, for the work he did, which was sometimes on the receiving end of criticism, but if he had not done as he did, we would probably not have this Constitution today, and so Mr Giscard d'Estaing deserves our warmest gratitude today."
"We are the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – and of the European Democrats."
"There are 128 MEPs in the European People’s Party, and the DE part of our group has 40 Members."
"Speaking for the PPE part of our group, I can assure you that we will be saying ‘yes’ to this Constitution without reservations, while the European Democrats in our group are entitled to come up with their own positions."
"A constitution needs values."
"Almost as crucial as the procedures are the values that bind us together, for if we have no awareness of values, we have no foundation on the basis of which we can take political action."
"We rejoice that many of our values, which we see as Christian, have been included: human dignity, the dignity of older people, the worth of children too."
"I think it particularly splendid that children get a mention in the Constitution, for without children, this continent has no future, that we have described our values and banned cloning, and that reference is made to our principles – the rule of law, democracy, subsidiarity and solidarity."
"All these things give us cause to say ‘yes’."
"Today, though, I would not wish to deny that many of us would have welcomed a reference to God in the Constitution, because it affirms that our human capacities are not infinite."
"We would also have been glad to see reference made to our Judaeo-Christian heritage, for, at a time when dialogue with the world’s cultures is so necessary – particularly with the Islamic world – I believe that it is important that we know where our own roots are, and that our cultural and religious development should be mentioned in the Constitution."
"Even though that is not in the Constitution, every Constitution is of course a compromise, and so we say ‘yes’ to this Constitution, because it reflects our values."
"It is also proper that a constitution should include a description of the constitutional structure of the European Union, and I think it is particularly successful in this, talking as it does in terms of national identity."
"Europe is not a melting pot, nor is it meant to become a superstate; on the contrary, it is in its diversity that Europe’s wealth is to be found, beginning in our towns and communities, where people live, and in the regions."
"Our nation states have their own identities."
"We have a Constitutional Treaty which declares that it is from the nation states that the Constitution originates."
"It is through our own national citizenship that we are citizens of Europe, and hence freedom of organisation for local authorities is made explicit in the subsidiary structure of Europe."
"I think that is quite a masterstroke."
"Jean Monnet, the first Honorary Citizen of Europe, once said that nothing is possible without people, and that nothing lasts without institutions, and what he said is true to this day."
"If we do not have values which underpin everything, and if these values are not ultimately expressed in institutions that embody them, then those values cannot be realised."
"That is why it is right that we should follow Jean Monnet’s directions and go down the road that leads to Europe as a community, and, my dear friends – I apologise for using an expression current in my own party, but, as we are talking about the Constitution today, we are somehow joined together as one, not that our differences should be obscured – neither now nor in the future must it be intergovernmentalism or cooperation between governments that shapes the European Union."
"The Europe of the future must rather be founded upon the Community method, and upon the Community action of the European institutions."
"What this means for us is that we need a strong European Parliament, one that is a symbol of democracy, that we should act as equals in all matters affecting European legislation, that we need a strong Commission, deriving its legitimacy from its election by the European Parliament and hence also from European elections, and that we have to have a Council of Ministers whose actions are transparent."
"Let me conclude by saying that much that is in the Constitution is in the nature of a programme and has yet to become reality."
"An example of this is Article 750, which states how we are to live as good neighbours alongside the peoples of Europe who have a European vocation – and right now it is Ukraine of which I am thinking."
"Another is foreign policy, an area in which we cannot, in future, allow ourselves to speak with two or three voices, but must act jointly."
"That is why it is not Member States of the European Union, as such, that should be seeking to join the UN Security Council, but rather the European Union as a whole, if it wants to be a global actor for human rights and democracy."
"It is the European Union as such that must be represented in the United Nations."
"We have many tasks ahead of us."
"I speak for my group when I say that I hope there will be broad support for this Constitution, not only here in this House, but also in all the Member States, because this Constitution is the means whereby we will get through the twenty-first century as a Europe of freedom, democracy and peace."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this coming 27 January will mark the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp at Auschwitz."
"The foundation of the European Coal and Steel Community a few years later was a direct consequence of what had happened during the Second World War."
"The fathers and mothers of European cooperation could see with their own eyes that ultra-nationalism, Fascism, and the division of our continent by Bolshevism, always resulted in oppression, in terror, and in the dignity of the individual being lost."
"They could also see that what created peace, dignity and democracy was supranational action and integration at a supranational, European level. It is worth adding that this was then achieved through the Coal and Steel Community gaining control of the weapons-manufacturing industries."
"If you trace a continuous line from the ECSC to the European Economic Community, through the next act of integration to the European Community and then to the EU as we know it today, you find a success story as yet unequalled in the world, for it looked not only to 1945, and to the end of a war of destruction on this continent; the next stages incorporated states that had, in the post-war era, had their own political changes to cope with, namely Greece, Portugal and Spain, and so the overcoming of their fascist dictatorships and the stabilisation of democracy through membership of the European Community was an enormous success in the late 1970s and 1980s."
"What we saw happening in the 1990s, when the states that have now acceded took their present form, was, in principle, a triumph over Communist oppression in one part of Europe."
"The European Union is a union that has managed to take the values described in our Charter of Fundamental Rights and use them as the basis of democratic integration and to overcome both the Fascism and the Communism of Europe’s past."
"The events of recent days, in which people have been powerless in the face of forces that no amount of technology has enabled them to confront, show how absolutely necessary it is for action to be taken at the supranational level, with no national borders standing in the way."
"In the global village, the European Union is Europe’s rational and modern response to the challenges of the twenty-first century."
"The Constitution we are now debating is the framework provided for it."
"Our group will be voting in favour of the Corbett/Méndez de Vigo report – out of profound conviction, and also out of the conviction that the values described in this constitution are civil values."
"The splendid thing about them is that you can understand them as Christian values if you are a Christian."
"You can understand them as your own values if you are a Jew or a Moslem or an unbeliever."
"These values are universal and indivisible, and so they are valid for everyone."
"That also makes it easy for us, despite the divisions that otherwise separate us, to join together in supporting this Constitution, but if we do that, it is our shared basis for a democratic and dignified future in a social community with social responsibility and economic prosperity."
"In the knowledge-based society of the future, this Union of ours must, at one and the same time – and the Constitution does indeed set this out in black and white – perform its social tasks and guarantee the protection of the individual and of every citizen from the dangers present in this divided world."
"That is what this Constitution will be able to achieve, and we are largely agreed that we are willing and obliged to stand up for it and contend for it."
"One thing alone is lacking, and, speaking for our group, I will spell out what it is. For the European Parliament to commit itself and mobilise itself is not enough."
"Those who signed their names to this Constitution at the dignified ceremony in Rome, which all of us chairmen of groups were allowed to attend, Europe’s Heads of State or Government and foreign ministers, must, in the same way as we do, appear before the peoples and declare that this is our Constitution and that we want it."
"Far from this being one individual matter to be left to the European Parliament or to the Commission, the statesmen and stateswomen of Europe must do their part and affirm this to be their work – not only the work of the European Parliament or of the Convention on their own."
"It is those things too, but it is the work of all those who carry responsibility for Europe’s future, and they must affirm, before the peoples of Europe, their support for it."
"If they do that, this Constitution will enjoy majority support, with the support of the PPE Group and probably even of that Group’s European Democrats."
". Mr President, Mr Poettering properly reminds us that when Parliament reacted to previous reforms of the Treaties, the resolutions adopted were peppered with regrets, criticisms and things that we deplore, plus demands for further reform."
"This time, we are not obliged to do this because we ourselves have been prominently involved in the drafting of the reforms, both in the Convention and the IGC."
"This report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo gets the story right and I am pleased to say that all Members of my Group who will be speaking today will be speaking in favour of this resolution."
"Thereafter we will be out campaigning for the entry into force inside the Member States where referenda are to be held, including in France – to oppose certain factions of the left – and in Britain, where we will be fighting to oppose the right."
"The principal argument for this great reform is clearly that it strengthens the European Union."
"It strengthens our capacity to act abroad and inside our Member States, making us prepared to stand on our own feet in world affairs, shaping Europe's response to globalisation politically."
"The Constitution redefines the European Union."
"It strikes a balance between states – the old and the new, the large and the small – between citizens and the authorities and, as Mr Giscard d'Estaing has said, between dream and reality."
"It has created a fresh, large consensus behind the project of European integration."
"A word to those such as the British Conservatives who carp on the sidelines: if you are for Europe, you should be for the Constitution."
"Europe cannot be constructed without clear, liberal and social values, strong rules and robust parliamentary democracy."
"Europe will not work without strong authorities in Brussels."
"Without the Constitution, things will not work properly and the quality of policy flowing from Brussels and Strasbourg will begin to decline."
"Future expansion will be out of the question and I cannot believe that is what the British Conservative Party really believes in."
"But Europe cannot work either without strong leadership."
"This Parliament must learn to fill some of the strategic space that the reforms begin to open up for us."
"We have many new powers, including, importantly, the right to propose a reform – a reform in the future of the Constitution itself."
"The Commission must assert itself quickly as the new arrangements for the Foreign Minister and the Foreign Service, the team presidency and especially the so-called full-time President of the European Council are put in place."
"The prime ministers and presidents must coordinate their campaigns."
"I am pleased to hear what Mr Schmit said on that."
"They must shoulder their individual and collective responsibility to win these referendum campaigns by showing the voters why these reforms are for them and why this is truly the Constitution for Europe."
". – Mr President, a majority in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is in favour of ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, because it sees it as an important step on the road leading to the political integration of our continent."
"Despite the Treaty’s many shortcomings, there are no other alternatives in the current political and institutional context."
"The proposed Constitution establishes the Union as a community based on fundamental rights, grounds European policies in a code of common values, defines clear and binding objectives, and expresses a commitment to uphold sustainability in the economic, social and environmental fields."
"It includes social rights among traditional human rights, ties the Union’s external actions to compliance with international law, simplifies procedures, clarifies competences, expands the scope of Community decisions, and increases transparency and the democratic legitimacy of the Union, as well as opportunities for its citizens to play a part."
"The text has a good many gaps and pitfalls in it, and it is understandable that there should be growing disaffection towards the European project among many people, associations and movements politically close to us, in whose eyes the Union is not yet able to respond to their concerns or to be a political entity fully able to act for a better, less unfair world."
"To deny this reality, as our fellow Members do in their report, is, in our view, inappropriate."
"Turning the motion for a European Parliament resolution almost into a propaganda exercise, pretending that it is the ideal outcome of noble, harmonious work done in the best possible manner, even saying that the Intergovernmental Conference left the Convention’s text unaltered – although we know that that is not true because all the amendments made by the Intergovernmental Conference made the text worse: one need only think of the Legislative Council or the disagreement over the budget – none of that will convince a single Eurosceptic or help us win over all those who, far from fearing a non-existent European superstate, know that the Union is not yet united enough or cohesive enough."
"For us Greens, the European integration process cannot be considered complete with the adoption of the Constitution, partly because other countries and peoples, beyond the current 25, are still finishing or starting out on their journey to join the Union."
"In that respect too, unlike the rapporteurs, we believe that the Union’s institutional system is still too confused and complicated and will not last much longer without further reform."
"We therefore believe that any development and improvement of the future European Union will depend on ratification of this text."
"It is a dangerous illusion to believe that rejecting this text would prepare the way for another, better or even ideal constitution."
"On the contrary, throwing it out would leave us with the provisions of the Treaty of Nice, which are much less advanced in terms of both the values of their objectives and the institutional structure they propose."
"If the Treaty were defeated, it would be an ideal opportunity for the Eurosceptics to point out that the people no longer want Europe, whereas we know very well that this is not the case. It would also convince many governments that the Convention method – that timid, half-hearted attempt to overthrow undemocratic, inefficient methods of reform like diplomatic talks and the power of veto – can lead nowhere."
"We therefore have a double objective: to approve this Constitution so that we can quickly lay the foundations for its successor, by seeking to build a strong, stable alliance with those political, social, associative and economic forces that believe, as we do, that in order to achieve our aims of social justice, ecologically sustainable development and peace, we must not only win the elections again at a national level, but also make European democracy stronger and more complete."
"To do that, we need to take back the initiative, and it is on that point, Mr President, that I believe it will be possible to rebuild a united front of all those who are today convinced of the inescapable need for European democracy but are divided in their evaluation of this text."
". – Mr President, the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo concentrates almost exclusively on a series of new provisions that are not in the current Treaties. Such provisions include replacing the rotating presidency with a more stable two-and-a-half-year presidency, creating the post of minister for foreign affairs, albeit without communitarising the common foreign and security policy, strengthening Parliament’s powers, according national parliaments the right to call the Commission to account, where they feel it has overstepped its powers, and giving a million citizens the opportunity to propose that the Commission table a draft law on a particular matter."
"If the text submitted for ratification by the citizens or by the parliaments were in fact limited to that type of provision, many members of my group – not all, but many of them, including me – would not be opposed to the draft Constitutional Treaty."
"We are in favour of Europe and in favour of anything that serves to enhance Europe’s democracy and improve its functioning."
"We should not be bracketed with the UK Independence Party."
"We feel that there is a great need for Europe in this globalised world, but what guidelines and structures do we need for Europe? That is the question."
"The first thing we need, in our view, is a set of guidelines and structures that enable us, at Union level, to control the financial markets, rather than be entirely at their mercy, as we are now."
"This can be done, provided that it is agreed to make use of powerful levers such as the Central Bank and taxation of the capital of major public bodies; to make laws aimed at holding companies accountable on social, environmental, democratic and ethical issues; to channel funds thus released into major political priorities that are publicly debated, democratically established and regularly assessed."
"Europe is therefore the appropriate level to meet challenges that a single country would nowadays have difficulty in tackling, due to globalisation."
"It follows, for that very reason, that we need guidelines and structures whereby we can reverse the trend of maintaining the main decision-making centres at a distance from the people, and whereby we can reclaim popular sovereignty and the power to make political choices, instead of submitting to the laws of the market, even if that means encouraging fatalism, that deadly enemy of democracy."
"In other words, to achieve those objectives, Europe is also a relevant level, a level at which it is appropriate to promote the rights of workers, citizens, members of Parliament and the public authorities to access information and to take action, in order to reduce the arrogant power of those who tend to see themselves as modern day feudal lords."
"Indeed, if there is a role that we are amply entitled to expect Europe to take on in full, it is that of responsible player on the world stage, determined to use its influence to bring about the introduction of a fresh set of rules governing international relations."
"Let us consider the potentially salutary influence of, say, a European decision explicitly to ban all recourse to war as a means of solving the world’s problems, so as to ensure that, from the Middle East to the Caucasus, the force of politics prevails over the politics of force. Think of the positive influence of a decision to conclude alliances between Europe and the countries of the south that will extend to include international financial and trade institutions, thereby tackling head-on the murderous onslaught of economic war; or of a decision to establish with the United States, of course, the will to forge – with that great nation and with others – the most ambitious partnership possible, yet within a framework of total political and strategic independence."
"If you harbour such ambitions for Europe, then perhaps some of you could tell us why, in that case, you are opposed to this draft Constitution."
"You are opposed to it precisely because this text takes up provisions accumulated in particular since the Maastricht Treaty, in order to perpetuate them, solemnly and for the long term; provisions that constitute so many obstacles to even the partial implementation of such a European project."
"I refer in particular to the key principles of the open market economy in which competition is free; to the fact that the European Central Bank can no longer have liberal statutes or a liberal mission; to the Commission’s discretionary powers as regards competition or indeed the blatant subordination of all European security and defence policy to the policy formed within NATO."
"New provisions are added to those old ones, thereby widening still further the gulf separating the concept of Europe that is being constructed from the one that I have just mentioned."
"The draft Treaty thus contains an article which calls, in the fiery spirit of the multilateral agreement on investments, for the removal of restrictions on foreign direct investment and of other dangerously ambiguous articles relating to life patenting or indeed to cultural diversity."
"In all of these fields, what we need is not a propaganda campaign that brooks no contradiction, but a frank, public, pluralist review of the experience of recent years which has led to a breakdown of trust between the citizens and the European institutions."
"As for the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo, it does not say a word about the part of the draft constitutional Treaty devoted to the policies and functioning of the Union, which in fact accounts for two thirds of the whole text."
"We are therefore opposed to this report, just as we are opposed to the draft Constitutional Treaty itself. Once again, however, I wish to make it clear that the ‘no’ that many of us are saying is open to alternative suggestions."
"It is a European ‘no’."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is one word missing from this Constitution, and that word is ‘sovereignty’."
"It has been replaced by the word ‘identity’, which is not at all the same thing."
"In the four corners of the earth, as we well know, there are peoples who have strong identities and who rightly claim sovereignty, such as the Palestinians, the Iraqis and many others."
"In Europe, there will now be peoples who, at a time when they are at risk of losing their identities with Turkey set to join the EU, will lose their sovereignty when the Constitution comes into force."
"One word has disappeared, the word ‘sovereignty’, and another has appeared, the word ‘law’, European law, a word that is the very symbol of national democracies."
"There is therefore going to be a European law, henceforth on a higher legal level than national laws, even constitutional laws."
"Our Constitution, therefore, for each of our peoples, will become the equivalent of the internal regulations of a region of Europe."
"This European, supranational law will from now on be adopted by majority and not unanimously."
"There is therefore no longer any opportunity for a particular people to voice its opposition, even if this is a matter of defending its vital interests."
"Thirdly, this supranational European law will be drawn up by a Brussels bureaucracy that has had the attributes of a State conferred on it."
"That bureaucracy is becoming a full-scale international player, with the right to conclude international agreements, with a minister for foreign affairs; those words do not lie. It will enjoy the transfer to its remit of the powers of a superstate – the capacity to draw up laws, to define public services and to address matters relating to immigration and borders."
"At the same time – and this will be my last point – national democracies will be trampled underfoot."
"National parliaments are having their capacity to make laws removed from them."
"To compensate for this, they have been given the right to deliver opinions."
". Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteurs for undertaking the very difficult task of trying to find some areas of agreement on the Treaty in the very diverse institution and august body that this Parliament is."
"However, in one sense the debate has moved on, because it is now up to the Member States and the debate on the Treaty-ratification process that takes place in the Member States."
"It is up to the people to determine what the level of debate and discussion and the final verdict on this Constitutional Treaty will be."
"Many times when we speak about the issues involved, in spite of our best efforts, some of us would like to see new things added to what has already been agreed."
"Therefore, we are fighting the next argument rather than dealing with the current debate."
"In addition, when you listen to some of the debate, it is like going back to the future, because the same issues and points that were raised in opposition to the first treaties in the 1950s, and to the second and subsequent treaties in the 1970s and 1980s, are being rehashed."
"People are saying that this is the prophet of doom and gloom about to come and join us and take our power away."
"Let us be realistic about what is in this Treaty and what is good and bad about it."
"As a basis for the basic law of what the European Union will be in the future, it is a very good document."
"It ensures there will be proper respect and trust for the Member States and for their roles within it, in particular for the smaller Member States; it clearly sets down in the doctrine of conferral who has the power to do what and where the lines of demarcation are drawn."
"When the people who oppose this Treaty and have opposed other treaties say that this will override national law, this issue has already been decided."
"Back in the 1960s in the European Court of Justice, the primacy of European law over national law was brought into being."
"However, the Treaty clearly defines that and narrows down that role, namely that it only operates for European law."
"The European institutions and European lawmakers have been given the power by the Member States to make that law."
"So let us have a real and honest debate."
"Let us move away from the lies, the fear and scaremongering that takes place."
"Some people will be justified in opposing this Treaty because of their political beliefs, ideologies or their genuine concerns about what it means for those Member States."
"But let us ensure that the debate is based on fact, truth and the written text and not on misconceptions."
"Mr President, though this House, in self-congratulatory euphoria, will embrace this Constitution, thankfully the ultimate decision rests with the Member States."
"It is their votes that really matter."
"What I despise most is the false pretence, particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom, that this Constitution is merely a tidying-up exercise made necessary by enlargement and that it will settle the constitutional shape of Europe for generations."
"That is demonstrably false."
"Those who peddle that deception are best exposed by the Constitution's own most ardent and more honest proponents."
"In the Constitutional Affairs Committee, I have observed at first hand the strategy and scheming of arch Europhiles."
"They make no secret of the fact that this Constitution is not an end in itself, but a work in progress and they do nothing to conceal their ambition to have it, in their terms, strengthened at the first opportunity – without, of course, the troublesome obstacle of further national consultation."
"Their undisguised candour gives the lie to those who would deceive voters into thinking that this is a mere tidying-up exercise: it is not."
"The choice for the nation-states is this: a choice between a Europe of cooperating sovereign nation-states, or a Europe that is itself a superstate."
"Despite all the denials, this Constitution is a framework for superstatehood."
"It declares its supremacy over national constitutions; it proclaims the subservience of national law; it appoints its own president and foreign minister."
"It relegates national parliaments to mere consultative sounding boards; it trades meaningful democracy for the pseudo-democracy of this House; it neuters the last defence of the nation-state by increasingly supplanting the national veto with radically increased qualified majority voting; and it provides an unbridled path to further integration by permitting amendment by heads of government rather than by the people."
"Anyone with pride in his or her own nation, who does not want to see it subsumed into a hideous conglomerate, will reject this tawdry Constitution."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we have been given here is a Constitutional Treaty founded on the work of a Convention composed largely of parliamentarians, and, as it was they who made this breakthrough possible, the development of Europe is no longer in the hands of diplomats."
"Ninety per cent of the draft produced by the Convention then went through the Intergovernmental Conference, and I believe that it was this method, involving the peoples of Europe through their elected representatives, that was crucial in terms of the progress made."
"Not everything in this constitution is perfect, but I think the decisive thing is that it is better than what we have at present."
"This Constitutional Treaty reinforces the citizens in their rights; the Charter of Fundamental Rights will give them entitlements and safeguards."
"It strengthens citizens’ rights because, in future, the election of the President of the Commission will be directly dependent on the votes of the European Parliament."
"The public’s hand is strengthened both by the referendum and by extending the rights of the European Parliament."
"This Constitution has become more transparent, because it makes the allocation of powers and responsibilities clearer, thereby making procedures more readily comprehensible, and because the Council is, at least when taking decisions on lawmaking, required to meet in public."
"The extension of majority decision-making may well not be sufficient, but it is considerable, and it does make the European Union more efficient, something that is apparent in other areas, for example, in the removal of the pillars structure and the introduction of a single legal personality, and, in particular, in the substantial improvements made in the fields of foreign, security and defence policies."
"Our Europe is founded upon values."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights, which I regard as drawing to a high degree on the Christian conception of what humanity is, is – or so I believe – one of its wonders."
"Having been drafted by a previous Convention, the marvellous thing about it now is that so many peoples can take such a common basis of values as their guide and that those who make our laws in future must look to see that these values are adhered to – and this is legally binding rather than a matter of policy."
"We want this Europe of ours to be a community, and that is what the Convention wanted."
"Now, as we move to make the Constitution work, we have to attach high priority to what the Convention wanted being retained, without it being altered by a technocratic approach to its implementation."
"Even now, we have a Foreign Service on which to practise, and we are constantly hearing of attempts already being made in the corridors of countries’ foreign ministries to contest the Commission’s powers – and hence also those of the European Community and its Parliament – as a means towards establishing a new intergovernmental authority."
"In the way it is represented abroad, too, the European Union is a Community, and we see this in its foreign relations, in development and in many other areas of activity, and this must not be changed by the technocratic way these are shared out in a foreign service."
"Here we have fought to secure substantial rights for the Commission, without whose consent nothing happens, and I would point out to it and to the Council that we will keep a very close eye on this."
"The way in which Europe’s powers and responsibilities are ordered makes clear that those powers and responsibilities are conferred by the Member States, and it is for this reason that all this talk of a superstate is complete nonsense."
"The fact is that sovereignty continues to be vested in the Member States, and every competence not expressly defined as being European remains with them."
"In this respect, this Constitution surpasses anything else we have had; as the opponents of a superstate argue that Nice is worse, it is they who must surely be in favour of the Constitution."
"That is the truth of the matter, and so I would ask Mr Allister and Mr de Villiers to take an open-minded look at the way things are and not tell their voters and the public things that are not true."
"This Europe seeks to pool sovereignty where we as individual states are too weak to go it alone."
"What this means is that we do not want to take sovereignty away; on the contrary, we want to reclaim it for our citizens where we cannot act otherwise."
"Now that the tsunami has struck, we can see that the nation-states can no longer help on their own, because it is beyond us, and that is why our peoples need to be given additional strength through our standing together in order to have a chance of survival in this globalised world order."
"That, after all, is the whole point of this European enterprise, whose traditional objective has been to make war in Europe impossible – an objective of which we must not lose sight."
"At the same time, the citizens, states and peoples must retain their own identities."
"In the future, too, I would like, as a German, to be able to get angry when we lose at football to the Dutch."
"We want to retain our identity."
"It is in diversity that our wealth is to be found."
"That cannot mean, though, that we do not take joint action in situations in which our strength depends on our standing together."
"We should see to it that the Constitution is successfully ratified."
"Domestic, day-to-day policy must not be allowed to decide how the Member States and their parties handle the ratification process; what is, instead, decisive is the historic moment, in which it will become apparent where the statesmen are in the Member States, moving the process of ratification forward."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo on their outstanding report."
"This Constitution is indeed our baby, and even if it does have a few flaws, there are no ifs or buts in our commitment to it."
"We want it to grow and flourish."
"Let me say, secondly, that the greatest challenge for the European Union is not Turkish membership in twenty years’ time, but the ratification of the European Constitution in two."
"It is by that that history will judge us, and – let me say – not just the politicians, but also the peoples of Europe."
"I have confidence in the peoples’ intelligence, and in that of their parliaments."
"In two years’ time, the Constitution will be in place."
"After all, what will happen if it is not?"
"Those who believe that the status quo under the Treaty of Nice will continue to prevail in Europe are hankering after an illusion."
"Europe will not shake itself down into a core Europe and a fringe Europe, either; on the contrary, without a European Constitution, the European Union will degenerate into a patchwork Europe, confusing the public at home and destroying Europe’s credibility in the eyes of the world."
"It would be criss-crossed by the axes and alliances of what would claim to be strategic partnerships."
"If the Constitution fails, we will revert to a Europe of plots and counter-plots, the old Europe, and it is precisely that that we do not want."
"The Constitution brings to an end twelve years of intermittent reform, which have taken us from Maastricht to Nice via Amsterdam and from 12 to 15, and then to 25, Member States."
"Now at last, Europe can again give its full attention to the political challenges of the twenty-first century, which are enormous."
"We do, though, have a new basis on which to do this."
"The 25 different peoples, all of whom want to retain their identity – and will do so – who robbed and murdered each other, waged war on each other and laid each other waste for centuries; these 25 peoples are now indissolubly uniting their political destinies."
"No such thing has been done before in Europe’s history or that of the world."
"That is what makes our fight for this constitution so worthwhile."
"Let me say, fourthly, that European unification was, for fifty years, an inward-looking affair, focussing on the accession and integration of new Member States."
"From now on, it must look outwards."
"Europe is not a world power, but it does have a world power’s responsibility, and that responsibility we have to be able to live up to."
"The twenty-first century will present Europeans with immense challenges: globalised business and financial flows, international terrorism, climate change and the disasters associated with it, and the flow of migrants."
"A new world order is coming into being – not in ten years’ time, but now!"
"Economically speaking, Europe is – still – a global player."
"Politically speaking, we are in the regional league."
"If we Europeans do not face up to these challenges now, we will be exiting the stage of world history – politically at first, and then – inevitably – economically."
"That is not the Europe for us to leave to our children."
"Europe’s response to globalisation is the unity of its peoples."
"That is our response to the challenges of the twenty-first century."
"Let me conclude by saying that the Constitution provides two guiding lights for the European Union’s actions in the future."
"In the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Constitution affirms that the EU exists not only to guarantee the freedoms of the market, but also so that the citizens may enjoy the freedoms to which they are entitled."
"Article 3 of the Constitution commits the EU to working towards peace, security and the sustainable development of the earth, thus affirming that the Union bears responsibility for our planet rather than existing for its own sake."
"Freedom for humanity and responsibility for the world – from these grows the new Europe’s identity."
". – Mr President, the American publicist Jeremy Rifkin recently wrote a book about the European Union and entitled it ‘The European Dream’."
"I am grateful to the President for making it possible for Mr Rifkin to be with us this afternoon, and for giving us the opportunity to discuss with him the future of Europe and of the European ideal."
"This book is a dazzling analysis of the achievements and innovations of fifty years of European unification, which are truly unique and to be found nowhere else in the world: direct elections in 25 countries to one parliament; a court of law capable of handing down rulings for all citizens and all states; one single currency in twelve countries, enabling us to defend our economic sovereignty at a time of globalisation; and, now, a European constitution on the table before us."
"This is something of which Europeans should be proud; they really should take great pride in what has been achieved."
"It is, however, glaringly apparent that such a euphoric analysis is the product of observation from outside Europe, for the European Union evokes astonishment and admiration from around the world: in Africa – having heard President Mbeki’s speech to this House, we know what expectations are placed in Europe; in Asia, where Europe is giving extraordinary help to deal with the present disaster; and also in America, both North and South."
"I sometimes wish there were less small-mindedness, less fearfulness and less scepticism within the European Union."
"Rather than being afraid of the project of European unification, we should hold our heads high with pride."
"We are a model, and a model secured by the European Constitution."
"Some of Europe’s dreams have already come true."
"We still have work to do on the others."
"As has already been said, the founding fathers’ great dream was that, after a millennium of war, peace would at last be restored to the continent, and the EU is the greatest peace project in the world."
"Many peoples have longed for freedom and democracy."
"Let me say it again: the EU is the greatest peace project that there has ever been on this continent."
"Many of those around us find the EU very attractive and want to join it."
"Some dreams, though, have not come true in a time such as this, in which crime, terrorism and the challenges of globalisation are gnawing away at the European Social Model."
"I believe we will be better able to make the dream of prosperity and security a reality with this Constitution than without it."
"Such are the big issues that have to be explained to people everywhere over the coming eighteen months, as ratification is debated in the twenty-five countries."
"The Europeans’ great dream, the long-term goals of this European project and the values that underpin it: these are what we must communicate, and we must not allow ourselves to get lost in trivia or details."
"One Member on my committee once said that we must not now count the individual trees, the 448 articles, and pick out one; instead we must look at the whole wood, the project as a whole."
"It is then that we come to the conclusion that this is a great leap forward, from a union of states to a union of citizens, from diplomatic Europe to a democratic Europe."
"Nothing is set in stone, and there will of course be more stages to European unification."
"That is what we should be saying to all those who are not yet satisfied."
"I want to thank Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo for producing a really good report, which will prepare this House for dialogue with our partners in the national parliaments and the citizens of twenty-five countries."
"I am glad that the European Constitution owes much to this House, from Altiero Spinelli’s ‘Crocodile Club’ to the European Constitution Intergroup in the previous and present legislative periods, in which many Members have worked to achieve progress in this area."
"We rejoice and are glad that this draft is now on the table."
"We must now do everything possible to ensure that this draft becomes reality rather than existing only in black and white."
"There have already been two drafts; this third attempt at a European Constitution must see the light of day."
"If, tomorrow, we vote for the Constitution by a large majority, everyone will go out and fight for it."
"Europe’s friends must not let this historic opportunity be taken out of their hands."
"We must not leave the field to its opponents, who will lead their countries and peoples into isolation and down a political cul-de-sac."
". Mr President, Parliament’s Committee on Development expressed decisive support for the constitutional text, in the belief that it represents historic progress by establishing solidarity with those who need it most, development cooperation and responsibility in humanitarian assistance, wherever it is required, as defining characteristics of the European Union."
"In the opinion of the Committee on Development, we call for mobilisation so that the Constitution can be ratified and can enter into force as soon as possible, and for that mobilisation to involve those institutions, NGOs and individuals in Europe who have made North-South solidarity a fundamental cause within our political struggle and our social commitment."
"Let us remember, therefore, that the Constitution makes these values of solidarity and cooperation and humanitarian responsibility the European Union’s distinguishing marks and that, accordingly, they must transcend all policies and guide all Community actions."
"The Constitution also means that, in the future, the European Union will have the legal personality we have lacked and which will allow us to act as a Union on the international stage and particularly within the realm of the United Nations."
"In this way, we will be making considerable progress with regard to representativeness, responsibility, efficiency and potential, which are particularly important in terms of the European Union’s presence and work in the countries of the developing world and in the field of development cooperation."
"Let us not forget that the eradication of poverty in the world is explicitly laid down as one of the European Union’s constitutional objectives."
"We will end – though this is of particular relevance given the current circumstances in Southeast Asia – by stressing that the Constitution provides for the creation of a European body of volunteers for humanitarian actions, thereby demonstrating its considerable timeliness and capacity for anticipation."
". Mr President, in the area of trade policy, this Constitution puts the European Parliament in a much stronger position."
"When, as was formerly the case, the European Parliament’s democratic control did not extend to trade policy, that gave rise to constant criticism."
"This House did not even have to be consulted when the autonomous trade legislation was adopted."
"In future, necessary measures will have to be laid down by European acts and framework legislation, so, in principle, Parliament will participate as an equal."
"That is something in which we should take great satisfaction."
"It is still, however, a source of anguish that it has still not yet been possible to make qualified majority voting the norm in the Council."
"On this, the Convention was more advanced than the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Nevertheless, this Constitution makes for greater consistency in the trade policy matters that we have been dealing with within the WTO ever since the Uruguay round."
"This Constitution puts the European Union on a better legal footing for conducting negotiations."
"Mr President, for those of us who work to ensure that the Union’s economic resources are well spent, this is a good day: all spending is going to be subject to greater democratic control by Parliament and the Council, and efficiency in spending is going to increase, because governability is being increased: we are replacing vetoes with democracy."
"That means we are going to be able to spend better; and if the resources the citizens contribute are better spent, we will have more authority to ask for more resources in order to implement the policies the citizens are demanding of the European Union."
"It is, therefore, a great day, a day for being happy to say ‘yes’, at a time when, through this Constitution, we are bringing the European project to fruition after fifty years."
"This Constitution brings much progress with it; nevertheless, as our Group President, Mr Poettering, quite rightly said, it is lacking certain things."
"We have been timid in terms of acknowledging our Christian roots, we have been timid in recognising the obvious."
"We have just celebrated Christmas; this Parliament will stop at Easter; here in Strasbourg the most important building is not a building like this one, but a medieval building, a cathedral."
"Perhaps we have been victim to a degree of intolerant secularism, but Christmas, Easter and the Strasbourg Cathedral will still be there and there are many aspects we have been able to improve."
"We must, therefore, say ‘yes’, because we believe in Europe and we are aware that this European project is going to resolve the daily problems of the citizens."
"We are going to do so in the best way: by spending better, controlling our spending better and having more democratic and effective policies."
"Our group and I personally say yes to the Constitution."
"Mr President, there was a large majority of us in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs who voted in favour of the new draft Constitution."
"We did so not because we thought that the proposal was perfect in all respects."
"Indeed, we should like to see more decisions with qualified majority voting in the social area."
"I myself should like to see opportunities exist for cross-border union rights."
"We voted in favour because this proposal in the social area is better than the current proposal."
"We must not turn the best into the enemy of the good when we judge the new draft Constitution."
"Let me give a few examples of improvements."
"Firstly, the objective of full employment."
"This is the first time we have this objective in any draft for the new Constitution."
"Secondly, the social clause in Part III, which obliges the EU to meet the social objectives in all the areas of competence."
"Thirdly, the fundamental rights in the Charter of Citizens’ Rights, which also includes union rights."
"Fourthly, the strengthening of the social partners’ role through recognition of the significance of the social dialogue and trialogue."
"Fifthly, the emphasis upon the balance between employment policy and macroeconomic policy."
"Sixthly, the introduction of a legal basis for services of general economic interest."
"Seventhly, the fact that EU citizens are now able to take initiatives."
"The new draft Constitution would make the EU more open, more efficient and more democratic."
"For ourselves who defend the social model, it is quite easy to support the new draft Constitution because it includes a long list of improvements which will significantly improve the opportunities for developing the social model in the future."
". – Mr President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has adopted a position with regard to the Constitution, of which I shall highlight the following salient points: we welcome the fact that the implementation of the three pillars of sustainable development is among the Union’s objectives and that environmental integration and a high level of protection for human beings have been recognised."
"It is a pity that the third part relating to the Union’s policies and functioning does not tally with the principle of sustainable development, within the scope of the policies on agriculture, cohesion, transport and trade."
"Certain environmental measures – such as those relating to tax, town planning, quantitative water management and land use – could be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure, but instead are still adopted unanimously by the Council."
"We welcome the adoption of measures aimed at attaining high standards of quality and safety of medicines and medical devices. Measures relating to surveillance and early warning systems in the fight against serious cross-border health threats are also a step in the right direction."
"We welcome the introduction of a chapter on democratic life in the Union, and the principle whereby these positions must be taken as transparently as possible and in the manner that is closest to the citizens. Furthermore, we should like to highlight the importance of the Community institutions’ responsibility towards the public, and public access to the courts and other relevant organisations, not least in the field of the environment."
"Personally, Mr President, I feel that the next step is to discover how the public will take to the new constitutional structure; how this Constitution, which has been created in a somewhat top-down fashion, will be received and experienced from the bottom upwards; and how the principle of equality between States and the Community method will be strictly guaranteed in practice."
"Only history will be able to tell us."
"Mr President, although Mr Leinen has enjoined us to consider the whole forest of the Constitution, and not just individual trees, I must, as spokesman for the Committee on Industry, give brief attention to the trees of industrial policy, some of which I might wish would grow better than the Constitution makes provision for."
"Some significant progress has, though, been made."
"The example I would like to give is that of space policy, for which Europe now has additional powers; it may well not sound either particularly everyday or convincing, but I am not talking about us competing with the Americans or the Russians or the Chinese or anyone else in sending our man – or woman – to the moon or to Mars."
"Rather, what I am talking about is our making use of the means of information afforded by space policy for what we have to do in Europe and also around the globe."
"Consider, then, the great disaster that we now have to deal with: we need better information and warning systems, and Europe has the technology to provide them."
"Consider the day-to-day problems and tasks in connection with information and navigation that our Galileo has to deal with, and, finally, let us give thought to security policy."
"We cannot deploy our troops without the information they need being provided from space."
"If we want a proper policy of military security around the world, then we also need a proper space policy, with an emphasis on civilian and peaceful use, and for that the Constitution provides additional possibilities."
"For that reason, the Industry Committee, too, fully and wholeheartedly supports the European Constitution."
". Mr President, it goes without saying that I must begin by congratulating the rapporteurs on their excellent report."
"I have had the honour of being draftsman of the opinion for this report for the Committee on Regional Development and I would like to say that the debate on this issue has been very positive and intense, because, amongst other things, we must remember the essential role played by regional and local administrations in European integration."
"And it is also essential to remember that the European Constitution recognises local and regional autonomy as an integral part of the national identity of the Member States."
"This means that, amongst other things, the European Constitution guarantees the inviolability of the current borders of the States making up the current European Union."
"Today, however, on the subject of the Constitution and the regions, I would also like to condemn the fact that, in a region of Europe, a Spanish region, the Basque Country, the exclusive nationalist government of that Autonomous Community wants to implement a rupturist, secessionist and independentist plan, the Ibarretxe Plan, which is a direct attack on the Spanish Constitution and the European Constitution."
"Because Ibarretxe and his government, who call themselves democrats, have made a pact with the murderers of ETA and Batasuna to bring this plan into being; they have made a pact with an organisation which is on the European Union’s list of terrorist groups, Batasuna, and the Basque Nationalist Party has made a pact and an alliance with criminals, with murderers: in short, with the enemies of Europe."
"At this point, I am convinced that this Constitution is also going to put an end to independentist, rupturist and secessionist proposals such as the Ibarretxe Plan and I am sure that the new Constitution will represent an insurmountable obstacle to this Ibarretxe Plan and to anybody who wants to dismember the European Union."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ever since the advent of the common agricultural policy nearly half a century ago, the European Parliament has been little more than a consultative body when it comes to the making of laws."
"Right up to now, the Council has been able to take decisions without reference to Parliament, and over half the European Union’s Budget is disposed of without any democratic control."
"This is something that the European Parliament, and the Committee on Agriculture in particular, have never accepted."
"Unofficially, we have found ways of delaying final votes as a means of forcing the Council into a sort of codecision."
"We have also done sterling work on handling such crises as BSE, which means that our being conceded codecision in principle is something we have, to some extent, earned, and that is something we welcome."
"It has to be clear to us, though, that a number of points remain to be rectified."
"In one article in particular, the Council has reserved to itself the right to vote on quotas, prices and restrictions on quantity, without, this time, consulting Parliament at all."
"We still, then, have much to do in the future."
"We will still have to draw on our creative powers in order to exert our democratic influence in these matters and in getting it stated, in principle, that agricultural policy will be subject to codecision."
"If it is, though, Parliament will be given more responsibility, and I hope that this House will continue, as before, to give the interests of agriculture and of rural areas the attention they deserve."
". Mr President, Members of the Committee on Fisheries are well attuned to opinion in Europe's coastal and island communities."
"That committee, in a near unanimous decision, endorsed my opinion on this Constitution."
"The most important paragraph in that opinion, which will be retabled tomorrow for voting as Amendment No 13 on behalf of my Group, refers to exclusive competence."
"It 'considers that within the context of the other exclusive competences of the EU, which are detailed in the Constitution, the inclusion of the conservation of marine biological resources is anomalous and unjustified'."
"The common fisheries policy has not been one of the European Union's success stories."
"Decision-making is too centralised, too inflexible and too remote from the communities that it affects."
"To entrench the CFP effectively in primary constitutional law is a major step in the wrong direction and one that will – I believe – be an obstacle to the kind of major reforms demanded by the fishing communities that I am familiar with."
"Exclusive competence takes the CFP outwith the principle of subsidiarity, ensuring that regional advisory councils can never evolve into management bodies."
"I hope that colleagues will support Amendment No 13 tomorrow and support the fishing communities, as the Fisheries Committee of this Parliament has done."
"These communities strongly believe that exclusive competence is not only unnecessary but is indeed anomalous and unjustified."
"."
"Mr President, I too would like to warmly congratulate both rapporteurs, particularly on the way in which they structured their report, in which there is little room for us on the Legal Affairs Committee to make further improvements, although what we have proposed has been incorporated, and for that I am very grateful."
"We, in the Legal Affairs Committee, will, though, be dealing with the issues of special interest to us in an own-initiative report, particularly the reform of legal instruments and of the lawmaking process, the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, and the innovations in the justice system."
"I believe that another issue that will demand our attention in the future is that of how we can guarantee coherence between parts I and III of the Constitution."
"This opinion by the Legal Affairs Committee does of course concentrate on the rearrangement of the Union’s instruments of action, of which there is at present a veritable plethora: the Convention counted 35 different types of them."
"I would like to pay tribute to its Vice-President, Giuliano Amato, who achieved great things as chairman of the Working Group on Simplification, something that all those present who were involved in that Working Group will be able to confirm."
"They can all, in any case, take pride in their own contributions."
"That much about this European Constitution is unique as has already been said;"
"I also contend that something else that is unique is the amount of simplification that this Constitution has enabled us to achieve and the amount of bureaucracy it has enabled us to do away with."
"I am thinking only of the constitutional reform processes that are going on in Austria and Germany at the moment."
"I also see this as proof that the EU is not the bureaucracy it is always depicted as being; on the contrary it is very much an institution capable of reforming itself and has shown itself to be more so than not a few nation states."
"Our legislative instruments will in future be simple and readily distinguishable from administrative instruments – and, when the Constitution is in place, much else about our lives will be so much easier."
"I also believe that, although these changes are less spectacular than some of what is going on in the institutions, they play a very important part in making the EU more democratic and bringing it closer to the people."
". – Mr President, I congratulate the Members who have drawn up this important report."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs found it a pleasure, a great pleasure, to approve the revised contents of the Constitutional Treaty, because several issues relating to the area of freedom, security and justice will at last be addressed in a new way in keeping with people’s demands: clearly, when one talks of freedom one is talking of the most important thing in life for each one of us."
"There remain, however, certain aspects – which I shall highlight – that the Civil Liberties Committee examined but which left us somewhat perplexed, although without detracting from our pleasure and hence our desire to have this report adopted unanimously by this Parliament."
"As I was saying, we were left perplexed by certain points: the clause granting Member States alone the power to determine the volumes of admission to their territory of third-country nationals, thus precluding the possibility of establishing a genuine European policy for the management of legal admissions to the Union; the appropriateness of incorporating the ‘emergency brake’ clause for judicial cooperation in criminal matters; the appropriateness of some Member States enjoying special arrangements for derogation from the Constitution; the European Parliament's limited role in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters as regards family law; and the fact that the provisions relating to the freezing of funds, financial assets and economic gains needed to achieve the objectives of the area of freedom, security and justice are limited, contrary to what was proposed in the Convention text, to the area of the prevention and combating of terrorism, and thus exclude the prevention and combating of organised crime and of trafficking in human beings."
"Nevertheless, the Civil Liberties Committee was very pleased to issue a favourable opinion and therefore, on behalf of the Civil Liberties Committee, I call on all Members to express their approval of the Constitutional Treaty tomorrow."
"Mr President, the Laeken Declaration rightly called for the EU institutions to develop in a way which brought them closer to the people."
"As the ratification process on the Constitution gathers pace, it must be said that those ambitions clearly have not been realised."
"As a member of the Convention, I made great efforts to try to persuade my colleagues that the emerging draft was wrong for Europe in principle and wrong for Europe's citizens."
"I argued throughout that Europe did not need a constitution but a simplifying treaty."
"That would have been enough to modernise the institutions and the workings of the Union."
"I even submitted a draft of a possible alternative."
"Prime Minister Blair agreed with me then; now he embraces the Constitution as it has been drawn up."
"There is nothing anti-European in opposing the Constitution."
"However, British Conservatives and other colleagues in the PPE-DE Group think that it centralises more powers, makes the institutions more remote and reduces the powers of nation-states."
"Europe has missed an historic opportunity to modernise its workings to meet the demands of an enlarged and more diverse Union."
"A simplifying treaty could have tackled the real issues: relative economic decline, fraud and waste, and greater involvement of national parliaments in the decision-making processes."
"At a time when the generosity of people across Europe and the world towards the victims of the tsunami disaster is evident to all, it is inexplicable why this Parliament is committing a considerable sum of money to a programme of events and receptions in support of the European Constitution."
"Those funds would have been better directed to assisting in the disaster relief."
"The Constitution is of such far-reaching significance that its rejection in one or more of the Member States in the forthcoming referenda would render it void."
"However, rather than being totally negative, we should regard that outcome – should it occur – as a fresh opportunity for us all to establish a modern Union that respects and celebrates its diversity and which is accountable by the people and from the people, rather than one which demands too much conformity."
"We live in a very peculiar time in the history of the united Europe."
"Even though it is very difficult to divide the recent past into sections, we witnessed, organised and became part of such events that clearly allow us to draw the conclusion and declare that we have entered into a new era."
"Today, the united Europe consists of 25 Member States, and we know that expansion is still in progress."
"The united Europe’s new face shows more and more defined characteristics and in order to maintain and preserve these traits, we now have a Constitution, which is the topic of today’s presentation."
"The Constitution proves that the united Europe will be able to meet the legal requirements of the expansion as well."
"This Constitution allows for more opportunities to make Europe become the Europe of its citizens."
"The role of Parliament, whose Members are appointed by direct election, has grown, and we believe that the decisions made by the European Parliament and the national parliaments should and will be built upon each other."
"Thus, the range of norms that pertains to the whole of the Community may extend in the long run, especially in the area of social issues."
"Hungary had already ratified the Constitution at the end of last year."
"However, this document that is on the agenda today is very important to us as well."
"There have been concerns that information has been suspiciously withheld."
"I firmly believe that we do not withhold information and we do not have any secrets, we have nothing to hide."
"It seems as if we have to force information on the European political systems and citizens of Europe."
"It requires certain knowledge to be a European citizen and to be democratic."
"In the so-called Lisbon process, we need to be familiar with the norms of the Constitution, its social norms and also know that norms require more and more guarantees in order to build a social Europe, strengthen solidarity and secure social tolerance."
"The Constitution is our basic law, but as many have said before, it is not a final document set in stone."
"Let me mention two areas that reflect our future challenges."
"Firstly, the challenge of a multicultural Europe."
"What I mean by this is not the question of Islam, but the challenge that our Europe is religious and secular."
"Secondly, the question of minority issues."
"During the ratification debate, the Hungarian parliament urged that minority rights should be strengthened in community legislation."
"I believe that our common European citizenship is the key to overcoming discrimination and the insecurity of national identity."
"Let us take advantage of the opportunities provided by European citizenship!"
"Mr President, this part-session of the European Parliament is of historic significance."
"A motion for a resolution has been tabled on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, and this House, Europe’s largest democratic institution, will send an important message to the nations and citizens of Europe by adopting it."
"The resolution approves the Constitutional Treaty and calls for its ratification."
"Adoption of the resolution will be an opportunity for all those who believe that Europe needs a Constitution not only to gain information on the Treaty, but also to convince Europe’s citizens that it should be adopted."
"In addition, I believe it will also act as an appeal to the European Commission to become involved in convincing European citizens of the Treaty’s merits."
"The Constitutional Treaty has been the target of much criticism in my country, and it did not live up to all the expectations held of it."
"I have no doubt that, as it stands, the Treaty makes it possible to strengthen the European Union."
"Firstly, both the Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights enshrined therein state unambiguously that respect for the dignity of the human being is the basis of our common values, thus confirming the significance of our Judaeo-Christian heritage."
"Secondly, the Treaty strengthens the role of the Community institutions, notably Parliament, the European Commission and the Court of Justice."
"Thirdly, the Treaty extends citizens’ rights and creates a European public space."
"Fourthly, the Treaty strengthens the EU by creating the post of EU Foreign Minister, and it enables full continuity to be achieved by means of longer presidencies, without the EU being turned into a superstate."
"Fifthly, it strengthens the EU as a community of states, nations and citizens, based on common values and solidarity."
"This is the kind of EU we need."
"Two new Member States, Lithuania and Hungary, have been the first to ratify the Constitutional Treaty."
"I am sure that my country, Poland, in which the majority of citizens are in favour of adopting the Constitutional Treaty, will also demonstrate its unequivocal support for the Treaty during the referendum."
"I believe this should be regarded as something significant and, in its own way, symbolic."
"Twenty-five years ago, the Polish Solidarity movement removed the first stone from the Berlin Wall, and our German colleagues ought not to forget this."
"Fifteen years ago, the Round Table talks in Poland showed that it is possible to make the transition from a totalitarian system into freedom without any disruption to international peace."
"This was the beginning of the unification process in Europe, and the Treaty represents a great opportunity for this united Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the destiny of Europe is at stake."
"I believe that I know what that means; my father survived the battle of Stalingrad; my mother emerged from the concentration camps at Auschwitz and Dachau."
"Are we not all, on this continent, the products of an endless succession of perpetrators and victims of ceaseless violence?"
"That is why I insist that Europe is a promise – a promise made 60 years ago on the brink of the abyss that was Auschwitz, and in the ruins of Europe."
"The promise was that nationalism would be overcome, that democracy and the rights to freedom would be unrestricted and that Europe would be united politically."
"Our actions must be measured against that."
"This Constitution, which the vast majority of Greens will be endorsing, is a great step toward this promise being kept."
"It is not the end; the tasks have not been completed."
"It is for that reason that we will be voting in favour of it, and of the report as well."
"This Constitution lays the foundations of a European democracy."
"It establishes the Union as a community of fundamental rights."
"Its policies are underpinned by a common code of all-embracing values and objectives; for the first time, it declares social rights to be human rights as traditionally understood."
"It simplifies the Treaties, makes external actions subject to international law, makes the EU more effective and transparent, more democratically legitimate, and creates the possibility of its citizens sharing in its decision-making."
"Indeed, it does create something that is a Europe of citizens rather than the Europe of state chanceries that once existed."
"That is why we will be voting in favour of it, and that is why I am glad to see Mr Wurtz here to hear me say that I find his criticisms incomprehensible."
"His amendment makes no reference to democracy, even though this Constitution is indispensable if Europe is to be democratic."
"Why does he not mention that?"
"He claims that social progress is absent, yet this Constitution, for the first time in the 200 years’ history of human rights, acknowledges and enshrines social rights as human rights in the traditional sense of the word!"
"Despite certain contradictions, we have, for the first time, incorporated full employment and the social market economy in the list of this Constitution’s objectives and values."
"It is not true to say that we have agreed to make Europe a military power."
"The whole process is highly questionable."
"The issue of our relationship with NATO is as yet unresolved, and, although none can surely say in what way Europe will emancipate itself, we have made our actions subject to international law and to the UN Charter, while also, and for the first time, making civil conflict prevention a task imposed by the Constitution."
"You cannot make things so easy for yourself."
"I am worried about the ratification process, but that is not what we have to get through."
"When the president of the Lithuanian parliament was here, when our Hungarian colleagues spoke, these ratifications took place without any information campaign on the part of the governments and without any public debate."
"Is that how we want to win the Constitution?"
"We will not do it that way!"
"We have at least nine referendums ahead of us, and please can the rapporteurs, whom I want to congratulate and thank, allow us to say that this report is completely uncritical."
"That puts a question mark against the credibility of this House."
"We are not the Intergovernmental Conference’s court poets."
"We are not here to sing the praises of a Constitution that is not without its defects."
"We have not created a European social order."
"European democracy is incomplete."
"The shaping of a European peace framework still calls for great deeds to be done, and so I would have liked to see us not only vote by a large majority to adopt this Constitution, but also open up prospects for the continuation of the constitution-making process."
"We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will make our contribution by setting in motion the first citizens’ initiative, which will demand a first amendment to the Constitution, completing democracy, peace and the social order in Europe."
"Mr President, in defiance of the resolution passed by the majority of my party, the PDS, and of the majority in my group, I support this Constitution. To their ‘no’ I say ‘no’."
"As a socialist and a convinced European, I cannot square rejection of the first European Constitution with my conscience."
"It was through a democratic process that it came into being, and that is itself a first in the history of the European Union;"
"I myself played a part in that as a member of the Convention."
"Let me set out the reasons that have led me to this conclusion. For centuries, the peoples of Europe have suffered from imperialistic wars and bitter animosities."
"To these we are, as we must, putting an end."
"On that the Constitution sets its seal."
"Defining the Union as a community of values, the Constitution enshrines a canon of values ranging from the respect for human dignity, which is the highest good, to justice and solidarity."
"All these values I count as my own, and I want to do everything I can to see them, in their entirety, actually made real in society."
"The Constitution reinforces the rights of citizens; it makes the EU distinctly more democratic, above all, indeed, presenting new opportunities to create a social Europe."
"The Constitution substantially advances European integration, making the European Union as a whole better prepared to face the future."
"The Constitution is significantly better than the Treaty of Nice, by which the Union is at present held together in law."
"My decision also has to do with the fact that the Left, during the course of the Convention, largely refrained from contributing any practical proposals of its own to the process, and with its failure to come up with any real alternatives to what it now rejects."
"I find that unacceptable."
"Whilst I would like to see a peaceful, democratic and social European Union and to see Europe united, this goal will elude us unless we are prepared to make concessions to one another."
"I am convinced that Europe will never come into being if the political families declare their own standards to be points beyond which they will not go."
"My saying ‘yes’ to the Constitution does not, of course, mean that I wish to gloss over or ignore its defects, and I want to continue to contend for changes in the EU."
"I will, of course, take up the cudgels against neoliberal policies, and I will also fight against all that tends to turn the European Union into a military power."
"My particular concern is that we must prevent the European Union from degenerating into an image of the power projected from America, and from its being weakened in economic and social terms by rearmament."
"Mr President, a blank cheque is a cheque on which the recipient writes the amount concerned."
"A cheque of this kind can be issued in an emergency, if the signatory knows the recipient very well."
"Why, however, recommend to the electorate that it endorse an agreement that is to be given substance by leaders we cannot possibly know at present?"
"We do not know whether the most important and most sensitive issues are to be decided unanimously or by qualified majority voting."
"The future unelected prime ministers will themselves be able to determine how they will make decisions, instead of giving the electorate the last word."
"Nor do we know the content of important articles in which decisions are left to the Court of Justice."
"In one place, a pledge is given on matters relating to countries’ social systems; elsewhere, our welfare systems can be voted away on the basis of a majority decision or a judgment."
"In one place, the status of the national church is maintained; elsewhere, the precedence taken by the Danish Constitution in matters relating to the national church is removed."
"In one place, national identity is guaranteed; elsewhere, the Constitution has to give way if it is in conflict with a decision by officials in Brussels."
"In Article III-375, the Danish Supreme Court loses the right to decide the limits placed upon the EU authorities."
"In many places, there is freedom of choice as to whether a binding decision or voluntary coordination is to be used."
"Thus, we do not know what we are supposed to endorse."
"It is therefore wisest not to endorse anything until the amount is stated on the cheque, together with the identity of the recipient, and until we are also given the right to cancel the cheque. In that way, we shall at least know what we are voting on and how we can overturn a decision."
"Constitutions are for states."
"Between states, agreements are made, that is to say treaties."
"I want to see a Europe of democracies that solves practical problems by focusing upon cross-border issues, or matters that we cannot solve ourselves."
"In that way, we should not be losing anything in terms of democracy, but should have everything to gain in terms of cooperation."
"We should then have a democratic bonus instead of a growing democratic deficit that might end up with the collapse of democracy."
"As the well-known poet Ebbe Kløverdal Reich pointed out, democracy without a is simply the exercise of power."
"Government that provides no opportunity for adjusting a country’s course at the date of the next election is not democracy, but oligarchy."
"Europe deserves better, and that is the title of the alternative statement that I recommend be adopted instead of Mr Corbett’s and Mr Méndez De Vigo’s report."
"– Mr President, the Convention, in which this Parliament took part, drew up a text considered at the time to be the best possible compromise."
"Then the Council, in turn, reached the most workable compromise, and the new Constitutional Treaty was signed in Rome."
"Depending on individual national constitutions, it is now a matter for the people, through referendums, or for the national parliaments to give final approval to the new path."
"It is a path which, like it or not, regards Europe not as a federal superstate that has gradually eroded away identities, traditions and cultures, but as a Union of sovereign states that have freely chosen to breathe life into a common policy."
"It comes at a time in human history when natural disasters and man-made tragedies require that not just the economic interests of our countries be represented on the world stage, but also the values of democracy, freedom and respect for human dignity – values that our continent has secured and set out at last after centuries of war and conflict."
"If today, in this Chamber, we divide over something that no longer depends on our decision, but on ratification by the individual Member States and individual peoples of the Union, it will mean disavowing our Parliament’s ability to plan the future and relegating it to the role of a talking shop in which plenty of fine speeches are made but little is decided."
"That stands in stark contrast to the increase in our prerogatives which, after a great struggle, we have finally achieved precisely through the drafting of the new Treaty."
"It would seem appropriate to recall that, while the values and principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights now included in the second part of the Treaty form the ethical basis for the Union, several parts of the Constitutional Charter are still incomplete and will need updating in the light of current circumstances."
"Furthermore, we must ensure that the Constitution is not exploited for party-political purposes against governments that have been duly elected by their own citizens."
"The European Union must not run the risk of becoming a place where political groups join in battle to attack freely made national decisions on ideological grounds."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we hear it said that the EU needs this Constitution if it wants to deepen integration, but, as we have just heard from one of its most forthright advocates, not everything in the draft we are to vote on is ideal."
"It is, apparently, better than what we had before, so this is progress in any case."
"That actually sounds pretty feeble."
"We are also told, though, that this Constitution will in no way facilitate the development of a European superstate; on the contrary, it apparently strengthens the Member States in their identities."
"If that is so, then the citizens of Europe’s states should be given a real chance to have the last word in the debate on its ratification, if at all possible by means of referendums."
"For that, though, they need real information rather than just the one-sided propaganda celebrating the Constitution."
"The Constitution’s weaknesses, too, need to be discussed without accusations of anti-Europeanism being thrown around: for example, the fact that smaller Member States will have fewer ways to defend their interests; the fact that the European Parliament will continue to be a toothless tiger, particularly in matters affecting foreign and security policy; and also the fact that Europe’s workers are still exposed to the risk of wage and social dumping."
"Only a frank and open debate on this Constitution’s flaws and dangers will make it possible for the peoples of Europe and the citizens of the EU to see it as something more than a Basic Law handed down from on high."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what is at issue in today’s debate on the European Constitutional Treaty?"
"I think that if we consider it as it stands, there are a number of things that I personally, my party, and our group – that of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – would like to have changed: we would have liked a reference to our Judaeo-Christian heritage, a clear demarcation of powers and responsibilities, a description of the European Union’s geographical borders, public participation in the ratification process, since a constitution is actually an expression of popular sovereignty and something that ought to have been expressed somewhere in it."
"On the other hand, though, this treaty makes a multitude of improvements over against the treaties that we have at present, and that is the comparison in which the Constitutional Treaty must come out best."
"It brings us more democracy, strengthens the European Parliament, and involves the national parliaments in the lawmaking process."
"Instead of weighted votes, there will be dual majority in the Council."
"Instead of more general clauses, powers will be specifically conferred."
"The Commission is to be limited in size, which will help to make it more democratic, and the Constitutional Treaty makes for greater transparency, which of course makes it necessary to involve the national parliaments."
"Before we come to decide on something at first reading, the national parliaments will be given the chance to say something about it."
"Not only in that it makes for transparency do I regard that as something important."
"The Council will have to hold its meetings in public."
"We are at last taking leave of the clandestine diplomacy that has characterised Europe for over fifty years."
"To sum up, what that means to me is that the European Union will be concentrating on the tasks it can perform, rather than becoming a superstate."
"Even if people still need to be more informed and more involved, this is still, on the whole, a respectable treaty."
"I can speak for my own party, the CSU, but also for our colleagues in the CDU, when I say that we will vote in favour of this Constitutional Treaty without any reservations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on the European Constitutional Treaty has been written in a very positive spirit."
"We seem to be commending a flawless piece of work, as if we were unaware of its weaknesses."
"We should not, however, ignore the voices warning of the shortcomings of the present draft Constitution."
"We may decide that, despite every effort, this Constitution is neither transparent nor comprehensible."
"I am also struck by the fact that the motion for a resolution does not allow for much democratic discussion, thus branding those who have their reservations about the Treaty as anti-European."
"The European Constitution is a practical instrument that will affect European integration for decades to come."
"Europe can set out on the road either towards a bureaucratic federalist superstate, or towards the political opposite, a liberal and competitive Europe."
"Let us make it quite clear that adopting or failing to adopt the European Constitution is a predominantly political matter, and not a prerequisite for integration."
"It is therefore entirely legitimate to vote both for the Constitution and against it."
"Ratification is often portrayed as an essential step which should not be open to too much discussion."
"Advocates of the European Constitution sometimes even threaten that the Union will not allow itself to be held back by just a few countries not ratifying the Constitution, and that these countries will be marginalised and will have to content themselves with some lesser form of affiliation."
"I consider this approach to be very unfair."
"I have already repeatedly referred to the risk that democratic principles will be violated;"
"I grew up in a political system where a cheerful and happy ‘yes’ vote was the only possible choice at every election."
"I should now like to issue a warning against the use of these same principles."
"I am not trying to target the Constitutional Treaty directly."
"I simply wish to emphasise the need for open and democratic discussion, and to stress that a failure to adopt the Constitution is not a disaster, nor does it mean an end to the process of integration in Europe."
"On the contrary, it might lead to more profound consideration as to where European integration is heading and where the voters would really like to see it."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express my support, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Spanish Socialists, for the Corbett-Méndez de Vigo report, which marks the end of an historic process."
"There have been two debates on the creation of constitutions in the European Union."
"The first was the debate of the Congress of the European Movement in 1948, in which Churchill, Reynaud, Ramadier, van Zeeland, Madariaga and Adenauer had the opportunity to begin debating a Constitution for Europe."
"The second is the one we are concluding today, which has changed the history of a continent on which more than a hundred million people died violent deaths between 1914 and 1945 and on which, today, peace is the norm, thanks to a process to which we are giving real form through this Constitution, which expresses our fundamental shared values, enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, with common citizenship and a Union based on citizens and on States: a secular Union and a Union with the ambitious objectives which have already been mentioned here."
"Mr President, please allow me to refer to my country, which will be the first to hold a referendum on the ratification of the Constitution, with a public and open debate which we believe is important for everybody."
"It is true to say that the Zapatero Government, after winning the elections of 14 March, unblocked the process of approving the Constitution, but I would like to say – and I cannot see any Member of the Spanish Peoples’ Party, and I would therefore ask the Vice-President of their Group, Mrs Grossetête, to communicate this on my behalf – that the Convention began with the Spanish Presidency of the Council of Mr Aznar, and it was he who called for the referendum."
"I therefore believe and hope that there will also be decisive support from the Spanish Peoples’ Party – the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats appears to be guaranteed – for the whole of this process."
"I believe that in that way we will be able to ensure that we have a referendum which genuinely sets a positive precedent for the referendums in the other States which have decided to hold them and that there be a public and open debate."
"I will end by saying that this concludes a process in which Europe has been constructed with passion and with good sense, and this has led it to change history."
"Mr President, any position on the European Constitution must be based on a balance between what this Constitution says and what it does not say – something that is not perhaps properly underlined in the report we are voting on at this part-session."
"This leads me to say 'yes' to this Constitution because of what it represents and because it means a new step forward on the way to a stronger and more efficient, more transparent, more democratic Europe."
"With this Constitution, Europe will have a stronger voice in the world."
"Citizens will get better protection of their fundamental rights."
"Their freedom and security will be better defended."
"Moreover, our values, including those which are behind our social and economic model, will be strongly proclaimed and protected to allow Europe's growth and, simultaneously, to protect Europe's social cohesion."
"But that does not prevent me from acknowledging that the text reflects the unfortunate bias of some political majorities that existed in Europe at the time when it was drafted."
"I particularly regret that it reflects a virtual Europe, a Europe that is not the real Europe, a Europe that does not exist in political terms, where everything that lies between individual citizens and states is just ignored."
"Peoples in Europe, regions, and their political role in the construction of a diverse and plural Europe have simply been neglected, have been passed over in silence in this text."
"But this is just not the reality of the Europe we are all building here together."
"What is worse, some languages, such as my own – Catalan – which are stronger than acknowledged officially at European Union level, are blindly ignored in this Constitution."
"Some of these problems can be solved outside the Constitution, and some of us will keep fighting for that."
"I will therefore join those who support this positive step forward in the building of Europe and I will strongly recommend a 'yes' in the Spanish referendum, although I will fully comprehend and respect any other position taking a different view of this balance."
"I will not take this text as something engraved in stone, but as an improvement that allows us to keep working for a Europe where all citizens and peoples can feel comfortable, and are acknowledged as they really are and want to be."
"Mr President, we European Greens are in favour of a ‘yes’ vote in the coming referendum on the European Constitution in Spain."
"We will have the great responsibility of holding the very first referendum on the continent, and a result expressing the Spanish citizens’ firm support for the Constitution will send a clear and strong message to the other European countries and will provide the impetus to carry on building the Europe we want to see after ratification."
"Our ‘yes’ is a demanding ‘yes’."
"On the other hand, we are concerned and confused by the position of the Spanish Peoples’ Party."
"I would ask the question: what has happened to those people who said they wanted to die for Nice, such as Mr Aznar?"
"I see that they are still alive and kicking and that they are currently creating confusion, double language and alarm in relation to the coming referendum in Spain, putting narrow-minded party-political interests above European integration."
"This double language, together with an attitude of saying or doing little in relation to the Constitution, and confusing the people with other issues which have little to do with the Constitution, does very little to promote European integration."
"Some people are calling for a ‘yes’ without any real conviction and sending confused and contradictory messages to their own voters, seeking only to erode the current government of Spain."
"The demanding ‘yes’ that we Greens advocate means choosing to take advantage of the new European political area constructively in favour of the social and ecological Europe we want."
"The Constitution is not the end of the road, it is not the final destination, and is not even an inn."
"We believe, like Antonio Machado, that the path is made by walking; we believe that this Constitution is a step forward and we will continue along this road in the future."
"Mr President, I must again point out the wisdom contained in the Norwegian Mountaineers’ Handbook."
"In the event of a discrepancy between the map and the terrain, follow the terrain."
"Otherwise, we end up in tragedy or farce, something we are well on the way towards."
"This is due to the fact that, in crucial areas, the Constitution goes against the democratic intentions that are invoked and correspondingly deprives genuine democracy of vital sustenance."
"The Constitution involves a huge concentration and centralisation of the EU elites’ political power, especially over the judiciary and police."
"The EU Constitution constitutes a genuine abolition of living democracy in civil society, especially since the expansion of the EU’s power makes real democratic control impossible."
"The only hope in this process lies in the forthcoming referendums."
"The EU elites are trying to abolish this ultimate democratic element too."
"Democracy is now so deeply compromised that it is openly practised as the power of the elite to govern the people."
"The fight against the EU Constitution is a fight for democracy, and one that we intend to win outside this House."
"Mr President, it is pretty clear that what we are involved in here is a one-sided exercise in selling this Constitution to the peoples of Europe."
"Listening to some of the talk, you would think the Second Coming of the Lord was being debated."
"Starting this week, you will be spending large amounts of taxpayers' money telling people what they should think and how they should vote."
"I suggest that first you ought to put your House in order."
"Some weeks ago I revealed to this Parliament Commissioner Barrot's past and the affair was whitewashed."
"Now it has emerged that during his hearing, Siim Kallas, who is in charge of the anti-fraud drive, gave deliberately misleading information and inaccurate dates, and used a misinterpretation as a means of shying away from a vital question."
"Yesterday afternoon, President Borrell denied me the chance to make a one-minute speech to mention this to Parliament."
"You will not win your constitutional battle by burying the truth and by failing to have a proper debate."
"The whole process will fall yet further into disrepute, although, given the fact that I, along with many colleagues here, will be campaigning for a 'no' vote, perhaps I should be grateful for the manner in which you conduct yourselves."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there have been times in the course of this debate when one might have been forgiven for thinking that no criticism of the Constitution had ever been voiced."
"I believe that this will change when the Members of this House return to their countries and encounter diverse and varied criticism of the Constitution from a number of very different quarters."
"The Union for Europe of the Nations Group, in common with many of the other political groups in this House, is divided on the issue of the Constitution."
"The members of Law and Justice who constitute the Polish element in this group are opposed to it, not because it would be a bad thing for Poland, but because it would be a bad thing for Europe."
"To begin with, the Treaty alters the system according to which votes are counted, to the disadvantage of countries with a particular interest in policies relating to Eastern Europe, cohesion and agriculture."
"This applies to Poland in all three instances, of course, yet it is not the implications for Poland that are the most significant problem, but the weakening of whole sectors of European policy."
"The Treaty strengthens the EU’s powers over economic, employment and social policy within the Union."
"It does not yet go so far as to grant exclusive competences, of course, and no decisive step has yet been taken."
"Nevertheless, it substantially strengthens the EU’s powers."
"Yet it is not harmonisation of economic policy that Europe needs, but systems competition in this field."
"Harmonisation will consign Europe to the margins of global competition."
"The Treaty is a significant step towards use of the Community method in the field of foreign policy."
"Again, no final decisions have yet been made, but a step has been taken in that direction."
"It is difficult to say where a line can be drawn between the Community method and the inter-state method in foreign policy, and Mr Rehn, the new Commissioner, admitted as much during his hearing before the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Finally, the Treaty is based on false premises from its very first lines."
"An example of such falsehood and extreme prejudice is the removal from the preamble of references to Christianity and God, whose presence is still felt in the majority of the European Union’s Member States."
"These are all reasons why today we must say ‘no’ to the Treaty and ‘no’ to this motion for a resolution in order to say ‘yes’ to Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only is the draft Constitution far from being ideal, it is also far from being the compromise it could have been."
"Those in favour of a Constitution and a better European Constitution would do best to reject this draft, as I am in no doubt that a subsequent one would be an improvement."
"The members of Self-Defence will vote in favour of Amendment No 102, an extremely important amendment by Mr Bonde to which I have put my own name."
"The democratic deficit would be increased if national parliamentary competences were to be handed over not to the democratically elected European Parliament, but to the unelected European Commission, and this would be most undesirable."
"It would also be undesirable to abandon the principle of ‘one country, one Commissioner’."
"Yet it would be a good idea to hand back to the nation states all matters which are not in actual fact of supra-national importance, and more freedom and less centralism is a good principle to follow."
"In conclusion, I should like to say that the members of Self-Defence are open to the idea of an EU Constitution."
"We do not reject it as such, but we cannot vote in favour of the motion for a resolution as it stands."
"We have doubts, and these doubts are shared by millions of inhabitants of the EU’s Member States."
"Yet we are open to dialogue, as this is what the millions of inhabitants of our countries want."
"We will therefore abstain from voting in the final vote."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo, on their remarkable report."
"I should also, however, like to thank Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, without whom, I am sure, we would not be here today debating this historic stage in Europe’s development."
"We are in a position to gauge how far we have come."
"The greatest danger for Europe would be to fall back into intergovernmental methods."
"Indeed, we must deplore the fact that European governments have not followed all the proposals made by the Convention, the consequence of which is that we shall gradually have to adapt the Constitution as we go along."
"In fact, what we need is more Europe in a globalised world confronted with terrorism, migratory flows, climate change and major economic disruption."
"We need more Europe, more Union – a Union based on our universal values – and more democracy."
"The Constitution will bring all of this, strengthening Parliament’s role and involving national parliaments at the same time."
"Those rejecting this Constitution speak of Brussels bureaucracy, of a loss of national sovereignty and of a European superstate."
"For want of arguments, they trot out the same backward-looking slogans, which are today devoid of meaning because they bear no relation to reality."
"This is typical of their inability to look to the future."
"How else can we explain that all 25 of our governments agreed to adopt the Constitution?"
"They certainly did not intend to commit ."
"Because we must work collectively together in the service of the European citizen and for future generations, we say ‘yes’ to the Constitution for Europe."
"Europeans must choose between insularity and paralysis, on the one hand, and openness and modernity, on the other."
"The choice is simple – if we want a free and responsible Europe, we must ratify the Constitution for Europe."
"– Mr President, as a French socialist and as a European socialist, I shall be voting tomorrow, with emotion and pride, in favour of the report by the two Members of this House."
"I shall therefore turn my speech into a tribute – a tribute to Altiero Spinelli, who drew up the first European Constitution in this democratically-elected House."
"I never forget that he was a veteran of the young communists and I turn to my fellow socialists and say to them ‘never forget where you have come from’."
"He was an old anti-fascist militant, an old federalist, and I pay tribute to those Members of Parliament who voted for this draft during the sitting of 14 February 1984."
"Mr Poettering voted in favour, Mr Hänsch voted in favour, Mr Wurtz voted against and Mr Vergès voted against."
"They will do so again, loyal as they are."
"If you re-read the text on which we shall vote tomorrow, you will notice that it takes up a number of elements of that old text. Let me give you some examples."
"Article 3 of the Spinelli report enshrines the principle of European citizenship; Article 4, respect for fundamental rights;"
"Article 9, the Union’s objective of full employment; Article 34 speaks of European laws;"
"Article 44 mentions sanctions; Article 82 of Part 4, which is Part 3 today, speaks of ratification, and I could go on."
"What I am trying to say is that tomorrow’s vote forms part of the context of this long history, and that this Constitution has not simply fallen out of the sky; it is part of a major historical movement."
"The seam was first mined over 50 years ago and yielded the raw material of reconciliation."
"The single currency, the euro, which is more than ten years old, was Germany’s currency of reconciliation."
"Let us therefore view this Constitution as a hand proffered to the peoples who have joined us again, now that the dark night of totalitarianism is over."
"– Mr President, current events demonstrate that we need Europe now more than ever."
"We need Europe to protect us, and to initiate and drive forward an original social model."
"We need Europe to generate growth, to coordinate our economic policies and to combat unemployment."
"We need Europe to implement a genuine research and development policy, like the one pursued by the United States."
"We need Europe to protect and preserve our environment and, finally, we need a Europe that carries weight in the world, with military and civil European defence, and a genuine foreign policy."
"The world’s balance depends on Europe’s continued existence."
"In order to address this enormous expectation we need more effective, more transparent and more democratic institutions."
"We need institutions that move away from a way of working that is all too often intergovernmental, whereby decisions are always taken without the citizens ever being involved."
"We need institutions that favour Community decision-making, because this is the only truly democratic method of decision-making."
"We also need strong institutions, enabling us to move towards a more integrated Europe, despite the timidity of the Heads of State or Government."
"This is why we support both this excellent and well-written report and the draft Constitution."
"Even if it does not go as far as we would like, this Constitution is a symbolic and significant step towards a more unified, stronger and more democratic Europe."
"We owe that to our citizens."
"Mr President, for the Catalan Republican Left – the – and for the other parties in our European coalition – for example from the Basque country, Aragon and Andalusia – this is not a good Constitutional Treaty."
"It does not recognise our wish for internal enlargement."
"Stateless nations will not have any recognition in this Treaty."
"We would have accepted the Treaty if only it had included a small step forward – official-language status for the Catalan language."
"Today, in Parliament, about 2% of Members may not speak their mother tongue."
"Of this 2%, the vast majority of us are Catalan speakers."
"I am the fourth Catalan-speaking Member – after President Borrell, Mr Guardans Cambó and Mr Hammerstein Mintz – to speak here this morning in a language other than our own –"
"We reject this constitutional Treaty because we want to be directly involved in Europe and want a stronger, more united and cohesive Europe, built on its own diversity; just the opposite of a nation-state built on the basis of the French model and against plurilingualism, diversity and plurinationality."
"Working nation-states do not make a good basis for the construction of Europe."
"Europe should be built on the basis of national diversity comprising stateless nations, nation-states and constitutional regions, for the purpose of establishing a new European citizenship."
"– Mr President, the primary duty of a parliament is to represent the people."
"Our duty in relation to the Constitutional Treaty should be, first of all, to measure the gap between the peoples of Europe and this Treaty: without the people there can be no Constitution."
"To the democratic deficit in the drafting of the Treaty we can now add the lack of democracy in its adoption: if we cannot have a single referendum for all of Europe’s citizens, we could at least have held a referendum on the same day in all the countries of the Union."
"Instead, however, everything is done haphazardly and people are just as divorced from the Treaty today as they were yesterday."
"Europe is in danger of going the way of the titles of a famous trilogy by the great European intellectual Italo Calvino: from to to ."
"There are no people and there is no constitutional spirit in the Treaty; it lacks any idea of its place in the world and in time."
"That is all very serious, at a worrying time when war and terrorism have come to predominate in politics, when natural disasters like the one in South-East Asia speak of the social injustice and the intolerable poverty of this world."
"In a globalised world, Europe is in danger of declining: there is a feeling of malaise in Europe linked to its internal crisis of social cohesion, while instability has become the key social factor of our times."
"This Treaty represents the abdication of politics in the face of all that: a silent Constitution."
"In it, peace is a vague aspiration, not a repudiation of war."
"In it, the rights of people, women and men, workers and migrants, are a variable dependent on a balanced budget and monetary stability."
"Democracy is an optional extra."
"The Constitutional Treaty does not provide for rights, apart from those of the market; it does not propose reforms; it has no future; but instead it keeps Europe stuck in its present crisis."
"It is not just inadequate: it is the wrong direction altogether."
"That is why the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is declaring itself against this Treaty and will be campaigning against it in every country."
"We need to free ourselves of this encumbrance in order to build the Europe of the future."
"Mr President, today, the European Parliament is debating a treaty that is, as regards its nature and content, a constitution, or at least that is what the rapporteurs tell us we are doing."
"In the report, they take as their starting point the apparent opposition between the Council and Member States on the one hand and Parliament and the citizens on the other."
"In doing so, they overlook the fact that the European institutions owe their existence to the voluntary transfer of powers by the Member States."
"Moreover, citizens continue to identify primarily with their own state."
"A European identity that has been imposed from above, with its own symbolism, will not change this in any way."
"The treaty endows the European Union with the characteristics of a state."
"One unfortunate illustration of this is the Foreign Affairs Minister, a joint figurehead who has to cover up the lack of joint policy, and it is equally unfortunate that this person himself becomes an institution."
"The rapporteurs have to recognise that the dual responsibility on the part of the Council and Commission creates confusion and sows the seeds of potential conflicts of loyalty."
"I cannot describe this treaty as anything other than an impetuous leap in the dark."
"– Mr President, as a Lithuanian I ought to be proud that my country's parliament was the first to ratify the European Constitution."
"However, the majority of Lithuania's citizens have not seen, read or discussed it."
"It was not even debated by Lithuania's Parliament."
"On the other hand I am sure that for the most part this Constitution is in keeping with the interests of my nation and state."
"However, I would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to Part 1 Article 8 of the Constitution, which lays down that the word euro – the name of the common currency of the European Union – must be used in the same way in all European Union languages."
"It goes against the fundamental principle of the Constitution and that of the creation of the European Union itself, that is, respect for national languages and cultures."
"According to this article, which is based on Council Regulation No 974/98 of 1998, there would be an unprecedented intervention in the grammatical systems shaped over thousands of years and in semantic relations expressed not in word order, not in words with one form, but in the declension of words, of the languages of the seven new countries of the European Union, among them the Lithuanian language."
"The Regulation mentioned, announced six years ago, before the new countries were admitted to the European Union, does not allow the word euro to be declined."
"Such a ban contradicts Article 314 of the European Community Treaty and Article 53 of the Treaty on European Union on the true equality of the European Union's official languages, as well as European Community Treaty Article 5 on subsidisation and Article 151 on the limits of cultural policies."
"I asked the Commission and the Council why these circumstances have not been taken into consideration and four months later Mr Almunia, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, replied that the non-declinable word euro is used in the Constitution because this was laid down in the Council Regulation."
"Back to square one, and disrespect for national languages remained."
"If such a ban remains in the Constitution, then in the Lithuanian version and all legislation we will have an abundance of not only ungrammatical but absurd statements."
"I hope that Parliament will take these arguments into account."
"Thank you for your attention."
"– Mr President, a Constitution is the founding act of a State, and it was an entirely conscious decision to choose that term, just as it was to give the EU a flag, an anthem, a motto and even a national celebration."
"Despite your pathetic denials, the European Constitution is, therefore, without doubt, the founding act of a European superstate."
"It represents the death of our often ancient nations and their transformation into a number of powerless provinces within this bureaucratic, omnipotent and centralised State."
"I know that you blithely accuse those who do not share your blind belief in the benefits of the Europe of Brussels of lies, of mediocrity and even of stupidity."
"This is a handy tactic and entails never having to explain. It also makes it possible to follow the peremptory statements of the happy few, who know – or think they know – what is good for the, in their view, uncultivated, masses."
"The fear instilled in you by the fact that referendums are to be held on the Constitution is an illustration of the contempt in which you hold the citizens."
"What, for that matter, are the benefits of which people speak?"
"I have seen with my own eyes, as a direct consequence of European policies, the destruction of our farming and of our economies, company relocations and deindustrialisation, endemic unemployment and poverty, the disintegration of our social protection systems, the opening of our borders to immigration on a massive scale, to terrorism and to international crime."
"The Europe of Brussels is not, of course, solely responsible – it could not have created or exacerbated these problems without the collusion of governments, of all political hues, which have decided to sacrifice their countries’ independence and their inhabitants’ freedom to the Brussels Leviathan."
"The European Constitution will put the finishing touches to this monstrous edifice, which was begun over 40 years ago."
"That might be what you want, but we are rejecting it because Europe and the Europeans deserve better than this soulless superstate."
"We are rejecting it in the name of freedom, in the name of independence, in the name of the sovereignty which belongs solely to the people and which is inalienable, and in the name of those people’s right to self-determination."
"The Members of this House have betrayed their homelands."
"Their guilt is there for all to see."
"They will be cursed by history and by future generations."
"– Mr President, we would be making a serious mistake if we considered the Union to be merely an economic entity or a vast free-trade area, or even a kind of superstate replacing the national states."
"Europe is primarily a great ideal, and it was an ideal for the founding fathers Alcide De Gasperi and Konrad Adenauer, from Robert Schuman to Altiero Spinelli, from Gaetano Martino to Helmut Kohl."
"Europe is our history: it is the synthesis of our cultures and our languages, our identity and our future."
"It is the Europe of values, of the central importance of the individual, of freedom, solidarity and subsidiarity."
"We cannot think of a Union shut in tightly within its borders; we cannot think of Europe as a machine – albeit an efficient one – run by a bureaucracy that keeps changing the rules."
"On the basis of the principle of subsidiarity itself, Europe must instead solve the major problems of its citizens which other institutions are unable to address."
"Does the Constitution interpret these values?"
"The answer is substantially ‘yes’, even though we cannot hide our profound regret that there is no reference to the Union’s Judaeo-Christian roots."
"Such a reference would have represented not a religious choice, but the identification of our undeniable historical roots."
"The decision to sign the Constitution in Rome was, for our country, an important acknowledgement of the work carried out during the six months of Italy’s Presidency."
"To be effective, a fundamental law needs to have life breathed into it; in other words, it has to be put into practice and invested with political power."
"That is why Europe, through the Constitution, really must speak with a single voice in foreign policy. It must win a seat on the new UN Security Council and it must be an exporter of peace and not just of special interests in the Mediterranean area and the Middle East."
"The world of globalisation needs this Europe, the Europe of solidarity, subsidiarity and human rights – the political Europe of the people whom this Parliament truly represents."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"There can be no doubt that Europe, the Member States, and, above all, Europe’s citizens need a European Constitution."
"The present framework of the Treaties is too narrow for an enlarging Europe."
"What was adequate for 15 Member States is no longer adequate for 25 Member States."
"After all, one would not try to dress a fully-grown 25-year-old in the same suit he wore when he was 15 years old."
"He would need to be bought a new one."
"The same is true for Europe, and the enlarged European Union must therefore have a legal and organisational framework that corresponds to its size, intentions and ambitions."
"The European Constitution creates such a framework."
"The Constitution is a good document as it represents a compromise."
"It makes the EU more citizen-friendly, more efficient and better."
"It also makes the Union a place where human beings are valued and where democracy and security are safeguarded."
"Moreover, it provides for a high level of protection of citizens’ personal rights, and grants them better access to the affairs of the entire EU and influence on the European Union’s legislative capacities."
"The EU’s citizens are well aware of this, and this is why they support the European Constitution in such large numbers, even if they are not entirely familiar with the details of its contents."
"This is the case in my country, Poland."
"I am proud to be able to tell you that 73% of Poles are in favour of the European Constitution, despite the reservations previously expressed by my government with regard to the draft Treaty, and despite the campaign that has been conducted against the Constitution within the country."
"It has become apparent that it is a mistake to exploit the Constitution in domestic political disputes."
"No political party has the right to call for the Constitution to be rejected, even if it is in opposition."
"Referendums on the Constitution should relate to its contents, and not turn into anti-governmental plebiscites."
"The citizens of the European Union are aware of this, and this is why they know better than politicians what is good for them."
"They subscribe to the view that whoever is in favour of Europe is in favour of the European Constitution."
"We should listen to them."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Constitution, or Constitutional Treaty, is a better legal basis than any we in the European Union have previously had, and, as it is a good and acceptable compromise, our group really can vote to endorse it."
"We should regard the European Constitutional Treaty as being, above all, a great chance to construct a shared European identity."
"That is what we in Europe need: a sense of being ‘us’, a feeling of belonging together, with us all seeing ourselves as Europeans and also Germans, Westphalians from the north of the Rhine, and, in my case, citizens of Cologne – all this made possible by this European Constitutional Treaty."
"We have written our shared values into this Constitutional Treaty, thereby making this old continent into something of a new world, for the wonderful thing about this Constitutional Treaty is that we are defining in precise terms what holds us together."
"If this feeling of being ‘us’, this identity, is to come into being, it is quite vital that all Europeans should be able to decide for themselves whether they want this Constitution."
"That is why we are campaigning for referendums on it in every European country, for although most of the people can now vote on the Constitutional Treaty, not all Europeans can."
"If the people of Europe are to know, firstly, that this Constitution exists, and secondly, having given it some thought, that they want it, it is vital that they themselves should be asked."
"We should therefore let people themselves vote and make an effort to ensure that referendums are held in every country."
"It will not, unfortunately, be possible to organise it so that they are held all on the same day, but, if people themselves are asked, it will in any case enhance their sense of identity, their awareness of being ‘us’."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would invite you to see this Constitutional Treaty in perspective and not as the finished article."
"The European idea has never been fixed, and it will not now be fixed in the wording of this new Treaty."
"This Constitution is an important, essential and indispensable staging post, but it is still only a staging post."
"Mr Giscard d'Estaing said of this document that it was unhoped-for."
"I prefer to say of it that, broadly speaking, it can still be improved, given the extent to which, and despite the unquestionable advances it entails, the dross from the previous documents still clings to it."
"Our fellow citizens are prepared to live with this document as an interim report on their common history but have no desire to be taken hostage by it for decades, with all movement on what was the European compromise at the beginning of the twenty-first century indefinitely postponed."
"That is the whole point of Amendment No 17, which I have tabled on behalf of my group and which a great many of my fellow MEPs have co-signed."
"Through this very clear and very brief amendment, our Parliament, and I quote, ‘[a]nnounces its intention of using the new right of initiative conferred upon it by the Constitution to propose amendments to the latter’."
"I would thank our two co-rapporteurs, Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo, for having supported this amendment, as it is the medium through which our House indicates that, while remaining forever the driving force of European development, it is attentive to the social and democratic advances awaited by our fellow citizens. If the document were to be set in stone, there would be a danger of the same thing happening to the Constitution too."
"Moreover, any stone out of which the Constitutional Treaty were to be carved would not, whatever Mr Giscard d'Estaing may think, be that out of which the equestrian statue commemorating the President of the Convention would also be carved. It might, rather, be that marking the grave of the European project."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would therefore again invite you to embrace a progressive Europe, as the constitutional process is still in its early days, and its strength and interest lie specifically in its newness."
"I once wrote a book on the emergence of human rights theory and on the American Constitution, so I have some understanding of the positive aspects of this document."
"What I do not understand, however, is why the European Parliament wishes freely to condemn itself to a second-class position by supporting this document."
"Article III-330(2) reads as follows: ‘A European law of the European Parliament shall lay down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the duties of its Members."
"The European Parliament shall act on its own initiative after seeking an opinion from the Commission and after obtaining the consent of the Council."
"The Council shall act unanimously on all rules or conditions relating to the taxation of Members or former Members.’"
"This preserves the supremacy of the Commission, the executive, which has more rights than we do, and it also preserves the unjust disparities between us as legitimate representatives of the European people."
"Only we are truly legitimate, with all the other European bodies being derivative, and so I believe that this provision must be omitted."
"Although Mrs Wallström has just said that we would have more democracy, I do not think that it is more democracy we want, but merely democracy, pure and simple."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if you gave the Constitution, or whatever you ultimately call it, to a cartoonist in any country of Europe who respects the principles of democracy, of national sovereignty, of the values of the historic and cultural heritage, he would draw it like a mincer from which various parts of various animals, from sheep to cows, come out in the form of minced meat."
"But people are not animals and it is a crime to treat them like minced meat."
"Fascism did it with weapons and some people appear to envy its intentions, and 65 years later certain other weapons such as money and propaganda are being used for the same reason."
"We therefore say no to the canning of the peoples of Europe, no to the law of the jungle which throttles the weak, no to the imposition of underhand approaches and people and no to efforts to turn citizens into docile robots in the hands of multinationals and banks."
"We say yes to the right of opinion and rejection, yes to the Europe of sovereign nations, yes to Christianity and human rights, yes to the pride and dignity of the peoples."
"'I recognise you by the fierce edge of your sword."
"I recognise you by the look which measures the earth with force.’"
"And force used on the spirit is worse than force against the body."
"There is still time for resistance."
"We have time to reverse globalisation and the new order of things. '."
"Mr President, since the first six countries joined forces, the European Communities have developed a form of cooperation that is not perfect but that is nonetheless a form of cooperation between states of equal value whose governments have the last word concerning the states’ cooperative participation."
"What is more, the adherents of this Constitution have not today concealed the fact that Europe is to be governed not by the countries’ governments but by a strong Commission whose parliamentary legality lies in the directly elected European Parliament."
"My party and I dispute the sense and validity of this construction."
"This Constitution removes countries’ independence in favour of a non-transparent regime pursuing objectives that, in all too many cases, do not have grass-roots support."
"My country’s oldest constitutional document, the Jutish Law of 1241, states, for example, and I quote: ‘The law shall be honest and just, tolerable in terms of the country’s customs, appropriate, useful and clear, so that everyone might know and understand what the law says’."
"It may be said of the Constitution that we are debating in this House today that it is not honest about the intentions behind it."
"If it is just, it is only so in the eyes of those who wish to amass power throughout the whole of Europe."
"It is not tolerable for the majority of Europeans, for it only corresponds to the customs of a few countries."
"It is of no use in terms of free cooperation, and it is not clear, for no one can know and understand what the Constitution says."
"This draft Constitution must be rejected. Otherwise, the EU will end up as a regime of the big powers, which will damage the EU as a whole."
"I recommend the minority’s amendment."
"Europe deserves better."
"Please allow me, ladies and gentlemen, to use my time to explain the actual supplementary proposal, to digress a little from the spirit of the previous discussion."
"The proposal I refer to, Proposal No 10, corrects one of the discrepancies introduced by the Constitution, those discrepancies about which so much has been said today."
"In fact, the text of the agricultural policy is out of date in the Constitution, fifty years out of date."
"The legitimate aim of agricultural policy half a century ago was to produce sufficient food."
"Today the situation is reversed, Europe has the problem of disposing of its surpluses."
"The European Parliament’s AGRI committee has even pointed, in its views on the Constitution, to the direct conflict between the original aims of the common agricultural policy and the Constitution."
"On the other hand, increased competitiveness is a priority aim of all the reforms which have been and are being made in the common agricultural policy – but this is not included in the Constitution."
"The draft amendment rights this wrong."
"It would also be desirable for the European Parliament to adopt this draft amendment because, in the entire resolution of the European Parliament, this is actually the only reference to the most important common policy – the agricultural policy."
"The subject of our debate, the Constitution, may be the first joint creation of the reunited Europe."
"The Member States may also regard it as their own, as we, including myself, participated in the work of the Convention drafting the Constitution for a year and a half."
"It is, perhaps, not by accident that two new Member States, Lithuania and Hungary were the first to ratify the Constitution."
"The Hungarian parliament even proposed an amendment including minority rights among the fundamental principles of the Constitution."
"It is an important basic principle, since Europe is also the Europe of minorities, and everyone is a minority in Europe."
"At the same time, it is important that minority rights are exercised collectively and mutually and that the Constitution allows for this as well."
"This is, therefore, very pleasing to us."
"However, I find it a little unsettling that there are many people here in the European Parliament and also among the European public who were offended by the acknowledgement of the historical fact that Christianity contributed to building a joint Europe, to the creation of today’s Europe."
"It was by no means an attempt to get rid of a secular Europe, but we found it necessary that in addition to mentioning the inheritance of humanism, enlightenment and other common European values, the preamble acknowledged the contribution of Christianity to this joint Europe and its role in making it possible for us to be here today."
"I am, however, pleased that the Constitution allows for an institutional dialogue between churches and the European Union, which is a very important aspect for churches."
"This holds true, no matter how many disapprove of this idea."
"As the leader of the Hungarian Socialist delegation and as a president of the Intergroup for historical national minorities, regional languages and constitutional regions, I welcome the Constitutional Treaty."
"This Constitutional Treaty is of historic importance in many regards."
"It is definitely so for national minorities, as it will be the first time in the history of the Union that national minority rights become part of the ."
"At last a working system can finally be established to protect minority rights within the European Union."
"As a Hungarian Socialist, I am especially proud that it was my government who initiated the section regarding minority groups."
"Millions of people belonging to national minority groups will celebrate the Constitutional Treaty’s coming into effect."
"I represent a country where 10% of the population is made up of minorities, and from a cultural point of view, one third of its people lives outside its national borders."
"As a representative in the European Parliament, I had the right to say in the Hungarian parliament’s ratification debate that every country, including Hungary, shall now have two Constitutions."
"The more generous Constitution is to be observed."
"We must ensure that we always refer to the Constitution that grants more rights to our citizens, to the citizens of Europe."
"All countries will become richer in this respect."
"With regard to minority rights, the Hungarian Constitution is far more generous than the European Constitutional Treaty, as it includes collective rights, acknowledges national minorities as decision-making factors in legislation, and in addition to equal treatment, it emphasises the importance of favourable treatment, positive discrimination and allows minorities to establish their own institutions of self-government at all levels."
"Mr President, there is plenty of criticism that could be levelled at the Constitutional Treaty, and, although the text is certainly an improvement on what we have at present, the question remains as to whether it is good enough."
"In my view, there are a few missed opportunities in a number of areas."
"Let us, for example, consider the election of the President of the European Commission."
"As I see it, the European public, or at least the European Parliament, should be asked to vote."
"Indeed, that is what is stated in the new Constitution, but in the first instance there is only one candidate, as opposed to various candidates, so there is no choice."
"The same applies to codecision: a wonderful European model, a broad majority of peoples and a political majority should apply across the board."
"That may be what the Constitution stipulates, but very little will be put into practice right now."
"It follows that there is room for much more efficiency and more democracy."
"When it comes to ratifying the Constitution, and certainly in countries where a referendum is to be held on it, the debate will not, though, be about subtleties and the differences between the old and new situation."
"That is a debate reserved for connoisseurs like us."
"The treaty is about more than these innovations; it is about the text as a whole."
"We will be voting on a text which is an outline of what we have built up over 50 years of Europe – fifty years of peace, security, free movement of persons, goods, services and capital."
"If I consider the opportunities and challenges which the Dutch, along with all Europeans, are able to take on in this large Union, then I have no doubts and vote in favour."
"A referendum will be held in the Netherlands in a few months’ time."
"I am already opposed to the argument that, as a result of the new Constitutional Treaty, the imminent accession of Turkey would mean that small Member States, such as the Netherlands, would more or less disappear into oblivion within the Union."
"This is rabble-rousing, because Turkey is a separate decision and the public should, in my view, make up its own mind in a referendum when the time comes."
"It is, however, also a sign of small-minded thinking."
"It is in the present institutional chaos of Europe that large Member States can exert disproportionate amounts of influence, and smaller Member States benefit from law and order."
"I am in favour of proper and democratic governance and against chaos."
"During the forthcoming referendum, the Dutch Liberals will campaign actively in favour of the EU’s new Constitutional Treaty."
"Mr President, the worst sentence in the Constitution, which is in conflict with the basic idea of the Coal and Steel Union, is ‘Member States shall undertake progressively to improve their military capabilities’."
"If the purpose had been only to reduce the defence budget through greater efficiency, that is what would have been stated."
"Now, the clear aim is to increase the EU’s military striking power."
"From disarmament, we are now moving towards rearmament."
"If we combine this with the wording to the effect that ‘[I]n its relations with the wider world, the Union shall uphold and promote its values and interests’, we see a return to a 500 year-old colonial policy."
"This may cause anxiety in the wider world, which remembers the last time we wanted to spread our civilisation with the help of the army."
"It might perhaps create peace between ourselves, but in the world it will create anxiety."
"This is not a document for the future."
"It is a return to old-style imperialism and colonialism."
"It is something I reject."
"Mr President, I am in favour of rejecting the Constitution, as is all my group."
"At the same time I would like to remind everyone that the European Parliament does not have competence in this matter."
"This debate and the committee initiative report to be adopted, which is based on it, have no legal basis or value."
"One reason why the Constitution should be rejected is that it means the militarisation of the European Union."
"Under the Constitution, Member States even have to agree to increase their military expenditure."
"It is quite incredible that there should be a provision on such a subject at the level of the EU Constitution."
"Governments of the Member States are behaving as if the Constitution were already in force."
"It has been decided to establish 13 battle groups, and to equip them as if they were shock troops."
"In fact they are shock troops, as the intention is to use them for illegal military operations just because the EU decides to."
"We in the Convention did not adopt a ruling for the Constitution stating that operations outside the EU’s borders must always be lawful – in other words, that they must always have a mandate from the United Nations."
"The Constitution should be rejected, but let the people do it."
"In fact, the people of just one nation will suffice."
"Mr President, this is the first time delegates have been present here who bring with them 50 years’ experience of life under totalitarianism."
"Today, although we are dealing with the draft European Constitution, I occasionally feel as if I am back in the old times."
"An unelected get-together known as the Convention has produced a rushed document."
"In a similar way, a powerful elite once made decisions in our country and then issued its resolutions as predestined inevitabilities."
"We are today being told that rejection of the Constitution would cause a catastrophe of cosmic proportions."
"Life has ultimately shown that no catastrophes have occurred, and the same is true now."
"A hybrid structure mixing constitutional principles with practical policies has been developed, opening up boundless scope for interpretation by uncontrollable EU officials."
"There is a parallel here, as well, as we too have had documents passing decisions from our country to others without authorisation."
"We are sitting here today in a Chamber adorned with lavish banners on the Constitution."
"On such occasions, we too used to put up banners and listen to noisy brass bands, so that the essence of the document which had been approved was eclipsed by the euphoria."
"We do not need a European Constitution, and what we certainly do not need is this fuzzy document we are about to vote on."
"What we also do not need is to expend EU resources on spectacular celebrations."
"We should do better to send the money to Sri Lanka."
"– Mr President, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"We feel that we must warmly welcome the new European Constitution."
"The Member States are transferring a growing proportion of their sovereignty to benefit an ambitious global idea, whereby 25 countries tread a common path together, side by side."
"It is 21 years since this Chamber, by a large majority, adopted the plan to reform the European Union that had been drawn up by the Italian Member Altiero Spinelli."
"It was a complex and daring plan, which was clearly designed to create a more integrated Community."
"Since then, little by little, the nations of the old continent have continued to add to and to develop the reasons for uniting within this international framework, which has undergone remarkable modifications and changes."
"The Constitution, signed on 29 October in Rome, just as in 1957, is a fundamental achievement in that context."
"Half a century later, Europe’s road has come back to the place where it all began: an exciting new challenge involving us all in creating and building the Europe of tomorrow."
"Mr President, as Vice-Chairman of the Convention, I can only rejoice at the likelihood of the European Parliament, tomorrow, and by an overwhelming majority, declaring itself in favour of this Constitution."
"Although the European Parliament need not give its opinion formally for some time, this position on the basis of the excellent report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo, in my view, sends a strong message to Europe."
"It is true that we, in the Convention, tried to provide an answer to the challenges that Europe is facing, namely enlargement and globalisation, and this Constitution would not have assumed its present dimensions without the European Parliament’s important contribution."
"I think that this Constitution, although it is a compromise, has, in terms of quality, been a considerable step forward."
"The Constitution provides the institutional framework that the enlarged Europe requires."
"Indeed, it is impossible for Europe to continue to work with the same institutions and the same rules as it did when there were fifteen Member States."
"At the same time, I think that the true dimension of this Constitution is that we, although the first step was taken at Maastricht, are only now really changing from an economic community to a political union: the end of the pillars, the communitisation of the third pillar as regards the area of freedom and justice and a far more developed external policy, enabling Europe to speak with one voice in this globalised world."
"Although I hope that a large majority will support this Constitution tomorrow, let us not forget that we in this House carry a major responsibility in convincing the Member States that Europe needs it."
"I declare the session adjourned until 3 p.m."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before the two votes which will take place today at noon, I should like to give the floor for one minute to Mr McMillan-Scott, Chairman of the Delegation for Observation of the Palestinian Presidential Elections and Vice-President of the Parliament."
". Mr President, we have all returned safely from Palestine."
"I wish to thank my colleagues – there were 28 of us, the largest ever delegation of the European Parliament – the vice-chairman, Mrs Napoletano, and the staff who accompanied us and prepared the observation mission."
"Our task, as Members of the European Parliament, is to deliver an informed political verdict on this crucial election at the Brussels part-session later this month."
"However, we feel that the Palestinian people – especially the women – should be proud."
"In spite of the Israeli occupation and the lack of opportunity for East Jerusalem residents and others to vote, this election prepares the ground for the Palestinian parliamentary elections in July and could serve as a model for others in the region."
"I hope that the European Parliament will respond to the appetite for democracy in the Arab world as a whole."
". Mr President, I am grateful for the opportunity to address colleagues before, hopefully, my report is voted through plenary."
"The PEACE programme is of much more than purely financial importance to Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland."
"It is the most visible contribution so far by the European Union to building a stable society in Northern Ireland and, to that extent, it has enormous symbolic value as well."
"It is a fine example of the European Union offering assistance without interfering in the local political process."
"On behalf of the people of Northern Ireland, I thank those who have worked so hard to ensure that this report was able to go through its parliamentary stages at speed."
"I am grateful to the chairman and the secretariat of the Committee on Regional Development for addressing the proposal as a priority once it was received from the Commission."
"I am also very grateful to the Committee on Budgets for its efficient handling of the budgetary question, which has enabled us to vote today."
"Whilst I am also grateful to the Council and the Commission, I regret that the British and Irish governments did not ask for a higher sum of money."
"The amount allocated falls somewhat short of initial expectations. However, I am pleased that the PEACE programme is being extended and would be grateful for strong support for this symbol of EU commitment to all the people of Northern Ireland."
". Congratulations, Mr Diamandouros."
"We hope that you will pursue actively, as you did during your previous mandate, your activities under Article 195 of the EC Treaty."
"We know what a vital role the Ombudsman plays, enhancing the responsibility of the Community administration, as well as stimulating thinking on practices and procedures."
"I promise that the Commission will continue to work actively and closely with you."
"The Commission is also aware of the fact that citizens are making increasing use of their right to complain to the European Ombudsman."
"The number of complaints rose substantially during the first ten months of last year, compared to the same period in 2003."
"This seems to mean that the rise in the number of complaints reflects the fact that citizens know about their rights, rather than any worsening in the administrative behaviour of European institutions – at least, that is what we hope."
"The Commission is looking forward to improving its cooperation with the European Ombudsman."
"We wish you all the best in your important work."
"That concludes the vote."
". Today I voted in favour of the extension of PEACE Funding but I did so with considerable reservation."
"That reservation arises from the fact that, to date, PEACE Funding in Northern Ireland has been allocated in a most imbalanced way, to the gross disadvantage to the Protestant/Unionist Community."
"It has also favoured terrorist prisoner groups over victim groups, who exist as victims because of the horror visited upon them by those terrorists."
"During this extension of PEACE Funding I am looking for an overt righting of these wrongs."
"This funding must be allocated in an even-handed manner."
". I am delighted to support this report and welcome the proposed extension of the PEACE programme to cover this year and 2006."
"This decision will allow the PEACE measures, designed to support reconciliation, to be carried on for another few years."
"The continuation of these peace initiatives is invaluable in rebuilding trust between communities and bringing communities together from both sides of the border."
"PEACE focuses specifically on reconciliation and the projects it has funded have contributed greatly to promoting mutual understanding and better community relations."
"I am delighted that funding has now been extended to the end of 2006 and sincerely hope that further provision will be made in the Financial Perspectives when they are finally established and come into effect in 2007."
"There is no doubt that our hopes for a peaceful future depend on the good work of the various cross-border and North-South initiatives funded under this programme."
"The PEACE programme is justified as an internal matter for the EU."
"The players that have the main and ultimate responsibility for achieving a consolidation of the peace process are, however, Ireland and Great Britain."
"As the June List sees it, it is of crucial importance that economic aid not be used as a form of ‘structural aid’, but that it be used for bringing about real and practical improvements that promote positive development of the peace process in Northern Ireland."
"If it were only up to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the draft Constitution would be much more ambitious than the one presented to us."
"It would enable us to give substance to the political, social and ecological Europe that we champion."
"It would be a project with unambiguous and definite objectives and not include this third part that, in merely echoing the earlier treaties, is an obstacle to an ambitious global project for Europe."
"In spite of its imperfections, I shall however vote, and call upon others to vote, in favour of this Constitutional Treaty, for it would be an aberration and a major political error to throw in one’s lot with those opposed to the Constitution, on the pretext that the final wording is not commensurate with what is at stake."
"We need Europe, even an imperfect Europe, more than ever."
"With a Constitution, we shall succeed in launching this peace-oriented Europe, the bearer of common values such as human rights and democracy."
"It is by taking this major step that Europeans will feel united in a genuine common project."
"It is a militant ‘yes’ that I shall stand up for in voting on the Corbett report."
"Not to rise to this historic occasion would be to deny our own work as builders of Europe and would, for some considerable time, inhibit what we wish to see, namely the ambitious development of European integration …"
". I congratulate Mr Nicholson on his excellent work on the recommendation concerning the extension of the duration of the PEACE programme."
"The PEACE programme, which was started in 1995, is aimed at fostering peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and in border areas of the Republic of Ireland."
"Following the success of the PEACE I programme, the Berlin European Council of 1999 decided to extend the programme for a further five years, in order to provide continuity to the projects that had been set up."
"I endorse the rapporteur’s position that in this region of Europe, which has endured over 30 years of violence, all energies should be channelled into making it possible to maintain social inclusion, economic development and employment, urban and rural regeneration and cross-border cooperation."
"It is therefore essential to extend the implementation of the PEACE programme by two years, until the end of 2006, coinciding with the programming period for the Structural Funds and with a proposal to extend the annual Community contribution to the International Fund for Ireland for the same period."
"The wider aim, therefore, is to align the measures financed by these two instruments with interventions carried out in the region under EU cohesion policy."
". I welcome this report, which formally gives the backing of the European Parliament to continued EU funding for the European Peace Fund until the year 2006."
"In 2005 and 2006, EUR 108 million are being allocated to this fund which is supporting projects in the border county region and Northern Ireland."
"One third of this fund, EUR 36 million, will be spent in the border county region, the remaining EUR 72 million being spent in Northern Ireland."
"The European Peace Fund 2000-2004 supported 4 000 projects in Northern Ireland and the border county region alone."
"The European Union also gives EUR 15 million a year towards the International Fund for Ireland and has supported consecutive Interreg programmes dating back to the late 1980s."
"In the overall context of the peace process in Ireland, the European Union has been at the forefront in providing political and financial support – and it is clear that it will continue to play an active and central role in this regard."
". I voted in favour of Mr Nicholson’s report on the PEACE programme for Northern Ireland, because I feel that it is extremely important for the EU to show solidarity with the Irish peace process."
"Our solidarity should be channelled into benefiting the wide range of sectors, groups and communities worst affected by the violence, and into fostering inter-community projects."
"Financial management through locally-based partnership structures and sectorally specialised non-governmental organisations will help to strengthen the ties of peace and reconciliation that are crucial to stabilisation in Northern Ireland."
"I also consider essential the objective of financial consistency that has been set out as a result of the extension of the implementation of the PEACE programme for a further two years, given that it constitutes a step towards aligning the actions financed by this instrument and by the International Fund for Ireland with interventions carried out in the region under the EU cohesion policy."
". In a Europe that has proved capable of building peace within its borders, phenomena such as those in Northern Ireland and the Basque Country have, fortunately, become fewer and farther between."
"Given the serious nature of these situations, however, the EU must continue to condemn vehemently and unconditionally the use of violence as a means of solving political issues."
"In the context of the ceasefire initiatives and the opening of negotiations between the two sides in the Northern Ireland conflict, I feel that similar determination must be shown as regards any initiatives intended to help establish lasting peace in those territories."
"Against this backdrop, I welcome the fact that financial support is to be maintained for Northern Ireland and for border areas of the Republic of Ireland, and that the PEACE II programme is to be extended for a further two years."
"We are therefore continuing with the debate on the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"– Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, the new Treaty is a positive step from an institutional point of view, as everyone has pointed out."
"The new Treaty gives us a Union that is stronger, more democratic and closer to the citizens."
"It is also a Constitution which, most importantly, represents shared values and is a political project. We see this straightaway with the constitutionalisation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is aimed at creating a society that sees itself as a social market economy and that targets full employment."
"These are not mere words; they are the EU’s new objectives, which are enshrined in Article 3 of Part 1 of the Treaty and which must guide all of its actions and policies."
"Article 185 of Part III on monetary policy, for example, expressly states that, without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the European System of Central Banks supports the general economic policies in the Union in order to contribute to the achievement of its objectives as laid down in Article I-3."
"Horizontal application clauses should also be highlighted. These clauses guide the Union’s actions and policies laid down in Part III of the Treaty."
"Accordingly, Articles 115 to 122 of Part III, for example, state that the various policies of the EU must ensure that equality between men and women is promoted, that the environment is protected, that consumers are protected, that social rights such as employment are guaranteed and that public services or services of general economic interest have the necessary conditions to fulfil their missions."
"These examples show how the new Treaty strengthens the European social model. It does not backtrack on any gains that have been made and enshrines new and important advances."
"It is therefore good news, in that it gives tangible form to our desire to live in a society with high levels of social protection and high environmental values."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, five years ago, there were some of us in this House who wished to revive Spinelli’s Crocodile Club."
"At that time, we started a federalist cross-party group designed to work towards a European Constitution."
"There were many who laughed in a rather indulgent way then."
"In my home country of Sweden, I was patted on the head when I talked about the need for a common document that clearly stated what we stand for, why we stand for those things and how we work."
"Now, no one is laughing any more, and talking about a European Constitution is not especially controversial."
"Most people are in favour of it."
"Through the Convention and through hard work, especially here in the European Parliament, we now have a draft European Constitution."
"That is fantastic progress. It makes the EU stronger, more open and more democratic, puts the citizen centre stage and simplifies decision-making."
"Mr Corbett’s and Mr Méndez de Vigo’s resolution gives a very sound and instructive account of the advantages of the new Constitution and is a document that can in actual fact be used in the campaign, since it is written in such an educational way."
"Certainly, a lot could have been better, and many fellow MEPs have talked about the fact in this House."
"Personally, I should have liked to have seen a clearer demarcation of the EU’s powers."
"With so many Member States, it would have been sensible to concentrate upon rather fewer issues at EU level so as to be more effective in these areas."
"I should also have liked to have seen the permanent President placed not in the Council but in the Commission."
"Finally, I regret that the Convention did not discuss the issue of the European Parliament’s seat."
"We must stop this commuting between Strasbourg and Brussels."
"It is expensive and inefficient and, as long as it goes on, people will never fully trust this institution."
"A new era is on the way."
"We shall be able to adopt new reforms and shall be able in the future to take further steps with a view to the next Convention and the next Constitution."
"Firstly, the present Constitution must be ratified and, overall, this is a very good draft."
"It constitutes progress for European democracy and for our citizens."
"Opponents must bear in mind that the alternative is the Treaty of Nice, which does not in any way increase democracy within the EU."
"Nor does the Treaty of Nice make it any easier for us to cooperate with so many Member States."
"I am therefore looking forward with great enthusiasm to the debate that is now in the offing and that is already going on in the various Member States and to being out with you on the streets and in marketplaces defending the European Constitution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, together with the Flemish Greens, I will, over the next few months, be conducting a campaign for Belgian ratification of the Constitution in the federal, Flemish and Brussels parliaments."
"Tomorrow, however, we are not voting on the Constitution, but on the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo, which I regard as disappointing."
"It is an apology, an excessively one-sided enumeration of the Constitution’s many benefits."
"What a missed opportunity, Mr Corbett!"
"Should we not have given more consideration to the criticism that is now being levelled by the Left?"
"Why, for example, is it not possible to state that we are still on our way towards a fully-fledged European democracy, that the role of the constitutional regions is snowed under, that too many areas of policy are still left for intergovernmental cooperation, that there are too many areas in which the veto still applies?"
"Why can it not be said that the European Union is still too much in need of a social order, and that its orientation is too neoliberal?"
"That is why I would ask you to revisit the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, particularly Amendments Nos 4, 9, 15 and 16 and, I hope, support them when we vote tomorrow."
"– Mr President, among the various reasons for our opposition to this new Treaty I should like to highlight the fact that it reinforces centralism, federalism and European bureaucracy, that it calls for policies applicable to all Member States of the Union, irrespective of their actual situations, and that it embeds neoliberalism and the militarisation of Europe more deeply."
"The blind impositions of the Stability and Growth Pact, the European Central Bank and the monetary and single currency policies in the euro zone, regardless of the reality of each individual country, have led to a deterioration in the social situation, to an increase in inequalities arising from the privatisation of strategic sectors and public services and to appalling attacks on workers’ rights."
"We have also seen how these practices in agriculture, fisheries and in external trade policy have led to economic recessions, to unemployment and to the collapse of production in increasingly large sectors in countries with weaker economies."
"By the same token, we cannot accept the promotion campaign for the new Treaty, which is scarcely democratic and certainly not pluralist, based as it is on the arguments of its supporters, disregarding the arguments of those who are opposed to it, those fighting for a more social, more democratic Europe founded on the principle of sovereign States with equal rights and committed to peace."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a Constitution should lay down the ground rules for policy and the rights due to citizens of a democracy."
"A Constitution should not establish the content of policy."
"Social policy and policy relating to taxes, energy, policing and issues concerned with alcohol should be drawn up by the people of each country, acting together through the democratic process."
"When the will of the people changes in a country, it must be possible for policy to be changed."
"The draft with which we are now confronted is something quite different."
"It is an expression of the political class’s own ambitions for the European project."
"It regulates in detail; it deals with tourism and agriculture; it legitimises a corporate society; it forces each Member State into a currency union; and it points towards a concentration of power and a Europe governed by technocrats."
"What is presented here as a Constitution is an attempt by the political establishment to usurp the European peoples’ democratic right to shape their own futures."
"That is why the June List rejects this draft."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the task of European integration has brought about the world’s largest area of law and economic freedom, but the organisation of our continent cannot stop there."
"Europe must become a political player, a political unit endowed with democratic power and diplomatic clout."
"We want a Europe of states and peoples and, consequently, we wish to strengthen people’s confidence in the European Union."
"That is indeed what is proposed by the Constitution signed in Rome."
"I again congratulate our rapporteurs, Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo, and would emphasise the progress made through the new Treaty."
"The rapporteurs are sending out a clear message to our fellow citizens: the Constitution is fine, with the best possible wording."
"It proposes a more integrated, more efficient and more political Europe which is more attentive to people and stronger both internally and externally."
"The Constitution, as such, does not increase the competences of the EU."
"It prevents the emergence of a centralised superstate, it sanctions the legal personality of the EU and it gives the EU a human face in the form of a long-term President and a Foreign Minister."
"It also guarantees all our fellow citizens protection under the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The European Parliament is gaining ground on the European political stage. Finally, the Constitution facilitates recourse to enhanced cooperation, making it possible to face up to what will be at stake in the future."
"The destiny of a European country is now inseparable from the affirmation of its European personality."
"The Constitution represents the best way for our Member States to confront the future, starting from now."
"For them to be united around a document that they have all approved is very ambitious."
"What now will turn this ambition into a reality is the will of politicians and, in the first place, of ourselves."
"Mr President, the Dutch delegation within the Socialist Group in the European Parliament believes that the debate is about the Constitution rather than about whether we are in favour of Europe or against it."
"We are in favour, with reservations, because what matters to us are the benefits of the new Constitution compared to the Treaty of Nice."
"The Europe of Nice is undecided as to how significant it is."
"The new Treaty, however, guarantees the influence of regional, decentralised authorities, and designates the national parliament as a watchdog, so that Europe, rather than threatening to turn into a superstate, provides effective and cross-border cooperation in respect of crime and food safety."
"In addition, in the new Constitution, more than 30 types of decisions have been replaced by a handful of terms readily recognisable by the public, including ‘law’ and ‘enabling legislation’."
"With this, the Constitution introduces more clarity about the type of Europe we would like and decision-making that we use to that end."
"The Constitution also brings us more effectiveness by extending the number of areas in which decisions are taken by qualified majority, thus ensuring that one country cannot put a spanner in the works."
"More democratic accountability is introduced by removal of much decision-making from the backrooms, and by making the Council’s decision-making meetings public."
"Finally, the Constitution brings us more rights for the citizens: social dialogue, the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as well as the citizens’ initiative, of course."
"Anyone who fails to support this important step in the European integration process will become responsible for perpetuating the present Treaty of Nice, which is more bureaucratic, slower, and in many ways undemocratic."
"Our ‘yes’ is one that is tinged with a critical observation, because Europe is still very much lacking one voice."
"Social Europe is still inadequately anchored; hence a critical ‘yes’."
"In short, the Dutch delegation within the PSE Group gives a critical ‘yes’ to the Constitution."
"Around the referendum in the spring, we will be enthusiastically advocating this position, supported by Johan Cruyff, Catalan Dutchman or Dutch Catalan in the Spanish campaign."
"In that way, we are hoping to gain support in the Netherlands for this new project, the new Constitution."
"Mr President, Ireland held two referenda on the Nice Treaty: in the first we voted 'No' and in the second we voted 'Yes'."
"There were many reasons for this, but an overriding one was that our government took its citizens for granted."
"The Irish had always voted 'Yes' to Europe, so this time they thought it would be the same."
"However, on this occasion, the politicians got it wrong."
"We have to learn from our mistakes and ensure that, this time, citizens have easy access to all the information they require."
"I would go so far as to suggest that every household should receive a copy of the draft Treaty – certainly every household that requests one."
"This will be expensive, but it is well worth paying that price."
"Furthermore, I would very strongly support a suggestion to publish a document outlining, on the one hand, what is already in place in the existing Treaties and, on the other, outlining what is new, changed or different."
"Unlike the assertions from some speakers in this House today, this is not telling people what to do or how to think; it is giving our citizens a choice."
"If you were sitting a public examination in Ireland, you might be asked to compare and contrast."
"This is what we need to do: to assess if what we now have is an improvement or otherwise."
"In spite of the scathing references of many Eurosceptics, I do not claim this draft Constitution to be the Holy Grail or the Second Coming, but it is a positive step forward for Europe and one that I will support."
"I have many reasons for saying this, but time allows me to mention just one today."
"This Treaty brings the EU closer to its citizens."
"For example, a million citizens' signatures can prompt the Commission to draft a proposal."
"That is people power!"
"Just imagine the possibilities: citizens from Latvia, Spain, Ireland or Sweden, for example, finding common cause and demanding action."
"Surely, that is the possibility of a citizens' Europe!"
"Mr President, there are some things to admire in this Constitution but there are also many things to dislike."
"On balance my party has decided that it cannot recommend it to the people of Scotland, and accordingly will not be voting for the report."
"We have a number of objections to the Constitution itself, but in the seconds remaining I will simply mention the inadequate subsidiarity provisions."
"Scotland is not independent yet, but the Scottish Parliament is already the only body responsible for justice, the environment, education, health and many other areas of Scottish life."
"The provisions in this Treaty for incorporating it into the EU law-making process are inadequate."
"We have seen in the field of fisheries the disastrous consequences of EU legislation being inadequately sensitive to reality on the ground within the Member States or territories of the Union, and this Constitution will not sufficiently improve EU law-making for Scotland."
"More to the point, it does not take account of the dignity of my country."
"We cannot recommend it to the people of Scotland and will not be voting for it."
"Mr President, I am from a country with a constitution that enshrines the truth about fundamental human rights: the truth that they are part of human nature and essential to human dignity; the truth that a supreme being, not a mere human institution, gave these rights to us – all of us without exception."
"In Ireland we have had governments which have neglected or even denied our rights, but under the shelter of our constitution, even the most vulnerable of us can demand them."
"The EU Constitution expounds the false position that the EU creates all rights, even fundamental rights."
"Here, the EU is not the guardian of rights, but the giver."
"I would not dream of supporting this Constitution."
"It has not grasped the simple and important truth of fundamental human rights."
"History tells us that when human institutions become the giver of rights, rights become gifts."
"They can be bestowed selectively, denied, or even take back."
"I will support the truth that the fundamental rights of the human person are from God."
"I will defend the Irish constitution against usurpation."
"– Mr President, first of all I believe that we need to express our gratitude to the members of the Convention on the Future of Europe who prepared this Constitution and, at the same time, to congratulate the heads of the Member States who signed the Constitution on 29 October 2004."
"Nor should we forget the chairman of the Convention, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, whom we need to thank."
"I do not intend to repeat everything that has been said in favour of the Constitution or everything that has been written in the rapporteurs' report or everything said by the rapporteurs."
"I fully endorse everything that has been said and I congratulate them on the excellent report which they have submitted."
"I sincerely congratulate both Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigο."
"Τhe text of the Constitution which we are debating is not by any means perfect, as everyone has said."
"However, it is the best which there could be under current political circumstances."
"It creates a more democratic and more operational Union and makes it more credible and valid both at home and abroad."
"The European Union is going down in global history as a union of states which aims to serve values."
"Man, the European citizen, the individual, stands at the epicentre of the constitutional arrangements."
"Humanitarian solidarity is also transferred to state level with the provision on the defence of a Member State in the event of attack against it."
"It is precisely this solidarity which I emphasise in the amendment which I have tabled and I call on you to vote for it."
"The adoption of the Constitution for Europe is a huge step forward."
"It is a milestone on the road to the future."
"Those who do not believe in the European Union will naturally find clever legal excuses for political pretexts to deride the Constitution and they have every right to do so."
"However, they should respect one thing: that their governments, all the governments have signed this Constitution."
"That is why, irrespective of the reservations and the individual objections which we have, we all need to act and work for the approval of this Constitution, for its ratification by all the Member States"
"Supporting this truly excellent report gives the European Parliament both a great opportunity and a great responsibility to encourage our European fellow citizens to support the European Constitutional Treaty."
"Our message to the citizens whom we represent here is that the acceptance of the European Constitutional Treaty is a truly exceptional step forward in the development of our common European home and that it is indeed a prerequisite for its progress in all areas."
"It is but a step from European diplomacy to European democracy."
"If the worst were to happen, and for these or other reasons the agreement were not to be ratified, this would not simply be a case of Europe running in place; it would be a significant and a dangerous step backwards."
"It would endanger our efforts to bring about a future that seeks not only peace, but economic and social progress; a future in which a democratic Europe will remain an active and influential player on the international political stage."
"Today, therefore, we have the opportunity to send out the encouraging message that the European Constitutional Treaty is of the utmost importance for a more democratic, a more successful and a more united community of citizens and states, a community that, for the first time in history, has peacefully brought together almost half a billion people and also has a place for smaller nations – such as my own country, Slovenia – enabling them to develop their identity and, in an environment of diversity, to join forces with others to achieve our collective goals for building our European future together."
"Mr President, I also wish to congratulate the rapporteurs."
"However, I would like to ask for more noise and excitement over the small clause, under 'participatory democracy', that deals with the citizens' right of initiative."
"This, above all, makes a reality of bringing Europe closer to its citizens."
"It builds on the right to petition, but more than that it is a positive right that allows our citizens to begin to set the agenda."
"In my own country, in comparison, citizens have no right of initiative, petitions languish on shelves, legislative initiatives rely on parliamentarians winning a ballot – it is a sort of game of chance – and even then the initiative will probably be talked out by colleagues, with the citizens having no real place."
"I am very proud that this nascent EU right offers more: a real opportunity for our citizens to participate in and to move Europe."
"Let us therefore have a loud fanfare for this step towards direct democracy, European-style."
"Mr President, we are all aware that the Constitutional Treaty is bad news."
"It is legal nonsense, it is overly complex and it is riddled with ideology."
"The thick tomes of several hundred pages are incomprehensible to the average citizen of an EU Member State."
"They are written in the spirit of the French Revolution – an enlightened, revolutionary and secular spirit."
"There is no room in the Treaty for God or traditional, European, Christian, Roman, Greek and Latin values."
"There is no room either for the values that are dear to us, such as the nation, the family, human life, faith and traditions."
"These values have been replaced by secular, socialist, stupid and bizarre values, such as the worship of Mother Earth, or rather Gaia, rights for homosexuals and power for Brussels bureaucrats."
"This is something we cannot consent to and never will."
"The report we are debating is misleading, biased and deceptive."
"It is pure propaganda, and only has positive things to say about the Treaty."
"Where is the truth in all of this?"
"You should be ashamed of yourselves!"
"A biased report full of propaganda has been produced and distributed at the expense of the citizens of the Member States, and it is a stain on the conscience of the European Parliament."
"We should be ashamed of ourselves."
"The revolution must truly have gone a long way for the truth to be abused in such a fashion."
"Fortunately, Poland will reject this Treaty, and I hope other countries will follow suit."
"The League of Polish Families and the Independence and Democracy Group will vote against the report."
"‘No’ to the Constitutional Treaty!"
"Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that I cannot agree with the previous speaker."
"I should like to express my sincere thanks to all the members of the European Convention."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats made a particularly valuable contribution to this Convention, something which as a young MEP I was particularly glad to see."
"Mr Teufel, Mr Brok and Mr Wuermeling are names that deserve mention in this connection, but I should like to thank each and every one of the participants for the work they carried out during a period of such crucial importance for the future of Europe."
"I found it all the more regrettable that the Council, not long after the Convention had completed its democratic work, used an urgent procedure to revise its outcome to bring it into line with its wishes."
"It is unfortunate that the democratic nature of the Convention’s work was somewhat tarnished as a result of this."
"Nevertheless, I support the Constitution and do not believe that it requires detailed explanations, as the previous speaker said, but that it creates a clear, transparent and more citizen-friendly Europe."
"If I may go into detail on one point, I believe that one aspect of the Constitution which represents major progress is the fact that cooperation between the European Parliament, on the one hand, and the national parliaments, on the other, will improve our contacts with the national parliaments, and enable us to gain a more detailed idea of how the legislation for which we often merely lay down the framework is transposed directly in the nation states."
"Particularly helpful in this regard is the fact that we have a clear delineation of competences between national and European levels, and the early-warning system for subsidiarity monitoring will also have a positive impact."
"I therefore hope that regulation of a clearer and more transparent structure of competences, and the early-warning system for subsidiarity monitoring, will allow us to achieve more effective and better cooperation with our national colleagues, in order to make legislation in Europe even more transparent."
"Mr President, any community in which the separation of powers is not stipulated and the security of rights is not guaranteed needs a Constitution."
"That was stated in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789."
"We have wished to follow the path which more than two centuries ago led to the freedom of people and peoples and, therefore, through this Constitution we will have more and better Europe."
"Thanks in particular to the work of the Convention and, finally, to the agreement of the Intergovernmental Conference, we will have a Constitution which will represent a legal recasting and, above all, a political relaunch of the Union, and, as a result, the Union will be able to respond to the three great challenges of the twenty-first century: to intervene in globalisation in order to make it more democratic, to contribute to the construction of a fair and democratic international order and, of course, to respond to people’s demands."
"Through this Constitution we are restoring the impetus of the Maastricht Treaty, we are overcoming the failure of the Treaty of Nice and we are bringing enlargement and further Europeanisation together, in real time."
"Naturally, through this Constitution, the Union will have more legitimacy, more values, more rights, more democracy and more efficiency in terms of the Common Foreign and Security Policy; the European Security and Defence Policy; the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice; and also social Europe."
"I would like to stress the support of the European Confederation of Trade Unions for the European Constitution, which I believe to be truly essential and fundamental."
"This Constitution will have to be improved and, of course, applied and developed ambitiously when the time comes."
"No Constitution is perfect, but no Constitution can be improved unless it enters into force."
"We must therefore achieve its ratification on time and correctly."
"And we will do all of this with sufficient majorities to continue moving forward."
"This is a citizen’s Constitution which must be perceived as such."
"In Spain, on 20 February, we have a date with a referendum, with two good friends: a Constitution and Europe."
"We will be there."
"Mr President, we face many myths and red herrings as we try to promote the debate on the EU Constitution."
"Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo have done an excellent job in their clear and straightforward explanation and advocacy of its merits."
"Mr Corbett, I shall probably borrow your wording for a pamphlet in my constituency, but this is in a common good cause."
"One of the red herrings put around is whether to call the document a 'Constitutional Treaty' or a 'constitution', but, as the authors say, this is a sterile debate."
"It is a treaty in form, but a constitution in substance."
"Why are so many people, at least in my own country, Britain, so frightened of the word constitution?"
"Every club, every society has one."
"In fact the UK itself has one, even though it has never been written down all in one place – unfortunately!"
"The greatest benefits of the new Constitution are that, on the one hand, it constrains the EU, but on the other, it liberates it."
"The powers of the European Union will be constrained by strengthened rules on limits to competence, on parliamentary scrutiny, on democratic accountability and the definition of citizens' rights vis-à-vis the administration."
"But the Union will also be freed up to act more effectively on the domestic and external challenges we face."
"Domestically, this is most striking in the case of justice and home affairs."
"We will be able to act more decisively to manage our borders and immigration and to tackle serious crime, as our citizens want us to do."
"We will also be able to act more effectively abroad."
"What an impact it would have made on our public opinion, as well as on the disaster effort, if it had been, for example, a French aircraft carrier with German helicopters and British marines assisting in Aceh in Indonesia, and not just American ones."
"Some claim to see in the Charter of Fundamental Rights – which will become legally binding – a threat."
"I see it as an opportunity."
"The anti-Europeans have to understand that it will sometimes act in the sense of constraining the EU institutions and giving redress against abuse of powers by them."
"There is therefore no reason for people to fear and every reason to welcome the Constitution – and indeed this report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the draft European Constitution makes the European citizen a major player in the construction of a united Europe. The draft Constitution will be subject to the approval of our countries."
"Hungary and Lithuania have already said yes to it, and that is something about which we are delighted."
"In the form of a single document that is more easily readable than the current treaties, the Constitution reaffirms the double legitimacy of a Union of states and of citizens."
"The Council of Ministers will reach its decisions on a qualified majority basis in a greater number of areas."
"The Presidency of the European Council will be stabilised with a two-and-a-half-year term of office."
"The Commission will see the number of its members reduced and its coordination strengthened."
"Externally, the appointment of a European Foreign Minister will finally enable Europe to speak with a single voice outside our common borders."
"The drama of the tidal wave in South-East Asia illustrates once again the importance of such visibility and of the increased coordination of European action in the world."
"The President-in-Office of the Council, together with the Commissioner, have detailed the democratic progress represented by the draft European Constitution."
"The Constitution will also enable Europeans overseas to assert their particular assets and to contribute to the emergence of an active new European frontier, a showcase for progress in solidarity and diversity."
"Europeans have everything to gain from approving the ratification of the European Constitution."
"They will become its major proponents and enable the European Union to function better and with more clarity and transparency, while at the same time establishing a balanced and stable distribution of powers at the different levels of decision-making: European, national and regional."
"Mr President, following the example of our group, the Belgian Socialist delegation will vote in favour of this report, which gives its support to a document that constitutes an important stage on the road to European integration."
"Parliament’s decision will be crucial, democratically and politically, to the debates that will be conducted within the framework of the processes of ratification."
"Our own decision will be one in favour, even though our ‘yes’ vote will be designed to ring up the curtain, not to ring it down."
"In other words, it will be a combative ‘yes’, which should signal a beginning and not an end."
"It will be a decision in the affirmative because, as many of us have pointed out, this Treaty presents significant advances."
"How, indeed, can there not be delight about the fact that the Constitutional Treaty grants our Parliament new and increased powers, thereby imposing a democratic debate within the only European institution endowed with the legitimacy of universal suffrage?"
"How, too, can there not be agreement to integrating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the body of the Constitutional Treaty?"
"Our decision will be ‘yes’, but a ‘yes’ designed to start the ball rolling and with a price attached."
"When it comes to decisions taken by the Council of Ministers, it will not have escaped the attentive reader that, although the double majority rule has been extended, the unanimity rule has been maintained for a number of crucial decisions, including those relating to the social sphere and to taxation."
"In the same way, a number of us are alarmed that a Constitution should include, embedded within its wording, a part that is programmatic in nature and with which we cannot all agree."
"The document is not perfect."
"It will be difficult to progress matters in certain social or fiscal areas, but no more difficult than at present."
"What is important is to become aware of the fact that this Constitution is only a stage in European integration."
"It is meaningful only if it heralds an ambitious future project in which all European citizens, beginning with the least affluent, can glimpse, and hope for, an improvement in their conditions of life."
"More than in terms of the Constitution, the EU will be judged in terms of the subsequent actions that it will, or will not, promote and in terms of the strength and political will with which it responds, or does not respond, to Europeans’ hopes of bringing about, or not bringing about, the social Europe, or the Europe of the people."
"For us, that must remain the priority."
"Mr President, this is a day of celebration for Europe and for the European Parliament."
"It has taken over 20 years to construct this Constitution but we are getting close."
"I will vote for this report and for the Constitution for three simple reasons."
"Firstly, this Constitution was prepared in an open and democratic way."
"I have been a civil servant for ten years and I have been involved in negotiating three intergovernmental conferences, including the Amsterdam Treaty, the Nice Treaty and this one."
"I can guarantee that had this been an intergovernmental conference from beginning to end, we would never have had this Constitution."
"But because we had a Convention, we most certainly got one."
"Secondly, this Constitution is a good thing."
"There are 448 reasons for it, all of which are in the Treaty as articles."
"There are three key issues: firstly, it makes the European Union more democratic; secondly, it makes it more effective and, thirdly, it makes it more understandable."
"Thirdly, I will vote for this report because it is very good."
"I urge anyone who has not read it from beginning to end to have a look at it, because it simplifies and clarifies the Treaty in a magnificent way."
"I wish to congratulate Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo, who are both at present speaking on their mobile phones – I hope they are Nokias! – on their excellent report."
"If I were to bring up just one thing from the Treaty, it would be on external relations."
"Just reflecting on what happened in Asia, we had had a president, a foreign minister, a common security policy, a defence system, a better crisis management system, then together we would have got much further."
"Finally, I would urge each and every Member to go home and defend this Treaty."
"That is most certainly what I will do."
"Mr President, Commissioner Wallström, honoured guests in the gallery, ladies and gentlemen."
"Today’s debate is in my view the most important debate not only of this session but in the history of the Union as a whole."
"The Constitutional Treaty is a historic milestone and a particularly emancipating moment for the European Community."
"The very fact that, in this plenary session, there are representatives of twenty-five nation-states holding discussions in their own languages is clear proof of an ability to coexist in equality and to respect common values."
"On 1 May of last year, you welcomed us, or the great majority of us, here together, and we, or the great majority of us, felt sincerely honoured."
"Today, we are all deciding together on the adoption of a common primary unified legal framework respecting just those values which have allowed us to enlarge your assembly."
"I respect the fact that you waited for us and I personally feel honoured that I am able to cast my vote, because I perceive the Constitutional Treaty as an ethical and moral framework for Europeans, reinforcing our common historical identity, but I also respect the position of individual nation-states and the patriotism of their citizens."
"What more important document could we give our citizens?"
"Indeed, through the Constitution we are also strengthening their influence on political decision-making and making it possible for them to exert closer control."
"I have listened carefully to the reservations of the opponents and I should like to say most sincerely that the Constitution is a compromise, but the adoption of compromises is a great feature of all sensible, responsible and tolerant people."
"The European Constitutional Treaty opens up new horizons for us and also significantly emancipates the European Union within the framework of international politics."
"I believe that, by voting for the Constitutional Treaty, we are sending a clear and positive signal not only to the citizens of the nation-states within Europe, but also to the whole world, a signal of our resolve to live together in peace and solidarity."
"– In this Parliament I represent citizens of a state, which has already ratified the European Union Constitution."
"On 11 November last year, barely two weeks after its signing in Rome, Lithuania ratified this document, the first European Union Member State to do so."
"It is true, the decision was made not in a citizens' referendum, but in one of the last sittings of Parliament before the end of its term."
"It is also true that the European Union Constitution was ratified in Lithuania without comprehensive discussions on the provisions of this document, which ought to be known by, or at least familiar to Lithuania's citizens, above all so that they are able to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the European Union Constitution."
"Why do I believe that it is necessary to vote for the ratification of this Constitution in the European Parliament?"
"Firstly. Yes, until 2009 we can live according to the Treaty of Nice, but it has been clear for a while that the enlarged European Union cannot work effectively without necessary institutional changes, without a new and effective division of function responsibilities amongst the institutions of the European Union, as well as amongst the European Union and Member States, amongst the European Parliament and national parliaments."
"The European Union cannot work well without an effective mechanism for the enactment of resolutions, without more active participation by citizens, and without clear and transparent accountability to citizens."
"This is as obvious as what is written in the motto of the report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Corbett – a grown man cannot wear children's clothes which he grew out of long ago."
"Secondly. The European Union is striving to become one of the most competitive regions with the most dynamic development in the world."
"I believe that while striving for this goal it is important not only to properly set out the priorities of European Union expansion and to ensure that these receive the necessary funding, but also to see that there is order in the European Union above all from the standpoint of its institutions."
"I am about to finish, Mr President."
"I would also like a provision about the Christian roots of the European Union to be included in the preamble of the European Union Constitution."
"Despite the fact that there is no such provision, I will vote for the ratification of this document which is imperfect, but sufficiently good."
"Thank you."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Constitutional Treaty is another important step in the development of European integration."
"It creates the prerequisites for the European Union, following enlargement, to be able to act as a decisive factor in European development, and, of course, for it also to be able effectively to influence developments in the world."
"I see the benefit of the European Constitutional Treaty as being, among other things, that it brings the EU closer to its citizens, extends the rights of EU citizens, enshrines the Charter of Fundamental Rights in primary law, simplifies the legal system and replaces the main European Treaties currently in force with a single text."
"The Constitution also reinforces the democratic nature of the Union and strengthens the role of the European Parliament and that of parliaments in the Member States."
"It creates the conditions for effective decision-making by the European Union, and also clarifies the powers of the European Union with respect to the Member States."
"In addition, it strengthens the EU’s ability to act as a cohesive and unified power in the international community, which is very important in the light of the events in South-East Asia."
"For all these and many other reasons, which are too numerous to mention here, social democracies, including the Czech social democracy which I represent here, unequivocally support the draft Constitutional Treaty."
"As regards my home country, the Czech Republic, the situation with respect to ratification of the European Constitution is not going to be simple."
"The European Constitution is opposed not only by the communists, but also by the conservative right, represented here in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I should therefore like to invite Mr Poettering and the other leaders of the Group of the European People’s Party, for example Mr Karas, whom I can see in the Chamber, to come to the Czech Republic and urge the pro-European Czech forces to ratify the European Constitution."
"The Civic Democratic Party, which you have accepted into your ranks, will not do this work for you."
"I thank you."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the real world in which we live is far from being a fair world and changes are therefore required to traditional political models."
"What is new and fascinating in the European Constitution is the connection between the recognition of a common system of values, democratic values and human rights, and the recognition of a common system of authority."
"This notable connection between a project of justice and a method of political sharing is exactly how the great philosopher Immanuel Kant envisaged it."
"The European Constitution is therefore an act of both political transformation and moral transformation."
"This is because, rather than merely recognising common fundamental values, it was decided to share those values in legislative acts; because the Constitution prioritises norms over permanent negotiation; because it affirms the sovereignty of acts and the inalienable dignity of man as a reason for, and an objective of, European policies; because it articulates a programme of global justice that transcends national interests and complements the effectiveness of Member States’ internal constitutions; because it brings together modern European political identity in a system of universal values incorporating all of the other identities; because it represents the sense of belonging to a cosmopolitan and anthropocentric world; because it is the starting point for a league of nations in a more rational and more balanced world; because it is the constitutional homeland with which all homelands identify in this Europe, with a view to creating a new Europe."
"I am sending a letter today to the President of Parliament and to you, Commissioner for institutional relations, suggesting that we set up a TV station constantly broadcasting the work of Parliament and the Council’s future public works to all EU countries."
"Lastly, I wish to pay tribute to the rapporteurs, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Corbett."
"Mr President, the decisions made by the Heads of State or Government at the Laeken Summit have proved to be of still greater significance than anyone had foreseen at that time."
"The whole of today’s debate has shown this quite clearly."
"What was it that drove the Heads of State or Government at the Laeken Summit?"
"It was, in reality, two things."
"Firstly, they wanted an EU that functioned more efficiently and, secondly, they wanted an EU that could ensure that we too could operate once enlargement had become a reality."
"Whenever we have altered the methods of European cooperation, this has normally happened as a sealed-off process behind closed doors, following which the population of Europe has woken up one morning to find that leading politicians have once more changed the conditions of cooperation."
"That was not, however, the way in which matters proceeded this time."
"A Convention was set up, in which I myself had the pleasure of participating."
"I think the Convention did some exciting work, but it also set a new objective for how we are to effect changes in Europe in the future. In future, changes are to be made as part of an open process."
"We are now, therefore, presented with a new draft Constitutional Treaty which we need to discuss with the people. That being said, the following are crucial points I should like to emphasise."
"Firstly, an integral feature of the new Constitutional Treaty is that it provides us with values concerning not merely democracy and human rights, but also the environment and social responsibility."
"Secondly, the new Constitutional Treaty provides us with an assurance that the principles of openness and democracy, which a modern-day form of cooperation can be expected to respect, are also applied in European cooperation."
"As a Member of the Council of Ministers, I have often wondered at the fact that the population of Europe was not to know how I voted as a minister when we reached the point of taking decisions."
"Now, we are acquiring a modern, and open, Constitutional Treaty."
"Finally, we are ensuring that, via the European Parliament, the elected representatives of the people are given greater influence."
"All in all, it is a good product that we have debated today and that we are to recommend to the population of Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the challenge that Europe must face over the coming months is vital for European integration."
"Citizens and members of parliaments all across the continent are being called on to adopt a single fundamental Charter which sanctions and strengthens the values upon which this Union is founded: peace, prosperity, democracy, justice, freedom and solidarity."
"The new Constitutional Treaty is certainly not everything we had hoped it would be, but its very existence constitutes an unprecedented political and historical event, which was inconceivable until a few years ago."
"The text we are to adopt strengthens the democratic legitimacy of the European Institutions and brings them closer to the 450 million men and women who belong to the Union."
"Indeed, the Constitution confers greater powers on national parliaments and on the European Parliament, in both legislative and political terms: our citizens will also have a greater say in the democratic process thanks to the closer bond between Community institutions and local communities, the social partners and associations."
"Our duty, as elected representatives, is to make this participation real, productive and tangible."
"Europe will thereby consolidate its role as a global player."
"This is the main challenge: it is our duty and responsibility to build a Union which can speak with one voice on international issues."
"Lastly, cultural identity: despite our regret that there is no reference to the Christian roots upon which our Union is undeniably founded, we, as representatives of the Union of Christian Democrats, strenuously support ratification of this text."
"The Italian Parliament will ratify the Treaty in the coming weeks; it will be a positive vote, a vote of encouragement for other countries where the value of Europe is not felt as deeply as it is in Italy."
"Our country, our government, our party – preserving the legacy of those men who left their mark on and founded Europe – will contribute towards a positive outcome of the ratification process, in order to give full effect to the ideals in which we Christian Democrats have always believed."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs on this report, which adds clarity and weight to the debate."
"I was one of the 200 parliamentarians who participated in the Convention and produced the Convention text, which the IGC subsequently took on board to a very large degree."
"I doubt whether any Member State constitution has ever been prepared in such an open and democratic way."
"I doubt that there is a constitution in any of the Member States which achieved the kind of consensus that the Convention achieved."
"Of the 200 parliamentarians participating in that Convention, only eight signed an alternative text, basically arguing for the disintegration of Europe."
"We have heard that case being put here this morning, with Mr Allister of Northern Ireland arguing for a reversion to 19th century absolute sovereignty."
"If Sinn Féin had participated in the debate this morning they would – although they are the direct political opposites in Northern Ireland – have been making exactly the same case."
"Perhaps it is a kind of progress that they agree on 19th century absolute sovereignty, although it is unfortunate that they continue to fall out over the outcome of the Battle of the Boyne in 1690!"
"The fact is that this is a world in which the response to natural disasters and to man-made problems clearly requires transnational governance."
"Uniquely in the world, Europe is developing a democratic form of transnational governance."
"This Constitution will give us more democracy, more rights and more potential for a prosperous society in Europe, and indeed for solidarity with the rest of the world."
"To conclude, those outcomes will not happen of their own accord."
"We have to work for them, using this Constitution as the basis for our work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2004 was a particularly noteworthy year in the history of European integration, and it had both high and low points."
"There can be no doubt that the high points included the enlargement of the Community from 15 to 25 Member States, and the indications given in December 2004 that further enlargements would follow."
"Another high point was the signing of the Constitution on 29 October in Rome. It is generally acknowledged, however, that the European elections were a low point, both in terms of their date and their outcome."
"Turnout for the European elections was lower than ever before, and further evidence for this can be seen in the fragmentation the results caused in this House. Proof of this fragmentation can be found not least in the many colourful flags I see around me, and by no means only in front of the building."
"In 2005, therefore, we must ensure that the public become involved again in the European project, and I do not believe that to be actually such a hard task."
"It is, however, an issue of communication."
"The product we have – the new European Constitution – is a very good one, and we must win people over to it."
"We do not need propaganda campaigns; instead, we need reliable information, in particular with regard to claims that the Constitution will benefit people."
"We should not promise people the moon, but tell them what benefits the Constitution will and can bring."
"Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Corbett have summarised this in four key points."
"The Constitution will bring greater clarity and greater effectiveness to the European Union, as well as more democracy and accountability and more rights for citizens by means of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Providing information is not the same thing as refraining from criticism, but the first task for such criticism must be to make it clear that our product is, in principle, a good one."
"Finally, it has repeatedly been claimed that the public is not interested in a Constitution."
"When we held a publicity event at the University of Graz, however, the Constitution met with more interest than toadstools or dream interpretation."
"This should be an incentive for us to promote the Constitution to the public."
"Mr President, I would like to declare that the Italian socialist delegation will be voting for the Corbett-Méndez de Vigo draft report, and I would extend my congratulations to the rapporteurs on the quality of the report, in particular the explanatory statement."
"Today the European Parliament has certainly reached an historic milestone, which brings to mind 14 February 1984 when Altiero Spinelli’s draft Treaty, of which the Constitution is in some ways the ideal continuation, was adopted."
"It matters little if in strictly legal terms the text is a treaty, but what does matter is the substance: today we are all prepared to call it the Constitution, a term which until just a few years ago was often considered unmentionable."
"Those like Altiero Spinelli and the Federalist Movement, to which I am honoured to belong, who believed and still believe that it is vital to create a true federal state with few but essential competences that will ensure a role for the European Union in the world, would have wished for a bolder text."
"Nevertheless, this Constitution contains in essence certain fundamental passages which constitute a stable, lasting framework, on the basis of which we must now move forward so that the Union can effectively do what its citizens expect."
"I will only quote a few examples which I consider to be a priority and which in certain cases arise from the link with my region, a cross-border region."
"Firstly, I would like to mention the establishment of the position of Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is the European Union’s voice on the international stage and who guides its foreign policy."
"The procedures which make him, as a member of the Commission, accountable to Parliament are a prerequisite for the existence of a foreign policy."
"Following the many – too many – conflicts which have characterised recent years, the citizens of Europe are asking us and themselves what Europe is doing."
"Secondly, the EU must be a model of development, a tangible testament to the fact that it is possible to combine development and solidarity."
"Lastly, I would like to point out that the principle of subsidiarity is now a constitutional principle and this strengthens and guarantees it."
"That is another reason why I believe we must vote for this report."
"I support this constitution, however, in my opinion, it is a good thing that in this Parliament we have Members that are against it."
"Let me say why this is so."
"Not because I agree with the arguments that they are putting forward, on the contrary I think that many of their arguments are based on mistaken, or even false premises."
"But because without anyone opposing it, we will end up having a monotonous debate where everyone would be in favour and where we would have a lack of objective analysis."
"There is no better way by which one can win an argument about Europe as when one has the courage to compare the arguments in favour with those against."
"We have to take seriously the arguments of whoever is against and treat them with respect."
"But we should not be afraid or run away from the arguments of whoever is against, let alone ignore them."
"We should not expect to win the argument if we do not expose ourselves to an open debate, otherwise we will end up saying that we have won the game when in fact only one team would have come to play."
"After all, when one compares the arguments in favour of this constitution with the arguments against, one will not take long to conclude that the constitution has much more that is good in it than bad and it merits the support of the European citizens."
"There is no doubt that if we explain to the people what the constitution means, the people will be more in favour than against it, because they understand how logical is the unification of Europe, that it makes sense and that it is in their interest."
"Therefore it is of utmost importance that whoever is in this room, whoever in this Parliament is in favour of this constitution, has to commit himself or herself directly with the people to see that they understand it and support it."
"This support will be based on the comparison of the arguments and therefore it will be on a more open, more balanced and a more democratic debate."
"Mr President, a Constitution for Europe is necessary: it is a democratic requirement."
"Profoundly attached to the unity of the party, the French Socialists will conduct the national debate without in any way giving up our progressive values and ideas."
"I consider that approval of the report is the condition for establishing Parliament’s authority in respect of the Constitutional Treaty, but I am sorry that amendments tabled by a number of us have been rejected."
"Nonetheless, we shall be part of this long and treacherous process that is the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty."
"We state that this Constitutional Treaty is stable but capable of being modified."
"That is the case with all constitutions, and with this Treaty no less than with others."
"We also regret the fact that a large majority of the opinions issued by other parliamentary committees that have identified a host of shortcomings in the Constitutional Treaty have been left out of this report."
"We are also keen to state clearly that a special unit, established under the Dutch Presidency, will continue with its work under the future Presidencies and will carefully scrutinise all the possible consequences of the Constitution’s being rejected."
"I want Parliament, legitimised in its role following this vote, to get to grips with the difficulties of implementing the Constitutional Treaty and to use its parliamentary right of initiative."
"That is what we are called upon to do, and it is what Amendment No 17 is all about."
"Yes, it is incumbent upon ourselves as MEPs and elected representatives of the European people to take a proactive role in implementing the Constitutional Treaty, which governs the corporate life of more than 450 million Europeans."
"The difficulties revealed by the opinions of the other committees will resurface sooner or later."
"We must therefore be prepared to correct the imperfections bequeathed by the Intergovernmental Conference when it altered the delicate balance achieved wisely and equitably by the Convention."
"Let us prepare ourselves, ladies and gentlemen, for a new round."
"It is, indeed, going to be necessary to defend our popular legitimacy in respect of the Constitutional Treaty, whose shortcomings we have an absolute duty to correct when the time is right."
"A number of my colleagues in the French delegation will abstain from voting on this report."
"Mr President, this Constitutional Treaty is worth upholding."
"As a Christian Democrat, I am pleased that the subsidiarity principle has just been further worked out, deepened and anchored."
"The European Union has now also recognised and enshrined the task of the regional dimension, namely local and regional authorities."
"There is a need for a better balance to be struck between what happens at the centre and away from it, in Brussels, in the nation states and in regions and municipalities."
"As a governor at regional level, I noticed for years that EU information remained at Council level for too long and that regions and towns were involved in the debate and decision-making too late."
"As a representative of the European organisations, I was also able to attend hearings of the Convention, particularly those about subsidiarity."
"The Treaty text reinforces the position of regions and towns, which are close to the citizens and where important tasks are carried out in many areas."
"In that way, the democratic loophole, which Mr Prodi mentioned in his report on good governance, is closed once more."
"It is an important step that the European Parliament supports this and remains critical about the way in which this Treaty will be fleshed out at local or regional level in the next few years."
"I would also suggest that we in this House from time to time ask the Council and the Committee of the Regions whether, among other things, our national states have now learned to communicate openly about European policy, and whether, in the subsidiarity test, national parliaments take the opinions of regions and towns into consideration."
"I know that the Committee of the Regions is developing a similar test."
"In short, this Treaty is well worth upholding."
"Consequently, we will labour for this cause at national level, certainly if referendums are on the agenda."
"– Mr President, the major risks from this Constitution are three in number."
"The first is, are we to become a federation, a federation both on foreign affairs and in defence and elsewhere, or are we to be a Europe of a loose federation of dissimilar partners, especially after enlargement?"
"The second is, are we to be a Europe of social awareness or are we to be a Europe of the open, uncontrolled market?"
"The third is, are we to be a Europe without a democratic deficit, with power in the hands of the citizens, or are we to be a Europe in which European elections are held and we have abstentions of 70, 60 or 50%?"
"In my opinion, this Constitution answers all these questions most positively, in all events much more positively than they are addressed under current treaties."
"Anyone against this Constitution, allegedly for reasons of social sensitivity, needs to answer the question of whether the existing treaties help the poor and the weak in Europe more than this Constitution helps them."
"Allow me an element of minor national pride as a Greek and as a socialist: it was during the Greek Presidency, in June 2003, that the initial negotiations on this Constitution were concluded, and I am proud of that."
"Of course, it now remains to be applied and this is where the MEPs and the governments have a huge responsibility."
"We need to ensure that the seeds of social awareness sown in the Constitution do not remain pretty words and are put into practice."
"The famous social mainstreaming clause setting out the Union's obligation to ensure that its every policy promotes the objectives of high employment, environmental protection, public health, education and equality between men and women can only be applied under good laws."
"Similarly, I must tell you that, for any MEPs striving for a socially fairer Europe, this is a particularly painstaking and particularly welcome challenge."
"For many people, the institutions in Brussels seem remote."
"They see them as centres of power where decisions are made over which they have no influence."
"The Constitutional Treaty is not a miracle cure for all the problems of the European Union, but it is an opportunity to reduce democratic shortcomings and to speed up Europe's development."
"Why?"
"Because it replaces numerous agreements and amendments, thereby reducing the lack of transparency in key European Union documents; because in a single document it brings together the key constitutional and legal foundations and policies of the European Union; because it is the basis for more effective functioning of European institutions; because it contributes to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy; because it removes the problems that would arise were the current agreements to continue to be used in the future."
"The Constitutional Treaty is a compromise that does not completely satisfy anyone, but it nonetheless most represents what we have been able to achieve in the convention."
"We need the Constitutional Treaty because without it we cannot expect any effective reforms or effective functioning in the enlarged Europe."
"Although the chapter on policies has frequently been criticised, as a shadow rapporteur I must express my satisfaction that in the area of social policy and employment very concrete commitments have been set out for the Commission and the governments of the Member States, including the establishment of a Committee for Social Protection and European Social Harmony."
"By accepting the report on the Constitutional Treaty, the European Parliament is sending a clear signal to the people of Europe that the time has come for a transparent and wholesale rearrangement of our constitutional and legal foundations, thereby ensuring that Europe becomes a continent of peace, prosperity, solidarity and security."
"Finally I should mention that the Slovenian parliament will ratify the Constitutional Treaty this month."
"I am convinced that it will do so by a large majority."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I reject totalitarian regimes."
"My grandmother’s family died in the Nazi gas chambers."
"My father was incarcerated by the communist regime."
"We have paid in blood for our commitment to the freedom of conscience, which was embodied for us by Europe as a hope for democracy, freedom of thought, religious freedom and freedom of conscience."
"I believe that none of you would consider me to be anti-European if I were to pose a few questions."
"Why is the European Parliament pronouncing on the Constitutional Treaty before the citizens of the individual states?"
"Do we need Europe to be governed by a constitution?"
"The sovereignty of Member States should not be threatened."
"If, however, the Constitution strengthens the role of Parliament, but does not define the competences of the European Court of Justice, will the balance between institutions thus be upset?"
"Decisions of the Court will be directly imposed on Union bodies and Member States without any right of appeal."
"The European Court of Justice will be free from any criticism."
"Can we pretend that this will not happen?"
"The draft Constitution contains no guarantees that the European Court of Justice will not appropriate some of the exclusive competences of the sovereign states, even contrary to national constitutions."
"Even if the majority in this Parliament changes after the elections and the composition of the Council changes, a double unanimity will be required in order to change policies."
"And I just wonder: will such a Union be capable of development if its direction is set by this Constitution?"
"Our civilisation has developed from Christian roots."
"If the Constitution fails to acknowledge this historical fact, unrest will be introduced into the life of society."
"A new ideology will rise up under a mask of tolerance."
"Are we to build the European home on a distortion of history?"
"Is it true that, without this Constitution, the concept of a united Europe will die?"
"I think not."
"My voters have put their faith in me and I wish to proceed in Europe so that everyone, including the smallest, weakest and poorest, are accepted into it and can find their places in it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in a democratic Europe, I ask that we respect the freedom of conscience when voting."
"Mr President, despite all the differences of opinion which the debate surrounding this issue has produced, we are once again making European history."
"As such, this Treaty is an important step in the right direction."
"I am certain that the founders of the movement for European integration would be proud and pleased if they were now witnessing just how many fundamental issues have resulted in such compromises that Parliament is now debating and voting on them."
"It is unfortunate that in some countries the debate on the Treaty has been taken out of context and used to fuel an internal and party political row."
"The worst features of Europeanisation, intolerance and jingoism, are all too often visible and audible at such times, although attempts are made to conceal them in the form of lies disguised as loftier aspirations."
"When this Treaty has come into force, there is no chance that it will lead to the creation of a European superstate: on the contrary, its spirit and text will effectively block any self-seeking aspirations on the part of states, groups of states or extremist movements."
"The Treaty will still allow the economy to play the role best suited to it in cooperation within the continent."
"The dynamics of mutual economic activity and the single monetary policy are also preconditions of political cooperation."
"Without democracy there is no social dimension, and there is no democracy without a market economy."
"I am also proud that in my own country, Finland, we have been able to agree that Parliament can decide on the ratification of the Treaty at national level."
"While approving the report submitted, I would like to reiterate once more that Lithuania, on the decision of its Parliament, was the first to ratify this Constitution."
"After the recent elections, Lithuania's social democrats, who were and remain in power, took an active part in the task of preparing the Constitutional Treaty."
"When countries were invited to set down in legal terms the things which after deliberation all generally agreed on, we did this without delay."
"We had good grounds for this."
"In a referendum held a year and a half ago, Lithuanians gave the clearest ‘Yes’ to European Union membership of all the new Members."
"Support in Lithuania for European Union membership continues to grow and has reached 82%."
"People see that the hopes associated with the European Union are being fulfilled, and so they want to strengthen it."
"The failure of a referendum on the Constitution in any country of the European Union would, I believe, be a painful blow to the hopes of the majority of Europeans, among them Lithuanians."
"Today the European Union ship already contains 25 states, but is sailing with far too weak an engine for such a cargo – the Treaty of Nice."
"If it is not replaced with a much more powerful one – the engine of the Constitutional Treaty – our common ship will reduce speed and may begin to drift."
"With the old Nice engine we will never achieve the goals defined in the Lisbon strategy, and we will be unable to implement new neighbour policies effectively."
"This is particularly relevant to the new European Union countries."
"A strong democratic European Union moving forward – this is essential, not just in the interest of our country."
"The Constitutional Treaty – no matter how complicated a compromise it might be – contributes to this."
"Lithuania ratified it with resolve, so that the energy and optimism of the new countries might be passed on to the European Union's old-timers."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that this substantial report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo has been tabled. As a former substitute member of the Convention, I must admit that I might recommend to some people that they read this report rather than the Constitution itself, as it is supremely readable and extremely convincing on the issue."
"Today I should like to address my comments to those Members of this House who have taken a critical approach to the Constitution."
"They have warned against the creation of a European superstate and denounced shortcomings, and they have come out in opposition to mistakes made in the past."
"I believe we should make it very clear to them that this European Constitution is in fact a way of addressing these shortcomings."
"The European Constitution remedies many of the problems that all of us have experienced with Europe as it exists today."
"It lays down a system of competences and grants national parliaments the right of participation, thus making Europe less centralist and less bureaucratic."
"The Constitution gives the European Parliament a full say, and Europe will therefore become more democratic than it has been to date."
"It also strengthens citizens’ rights, above all by means of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as citizens will be able to invoke the Constitution directly when appealing against European decisions."
"Finally, the Constitution provides this Europe of ours with a basis of values, and is thus a way of countering the technocratic approach to political problems."
"The Eurosceptics should therefore really be in favour of this Constitution, as it is the only way of changing the things we all wish to change."
"Today is the anniversary of the birth of Alexander Hamilton, one of the fathers of the American Constitution, whose picture can today be found on ten-dollar notes."
"As I look at the fathers and mothers of the European Constitution in this House, I hope that they will also be remembered as gratefully in 200 years’ time."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteurs on a very thorough report."
"This document summarises exceptionally well the most essential points of the European Constitution."
"At the same time, I would like to see a slightly different emphasis regarding the publicising of the Constitution."
"In its conclusions, today’s report concentrates on printed materials about the Constitution."
"However, public surveys and common logic tell us that European citizens primarily look for and receive information via television, including information about the EU."
"Today’s report stresses the need to clearly distinguish every point in the Constitutional Treaty that differs from existing treaties."
"This, however, is more a topic for academic research rather than information to be relayed to every European citizen."
"The 300-page Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is voluminous enough as it is, and consequently also more complex than the constitutions of the Member States."
"There is no common European public opinion yet, but in my home country Estonia, for example, support for the EU has grown with every month since Estonia’s accession."
"At the same time support is falling in many Member States."
"Nevertheless, the same rule applies both in journalism and in public information throughout Europe: people must be given what they want."
"In old and new Member States, in cities and in the country, people are primarily interested in what effect the European Constitution will have on their everyday life."
"I believe that in presenting the Constitution, we should concentrate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"For instance, what does the right to good administration stipulated in the Charter mean for each citizen?"
"To what extent will such a requirement force bureaucrats or politicians to justify their decisions, or to be open?"
"Answers to questions such as these should be an integral part of public information about the Constitution."
"Also,in conclusion, I would say that there can be no talk of informing the citizens of Europe if television is not included."
"The Parliament’s Directorate-General for Information should take this into account in its efforts to publicise the Constitution."
"I wish them and all the European television networks success in translating the Constitution’s complex wording into a palatable format for the public."
"Thank you."
"– Mr President, tomorrow's vote is of historic importance."
"The significant progress being made with the European Constitution and the advantages which derive from its positive provisions have already been presented both in the full report by my honourable friends Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo and today in this Chamber."
"As, therefore, almost all the issues have been exhausted, I shall confine myself to one vital problem."
"A new marathon starts from tomorrow for ratification by the Member States."
"But what will happen if there is some problem with ratification by some Member State?"
"The Constitution does not contain a specific provision to deal with this eventuality."
"Nonetheless, the declarations relating to the provisions of the Constitution state that, if two years after signature of the Constitution, 4/5 of the Member States have ratified the Constitution in question and one or more Member States are facing difficulties in connection with ratification, the matter will be submitted to the European Council."
"Do you, however, think that this arrangement is satisfactory?"
"I believe that there should be a much clearer provision."
"Unfortunately, however, this arrangement also emerged from the series of compromises which were necessary in order for us to get where we are today."
"Therefore, it is not enough for us to talk and to support the ratification of the Constitution unreservedly."
"All the governments and all of us need to work to avoid such an unfortunate development if we want to enter a new era for our continent."
"– Mr President, by adopting the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Mèndez de Vigo, Parliament will be making its last major contribution towards the adoption of a constitutional Treaty for Europe."
"The existence of such a Treaty will enshrine the historic transition from a Community of peoples and countries progressively united by ever-closer economic ties to an actual political Community united by the desire for a common future."
"Fifty years of a policy of small, prudent steps has paved the way for a new reality based on shared values, civilised values that express a shared European identity based on peace, democracy, human rights and economic and social progress."
"Europe is not being built at variance with the secular reality of the nations on our continent."
"Europe is founded upon the free and informed desire to ensure that the past does not repeat itself and to provide its peoples with guarantees that they will remain masters of their own destiny in a future laden with challenges."
"The champions of sovereignty, who accuse Europe of eroding national sovereignty and who see in this Constitution their nightmare of a superstate coming true, are profoundly mistaken in their analysis."
"Economic, financial and technological globalisation, the current or potential emergence of new global, political and economic potentates, have forced Europe to seek responses at national level to defend, deepen and export the humanist project initiated in the last century by the post-war social state under the rule of law."
"In a world that is characterised by uncertainty, disorder and deregulation, it is increasingly necessary for Europe to speak out and to play an active role, both for us and for those others who look to us to set an example and to take action on matters of major international importance."
"The champions of sovereignty are not the only opponents of this Treaty. Others have loudly criticised it for not going far enough, for the fact that results have been meagre or for its lack of ambition."
"Such people refuse to acknowledge the significant progress that has been made, because they persist with the pointless exercise of comparing the constitutional Treaty before us to the idealised versions of their dreams instead of comparing it to the current Treaties and the Nice process, in particular."
"Mr President, while the European Parliament has no formal role in the ratification procedure, I am pleased that, as the elected representatives of 25 Member States of the European Union, we are having this debate today, at a point in time when the ratification procedure has just got under way at parliamentary level and is just about to get under way at referendum level."
"On the day when heads of state and government signed the Constitution in Rome, I happened to be in Bratislava, Slovakia, where I was privileged to participate in the opening of the House of Europe."
"That was the first opening of a House of Europe in one of the new Member States."
"It was followed by the opening in December of a House of Europe in Prague."
"Procedures for establishing Houses of Europe in all Member States are under way."
"The principal function of these Houses of Europe is to bring the European Union closer to its citizens."
"They offer citizens a point of information that is centrally and visibly located in their own Member State."
"The concept offers education on the European Union and, by providing accommodation for the political groups, it ensures that the views of this Parliament can be conveyed to the citizens."
"It is my belief that if the European Union is to work, we have to strengthen and deepen the relationships between this Parliament and the national parliaments."
"There is no other way in which we can achieve that cooperation in the longer term."
"It should not be an 'us and them' situation; it should be about everyone working together for the betterment of all people in the 25 Member States – or perhaps the 27 Member States, should that come about."
"That is the challenge for the future; that is the challenge that we, as democrats, have to take on board."
"It takes two sides to make a debate."
"Because people do not necessarily agree with every word that others say, this does not mean that they have no right to say it."
"I believe in the rights of everyone, I believe in democracy."
"I believe that those who disagree with me have a right to their views."
"The majority will ultimately win, but those who disagree can make this a better debate, and they should be encouraged to do so and should not be disenfranchised from their position."
"Mr President, as this report demonstrates very well, there are three basic aspects to the draft Constitution: firstly, the Union’s values and objectives, the unity and equality of its peoples, as well as the protection of the diversity of its cultures, identities and languages; secondly, the rights, interests and duties of the citizens; and, thirdly, the rules for the institutions and for European political life."
"The first two aspects – values and rights – define the European democracy we want, based on the diversity and freedom of the peoples, their progress and equality."
"The third aspect – this should be made clear: the rules of play – is the result of compromises between Left and Right, between federalists and intergovernmentalists; it should be made clear that it refers to those rules, not to the policies to be implemented."
"In this respect, the Constitution is not a final destination, but a departure point, with a view to overcoming Europe’s socio-economic lethargy, its lack of capacity for innovation, research and development and its insufficient weight on the international stage."
"We must move forward towards a European Government, moving beyond the currently predominant method of intergovernmental coordination with all its impotence, as demonstrated by the failure to implement the Lisbon strategy and the divisions over the invasion of Iraq."
"With this view towards future progress, we shall call for a vote in favour of the European Constitution."
"Mr President, a long-standing dream of this Parliament, and one shared by many of Europe’s citizens, is becoming reality."
"We have worked long and hard for this Constitution, but we can be proud of what has now been achieved, and I should like to take this opportunity today to thank Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Corbett."
"As shadow rapporteur for my group in the Committee on Agriculture, I can say that we are in favour of this draft Constitution, which undoubtedly represents a gain for the committee."
"When the common agricultural policy was established in 1958, this House was merely a consultative body, and it was only with the Treaty of Amsterdam that we were given the right of codecision in the fields of the environment, consumer protection and food safety."
"The democracy deficit, having persisted in spite of everything, will now be overcome by means of an extension of the codecision procedure to include all decisions of principle on agricultural policy."
"There are however also negative sides to the Constitution."
"In future the Council will be able to take autonomous decisions on the setting of quotas, prices and quantitative restrictions, as the draft Constitution takes no account of the new goals of the common agricultural policy following the EU agricultural reform."
"This is a step backwards from the current situation, and it will mean much work for us in the future."
"As a representative of the German Federal of Baden-Württemberg, too, I believe that a number of extremely important goals have been achieved; the national constitutions have been strengthened, regions and local authorities have been accorded greater significance, and the principle of subsidiarity has been adhered to."
"The draft Constitution lays the foundations for common economic activities, and we will gain a common basis of values shared by all of us, something I see as particularly important."
"We have before us a document which places an obligation on all those who bear responsibility for Europe."
"Mr President, I am very much in favour of the European Constitution, and would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their outstanding report."
"The Constitution, which above all strengthens the area of freedom, security and justice, marks a milestone on the road to a more secure and just Europe."
"We have taken a giant step towards a Europe of citizens with this Constitution, as by enshrining in it the Charter of Fundamental Rights, by EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and by simplified access to justice, citizens’ rights have been given an enormous boost."
"In addition, we now have increased opportunities to coordinate our efforts in the fight against such evils as crime, racism and xenophobia in Europe."
"I welcome the fact that the members of the CSU in this House will vote in favour of this report."
"Unfortunately, many members of the CSU in the German , which has yet to ratify the Treaty, appear to have no inkling of the significance and implications of the Constitution, as they have announced their intention to vote against it."
"This is yet another example of the double game which the CSU is so fond of playing, which involves being progressive here in Europe and flying the flag for the benefit of the outside world, but speaking out in opposition at home, just in case."
"This is, however, one of their traditions, for it was the CSU that, in 1949, voted against Germany’s Basic Law."
"Ladies and gentlemen: the trappings of the European Union have become too small, and no longer suit it in its new, expanded form."
"Therefore it is fitting that the new Constitution will replace agreements that are currently in force and will lead to more effective functioning of the European Union."
"It will also strengthen the role of the European Parliament and the national parliaments, and thereby the voice of the citizens of the European Union."
"As a member of the Committee on Culture and Education, I particularly support the articles of the Constitution that relate to those areas."
"I believe that it is important that the preamble emphasises the significance of Europe's cultural tradition, Europe's humanistic legacy and the values that define the essence of Europe and its citizens."
"One of our greatest objectives is respect for our rich cultural and linguistic diversity, and concern for the protection and development of the European cultural legacy."
"The Constitution guarantees freedom for art and science, the right to education and professional training, equal rights for men and women, and the right of the handicapped to be full members of society."
"Article 92 guarantees the safety of young people at work, and Article 93 states that the family should enjoy legal, economic and social security."
"The articles as written form a good basis for their implementation, but in spite of this the European Union must do much more than simply accept and ratify the Constitution."
"Above all, it must create the conditions under which the family is recognised as something precious and young married couples have the opportunity to create and nurture a family."
"If we use immigration as the principal means of solving demographic problems, this will jeopardise our cultural legacy, the languages of Europe, our culture, our faith, the European Union and European civilisation in general – in short, all the values that we wish to preserve and strengthen through the Constitution."
"Because we in the 25 Member States have opted for this community, it is also fitting that we do everything we can to ensure that it functions as well and effectively as possible."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work and express my full support for the report we are debating today."
"Tomorrow this House will express its support for the text which concludes a process of creating a constitution which has been ongoing for several decades."
"However, our work cannot stop here."
"We still have to face the most difficult challenge: its approval and ratification by the European citizens."
"Without their support, the Constitution makes no sense."
"As the honourable Members are well aware, we Spanish have a particular responsibility within this process, since the first referendum amongst European citizens will be held in my country on 20 February."
"We all, therefore, have the responsibility of explaining the constitutional text to the European citizens, which in my case includes those Spaniards living outside of Spain and even outside of the European Union."
"I am, therefore, pleased that in my country the majority of political parties, unions and other representatives of civil society agree with us and are fully involved in this task of creating awareness of the content and scope of the Constitution, which is the only way to ensure broad participation and a positive response to this historic task."
"Mr President, the road to this Constitutional Treaty was a long and rocky one, and a number of good proposals fell by the wayside."
"Now, though, we need this Constitution, and ratification by the Member States must progress quickly."
"The founding fathers, including Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer, laid the foundations for the European house."
"Their successors built the walls, bought the shelves and filled these shelves with files."
"The contents of this house are now piling up to the roof, and we face the immense task of clearing out this house and making it fit for the future."
"This is what the European Constitution will help us to do, and it represents a compromise which will mean greater openness and tangible improvements for the European public."
"Existing Community legislation will be set out in a Treaty, which will make Europe easier to understand."
"The common trade policy will play an exemplary role in future in representing our internal market to the outside world, and the enlarged Union’s capacity to act will be strengthened by a smaller Commission and by a new EU Foreign Minister."
"Citizens will gain more rights, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as drafted by Roman Herzog, will be enshrined in the Constitution."
"The European Parliament’s role will be strengthened; it will elect the President of the Commission."
"It is to be hoped that in future leading politicians from European parties will stand for this post."
"The Constitutional Convention allowed us too to bring our influence to bear on the Constitution, and Europe will not become a centralist monster state, but will instead be constructed according to the principle of subsidiarity."
"The characteristic approach and principles of the largest group in this House, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, can also be seen in the Constitution, although unfortunately we did not succeed in pushing through all of our amendments, for some of which we fought bitterly."
"To give but two examples, I regret deeply that no reference to God has been included, and that the formulas for qualified majority voting in the Council are so complicated."
"I would however hope for all our sakes that this Convention is a foundation upon which we can continue to build Europe, and that this Europe will be one of peace, freedom and prosperity."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to express my gratitude towards the honourable Members Mr de Vigo and Mr Corbett for an excellently prepared document, quite simply it is clear and highlights the most significant issues."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the drafting of the Constitution is in line with the situation which has developed historically in modern-day Europe and which currently exists in the world."
"Irrespective of our will, globalisation processes are occurring throughout the world, but initially in goods and capital movements, that is to say, in the realm of material values."
"The exchange of spiritual and moral values is taking place far more slowly."
"I believe that one of the reasons for conflicts in many places throughout the world today is largely due to the great disproportion and imbalance between the global exchange of material and spiritual values."
"The new Constitutional Treaty is a step towards reducing this disproportion."
"This Treaty will not only help us understand more clearly who we are and where we are going, but will also provide greater clarity to our partners throughout the world as to our aims and the values which guide our actions."
"Therefore, I repeat that this Constitution is well timed and necessary, despite certain shortcomings."
"One such shortcoming, which Mr Poettering and other honourable Members have already referred to, is that it contains no reference to Christian values."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we may or may not admit it, but we are Christians, atheists, Muslims or of other faiths."
"What we call common European values have evolved for centuries and are based on Christian values."
"Ladies and gentlemen, all of us, including those who have participated in the drafting of the Constitution and those who have participated in the analysis and discussions, have an obligation to explain the significance of this document to the citizens of our countries, as we cannot expect every European Union citizen to have read it."
"Unfortunately I should like to warn against the trend seen in the Member States, whereby the Treaty is often used for short-term discussions on domestic policy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us refrain from this temptation and discourage our party members from doing likewise."
"This is a long-term document, which we, our children and also our neighbours need."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that today the Constitutional Treaty – the European Constitution – is becoming a reality."
"The result of the Convention’s work, on which we are to vote tomorrow, shows the will to introduce more democracy, transparency and efficiency into the European Institutions, strengthening them and making the decision-making process more efficient."
"The citizens are the real winners, since the Constitution consolidates our common values and principles."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights, which the European Union has also published in miniature version – just like all of the most precious books in history – has been incorporated into the Constitutional Treaty."
"In my opinion, this is a fundamental sign of the transparency, solidarity and democracy of rights: the rights of the individual, of children, the elderly and disabled people."
"This time these principles are being adopted precisely to bring our institution closer to the people, to put it amidst the people, so that we can provide the answers they particularly need precisely at this time."
"I therefore think that removing society’s barriers to ensure that citizens can participate fully in our united Europe is the most important aspect of our current activities."
"Mr President, the last thing I want to do is to spoil a party."
"Over the next 48 hours this Parliament will spend hundreds of thousands of euro on celebrating the Constitution."
"We shall have balloons, a laser display, an orchestra; but I cannot help feeling that all this is a touch premature."
"In at least ten countries there must be a referendum before ratification."
"We cannot call the result of those polls with certainty."
"Not a single ballot has yet been cast."
"If it were only the party that was premature, it would be rather curmudgeonly of me to object, but we are anticipating the Constitution in other more important ways."
"We are, for example, pushing ahead with the creation of an EU diplomatic service, a proposal which, pending formal ratification, has no legal basis."
"In the field of justice and home affairs we have gone even further, pre-empting many of the Constitution's clauses, in particular those to do with the creation of a pan-European legal system and a European public prosecutor."
"Before the Constitution had even been signed, let alone ratified, the European Court of Justice had indicated that it would treat the Charter of Fundamental Rights as justiciable."
"Asked formally by this House what parts of the Constitution they intended to implement without waiting for official ratification, only five of the current Commissioners answered that it would be wrong to anticipate the results of the national referendums."
"The other 20 all replied in one way or another that they intended to forge ahead at once without waiting for the outcome of the national ballots."
"This is meant to be a democratic chamber, but its attitude sometimes recalls Bertolt Brecht's famous couplet 'Let us dismiss the people and elect another in their place'."
"I hope my country will vote 'no' to the Constitution and I am campaigning to that end, but if I lose, I shall accept the result with good grace."
"I would urge those of you who support the Constitution to display a similar respect for the democratic process and not to try to implement large parts of this Constitution even if one or more Member States has voted against it."
"No means no."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by addressing the citizens of Europe, and urging them to care about the Constitution."
"We must do everything in our power to ensure that the European public accepts this Constitution, because it will make Europe clearer and more citizen-friendly, transparent and democratic."
"My impression is that we are all in far too much of a hurry to get down to business as usual."
"The Constitution is on the table, but it has not yet been ratified."
"It is a political milestone for the European Union, and for a more citizen-friendly, transparent and democratic European Union."
"So far, though, the Constitution has been a PR disaster, and I should therefore like to warn that we need an information and communication plan for all the European institutions, the Member States and the national parliaments, and we need a European Constitution Week in all the Member States."
"We also need to abolish unanimity in the Council, thus strengthening the common, transparent and democratic Europe as provided for in the Constitutional Treaty."
"I would call on the Heads of States or Government to ensure that it is the spirit of the Convention and of the signing ceremony in Rome which sets the tone of domestic political debate, and not a lack of criticism and discussion, or aloofness and indifference."
"What we need is for the debate on the Constitution to be Europeanised, not for the ratification process to be nationalised."
"The Constitution is not merely a code of practice for the EU institutions; it affects all Europe’s citizens."
"We should however be fully aware that work will begin afresh with tomorrow’s vote."
"All that this vote must therefore do is to send out a clear signal."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo, who really have produced a masterpiece, making the Constitution more readable."
"The ancient Roman jurists used to say: ‘’ (the law arises out of the fact)."
"Well, from the first day that Europe’s founding fathers began to dream, began to imagine this common entity – a single entity drawing together millennia of history, geography, society and common values – well, from that moment the founding fathers themselves thought of having common rules: what we today call the Constitution."
"This is why I am extremely disappointed this morning to hear prominent fellow Members, whose freedom of expression I clearly respect, stating their opposition to the draft Constitution."
"People may oppose this form of Constitution or the content of the Constitutional Treaty, but not common rules, since the establishment of these rules strengthens sovereignty."
"Today we have to reach an agreement in a world undergoing fundamental changes, including with regard to its systems and new semantics: those whose idea of sovereignty is as it was conceived in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are mistaken."
"Today the new concept of sovereignty lies in subsidiarity: it is the sovereignty of local identities, the sovereignty of citizens, the sovereignty of those who must help construct a legal system to interpret in the best possible way the ever more varied and complex needs of an evolving society."
"We cannot conceive of using the terminology which the jurists taught us: federal state, confederal state, sovereign state: Europe is a new entity, a Union, precisely, with which we must all identify."
"Lastly, I would like to express my regret at the lack of a reference, not just to our Christian roots, but also to Periclean democracy – the origin of the very essence of democracy – to the Roman Empire and to Carolingian Europe."
"Let us hope that during the process of European integration these things will be remembered."
"Almost 50 years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome, that established the European Economic Union, finally Europe is going to have its own constitution."
"For the first time, 450 million citizens and 20 nations are going to be united by this document that defines the values and principles of this European Union."
"The ratification of this constitution will lead us to a more democratic Europe."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights was introduced in this constitution and thus the rights of each person are listed and every citizen may invoke this charter whenever he or she thinks that his or her rights have been broken."
"The social rights are also a priority and are so by a legal decree, the right to education, the right that every citizen can have access to information, protection in the case of an unjust expulsion and the right that the requests for a review in the case of discrimination on the basis of class can be sanctioned, all have been defined and can be implemented."
"The role of the European Parliament has therefore been greatly strengthened and the Parliament together with the Council is going to be responsible to ratify almost all the documents."
"The role of the national Parliaments will be strengthened as well, and this is because it will be responsible to oversee that any agreement between the European Union and the Member States is respected, and therefore the national Parliaments will have enough power to put pressure on the European Commission so that it can revise its proposals."
"In other words, the European Constitution will help so that we can have a more efficient Europe."
"Europe, that has been built in stages, and that is based on Treaties that have been agreed upon along the years; from now onwards we will really have one Europe."
"The integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the clear recognition of European values and objectives are now giving us the opportunity, as European citizens, to call this document 'The European Constitution'."
"I am going to vote in favour."
"I appeal my colleagues to do likewise for the good of European citizens."
". Mr President, in responding to this debate I wish to begin by thanking all those who paid tribute to the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the report it produced."
"It is clear that this Constitution has very broad support across the political spectrum and across Member States."
"I am hopeful that in the vote tomorrow there will be at least a two-thirds majority in favour of it, with more than 400 votes in favour in this Parliament, and that will send a powerful signal."
"Let me also respond to the criticisms that have been made of the Constitution."
"They seem to be twofold."
"Firstly, there are those who say they oppose the Constitution because it does not go far enough."
"They say it will certainly make the EU more democratic, social and so on, but not enough so."
"My answer to them is that the choice at the moment is between the new Constitution and the old one – our current Treaties."
"If the new Constitution contains improvements, then it is better to take the new Constitution rather than carry on living with the old one."
"That is an argument I would also put to those who complain that there is no reference to Christianity in the new Constitution."
"There is no such reference in the current Treaties, although they were drafted by Saint Schuman."
"However, the new Constitution contains a reference to our religious heritage and other heritages, and its values are Christian values and also the values of many others."
"They are values that Christians, non-Christians, people of other religions and of no religion share."
"Many opponents of this Constitution conjure up fears of a superstate; many are opposed to the very existence of the European Union."
"That is illustrated by those who oppose the supremacy of Union law over the law of Member States, which is after all the current situation."
"What is the point of agreeing common laws across Europe if one does not want those laws to be applied across Europe?"
"That is the whole point of agreeing common European legislation in the areas we want it, such as the environment and the common market."
"There is no point in having that legislation if you are against it in the first place."
"To those people I would say: be honest and campaign for what you really believe in, which is your country leaving the European Union, and do not hide behind attacking the Constitution."
"What nonsense to say that this new Constitution will create a centralised superstate!"
"Centralised, the European Union?"
"When it is based on a Constitution that confers powers on the European Union with the agreement of every single Member State on the ratification of treaties?"
"That is the only power the Union has."
"Even in exercising its powers, the Council – i.e. the Member States – has a central role in taking decisions, while the central administration – the European Commission – has fewer employees than the City of Leeds, in my constituency."
"Some superstate!"
"Let me conclude by saying that this debate is partly one of myth against reality."
"I am sure that by broadcasting the facts and enabling a true analysis of the Treaty we will contribute to an honest debate which will persuade people that this Constitution is worth having."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly very much like to thank Parliament for this constructive and largely positive debate."
"I am able broadly to concur with what has just been said by one of the rapporteurs concerning both the quality of this debate and the conclusions that must be drawn from it."
"Moreover, it was this Parliament that instigated this constitutional process."
"As someone pointed out this morning, it was in this House that the constitutional process began, and I should like to pay tribute, on behalf of the Presidency, to Altiero Spinelli who, with his draft European Constitution of 1984, initiated this process and set it going by introducing a first stage, known as the Single Act, negotiated moreover under the Luxembourg Presidency."
"I should also like to say to those who have attacked and criticised this draft Constitution that, in a democratic debate, we obviously respect their position."
"It is not, however, with nineteenth century discourses that a vision is offered to the peoples, European and others, of today’s twenty-first century world."
"To turn in upon ourselves and return to outmoded concepts of sovereignty are inadequate responses in a globalised world."
"They offer no solution at all in terms of prosperity, democracy and peace, neither to Europeans nor to others."
"I should also like to say to those who draw a subtle distinction between a pro-European ‘no’ and an anti-European ‘no’ that there is only a ‘no’ pure and simple, since a rejection of the Constitution is simply a defeat for Europe – a defeat for a stronger, more open, more transparent and more democratic Europe with perspectives to offer both within and beyond its own borders."
"I therefore believe in the need not to become entangled in subtleties of this kind."
"Admittedly, not everything is perfect in this Constitution, as the rapporteur said."
"We should all have liked to have seen improvements regarding this or that point."
"Is not, however, imperfection in a sense the very essence of democracy, since democracy thrives on compromise; and must we not therefore be capable now of accepting a compromise that represents progress in order to make further progress in the future?"
"As several speakers have said, the Constitution provides a sound basis for our shared values."
"It supplies a democratic framework enabling the European Union to take more effective action where action is necessary, account having been taken of the principle of subsidiarity."
"As has been said, the EU’s motto, ‘United in diversity’ characterises the essence of this Europe."
"A balance between large and small Member States, equality between citizens and the respect for national identities mentioned by several speakers are the very essence of our EU, reflected very well in this constitutional document."
"Advances have been made."
"They are perhaps insufficient."
"We should have liked to have gone further in the Justice and Home Affairs or external policy spheres, but I believe that the draft Constitution is an extremely important first stage."
"Nor should revisions be considered just at this time."
"Admittedly, every constitution needs to provide for revision mechanisms, as this one does; in fact, it provides for various types of mechanism."
"Improvements will come as the years go by, on condition that this Constitution is adopted and that we are capable of applying it and using it to construct a genuine European democracy."
"This document has been prepared with the broad participation not only of MEPs and of parliamentarians and other representatives from the Member States but also of representatives of civil society."
"There has been a debate, albeit an inadequate one, in civil society."
"This debate must be encouraged and supported, particularly through the ratification procedures that, as has been emphasised, have already been completed in two countries and that are to begin in other countries too."
"In this respect, Article 1.47, relating to participatory democracy, is an innovation, so much so that it is scarcely referred to in our national Constitutions."
"It needs to be brought alive and given practical content."
"The debate on the adoption of the Constitution has therefore begun, and it must be extended."
"Citizens must be fully involved in it, whether or not there are referendums."
"I entirely agree with what the Vice-President of the Commission said on the subject of communication, explanation and the efforts that must be made in order to make Europe better understood."
"The Presidency concurs with this assertion."
"I emphasise that this work must firstly be done in the Member States, for it is there that the people are building Europe."
"It requires everyone’s involvement: firstly, that of governments and parliamentarians but also, I repeat, that of the representatives of civil society."
"In the course of the next few months, the Presidency will contribute everywhere it can, and everywhere it must, to this process and will encourage this debate."
". Mr President, I would like to thank you all for this long but stimulating debate."
"The vast majority of the comments have rightly paid tribute to this excellent report and to the work of the co-rapporteurs."
"Hopefully, it will receive the overwhelming support of this House tomorrow."
"I am conscious that this report and the Constitution need to be put into historical perspective."
"This is the first time that the European Parliament has not had a list of regrets about the result of an Intergovernmental Conference, and we can ask one of the veterans in this kind of work about this."
"If I compare this report to the Planas, Méndez de Vigo and Tsatsos reports, for example, it is the most positive assessment of the outcome of an Intergovernmental Conference."
"I share the views of those calling for a wide and honest debate."
"Without debate we do not have a democracy and, without debate, we do not get closer to the truth."
"It is therefore our responsibility to provide examples of how the Constitution will affect the daily lives of European citizens."
"The word 'perfect' has been mentioned."
"I have been a Commissioner for only five years and I have not yet seen the 'perfect' document."
"If you look around, how could we find a perfect document?"
"We will have to continue to compromise because we are 25 Member States with different traditions, languages, political decision-making procedures and views."
"We will have to show the will and the capability to compromise."
"This a compromise and it will have to be a compromise."
"The words used this morning are worth recalling."
"Most of them are politically loaded – positively or negatively."
"Many have mentioned rights, democracy, openness, effectiveness and values."
"Mr Méndez de Vigo reminded us this morning that the Constitution is the unique opportunity to guarantee the values of the Union."
"We are united in our diversity but with a set of fundamental and social rights that brings us together."
"These are the values we guarantee not just for us but for our children."
"Others have attempted to describe the Constitution as resulting in a European superstate, a loss of national sovereignty, or a weakening of the role of the national parliaments."
"They have already received a reply from Mr Corbett."
"While I expect that we should have to provide concrete facts and examples of the benefits of the Constitution as compared to the Treaty of Nice, I also expect that those talking about national sovereignty or national parliaments should provide some facts."
"Has the role of national parliaments been weakened?"
"Is it possible to sneak through a European law without supervision by the Member States or national parliaments?"
"We have to be able to respond to those questions."
"Let us work on the basis of facts and the text of the Constitution."
"This should be made accessible to our citizens in all the Member States, not just scare stories or misconceptions."
"We also have to ensure that we are ready for the entry into force of the Constitution when it is ratified by all Member States."
"We will shoulder our responsibilities and so must the Member States."
"It is not enough to hope that adoption in one Member State will lead to automatic acceptance in the next country."
"That is why in the Council I have pushed so strongly for proper national strategies to be developed."
"As Mr Brok has indicated, preparatory work has already begun on the entry into force of the Constitution and the European external action service that will assist the European Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"We are not exactly jumping ahead, but we have to start to be prepared."
"We cannot simply wait and let another two years go by before we can implement the provisions."
"We will have to prepared in the best possible way and find the right balance."
"I agree that we must ensure respect for the text of the Constitution."
"The speeches this morning from Members in the new Member States have illustrated the historic value of the European project and the principles and values that it guarantees."
"Whether we need a bigger boat, a larger bus or a larger dress size, we all recognise that we have a sense of responsibility."
"I look forward to joining you in that debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the Commission communication on the Green Paper on admission for employment."
"Mr President, Mr Schmit, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour of informing Parliament that the Green Paper on economic migration that I presented following agreement with my colleague, Commissioner Spidla, was adopted today by the College."
"With this Green Paper, the Commission wishes to make a contribution to the current debate, a debate begun with the Tampere mandate concerning the most appropriate approach to the admission of economic migrants and concerning the added value represented by the adoption of such a common framework."
"Within the framework of the programme devised in The Hague, the European Council invited the Commission to present, before the end of 2005, a proposal for a common European approach to legal immigration for economic reasons."
"Three years ago, the Commission had addressed a proposal to the Council on this subject, but this was not followed up because of the reluctance of several Member States to tackle the problem in a Community perspective."
"The changes on the international stage, Europe’s need for balanced management of the migration phenomenon and of the latter’s many political, social and security implications and, finally, the signing of the Constitutional Treaty – which makes a clear distinction between subjects that fall within national competences and those which have, either in addition or exclusively, a Community dimension – are factors that have led the Council to engage in timely reflections and that have put this problem back on the agenda."
"The strategy devised in The Hague defines objectives and establishes a timetable that the Commission intends to respect."
"It is self-evident that preparing a proposal in this area demands a wide, comprehensive and transparent debate and, above all, the participation of institutional and social actors in carrying out the research for evaluations, proposals and contributions."
"Indeed, police forces and the authorities responsible for conducting inquiries cannot have available to them all of the facts necessary for putting together both a picture of local situations and of migratory flows from different regions of the world to each European country and a picture of the conditions of integration that have already been met, or are to be promoted, for communities of citizens from outside the EU that already reside, or that are establishing themselves, in the EU."
"The purpose of the Green Paper is, therefore, to gather new facts and up-to-date information by launching a public debate involving the participation of the greatest possible number of actors, including those from civil society, who are interested in a new European strategy in the area of economic migration – a strategy that the Commission is invited to propose before the end of 2005 and that we have to regard as the cornerstone of a much larger political project, capable of preventing, combating and eradicating intolerance, violence and any form of extremism."
"Indeed, these factors give rise to the sense of insecurity experienced by our fellow citizens and, in combating them, we must not confine ourselves to reactions in strictly military or policing terms."
"On the contrary, political actions also have to be undertaken, beginning with a programme of initiatives designed to manage the flow of growing economic emigration towards, inevitably, our own countries that sometimes constitutes an undeniable advantage for the European economy."
"Finally, the public debate launched by the Commission in the form of its Green Paper will enable the Commission to collect a host of data and information that it will be able to use as a basis for preparing the proposals that are requested from it by the Council and that we shall present within the periods laid down."
"Mr President, listening to Mr Frattini, I was thinking of the motto of the famous Belgian poet, Henri Michaux, about never despairing but allowing a solution to bubble up unbidden."
"I do believe that we must pay tribute to the Commission for not having despaired but for having reopened a necessary and useful debate."
"President Schmit, you should stay, for this is very much your area."
"We are, indeed, very keen to see the Commission’s move bear fruit."
"You failed on a previous attempt in this area, in spite of the Commission’s initiative and in spite of Parliament’s commitment. It was the Council that was unable to bring about an agreement."
"The question I put to you, Mr Frattini – yes, it is to you that I am speaking – is this: what objective information do you have that leads you to think – and the question is, in truth, also addressed to Mr Schmit – that the blocks placed by the Council on the previous initiative are likely to be removed today, a prospect about which we are, on the face of it, delighted, albeit – it has to be said – slightly sceptical."
"Commissioner, I am, of course, like my fellow MEP Mr Bourlanges, delighted that the Commission and the European Parliament are continuing with their common efforts to open legal immigration channels."
"I should like, however, to put three questions to you, Commissioner."
"The first is similar to Mr Bourlanges’ question: what practical legislative measures are you considering taking, and what will you do to stop the Council blocking such measures, as in the case of your first attempt in 2001?"
"The second question concerns your proposed sectoral legislation for legal immigration."
"Does not this approach endanger migrants’ rights by creating different regimes for each group?"
"Thirdly and finally, what measures will you adopt in order to link this immigration policy to a policy of European integration?"
"Mr President, my questions follow on directly from Mrs Roure’s comments."
"Firstly, we welcome the fact that the Commission has taken the initiative on this matter, and I hope that, this time, the Council not again stand in its way."
"I believe that the European dimension of this task is more important than the individual interests of the Member States; this is why it is essential for us to adopt European rules, as without such rules for this field we will be unable to create an internal market."
"One could, however, be forgiven for wondering at this point what the precise nature of these European rules will be."
"Mr Frattini, I have noticed that in your statements so far you have failed to say that the key regulations which are already in force, such as the ILO Convention, will be taken as a basis."
"What part will be played in the Green Paper by the key issues referred to in the ILO Convention on migrant workers?"
"In this connection, I should like to note that the European Parliament has already asked the Commission to incorporate these rules."
"Mr Frattini, we have decided to divide the questions into three, by group."
"Do you wish, therefore, to respond now to the statements made by the three speakers?"
". Mr President, I can answer the three questions, which concern the same basic issue."
"I would like to thank Mr Bourlanges and the Members who took the floor."
"The first reason why I am reasonably optimistic over the possibility of attaining a tangible result, namely the adoption of a European initiative, is that, with regard to 2001, it was the European Council – the very institution which in 2001 did not allow a similar measure to be adopted – which in November 2004 called on the Commission to adopt a European initiative by the end of 2005."
"Within the framework of the Hague Programme, the Heads of State or Government, that is, those at the highest political level, asked the Commission to go ahead and to do so quickly."
"That, in my view, demonstrates a new awareness of the fact that only Europe can provide the added value for a strategy on legal immigration."
"The second reason is that with respect to the past, we have chosen what I would call a bottom-up rather than a top-down approach."
"We have chosen to launch a debate with Parliament, with the European Economic and Social Committee, with employers’ associations and trade unions, so that we shall be ready to put forward a proposal only once we have gathered suggestions."
"I am confident that this method will first of all enhance the transparency of the debate, secondly it will allow members of civil society to participate more actively in this debate than in the past, and thirdly it will enable Member States to approve or reject the proposal that the Commission will table, having the views of their employers’ associations, their trade unions and the European Parliament on hand."
"These elements will consolidate the work."
"I therefore cannot predict what tangible measures will be included in the Commission’s initiative, precisely because today we are relaunching a European debate with the aim of gathering information and proposals which we shall submit to a public hearing in about the middle of this year, so that we can table a proposal by the end of 2005."
"At that time we will be in a better position to understand what the tangible measures will be."
"I can only tell you that we intend to adopt a framework of minimum rules, to enable those who wish to work legally to do so, and at the same time to give people a preview of the provisions with the minimum of bureaucracy – there are currently 25 different rules on the admission of migrant workers, one per country."
"We intend to establish a European framework with which anyone outside Europe can familiarise themselves beforehand: that will also help, in our opinion, to prevent illegal immigration."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we feel that it is certainly commendable that immigrants are at last no longer considered a problem, but a resource – as the Green Paper expressly states – and that we are aiming for a permanent multicultural and multireligious dialogue."
"We are concerned, however, by the productivity approach, as, moreover, you yourself called it in an interview for an Italian newspaper: that is, the decision to make migratory flows conditional on the requirements of the European labour market."
"The Green Paper inclines towards the possibility – just a possibility, but one which we intend to comment on – of making the admission of an immigrant conditional on a job vacancy which it has not otherwise been possible to fill with European Union workers, or on a Member State’s specific needs in particular employment sectors."
"Commissioner, do you not agree that application of this principle could mark the end of a common European immigration policy, as well as a step backwards from what many Member States have already achieved?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for the Green Paper."
"Since action was urgently required, and still is, I am delighted with it."
"I have only just received the Green Paper, and so I have not had the chance to read the whole document, only the first few pages."
"I was immediately struck by something on page 5, where as regards the form of future European legislation with a view to the planned harmonisation, three proposals have been made."
"At least, the impression is created that three options are still open, namely the horizontal approach, the sectoral approach and the so-called common fast track procedure."
"Is it not, though, the case that, thanks to years of indecision on the part of the Council, we have tacitly already decided in favour of the sectoral approach?"
"I think that the Peillon report about admitting third-country scientists and researchers is a case in point."
"That is backed by the Council, and that may explain your optimism to some extent."
"Mr President, Commissioner, many Members have not had sight of the Green Paper yet, but at this early stage we should set down for you some basic principles of what is a very welcome discussion."
"First, as my colleague Mrs Roure said, integration policy must be a vital component of any proposed legislation."
"We know that we want to share best practice, but we still have a very vague position on integration policy."
"Secondly, managed migration means all things to all Members in this House."
"For some it may mean control, for some it may mean the right to family unity."
"This is a big gap and we must define in this discussion what managed migration actually means."
"These are human beings coming from third countries to work in the European Union, they are not commodities."
"We will have a set of principles and laws which will have to accommodate that."
"Finally, I very much welcome that civil society will have a much greater say, but we must then listen to civil society, to the trade unions and to business."
"They have some good ideas, and we must not just pay lip service to those ideas but create a managed migration policy which will benefit both the European Union and those people and their families who are coming to benefit our economies."
". Mr President, the three interventions allow me to formulate one single comment."
"Firstly – and I am referring in particular to Mr Fava, who already knows this full well – a recognised, common, widespread principle, commonly referred to as the principle of preference for Community workers over third-country workers, is not asserted for the first time, but merely repeated in the Constitutional Treaty of the European Union."
"Precisely to avoid the indiscriminate and unbalanced application of this principle, we believe that we need to explore, with the help of civil society, trade unions and businesses, what job opportunities exist for which there is no direct issue of taking work away from the citizens of our countries."
"Because, if this were the issue, clearly the impact of immigration on society would not be positive, whereas we must ensure that legal immigration leads to true integration."
"This means workers being accepted into civil society and integrated into education, with real inclusion in society."
"Obviously, this matter is not addressed by the Green Paper, but is the subject of integration policies which will be the focus of a Commission action in 2005."
"These are areas that the Commission will be developing this year, in close cooperation with Parliament and the Presidency."
"Integration is an absolutely vital part of the process."
"In this forum we seek instead to listen to suggestions as to how we can make European policy on the reception of third-country workers uniform: that is our aim."
"I would reiterate once more to those who asked again that today I cannot give any options or preferences among possible abstract solutions."
"Somebody asked me whether we could introduce an American-style green card."
"The answers will come from the public debate which will be starting, from Parliament and from the social actors to whom we shall listen."
"With regard to one point I will, of course, confirm a commitment which you can already guess: the Commission will not confine itself to listening to advice, but will take into account the assessments and proposals that it gathers."
"In conclusion, therefore, the Commission has two lines of action: turning what has until now been a national approach into a European approach, with the aim of promoting a more balanced policy, and above all, delimiting the phenomenon of legal immigration through a positive approach within our societies."
"This approach is essential for true integration, which it will be difficult to achieve without it."
"Mr President, I thank the Commission for its initiative, which is extremely welcome."
"Let me try to put a new twist on things."
"There are tens of millions of Europeans living outside Europe who have benefited from the immigration policy of other countries – not only the United States, but also Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and many others."
"These people – or a very interesting sample of them – met for the first time during the Greek presidency in June 2003 in Thessaloniki."
"Some of the most remarkably successful Italians, Greeks, Czechs, Romanians and others living around the world came to tell us about their experiences."
"Their experience, as European citizens, of being integrated into those countries could be extremely helpful to you, Commissioner."
"I was involved in this and I would be happy to help your staff plan a meeting with these people."
"I do not believe that any of us here feel that the relatives we have in third countries have harmed those countries, nor do the host countries feel that they have harmed them."
"So for us as Europeans to fear the notion of legal migration so greatly goes against our personal experiences."
"Let us hear the experiences of these people."
"Their experiences might even enable us to make it easier for our own citizens – identifying as they will with them – to understand the benefits of legal migration to Europe."
"I have an observation to make, or rather a question to ask of Commissioner Frattini."
"I am not familiar with the Green Paper, but I would like this document to contain provisions to ensure that in future Europe will not be suspected or accused, as has sometimes been the case with the United States, of causing a ‘brain drain’ from poor countries."
"We need to make sure that people who come to European universities or scientific institutes to study or train do not remain here for whatever reasons, whether working or not, as this represents a loss for their own countries."
"The countries affected are frequently poor countries, whose development depends to a large extent on the education of such an elite."
"A policy must be developed which ensures that on the one hand it is possible to work here for a certain length of time, but that on the other hand instruments also exist which would not so much force people to return as encourage them to do so, in order to put the knowledge and experience they have gained to use in developing their own cultures and societies."
"Mr President, I have a sense of here, having drafted the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on a number of these issues."
"I have a number of questions."
"What attention is going to be paid to the work that Parliament has already done on these issues?"
"We have put forward a considerable number of proposals, which we discussed with civil society, trade unions and business."
"The trade unions will demand parity of treatment for third country nationals coming to work in the European Union, so that they are not paid poorly to undercut workers here."
"Business people will tell you that they want entry made easier so that they are not acting as a parallel immigration system."
"One of the things that have changed since Parliament last looked at this is that we now have ten new Member States."
"If we are looking at a hierarchy of movement for employment, presumably the Commission is looking at removing the transition periods for those new Member States as part of that change in the hierarchical system of entry for employment."
"Mr President, I am particularly keen to pick up on Mrs Lambert’s comments on transition periods."
"We should do our best to avoid perpetuating the absurd situation whereby third-country nationals are invited to work in the European Union or in the European labour market whilst restrictions on employment opportunities for those from EU Member States are still in place."
"A balance of some kind must be found, and I am confident that this will become possible in the course of further work on the matter."
"I would however like to thank Commissioner Frattini and his staff for their efforts in continuing work on this issue, above all because employment is by far the best form of integration we can offer our citizens, as has been brought to my attention in many conversations with groups and individuals affected."
"On a slightly different note, I have noticed that the Green Paper is littered with a great many questions."
"Given that the issue of labour migration is such a complex one, it would perhaps be better to leave some of these to one side, in line with the principle of ‘keep it simple, stupid’."
". I thank all Members of Parliament for their suggestions and opinions."
"The fundamental purpose of this proposal is that legal migration should be seen not as a problem but as an opportunity for all of us and for Europe in particular."
"In this period we will launch a public debate."
"We will take into account the work already done by Parliament, particularly on equality of rights and opportunities for legal migrants."
"We will take into account suggestions, concrete proposals, and we will consider all proposals as a very positive contribution in the spirit of open and frank cooperation."
"I should like to mention the important issue of 'brain drain'."
"This issue of brain drain and what to do about it will be one of the key subjects in the particular and specific communication on migration and development, which the Commission will present in Spring 2005."
"I can already assure you that the Commission is fully aware of the acuteness of this problem, particularly in specific countries and sectors such as healthcare."
"The Commission intends to propose a tailor-made approach where responses could be made that are commensurate with the magnitude of this very important and sensitive problem."
"In this way, we will put emphasis on the positive impact that migration can have on countries of origin."
"Finally, I can assure you that this problem will be taken fully into account by the Commission."
"That concludes the item on the Commission communication on the Green Paper on admission for employment."
"I should like to thank Commissioner Frattini and the speakers."
"Mr Ortuondo Larrea has asked to be given the floor in order to make a personal statement."
"Mr President, if I had to define the spirit of the Constitutional Treaty, I would say, firstly, that it is integrationist; secondly, that it is based on free accession; thirdly, that it is respectful of different identities, cultures, languages and institutional structures and creates a European citizenship which does not exclude, but rather co-exists with, other citizens from the Member countries."
"In the Basque country, our Parliament has just approved, by an absolute majority, a new Statute for co-existence with the Spanish State which, in fact, is inspired by the Community model, which maintains these same principles I have indicated and is respectful of the Constitutional Treaty."
"Nevertheless, in this morning’s debate one Member has accused it of attacking the European Constitution and has said that the Basque President and the Basque Nationalist Party have allied themselves with the enemies of Europe."
"That is entirely false."
"We are going to support a ‘yes’ vote and we advocate a ‘yes’ to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe in the coming referendum."
"And we want to be able to live together in peace and friendship with the other peoples of the Spanish State, on the basis of mutual respect for different identities and languages, free accession and common work within a united Europe."
"We Basques have supported European integration from the outset, and we want to be more European and are working for a common future with all Europeans under the new Constitutional Treaty."
"The next item is Question Time, with questions to the Commission (B6-0001/2005)."
"As a result of the proposal adopted by the Commission on 26 October, textile import quotas are going to be abolished from 1 January 2005."
"In terms of industrial restructuring and employment, this decision is going to have very major consequences for some of the Union's regions."
"Economists in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region are already speaking about the loss of 9 000 of the 29 000 direct jobs in the textile industry in that area."
"A veritable human tragedy awaits the workers concerned and their families."
"What specific aid measures is the Commission going to take to safeguard and develop employment in the EU’s major textile industry regions, particularly in terms of structural funding and combating intra- and extra-European relocation processes?"
"Honourable Members, I am responding to this question on behalf of my colleague, Mr Mandelson, who is unable to be here today as he is currently on his way to India."
"The WTO Agreement on Textile and Clothing, which established a ten-year period for the elimination of the quotas, expired on 31 December 2004, and trade in textile and clothing products is henceforth subject to the general WTO rules."
"Quota removal is likely to reshape the export of textile and clothing and global outsourcing trends."
"There may be a substitution effect among suppliers to the advantage of the countries that are able to offer a full range of products, economies of scale, competitive prices and efficient services."
"The impact of abolishing quotas will indeed be considerable, though it is difficult to assess at this stage."
"Moreover, it is likely to vary greatly depending on country conditions, the ability to achieve competitive advantages in the higher value added production segment and domestic policy responses."
"Sustained efforts are needed to help upgrade the skill levels of workers, improve the quality of their jobs and empower social partners at all levels to address the many challenges in the sector."
"As far as Europe is concerned, this sector definitely has assets for the future."
"Investment, a move upmarket and world leadership in the fashion industry have made Europe the world's biggest exporter of textiles and its second biggest exporter of clothing."
"The Commission believes that this entails a three-pronged response: monitor the level of imports into the EU, help the sector strengthen its competitiveness and remain a key industry in the EU, and keep a special focus on the poorest and more vulnerable developing countries."
"The Commission communication of 13 October 2004, entitled 'Textiles and Clothing after 2005', is a key element of this strategy."
"This communication was a response to the set of recommendations by the High Level Group on Textiles and Clothing, in which trade unions were represented."
"On structural funding and relocation processes, the participation of the textile and clothing sector in multisectoral programmes should provide an efficient framework for supporting the sector, allow for diversification of production and ultimately serve the economic interests of the regions in question."
"In addition, the Commission proposes that in all future programmes, Member States should reserve an amount of 1% of the Structural Fund’s annual contribution for the 'Convergence' objective and 3% of the Structural Fund’s annual contribution for the 'Regional competitiveness and employment' objective, to cover unforeseen local or sectoral crises linked to economic and social restructuring or to the consequences of trade opening."
"Madam President, allow me to express to this House my heartfelt solidarity with the millions of employees who will see their lives shattered in the interests of satisfying, once again, a minority of affluent people."
"Indeed, the economists of the International Federation of Trade Unions talk of what they, if not the Commission, know will be the destruction of thirty million jobs, a million of them in Europe, North Africa, Sri Lanka and Indonesia."
"As if what a number of these countries have just experienced were not enough, they now find themselves in even deeper trouble."
"It is, I strongly emphasise, the Commission’s, the Council’s and Parliament’s responsibility and duty to put a stop to this social disaster."
"The Commission must be aware of the problem of forced and illegal child labour in the cocoa industry."
"West Africa provides most of the world’s cocoa, where over 200 000 children are thought to be working in hazardous conditions on cocoa farms (International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, July 2002)."
"European consumers are faced with the possibility that some of the chocolate they eat has been produced by forced labour."
"Could the Commission inform me of what initiatives it has undertaken to ensure that the taste of slavery is irradicated from the European diet?"
". Honourable Members, I am responding to this question on behalf of my colleague, Mr Michel, who is unable to be here this afternoon, as he must attend the donors' conference on the tsunami disaster."
"On this issue, the approach of the Commission is twofold."
"Firstly, on the one hand, we support the initiatives and programmes of the ILO."
"Secondly, we reinforce the capacity of the countries in the region to implement the relevant Cotonou provisions and different Economic Community of West African States protocols and initiatives in the area of child protection."
"The International Labour Organisation, through its International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour, launched in 2000 a new initiative called 'Combating Trafficking in Children for Labour Exploitation in West and Central Africa'."
"In 2003 a 'West Africa Cocoa/Commercial Agricultural Programme to Combat Hazardous and Exploitative Child Labour' was added, focusing in particular on cocoa farming."
"The Commission has a strategic partnership with the ILO, in which the fight against child labour is a priority."
"In that context, a programme of EUR 15 million under the ACP funds is currently under consideration."
"The objectives would be, , firstly, to establish a sustainable mechanism to prevent children from carrying out all sorts of labour in the agricultural and other sectors."
"Secondly, to strengthen the capacity of national and community-level agencies and organisations in planning, initiating, implementing and evaluating action to prevent and progressively eliminate child labour."
"Thirdly, to remove all children involved in work in the cocoa sector, to prevent children at risk from entering such work, and to improve the income-earning capacity of adult family members, particularly women, through social protection schemes."
"ECOWAS is active as a regional organisation in the fight against child labour."
"In addition to the Cotonou provisions on trade and labour standards, the ECOWAS Heads of State have adopted a declaration and a plan of action to fight child exploitation, and ECOWAS has recently set up a child unit in its secretariat."
"The 9th EDF Regional Indicative Programme will provide capacity-building to this new unit within ECOWAS, with a view to promoting the effectiveness of its work."
"I thank the Commissioner for giving me information on the ILO and various other organisations and activity which is already in the public domain."
"I wonder whether the Commission is actually considering a more positive agenda with regard to companies who are making profits out of this at the moment, by perhaps insisting that unless European companies – and do not forget that Europeans and North Americans consume most of these cocoa products – can give a guarantee that they are not making their products and profits on the back of child labour, then they cannot import them into Europe."
"Has the Commission considered that and will the Commission consider it?"
". The Commission believes that the framework of the Cotonou Agreement between the EU and the 77 ACP countries gives real opportunities to address the human and social aspects of this practice, as well as the corruption element that may be linked to it, through political dialogue and support for good governance in ACP countries."
"Moreover, it considers that poverty and the lack of local opportunities are amongst the main reasons for exploitative child labour and child trafficking."
"The poverty- reduction approach through EU development cooperation is a sound basis for tackling the problem as it gives priority to equitable growth and to better access to education."
"Finally, the Cotonou Agreement represents an important step forward in promoting CLS in bilateral agreements."
"Article 50 includes a specific provision on trade and labour standards, which reaffirms the commitments of the Parties to international CLS as defined by the relevant ILO Conventions."
"Is the Commission aware of the fact that the world Chocolate Manufacturers Association concluded an agreement back in 2001 specifically to deal with this issue?"
"Would the Commission therefore undertake to look at the report that is due in the middle of this year from the international chocolate manufacturers, commend them on the work that they have been doing and encourage them to continue to develop their certification programme?"
"I am at a loss as to why chocolate has been singled out in this respect because there are many other food products being sourced from Third World countries where the same issues pertain – labelling issues and quality standards are very important across the whole of the sector."
". I will certainly bring Mr Harbour's comments to Mr Michel's attention."
"I propose that the Commission immediately commence talks with the Russian Federation on the threat of a suspension of and raising barriers against food exports to Russia from Poland and other new Member States."
"These talks should help facilitate, normalise, accelerate and define the inspection criteria."
"I wish to express my indignation at the Commission's stated position that the issue of veterinary inspections by the Russian Federation is an internal matter for the above states."
"This statement smacks of discrimination against the new Member States in EU internal relations, because Member States do not have the power to make independent decisions regarding veterinary matters related to the import of products from third countries."
"Hence, it will be impossible to resolve the problem without dialogue between all the parties."
"This situation is not new to the Commission, as it has already 'supported' talks between France and the United States on a similar matter."
". I am responding to this question on behalf of my colleague, Mr Kyprianou, who is unable to be here today, as he is unwell."
"The Commission has made all reasonable efforts to avoid disruption in exports of animal and plant products from the European Union to Russia."
"This potential disruption arises from Russian insistence that EU exports meet its specific import requirements."
"For animal products, there was the concrete concern that trade would be totally blocked from 1 January 2005."
"From this date, in fact, Russia insists on a single set of sanitary certificates for imports."
"However, negotiations led by the Commission on behalf of the EU have averted this risk."
"As regards plant products, where a similar risk to exports could materialise from 1 April 2005, the Commission intended to start negotiations as soon as the risk emerged, and asked the Council to endorse this."
"Following a debate among Member States on the basis of this request, the AGRI Council in December 2004 agreed and the Commission immediately started negotiations on these issues on behalf of the EU."
"The Commission is confident that this will lead to a successful outcome."
"The honourable Member can be assured, therefore, that although the Commission has very little competence in relation to export requirements in third countries, it has expressed its willingness and has been proactive in view of helping to solve this kind of problem and, as soon as the Commission was given the green light from the Council, it engaged in timely negotiations."
"In the course of negotiations, no distinction has been made between the new and former Member States."
"However, Russia has insisted on inspecting all establishments in the new Member States which have requested approval for export."
"The Commission has highlighted that these same establishments have been approved for intra-EU trade following the enlargement process."
"It has also pressed for the inspection process to be carried out as quickly as possible."
"Overall, this situation has undoubtedly led to disruption in the trade of these Member States with Russia, and it is not made easier by the fact that Russia is not a member of the WTO and does not therefore consider itself bound by the rules of the WTO."
"The honourable Member may rest assured that the Commission has involved all Member States in the efforts to avoid trade disruption, in particular the new Member States."
"These efforts are continuing and the Commission will continue to defend the Community interest."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the situation is more dramatic than might be supposed from the Commissioner’s reply."
"Since 1 May, Russia has been playing games and not accepting goods from Poland in retaliation for the refusal by certain countries, such as the Baltic countries, to accept Russian imports because they failed to meet the sanitary requirements laid down by the EU."
"Member States do not, however, have the power to take independent decisions on veterinary matters relating to imports of products from third countries."
"I would ask you to take urgent action on this matter."
". As I stated in my reply, the Commission has treated this matter with considerable urgency, when we asked the Council to give us the go-ahead and when we engaged in negotiations."
"The honourable Member is correct that it imposes certain major difficulties on some of these countries and the Commission will do its very best to achieve a satisfactory solution."
"However, I must stress the limits of what we can achieve."
"Hopefully, with goodwill on all sides, the matter can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion in the near future."
"There is widespread concern that the draft Services Directive, particularly its 'country of origin' provision, may lead to social dumping and a 'race to the bottom' in service provision."
"Will the Commission now withdraw the draft directive and initiate a process of consultation aimed at producing a more balanced proposal, while also taking into account the need for a Framework Directive to enable delivery of high-quality services of general interest/public services?"
". The Commission wishes to stress that removing internal market barriers is not tantamount to undermining the quality of services, or that the Services Directive will lead to social dumping – quite the contrary."
"As regards the protection of workers, the proposed directive does not affect the existing Community , namely the Posted Workers’ Directive from 1996."
"This directive provides that posted workers, including temporary workers, enjoy, irrespective of the law applicable to the employment relationship, a number of important protective provisions concerning working conditions in force in the Member State where the worker is posted."
"Therefore, companies cannot use this proposal in order to establish themselves in low-wage countries to circumvent the social protection of the host Member State."
"In addition, the proposed directive reinforces the control of posted workers because it establishes a system of cooperation between Member States and obliges the country of origin of the service provider to assist the authorities of the host Member State in the supervision of working conditions."
"The proposed directive will thus help to prevent social dumping."
"The Commission does not share the concern that the directive will lead to a 'race to the bottom' in service provision."
"First, the country of origin principle only applies to the temporary cross-border provision of services."
"For services provided via an establishment in another Member State – for example a hospital or a home for the elderly – the service provider will have to comply with all the relevant rules in that Member State."
"Second, the country of origin principle is embedded in harmonisation and enhanced administrative cooperation between Member States."
"Moreover, a number of derogations from the country of origin principle cover, for instance, the applicable working conditions in the context of posting of workers, consumer contracts, health and safety on building sites and public health."
"Finally, the Commission wishes to stress that the proposed directive does not require the liberalisation or privatisation of services which are currently provided at national, regional or local level by the public sector or public entities."
"Neither does the proposal affect the freedom of the Member States to define what they consider to be services of general economic interest and how they should be organised or financed."
"Furthermore, it does not affect Member States' ability to maintain appropriate regulations concerning the quality, availability and performance of services of general interest, or other regulations ensuring consumer and user rights."
"It is also important to note that the proposal does not prejudge the work on, or the outcome of, specific Community initiatives, in particular the follow-up to the White Paper on services of general interest."
"The Commission has committed to a genuine dialogue with both co-legislators and interested parties with a view to finding solutions to specific areas of concern."
"To date, the need for a major step forward in opening the internal market has not yet been validly contested."
"I am confident that also the honourable Member would like to see companies, consumers and workers enjoy the benefits of an open and competitive integrated services market."
"We are all aware of the economic and social challenges facing the European Union."
"Bearing in mind the importance of the services sector, the proposed directive will contribute significantly to addressing these challenges."
"Firstly I would like to welcome the Commissioner to his first Question Time in Parliament."
"I look forward to more."
"I am a little bewildered by the Commissioner's reply."
"His reply indicates that this directive will do nothing, that it is not going to affect any of the areas about which we have expressed concern."
"He says it will only apply to temporary cross-border provision of services."
"In what way, then, will this directive lead to a competitive integrated services market?"
"If it is simply to provide for the provision of temporary cross-border provisions, how does it lead to a competitive integrated services market?"
". As I pointed out in my reply, the country of origin principle applies only to the temporary cross-border provision of services."
"The rest of the directive deals with any other areas."
"If services are provided via an establishment in another Member State, the service provider will have to comply with all the relevant rules in that Member State."
"I should like to point out to the honourable Member that I would accept that the Services Directive is very ambitious: it aims to provide an overarching framework."
"I am aware of the concerns of many Members of this Parliament and people outside this Parliament."
"I am very conscious that it has raised the political temperature in a number of Member States."
"I have entered into an open and constructive dialogue with Members, and I will continue to do that."
"I look forward to future communications from your rapporteur to assess parliamentarians' views within the committee responsible."
"Would the Commissioner agree that it is vitally important for Members of this House to understand the huge variety of discriminatory and anti-competitive practices that Member States currently apply against service providers?"
"It would be very helpful if you could explain these in more detail to Members of this Parliament who persist in describing this directive in the entirely unjustified terms you have so convincingly dismissed in your answer of 'social dumping' and a 'race to the bottom'."
"There is no evidence whatsoever that either of those things will happen, and it would be helpful if the job creation facet inherent in this directive were properly communicated."
". I certainly agree with the honourable Member that the opportunities for job creation from an opening-up of the services market throughout Europe are immense."
"Various studies have been initiated, and there are great opportunities for job creation."
"Given that services account for well over 60% of the Union's GDP, it is clear that any improvement in the services area is going to lead to an increase in wealth and jobs for people in the Union."
"I agree with the honourable Member that many anti-competitive practices exist in lots of Member States that prevent the real opening-up of the services market."
"The services directive is attempting to open up the services area to the benefit of everybody in Europe."
"But having said that, and in reply to the earlier question from Mr De Rossa, I am also conscious of the specific concerns expressed by Members."
"Hopefully, during the parliamentary process and other processes we will be able to tease these concerns out further."
"If you take the qualifications that the Commissioner expressed in his answer to the first question at face value, it is clear that this directive would not apply to the UK health service, which is based on care that is free at the point of use."
"If we can take his reassurances at face value, why does he not simply exclude health from the scope of this directive?"
". The approach that I have adopted with the European Parliament and others who have raised concerns is to have those concerns and problems put on the table and into a document."
"I would not wish to start with a list of the items I think should be removed."
"That would not be the correct approach."
"I accept that this is a very ambitious document, what we are trying to achieve is worth fighting for."
"People come to various issues in this House from various perspectives, with their own experiences and political and economic philosophies."
"What we all have to accept is that if Europe is to meet the challenges of the future and keep the social protection model and other things that we aspire to and want in Europe, we have to ensure that the European economy grows."
"Standing still is not an option."
"The Services Directive attempts to open up this particular market."
"As I pointed out in reply to Mr Harbour, services make up the bulk of the European Union's economic activity, therefore it is a goal well worth fighting for."
"In early 2004, the European Commission presented a proposal for a directive on services as a crucial contribution to the pursuit of the Lisbon Strategy."
"This proposal has provoked a great deal of debate, including strong support as well as fierce opposition from some quarters."
"What conclusions does the Commission draw from the reactions that the proposal has generated?"
"Could the Commission indicate why it has chosen to table a proposal with such a broad scope and why it is putting so much emphasis on the role of the country of establishment of the service provider?"
"Why did the Commission not opt for a sector-by-sector approach?"
"What is the role of the service sector in the EU's economy, and what part of this involves cross-border activities?"
"What tangible results relevant to the Lisbon Objectives does the Commission hope to achieve with this proposal?"
". As the honourable Member has pointed out, the proposed Directive on services in the internal market is at the heart of our efforts to reform the European economy."
"Services account for approximately 70% of EU GDP and employment."
"The removal of internal market barriers in the area of services, as foreseen by the proposal, is essential for meeting the growth and employment targets which lie at the heart of the Lisbon Agenda."
"The potential economic opportunities arising from this proposal are indeed huge."
"This has been underlined by recent Dutch economic research which shows that implementation of the proposal in its current form could result in an increase in bilateral trade and direct foreign investment in commercial services by 15% to 35%."
"The Commission has proposed a horizontal directive for several different reasons."
"First, a broad range of services is dealt with because many of the barriers identified are common to various service activities."
"The most efficient way to address these barriers is in a horizontal way."
"Secondly, a large scale and detailed harmonisation process through sectoral directives would be unnecessary, unrealistic and inconsistent with better regulation and subsidiarity principles."
"Thirdly, the services proposal takes into account the specificity of certain activities, proposes specific harmonisation where this is deemed necessary and adopts a phased approach to implementation."
"It is clear that the proposal has provoked a great deal of discussion."
"However, this is exactly what a proposal this ambitious and far-reaching can be expected to do."
"It shows that the proposal is addressing some very important questions."
"At the same time, this also means that there is a lot of work to be done to achieve a common goal."
"The country of origin approach is a central element of the proposal, as far as the cross-border supply of services is concerned."
"It eliminates the problem of cross-border services being subject to a multitude of different rules."
"This will stimulate the offer of cross-border services and improve the competitiveness of the EU economy."
"The country of origin approach is in particular essential for SMEs, who do not have the means to establish a subsidiary or an office in another Member State and therefore can export their know-how only by the temporary cross-border provision of services."
"I wish to note, however, that the country of origin approach does not apply for services provided through a fixed commercial presence in the host country."
"At the same time, I wish to reiterate that the country of origin approach does not operate in isolation."
"Over and above the specific harmonisation foreseen for certain activities, the proposal also foresees the further development of administrative cooperation between Member State authorities and administrations."
"This harmonisation and cooperation will generate the degree of confidence between Member States required for the effective application of the country of origin approach."
"Finally, a number of derogations are foreseen for services demonstrating a particular sensitivity because of the need to protect consumers, public health or public security, or where the current divergence of Member States' legislation does not allow the application of the country of origin approach."
"As pointed out in my earlier reply, the Commission is confident that the proposal is the best way to allow the economic potential of the services sector to materialise, in the interest of our workers, our consumers and our companies."
"I also wish to welcome Commissioner McCreevy to his first Question Time in Parliament and to re-emphasise at the outset that I am fully in favour of the Lisbon Strategy and objectives because they can create greater wealth and employment within the European Union."
"However, turning to his reply, one of the biggest hindrances to cross-border trade and protection of the country of origin principle is the idea of a one-stop shop for registration of a company, that is if one Member State approves a company to provide that service in that Member State, it should be reciprocal in all other Member States, because the same basis for decision-making under the internal market rules should apply."
". The country of origin approach which lies at the heart of the Services Directive will allow for the circumstances Mr Crowley has outlined."
"As I said in my reply, it will allow companies to operate in another Member State without having to go through a multitude of further tests."
"That is the basis of the country of origin principle as it would apply to the circumstances outlined."
"I also welcome the Commissioner to his first Question Time in this House."
"I should like to ask him, in relation to competitiveness and economic capacity – aspects of the Lisbon Agenda – if he would confirm that he shares my view that structural labour problems need to be addressed, especially when Europe is compared to the United States?"
"In this regard, would the Commissioner agree that access by women to the workplace – which is greatly restricted in the EU compared to the situation in the US, in part because of the lack of affordable childcare facilities – needs to be addressed?"
"Will the Commission address this issue?"
". I welcome Mr Mitchell's contribution, but would like to point out that the matters referred to come under the remit of my colleague, Mr Spidla."
"Mr Mitchell has gone into further problems relating to growth within the European Community."
"The Lisbon process is about addressing these matters and, as you will be aware, Mr Barroso has made the Lisbon Agenda his top priority for our period in office."
"I note what the honourable Member has said regarding access by women to the labour market and his comments about childcare."
"I am sure other colleagues in the Commission will address these matters."
"I too wish to welcome Commissioner McCreevy."
"When it comes to the Services Directive, it is clear that not everyone has understood why it is needed."
"I therefore think it would be appropriate, and shall also ask the Commissioner if it might not be appropriate, to produce a list of examples clearly showing how companies have, in practical terms, been prevented from contributing to economic development."
"One example is the case of a French company that wishes to produce gravestones being prevented from doing so by Germans and exposed to threats of fines."
"Can the Commissioner come back with a full and practical list of the host of problems we have seen in SOLVIT and in other contexts – problems to which companies are exposed and that prevent economic development?"
". We have produced such a document and I shall gladly send a copy of it to the honourable Member."
"Madam President, I know how hard it is to chair these sessions, but I wonder what relevance that supplementary had to Mr Mitchell's original question?"
"Mrs Cederschiöld seemed to have jumped back to the previous question."
"I know my colleague Mr De Rossa had a genuine supplementary on the previous question and was refused the floor!"
"Mr Martin, it is evident that the whole House takes a great deal of interest in this matter."
"A great many Members had asked to speak, and there is no way for me to know in advance what Members’ supplementary questions will relate to when I give them the floor."
"Perhaps you should discuss the matter again with Mrs Cederschiöld."
"The second part of Question Time has already overrun in any case, which means that Questions Nos 31 to 33 can no longer be taken, and will instead be answered in writing."
"We shall now proceed to the next set of questions."
"The Summit of Iberoamerican Heads of State or Government agreed in San José de Costa Rica last November to focus on encouraging education programmes, as the key to Latin American development."
"Does this also provide the Commission with a window of opportunity in the field of EU-Latin American relations?"
". Madam President, I must admit that this is my first Question Time, but I am looking forward to it."
"An opportunity to deal with specific issues should always be welcomed."
"I shall now speak in English."
"This was a question on education, which is indeed a very important sector in the framework of the Commission's relations with Latin America."
"The importance of this sector has been stressed by the Heads of State and Government of both regions in Rio, in Madrid, in Guadalajara and at various different summits, calling in particular for the reinforcement of regional cooperation at the level of higher education."
"The Commission is currently implementing cooperation programmes at national, subregional and regional levels in the field of education worth about EUR 300 million."
"In particular the Commission is financing two regional programmes in the field of higher education."
"One is the Alfa programme – , and the other is the Alban programme – ."
"The Alfa programme promotes cooperation between higher education institutions and other relevant organisations in the two regions with a view to human and institutional capacity-building, mobilising the civil society of both the EU and Latin America regions as a whole and therefore creating and reinforcing lasting bonds."
"Alfa 1 covers the period 1994-1999 and Alfa 2 the period 2000-2005."
"Concerning allocations, Alfa 1 has a budget of EUR 32 million and Alfa 2 a budget of EUR 42 million."
"The Alban programme was launched in 2002 at the EU-Latin America Madrid summit, thereby responding to the recommendations of the Rio de Janeiro summit."
"The programme awards scholarships to Latin American nationals for education training at master and doctorate levels in institutions in the EU, as well as for higher training for professionals from Latin America in organisations in the Union."
"At regional and national level, several education projects are being implemented, notably in basic education."
"It is worth noting that the EUR 74.6 million programme is dedicated to education in the context of the programme for reconstruction and rehabilitation in Central America following Hurricane Mitch in 1998."
"In Nicaragua the Commission is contributing to the improvement of the education sector through budget support totalling EUR 62.5 million."
"Madam President, I would like first of all to welcome the Commissioner, Mrs Ferrero, who, as well as having an adopted Hispanic surname, has a mastery of Spanish and is knowledgeable about Latin America."
"Her reply has satisfied me."
"She has told me what I wanted to know about the Commission’s support for the education programmes and, in particular, for the instrument I referred to in my question, the Summit of Iberoamerican Heads of State or Government, which is made up of the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries of Latin America, as well as Spain and Portugal."
"I thank you once again, Commissioner."
"We will have the opportunity to discuss these issues further in the future."
". Since the answer has already been given, I have nothing to add."
"In its campaign entitled 'Would you leave it to chance? – We don't' the Commission is sending out the message that Europe has a substantial amount of money available for development cooperation."
"The statement by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner in this campaign says that the world must become a better place, but this evidently means primarily for Europeans and that development cooperation must in the first instance bring stability to our 'immediate neighbourhood'."
"Combating poverty has been relegated to a secondary role."
"Can the Commission say whether this approach, which is primarily designed to make Europe more secure rather than providing permanent solutions to third world development, is compatible with the development agenda of the developing countries and consistent with Article 177 of the Treaty and the UN Millennium goals?"
". As the Commission pointed out when it launched the poster campaign, the priorities of European Commission development cooperation are: to reduce and eventually eradicate poverty; promote sustainable development; build democracies; contribute to the integration of developing countries into the world economy; support good governance and promote respect for human rights."
"The Commission is committed to helping developing countries achieve the development goals of the millennium."
"However, there are important objectives and activities that go far beyond the millennium development goals."
"For example, promoting peace and security and also supporting institution building."
"A comprehensive, integrated approach is therefore essential in achieving sustainable development, as made clear also by the Treaty on European Union in Article 3, which emphasises the importance of assuring consistency of external policies and instruments in the context of external relations, security, development, economic and trade policy."
"This is also clearly stressed in the 2004 annual report on the Community's development policy."
"The Community's external actions, including assistance, are further adapted to the diversity of our partner regions and countries."
"The European neighbourhood policy is an expression of such a comprehensive and integrated partner strategy."
"Similarly, our relations with the larger developing countries in Asia and Latin America in particular cover a broad range of objectives."
"In this context, it is clear that bringing concrete benefits to our partners will make the world a better place, not only for the people directly benefiting from EC assistance but also for European citizens."
"However, this does not change the overriding objective of the development policy of the European Commission, that is to eradicate poverty."
"Madam President, I am pleased with the Commissioner’s response, because I have to say that I was a little shocked when I read her statement of 2 December."
"Indeed, one could have been forgiven for thinking that the objectives that she listed did not agree with the millennium objectives."
"Commissioner, this issue has been discussed in the Committee on Budgetary Control before."
"In this respect too, you have encroached upon the area of development cooperation."
"Mr Michel is the Commissioner for Development and I think that good agreements will need to be made, also in terms of statements made, to prevent what you said from being misinterpreted in the broader context of the millennium objectives."
"I should like to ask you to consult with Mr Michel very carefully on this score."
". Thank you for acknowledging that this campaign is going to the right development goals."
"It underlines the key sectors of the external assistance policy, as defined in the development policy communication and in the development goals."
"There are seven elements to the seven priorities of the European Commission intervention."
"One is prosperity, achieved by trade and the private sector."
"Second, security, which is being achieved via justice and regional cooperation."
"Third is freedom, achieved by human rights and good governance."
"Fourth is food: food security and rural development."
"Fifth, water: the water initiative protecting sustainable development."
"Sixth, education: education systems and access to schools."
"Lastly, the EuropeAid message – 'partnerships improving lives worldwide' – evokes the how and why of external assistance."
"With regard to scope, the campaign is reaching out to over 150 countries worldwide."
"It is establishing long-term partnerships, and its approach is to focus on ownership of projects in partner countries."
"Priority areas results are also to be focused upon: there must be a demonstrable impact on people's lives."
"This campaign has really gone to the heart of what we want to do and comes under the umbrella of the overall goals."
"In the light of Israel's continued breach of the EU-Israel Protocols, will the Commission consider the suspension of these agreements?"
"The human rights clause in the EU-Israel Association Agreement places ‘economic freedom and the principles of the United Nations Charter, particularly the observance of human rights and democracy’ as ‘the very basis of the Association’."
"Article 2, the Operative Clause, clearly states that ‘relations between the Parties, as well as all the provisions of the agreement itself, shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles, which guides their internal and international policy and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement’."
". In response to your call for the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, it is the Commission's judgement that measures such as sanctions would make the Israeli authorities less, rather than more, responsive to the efforts of the international community to promote a lasting solution."
"This is at a time when the EU is seeking to have a very constructive role in ensuring that the withdrawal from Gaza takes place in a positive climate, in cooperation with a new, and now democratically-elected, Palestinian leadership."
"I fully recognise the frustrations of those seeking to promote the peace process when confronted by Israel's expansion of its settlement activities."
"The European Commission has regularly expressed its concerns not only at the continuing terrorism and violence but also at the route of the separation barrier and the expansion of settlements."
"Our wish is to address these issues through dialogue."
"The Commission is seeking to develop relations with Israel and the Palestinians through the European Neighbourhood Policy, through support for Palestinian reforms and the development of political dialogue with Israel."
"The action plan adopted for Israel includes measures to strengthen dialogue and cooperation on the importance of adherence to international law and the need to preserve the perspective of a viable, comprehensive settlement, which involves minimising the impact of security and counter-terrorism measures on the civilian population."
"It is the Commission's view – and I believe this is shared by the Member States – that measures to suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement would therefore be counterproductive."
"I fully accept what the Commissioner says about the changing circumstances."
"Since I tabled this question, Mr Abbas has been elected as leader of the Palestinians and we have seen Mr Peres join the Israeli Government."
"That gives us some hope for dialogue between the two sides."
"However, I would ask her, in her new role, to keep this Protocol under constant review and to keep the pressure on Israel to observe the contents of the Protocol."
"I know that in the past the Commission has taken action on products that have come from East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip."
"I ask her to continue to monitor the situation to ensure that products from those areas are not labelled as 'products of Israel'."
". I can assure you that the Commission will certainly do that, because just before Christmas we had such a Council meeting."
"This has of course been one of the important issues in the Council so we will try to do our best to get both parties to abide by their obligations."
"On 9 December, at the time of the adoption of the initial action plans for the new European neighbourhood policy, the Commissioner responsible for external relations and European neighbourhood policy stated that his objective was to create a circle of friends around the enlarged Union's borders."
"Of the seven countries with which the first action plans were concluded, only Ukraine directly shares terrestrial borders with the enlarged Union."
"On the other hand, Belarus, which shares borders with three new EU Member States is, according to the Commissioner, not democratic enough to be included in the programme."
"Does the Commission plan to implement other internal measures to resolve the Belarus problem?"
"Does it intend to take account of the proposals to set up a cross-cutting Community assistance programme in the field of human rights and democracy or to broadcast radio or TV programmes from neighbouring countries?"
"Are there plans to set up an EU delegation in Minsk or to appoint an EU representative to Belarus?"
"These initiatives would contribute to the building-up of civil society in Belarus and to the process of democratisation, without in any way compromising with the country's authoritarian regime."
". The Commission underlines that the European Neighbourhood Policyframework is very important, and it wants to reinforce further the relationship between the enlarged European Union and its neighbours, including Belarus."
"A key principle of the 'Ring of Friends' is forging joint ownership."
"The Union cannot impose its policy on anyone, but it is ready to convince its neighbours of the benefits of the ENP."
"The Union is offering closer cooperation across the spectrum of its relations – from political dialogue to economic integration – on the basis of commitment to common values."
"This offer is, in principle, also valid for Belarus."
"Through the ENP, the Union is ready to reinforce its lasting commitment to supporting democratic development in Belarus."
"If and when fundamental political and economic reforms take place, it will be possible for Belarus to be fully involved in the ENP, with all the benefits that would bring."
"Under current conditions, however, there can be no fully-fledged ENP action plan for Belarus."
"The October 2004 parliamentary elections and the referendum were important milestones for Belarus under the ENP, but, unfortunately, Belarus failed to achieve them."
"However, there remains a clear prospect for deepening relations, including under the framework of the ENP, provided that fundamental reforms are carried out."
"At present, a key element – and this is also an issue in EU policy towards Belarus – is to support civil society and the process of democratisation."
"In addition, Belarus will continue to be able to benefit from the relevant regional, cross-border and thematic programmes."
"The Commission is stepping up its effort to coordinate assistance for democratisation and civil society."
"Moreover, the Commission is also looking – and here I want go into detail – into the possibility of supporting civil society and the democratic process in a flexible manner."
"In the first place, the assistance should be operational and managed in the country concerned."
"But the Commission does not exclude specific situations where a project would be implemented mainly outside Belarus."
"The modalities for doing so need to be carefully considered in the light of the relevant rules and regulations."
"Support for independent media and information dissemination is among the key priorities of EU assistance."
"A radio or television station broadcasting to Belarus outside the country is an interesting idea, but requires further clarification as to whether such an initiative could be supported by EU funds under the existing rules and regulations."
"As to the question of opening a delegation in Belarus, it must be borne in mind that the EU has limited resources for extending its network of fully-fledged delegations."
"Belarus is covered by the European Commission delegation in Kiev, which has a technical assistance office in Minsk."
"The Commission will look into the possibilities of allocating, within the existing structures, additional human resources for work in Belarus."
"At the moment, opening a European Commission delegation in Minsk is not, however, being considered."
"Commissioner, I should also like to congratulate you on your first Question Time."
"Your detailed replies would seem to indicate that the Commission will in fact be working very actively in Belarus."
"I should like to ask whether you believe cooperation with the current Belarussian authorities to be possible, even in the present circumstances?"
". Madam President, there can be no question of us cooperating with the authorities at present."
"What we can do, however, and as I mentioned before, is to provide particular support for civil society, and also to focus efforts on working with the academic community."
"I can tell you that we are planning to hold three workshops in order to identify exactly what we can do, involving non-governmental organisations and as many neighbouring countries as possible, as we share the view that support for civil society is the only opportunity available to us at present to bring about change in Belarus."
"Many thanks."
"Commissioner, it would seem that it is indeed essential to involve Belarus’s neighbours in efforts to support the development of civil society in that country."
"Academic programmes and programmes relating to the independent media can only be implemented with the cooperation of neighbouring countries."
"I believe that finding projects that might lead to additional funding for such measures would be the best way of ensuring that in future we will be able to establish cooperation with a genuine democratic government in Belarus."
". First I should like to point out that I have already answered, in principle, the question of the media."
"I clearly pointed out the Commission's opinion for the time being."
"However, with regard to projects and money I can give you some examples: the EU's support for civil society is to be strengthened; the EU's TACIS programme – which amounts to EUR 10 million for Belarus in 2005 and 2006 – will focus on support for civil society, independent media – exactly what you wanted us to focus on; higher education cooperation including exchanges of students and professors; and alleviation of the consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe."
"The provision of information to the general public with regard to the European Union and the European Neighbourhood Policy will also be strengthened."
"In addition, the Tempus Programme will finance exchanges of young Belarusian university students abroad, curriculum development on European studies and capacity-building in local universities."
"As I said, Belarus is indeed eligible under the New Neighbourhood programmes."
"It will therefore benefit from the European Neighbourhood Policy instrument as of 2007."
"Finally, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights – the EIDHR – will have a more active role in Belarus in the years to come."
"In 2005-2006 Belarusian applicants will be able to apply for support under two campaigns: 'fostering a culture of human rights' and 'promoting democratic processes'."
"I should like to know whether the European Commission is aware that these much-needed educational programmes are under the control of the Belarussian authorities, and therefore cannot be regarded as true support for the process of democratisation in Belarus."
"I should also like to ask whether, in the light of the Commissioner’s comments, a sum of money will be earmarked under the EIDHR (European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights) programme to support independent initiatives in Belarus, bearing in mind that over recent years not a single euro from the fund has yet been set aside for this purpose."
". As I said before, we will have three workshops."
"The last of them will be in Lithuania, which invited the Commission to work together with some neighbouring countries on new ideas and strategies; on what can be done with NGOs and others."
"I will certainly take up this suggestion in those workshops to see what can be done, but it must fit into the framework of the regulations that are there."
"However, we will certainly consider that."
"Questions Nos 38 to 41 will be answered in writing. Questions Nos 39 and 40 lapse, as they are already on the agenda for this part-session."
"Articles appearing in the highly reputable 'Vima' newspaper of 5 and 7 December 2004 reveal the discovery of a telephone tapping network set up by the Italian authorities and used to eavesdrop on mobile and fixed telephone conversations by Greek citizens in Greece."
"This has been confirmed in a report produced by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Bari (Italy) and quoted by the newspaper."
"It emerges that the network was set up without any court order having been issued by the Greek authorities, while senior Greek police and fraud squad officers indicate that they were tipped off once the network had already been set up by Italian functionaries."
"Will the Commission request information from the Italian and Greek authorities on this matter?"
"Does it know whether any form of complaint has been registered to date by the Greek authorities at the eavesdropping by the Italian authorities on Greek citizens without a court order?"
"Is it admissible, in the absence of a court order by a Member State, for telephone conversations by citizens of that Member State to be monitored by the authorities of another Member State?"
". The Commission has not been informed of any deposition by the Greek authorities concerning any of the facts mentioned by the honourable Member."
"Since phone taps always require an assessment of the proportionality of the potential infringement of fundamental rights in relation to the public interest served by such measures, permitting phone taps as a means of conducting criminal investigations are in most cases subject to a court warrant."
"When the competent authorities of one Member State in the course of criminal investigations in their own country need to carry out taps on phones or telecommunication services located in another Member State they must follow the procedures that have been put in place for that purpose."
"The European Commission obviously does not have the means to judge the behaviour of independent judicial authorities."
"The main European instrument providing for this situation is the 2000 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union."
"Until such time as this Convention enters into force, Member States can have recourse to the 1959 Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and to Council of Europe Recommendation (85)10 concerning letters rogatory for the interception of telecommunications."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome you but you surprise me."
"It is incomprehensible that the Commission should avoid commenting on a serious infringement of the basic rules of data protection."
"We have had telephone tapping in Greece of Greek citizens by the Italian authorities in the absence of any Greek authorities."
"Commissioner, a few weeks ago you were a minister in the Italian Government."
"Why can you not pick up the telephone and ask both the Italian and the Greek Government what happened?"
". I would like to apologise to Mr Papadimoulis, but I can only repeat that the Commission has not received any information about this case."
"At any rate, the Commission does not have the legal right to rule on a breach which, if committed, would have been committed by an independent judicial authority and not by a governmental authority of a Member State."
"There are legal instruments available, which I pointed out: in particular, Council of Europe recommendations and the Council of Europe’s Convention on Mutual Assistance."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, I think there has been another mistake here or something has escaped you."
"Last December, the and newspapers reported extensively on telephone tapping; they even had special diagrams of a device which perpetrates this crime, in or out of inverted commas. This device exists somewhere in Milan or southern Italy."
"I wonder, therefore, how is it that you too have not yet found out about it, so that you can make the relevant observations today."
". Of course, what Mr Mavrommatis said is correct."
"The Italian newspapers have reported certain facts; nevertheless the Commission can and must remain within the scope of its legal powers, which do not include the power to subject the behaviour of judicial authorities to investigations or actions."
"There are instruments, including within the national states, which allow a judge who has carried out an illegal activity to be prosecuted, but that clearly cannot happen at the request of the Commission."
"Commissioner, regardless of the facts of this case, when you next meet the justice ministers, will you make it clear to them that, under the various international conventions you mention and in the spirit of membership of the European Union, it is unacceptable for the authorities of one Member State – be they political or judicial – to carry out phone tapping in another Member State, without the express approval of that Member State?"
". Mr Martin, you are absolutely correct and this is certainly the right path to take."
"As you are probably aware, in Italy it falls on the one hand to the Minister for Justice and, on the other, to the judiciary’s self-governing body to take action against judges who commit illegal acts."
"I have naturally passed this request on to the Italian Minister for Justice."
"What is the Commission's view on reactions to the Commission's annual report on Migration (July 2004), including the view of experts such as SOLIDAR (Katrin Hugendubel) and the Social Platform of NGOs that it is difficult to establish 'best practice' on integration policy when the contexts of each EU Member State are so different?"
". It is certainly true that there are different approaches to integration represented in the Member States."
"Concept and practice varies due to a number of factors: different immigration histories and variations in the roles of government and civil society with respect to integration policies are just two examples."
"The Commission consistently stressed that integration policy was by definition an area where subsidiarity is at stake."
"On the other hand, all Member States adhere to human rights standards and shared values such as equality anti-discrimination, solidarity, tolerance, etc.."
"Through the ongoing exchange of information and experience, particularly through the work of national contact points for integration, we are now seeing a certain degree of convergence with respect to policy approaches, goals and targets."
"This was confirmed in December with the adoption by the Council of common basic principles on integration."
"The publication by the Commission in November 2004 of a handbook on integration for policy makers and practitioners, which brings together examples of good practice from throughout the Union on introduction programmes, civic participation and integration indicators, illustrates that there are many common problems and shows how much we can learn from each other."
"Best practice must be taken for what it is: ideas, lessons to be learned and suggestions which can inspire and inform policy makers in the definition of the policies required."
"I thank the Commissioner for that clear answer."
"I know from the previous debate that you take the issue of integration seriously."
"The Commission has a real impact on integration policy and a direct role, for example, in the enforcement of existing directives, which are crucial to integration – I refer explicitly to the Employment Directive and the Race Equality Directive."
"The Commission has played a strong role in trying to enforce these directives."
"They remain unimplemented in at least two Member States that I am aware of."
"Will you use your powers in office to enforce such directives, which play such an important part in the integration process?"
"You have that power."
". Yes, of course the Commission has such power, and I can reassure you that the Commission will use all its power to guarantee, stimulate and encourage Member States to fully implement all directives in the common European interest."
"Commissioner, I shall speak in your mother tongue in order to be forthright with regard to an old question: illegal immigration."
"The landings of illegal immigrants will certainly not wait for us to come up with a common strategy before they resume in the Mediterranean."
"Certainly, the only reason they are not continuing at the moment as well is because the poor wretches are lying on the seabed."
"So I would like to ask, what is the Commission doing and what has been planned for the near future to help countries on the borders of the European Union – I am referring in particular to my country, Malta – in order to provide aid and to receive illegal immigrants in a proper manner?"
"What level of funding will be allocated for this?"
". The question of illegal immigration is one which the Commission considers to be a priority."
"While we are preparing political actions and common European solutions, as you pointed out, we must also address the daily tragedy of desperate people."
"The Commission can and must take action, and it will, in order to ensure that the fundamental rights of persons entering European territory are respected, obviously including those who enter illegally: the right to respect for human life and dignity is not a question of legal differences."
"Having said that, we must speed up the strategic policies."
"We cannot take advantage of a delay and thereby continue to allow an illegal influx, but we must immediately respect the fundamental rights of individuals and at the same time prepare common policies on reception, on the one hand, and the prevention of illegal activities, on the other."
"In the Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on the fight against terrorism, the Member States were required to pass legislation in a number of areas related to combating terrorism, with a view to establishing common definitions in the face of the threats in question."
"Article 11 of this framework decision called on the Commission and Council to make an assessment by the end of 2003 of the forms of implementation by the Member States of specific anti-terrorism measures."
"These texts were finally submitted by the Commission (8 June 2004 – COM(2004)0409/final) and the Council (12 October 2004 – 11687/2/04/rev.2)."
"Both reports stress, in clear and objective fashion, the passivity of the Member States and their failure to comply with the objectives set out in the Council framework decision."
"The Commission does not possess binding legal instruments to oblige the Member States to comply with framework decisions."
"Despite this and with a view to ensuring the EU's credibility in the fight against terrorism, can the Commission state how it intends to promote and obtain a genuine anti-terrorist policy at Union level and ensure that the Member States act on their promises regarding legislative action?"
". According to Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union, framework decisions are binding upon the Member States as to the result to be achieved but leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods."
"However, framework decisions 'shall not entail direct effect'."
"Whereas, within the first pillar, the Commission has the authority to initiate an infringement procedure against a Member State, this possibility does not exist within the Treaty on European Union."
"The situation described by the honourable Member certainly does not facilitate the Commission's role, but it does not prevent it from producing a broad range of policy initiatives, which have been the basis for the policy definition of the Union in the important area of the fight against terrorism."
"The Commission has been playing this role very actively in establishing in June 2004 the revised action plan on combating terrorism, in updating it in December 2004 and in implementing more than half of the respective measures."
"This is also evident from the submission, in October 2004, of four communications covering different aspects of the prevention, preparedness and response to terrorist attacks and from the adoption, in the same year, of a communication on mutual access to data relevant to the fight against terrorism and of several classified documents in the field of consequence management and the protection of critical infrastructures."
"The Commission in general and President Barroso and I in particular are determined to work in close cooperation with Council presidencies to maintain the fight against terrorism."
"This is very high on the agenda of the Council, including that of the JHA Council and the European Council comprising the Heads of State and Government."
"I am well aware of the legal framework in which the European anti-terrorism policy can operate as far as the Commission is concerned and you described it very well."
"If, however, we do not wish to demonstrate collective hypocrisy, we need to say how things stand. And the way they stand is that we have major conferences, with all the Heads of Government present, and afterwards they have a press conference, set out a decision and following this decision nothing happens."
"The Commission itself admitted as much on 8 June 2004."
"The question is, therefore: what is the Commission going to do in political terms to put the policy into practice?"
". The Commission will begin to set out the action plan for the implementation of the Hague Programme at the informal meeting of the Ministers for Internal Affairs and for Justice at the end of the month."
"The action plan will be presented in May this year and I hope that it will be adopted by the European Council in June."
"The action plan on combating terrorism will contain tangible measures and guidelines, precise deadlines for the Member States and binding obligations for a common policy to enhance cooperation, information exchange and protection for the victims of terrorist attacks."
"These are the measures that the Commission initially intends to put before Parliament, something which we shall do at the beginning of February, that is, well before we draw up our proposal, and we shall then listen to Parliament’s opinion on the concrete proposals."
"What progress is the Commission making towards proposing a standardised set of criteria for the reporting of crimes and collection of statistics about crimes across the European Union?"
"Until such a system is established, it is difficult for law enforcement officers to have a clear picture of the extent of organised criminal activity, and it is therefore very difficult to counter the gangs effectively."
". The Commission agrees that the absence of comparable crime statistics makes the development of an effective EU law enforcement policy more difficult."
"The Commission is working on a draft action plan on EU crime statistics."
"Member State crime statistics experts are being consulted on this draft action plan, which will be presented in the form of a Commission communication in the spring of 2005."
"The two main blocks of the draft action plan are: first, the setting up of appropriate coordination machinery to ensure that Member States, the Commission and other key actors are part of the process of working towards common data-gathering methods and harmonised definition; the second element concerns the implementation of developing comparable statistics."
"This will include many different components, to be developed over a period of time, such as definitions of crime types and an inventory of definitions where there is already EU-level agreement."
"The Commission, in close cooperation with Europol and other providers and users of EU crime statistics, is developing this project on a step-by-step basis in accordance with Member States' ability to provide relevant data."
"The Commission's draft action plan was discussed with European directors of social statistics in September 2004."
"It was agreed to set up a task force to examine appropriate statistical methods for monitoring crime."
"This task force will begin its work in May 2005."
"I should also mention that the Commission is providing support for work being undertaken to measure statistically the quality and effectiveness of the judicial process."
"A seminar on this subject, co-financed by the EU's AGIS Programme, was hosted by the Italian Ministry of Justice in Rome in October 2004."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for staying to answer the question."
"I am very grateful that you recognise the urgency of this problem because with open borders across the Union, organised crime is free to operate and to prosper, while our police forces are national and cannot cross the frontiers."
"So we have a real problem."
"I am glad that you are treating this with considerable urgency."
"Could you tell us who will be responsible for the coordinating machinery?"
"Will this be done by Europol or will it be done by the Commission – or maybe a new agency?"
". I do not think that we can or should create new bodies;"
"I think that on the one hand the Commission should give strategic, or rather political direction to this sector and, on the other hand, the sector should have the chance to find different ways to use Europol, which as we all know is trying to extend its duties and its remit."
"The Commission intends to encourage this progression, this expansion of Europol’s duties."
"This is undoubtedly one of the sectors where work can be done."
"Madam President, I would like to make a few remarks: some of my fellow Members, like myself, have been here since the start of the sitting, have submitted written questions and have not had the opportunity of receiving a reply in the Chamber which they could then counter with a further question, whether they were satisfied or not."
"The Bureau and the legal departments should better consider the matter of Question Time and give proper thought as to the time allotted and how many questions can be answered in that time, because we cannot oblige a Member to stay in the Chamber all this time and then not have the satisfaction of receiving an immediate, direct reply from the competent Commissioner."
"The situation deserves to be looked into by Parliament’s administration. It is absolutely intolerable for a situation of this kind to arise."
"Mrs Sbarbati, the Rules of Procedure lay down quite clear rules for the holding of Question Time."
"A great many Members asked to speak on a certain topic earlier, and I could not give the floor to everyone."
"In my opinion, the main problem is that many Members spend a long time asking supplementary questions, and do not abide by the 30-second time limit, which of course means that we are often delayed."
"I will, however, bear your comments in mind."
"I should like to extend my sincere thanks to everyone, and especially to Commissioner Frattini again for being prepared to remain so long in the Chamber with us for Question Time."
"Questions Nos 46 to 76 will be answered in writing."
"Mr President, I rise to ask a question under Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure."
"We saw this House spied on in a disgraceful manner during the last election period, and it appears that this is already happening again, in that I heard yesterday that at least one attendance list from December 2004 was given – I stress given – to a Member in order that he might make a copy of it."
"There are two questions I would like to ask about this."
"Firstly, is there any basis in fact for what I have been told?"
"Secondly, if there is, is there any basis in law for this being done?"
"I am not sure whether this is exactly a point of order, but, in any event, I can reply by saying that the Bureau has already looked into this issue, which has been communicated to the legal services, and we are awaiting a report from those services so that we can act accordingly."
"The next item is the Council Statement on the programme of the Luxembourg Presidency."
"The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, has the floor, and I would like once again to express Parliament’s sadness at the death of her Royal Highness, the Grand Duchess Josephine-Charlotte of Luxembourg, Princess of Belgium."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must say, it is always a pleasure to come to Strasbourg, the very embodiment of the European city, a city that symbolises the reconciliation between France and Germany, a meeting point for so many European ambitions and an intersection of so many continental dreams."
"In addition to my pleasure at being here, I have the honour today to present to Parliament – the elected representatives of the peoples of Europe – the priorities for the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Union."
"The Luxembourg Presidency follows that of our Dutch friends."
"I must pay heartfelt tribute to their hard work, their tenacity and their undeniable successes."
"The EU made significant progress under the Dutch Presidency."
"When it comes to an end, I hope to be able to say the same of the eleventh Luxembourg Presidency, which began a few days ago."
"The experience of our previous presidencies might indeed prove to be valuable, but presidencies come and go and have different characteristics."
"When I was President of the Council of Ministers for the first time, in 1985, there were ten Members of the European Communities; when I was President in 1991, there were 12 ministers around the table; when I took over the Presidency in 1997, there were fifteen of us, and now there are 25 Member States."
"In 20 years the number of Member States has more than doubled."
"The decision-making system has naturally become more complicated."
"What a joy and a pleasure, however, to see the countries of Eastern and Central Europe take their place in the EU, in view of the fateful decree that sought to drive a wedge between us for ever."
"The experience of our various presidencies and of observing the successive presidencies of other countries has taught me two things."
"Firstly, the EU will not genuinely move forward if those holding the Presidency place their own national interests at the heart of their concerns rather than replacing them with the common interest, the best definition of the interests of everyone."
"It follows that the EU will not find genuine coherence, let alone harmony, unless we all respect the spirit and the letter of the Community method and the balance between the three institutions."
"The Commission is not a touch judge solely in charge of monitoring compliance with the rules of the internal market."
"It should be the playmaker, the inspiration and the driving force of the team."
"The Council, for its part, is not the field of play of exclusively national interests, however justified those may be, but rather a workshop of understanding."
"The place of Parliament, for its part, is not that of a spectator watching from the stands."
"It is an actor with privileged status because it is legitimised by universal suffrage."
"You will, therefore, see me regularly in your offices, in your meetings and in your corridors in Brussels and Strasbourg."
"I say this for myself, for my ministers and for all those who work in the service of Parliament, and thus in your service."
"Together we must oversee the ratification of the new Constitutional Treaty in the right conditions."
"It is true that the draft Constitution is not perfect, but we must not benchmark it against perfection; we must benchmark it against what Europe will need in order to remain an example to the world in the future."
"Let us do now what must be done in order for this to be the case in the future and let us ratify the Treaty."
"Let us not forget that the Treaty is a text that is of neither the left nor the right."
"Its content will be the fruit of our convictions, of our will and of our ambition."
"If our will and our ambition are perfect, the implementation of the new Treaty, which may be imperfect in theory, will probably be perfectly successful in practice."
"The ratification of the Treaty will not be an easy task everywhere, and I have one major concern in this regard: let us not use the potential difficulties of the parliamentary ratifications and referendums as an excuse to slacken the pace of action or to avoid making decisions."
"Let us not put off the most difficult decisions until the day after the first referendum, then until the day after the second referendum, then until the day after the third referendum, and so on. When we ask for the approval of the peoples and the parliaments of Europe, let us show them that Europe works, that Europe is on the move, that Europe is decisive and that Europe is capable of fulfilling its responsibilities."
"If the EU takes decisive action it can win over the doubters; if it is inactive it can put doubts in the minds of those previously convinced."
"Mr President, when the new Presidency takes up its duties there is usually a solemn atmosphere, but that has been overshadowed this year by the terrible tragedy of the seaquake in South-east Asia."
"The deeply distressing pictures of the dead, the injured and the devastation cast a giant shadow over the end of 2004 and the beginning of 2005."
"This tragedy will linger long in the memory and I hope that, in addition to the immediate emergency aid, we shall show lasting solidarity with the devastated peoples and regions of Asia."
"I should also like us to ensure that the misery that we are seeing in Asia today does not make us turn our backs on the poverty, the underdevelopment, the hunger and the death of innocent people elsewhere."
"Our hearts should be in places where the television cameras are no longer or have never been."
"Mr President, the European security strategy encourages us to promote peace, democracy and stability in the fight against the root causes of insecurity in the world."
"It is absolutely crucial that, in a coherent and coordinated fashion, we use the entire range of EU instruments in the Western Balkans, in the Middle East, in our relations with Russia and Ukraine and in our transatlantic relations."
"The future of the Balkans, a region still traumatised by its recent past, must form part of Europe’s outlook."
"The opening of accession negotiations with Croatia in March 2005, provided that there has been confirmation of complete cooperation with the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, will demonstrate to all Balkan countries that their efforts towards democracy will be rewarded and might bear more fruit."
"For the other countries in the region, the EU’s general action framework will continue to fall under the guidelines of the Thessaloniki Agenda, which sets out the European perspective presented to the Balkan countries."
"The Presidency will hold talks with Albania on a stabilisation and association agreement."
"A further crucial milestone in the region will be a review in mid-2005 of the implementation of the standards policy in Kosovo."
"We shall be paying close attention to the developing situation in Kosovo."
"I am of the opinion that, whatever its status, Kosovo’s future rests within the EU."
"The Russian Federation is a strategic partner of the EU and remains a major factor in European security and stability."
"Admittedly, the state of our relations is not satisfactory at the moment."
"I shall do all that I can to remedy this state of affairs, whilst remaining firm on our core demands."
"I trust I can count on your support in this endeavour."
"At the EU-Russia Summit in Moscow on 10 May, the Presidency will strive for a balanced package as regards the Four Common Spaces set out at the St Petersburg Summit, which are based on common values and shared interests."
"The EU will forge close ties with the new President of Ukraine, not least in areas such as the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"We have every interest in having a stable and prosperous Ukraine as a neighbour, a Ukraine that is strongly rooted in democracy, a Ukraine that is committed to the path of modernisation."
"The Presidency will prepare thoroughly for the summit between the EU and Ukraine that is due to take place during the United Kingdom Presidency."
"I shall now turn to transatlantic relations."
"For the world to be a stable place, it needs a transatlantic partnership that works."
"At the moment, transatlantic relations are not bad, but nor are they particularly good. Leaving matters as they are, however, is not an option that will satisfy expectations on both sides of the Atlantic."
"Consequently, we must improve the quality of relations in the best interests of both parties."
"We shall do this at the two Summits with President Bush – the first in February, at the US President’s request, and the second in June."
"We shall not focus on the differences of opinion that some of us may have had with the United States in the recent past, but we shall try to put the emphasis on a series of practical questions to which we must give equally practical answers."
"Transatlantic relations would not be complete without Canada, and I am delighted that there is to be a summit with Canada during my Presidency, in which we shall be discussing matters of shared importance between friends."
"The same applies, on the other side of the world, to our Japanese friends."
"At this point, Mr President, I should like to say a word about the Middle East."
"With the election of President Abbas on 9 January as head of the Palestinian Authority, and with the prospect of the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, a window of opportunity has opened up to relaunch the peace process and to speed up the implementation of the road map."
"That opportunity must now be seized."
"Against this backdrop, I should like to offer my support to the Middle East conference due to take place in London in March 2005."
"This, I am sure, will represent an essential step towards consolidating the peace process."
"Under the Luxembourg Presidency, the process of EU enlargement will be guided by the decisions taken by the European Council of last December."
"We shall be opening accession negotiations with Turkey in March."
"As regards Bulgaria and Romania, I hope that Parliament will issue its assent in April on the accession of those two countries, which will enable us to sign accession Treaties, also in April."
"Mr President, we cannot bring the EU closer to its citizens if we remain incapable of meeting their justifiable expectations as regards internal security."
"The new Constitutional Treaty paves the way towards definitively abolishing the ‘Justice and Home Affairs exception’, in other words the complete integration of this field into the European Project by means of the rigorous application of the Community method."
"Under our Presidency, justice and home affairs activities will be in line with this perspective, and our working basis will fall within the framework of the excellent Hague Programme, adopted by the Council in November of last year."
"In order to ensure that the area of freedom, security and justice becomes a reality, we must think European before we think national."
"We must ensure that a European security culture is developed."
"This is a particularly important requirement as regards the fight against serious and organised crime."
"Driving forward the area of freedom, security and justice is in our view an essential, even existential, task."
"We must first, however, optimise operational cooperation between the Member States; for example, we must ensure that information can be exchanged quickly and smoothly between Member States’ police forces and judiciaries."
"This principle of availability will constitute a major step forward in cooperation between police forces and the Presidency will set about this task at the earliest opportunity."
"We also wish to strengthen the European judicial area, which is based on both mutual recognition and the approximation of laws."
"We shall ensure, in particular, that negotiations are driven forward on the European evidence warrant and on the possible establishment of a European criminal record."
"This will make European security stronger and will not be to the detriment of public freedoms, nor must it be, since those freedoms form part of the European way of coexistence."
"The fight against terrorism must be a permanent priority."
"In this regard, I wish to salute the Spanish initiative to host a meeting of the Heads of State or Government in Madrid in March."
"The Presidency, for its part, will place particular emphasis on combating the financing of terrorism."
"As far as the strand of asylum and immigration is concerned, the Presidency will focus on three elements: strengthening partnerships with countries of origin and of transit; establishing a harmonised approach with regard to the policy of return and readmission; and the European Agency for the management of operational cooperation at the external borders begins its duties on 1 May."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we often refer – and rightly so – to the Europe of the citizens."
"Let us not be under any illusions."
"If we do not succeed in making the EU an area of work and well-being for all, the citizens will become alienated from Europe, from its Union and from the political project that underpins it."
"In order to stave off that risk and to give Europe back its economic and social place, we launched the Lisbon Strategy almost five years ago."
"We wanted – and we still want – to make the EU the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustained economic growth, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion, and one that respects the environment and natural resources."
"After five years of qualified success, the time has come for a mid-term review, which we shall draw up for the spring European Council."
"The first task will be to clarify the aim of the strategy that we are to pursue."
"The Lisbon Strategy – a name that, to my mind, means absolutely nothing to most people – is in fact a strategy for competitiveness, growth, social cohesion and the protection of the environment."
"It should be based on solid foundations of sustainable well-being for Europeans. We must act now in order, in the future, to guarantee access for all to the European social model, which must not be turned into a myth, but should remain, or rather, should return to being, a living reality for all."
"If we want to keep the European social model intact, it must be reformed so that it can provide a response to the growth crisis, to under-employment, to the weakening of the fabric of society, to the loss of competitiveness and productivity, to the falling birth-rate and to the ageing of our populations."
"Naturally, Europeans do not like reforms; they are scared by them and do not understand the reasons behind them."
"We must explain to them that the reforms that we are proposing are intended to guarantee the survival and the viability of the European social model."
"We must convince them that putting off those reforms would prove more expensive."
"We must prove to them that we are right to act and would be wrong to do nothing."
"The bottom line is that we need to reinvigorate Europe."
"The next step, when we draw up the mid-term review, is to keep together the three pillars of the Strategy – the economic, the social and the environmental."
"I am well aware that Europe has a competitiveness problem, which largely explains its mediocre performance in terms of growth and jobs."
"Of course competitiveness must be stepped up."
"It is not, however, an end in itself, nor some neutral, self-sufficient benefit."
"No, the competitiveness that we must seek should provide us with stronger and more sustainable growth and should be aimed at greater social cohesion and a more harmoniously-balanced environment."
"Please let us not start a foolish and pointless debate over whether we should have more competitiveness and thus less social cohesion, or more social, and less environmental, cohesion."
"If Europe wishes to be strong, it needs three things, and those three things go together: greater competitiveness, greater social cohesion and a better-balanced natural environment."
"I say yes to competitiveness; I say no to giving up our social and ecological ambitions."
"I say yes, for example, to opening up service markets, but I say no to social dumping, an element that some people would like to promote."
"The bottom line, Mr President, is that we must find the right way of ensuring that the strategy is successful."
"After five years of charting a rudderless course between success and failure, it is not so much a matter of knowing what we must do – because after all we do know – it is more a matter of knowing how we are to go about it."
"It is essential that we make the European learning area a reality, step up the research effort, improve our education systems and foster lifelong learning."
"This is what we must do, but how do we go about it?"
"We have far too many processes in Europe."
"We have the broad economic policy guidelines, the employment guidelines, the sustainable development strategy, the internal market strategy, the small and medium-sized business charter, the Cologne process, the Cardiff process, and many others. All too often, these processes become bogged down in bureaucratic procedures that lead nowhere."
"The EU is more like a research unit – a unit of unused research, at that – than a factory of ideas that are practical and are put into practice."
"We must change this by streamlining our strategy."
"Our strategy is essentially European, but its implementation must first be national."
"We should like this strategy to remain essentially European."
"It must be subject to a broad review every two years, or preferably every three years."
"We cannot change strategy every six months, from Council to Council, according to the whims of the presidencies and to what is inspiring them at the time."
"The strategy must be there for the long haul."
"We should like implementation at national level to be speeded up and stepped up."
"We are proposing that Member States should set up action programmes at national level. These should be designed in conjunction with the social partners and must be presented to national parliaments, which, along with the Community bodies, would monitor their implementation."
"These national programmes would take account of the particular national and regional characteristics and should provide the possibility for assessing the pace and intensity of the respective national reforms separately and should make it easier to gauge the level of performance achieved up to a given point."
"So much for the strategy and the way in which it is to be implemented."
"We shall discuss this matter again together, Parliament, the Council and both of us with the Commission, which will soon present its summary report to us."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the partial reorientation of the Lisbon Strategy also invites us to reflect on the Growth and Stability Pact."
"I beg your pardon, the Stability and Growth Pact!"
"Actually, I would have preferred it the other way round."
"Yet as Europe was governed in 1996 by our old friends – and not the ones you would think! – the second order was the one that was kept."
"We began a review of the Pact under the Dutch Presidency and we should like to conclude it under the Luxembourg Presidency."
"We are going to reform the Pact, or rather, to adjust its implementing measures."
"Let me explain this by first detailing what we are not going to do."
"Economic and Monetary Union needs stability."
"We therefore have no intention of driving stability away, neither in what we say nor in what we do."
"Stability is a founding element of the pact that forms the basis of the euro."
"We promised a stable currency."
"It will remain stable and it will remain strong."
"It follows – let me say right away – that the Presidency will not propose to neutralise or immunise certain categories of budgetary spending applicable under the Pact."
"It follows that the basic criteria – 3% for the deficit, 60% for the debt – will remain applicable."
"It is clear to me, however, that changes must be made, not least in order that the Pact can take better account of the economic cycle."
"During times of strong economic growth, Member States in the euro zone must, as a matter of priority, be required to allocate budget surpluses to reducing the debt and the deficit."
"We shall enrich the preventative element of the Pact by means of a strong dose of extra stability."
"During times of weak growth, on the other hand, Member States in the euro zone should be given more reactive room for manoeuvre as regards the budget."
"The greater the efforts to reduce the deficit and the debt during periods of economic expansion, the wider that room for manoeuvre."
"If, during periods of weak growth, a Member State incurs an excessive deficit, this situation and the consequences arising from it, not least in terms of the timing of correction, will be judged by means of objective measures of assessment."
"We must avoid at all costs arbitrary political judgments that might lead to differing assessments based on the size of the country."
"From this perspective, Luxembourg is always the loser."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, we shall have a proper debate when the time comes, in committee, without too many witnesses, on the comparison that could be made between France, Germany and Luxembourg as regards taxation."
"It is a debate that will be interesting and informative for those who, I must say, view Luxembourg in a somewhat superficial manner."
"Let me invite you to a calm debate about the Pact."
"I am wary of extreme solutions."
"I say no to those who seek to replace stability with brazen, unbridled flexibility, as well as to those who seek to set the Pact, as it is now, in the cement of dogma."
"We need greater stability and greater flexibility to take account of the economic cycle."
"Mr President, you would no doubt be surprised if I failed to mention the debate that we are to hold on the financial perspectives."
"In front of you, I would not wish to detail the component parts of this – it must be said – difficult dossier, because your grasp of them is better than mine."
"I shall simply say that the Luxembourg Presidency will do all that it can to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives before the end of June."
"I am not under any illusions, however."
"The Member States are currently entrenched in their positions and it will be difficult to move them from those positions in time, by which I mean now!"
"If we do not reach an agreement on a common position under the Luxembourg Presidency, by 1 January 2007, it will be politically, legislatively and technically impossible to meet the challenge of the enlarged EU."
"Consequently, no institution or Member State will have any interest in playing extra time."
"The absence of an agreement in June will not be the Presidency’s failure, which is only of very minor interest to me, but Europe’s failure."
"Let us decide."
"Let us decide quickly. Let us decide now."
"We must spare Europe a long, drawn-out debate lasting 18 months or even more."
"That would cause even more disputes and exacerbate the conflicts between the Member States and the institutions."
"Mr President, I am relying on Parliament to drive forward the decision-making process on the financial perspectives."
"We shall work with you, because your agreement is necessary."
"You will not be handed a , I guarantee you that."
"That, Mr President, is the thrust of our programme."
"Presidencies come and go, but fortunately Europe remains."
"We want to serve Europe with determination and passion, with the determination and the passion that long distances and grand ambitions require."
"Given the applause you have received, we can expect the Luxembourg Presidency to be very positive."
"That is what Parliament wants to see."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the half-year that has just begun will feature a series of important landmarks that will determine whether the EU will be able to meet the objective of achieving a higher level of prosperity, solidarity and security for the citizens."
"Much of what the Commission may accomplish during the coming years will be determined by the initial decisions taken during this term and by our capacity to resolve difficult questions and to achieve practical results."
"I should therefore like to highlight, from the Commission’s perspective, the particular importance of this Luxembourg Presidency in this first half-year of 2005."
"Accordingly, the Commission will table the programme for the period 2004-2009 as early as 26 January."
"We hope that the other institutions can agree to this programme so that it can become not just part of the Commission's programme, but part of the programme for the entire Union, thus anticipating the provisions of the European Constitution, and we can then begin right away to work within the spirit of the Constitution."
"Luxembourg has the responsibility of chairing the Council during this crucial period."
"I feel that it is a privilege for us to have Prime Minister Juncker as President of the Council during this period, given his invaluable experience as Head of Government, his deeply-held European conviction and his well-known ability to resolve tricky situations."
"From a personal point of view, it is a pleasure for me to work with my friend Jean-Claude Juncker."
"Mr President, we have heard from the Presidency about its expectations and priorities."
"Let me comment briefly on just three of the main issues that will be on the agenda of the Luxembourg Presidency; there are many others, but I wish to concentrate on three."
"The first is the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Europe is facing very important challenges, most of which were already identified at Lisbon 2000."
"But we could say today that the challenges from globalisation and the ageing of the population make even clearer the need to adapt to increasingly difficult situations."
"Europe's prosperity is under threat."
"To tackle this threat we need more growth and more jobs."
"If we continue on the path of low, diminishing economic growth, we put all our policies at risk, but in particular our capacity to ensure solidarity and security and to preserve and improve the European model."
"As outlined in the Kok report, to be more effective the Lisbon priorities need to be refocused, streamlined and prioritised."
"Too many priorities means no priority at all."
"Growth and jobs must be our priorities."
"The Commission is working on a report which will present its views on the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and propose guidelines for future action."
"At this point in the preparation of this report, two elements strike me as particularly consensual."
"The first is the knowledge economy."
"Returning to growth will require considerable investment in knowledge."
"Companies cannot become more competitive without a better-prepared labour force."
"Only well-trained people can ensure high productivity."
"This requires unprecedented effort in the areas of research, development, education and training."
"Particular effort will be required to involve young people in this investment for knowledge."
"Higher productivity should lead to higher growth, which, in turn, would create more jobs."
"I do not see knowledge purely as an instrument for other objectives: knowledge in itself is an important goal and a vehicle for self-realisation."
"The second consensual point I can underline at this stage is about coherence in implementation, the delivery problem."
"The coherence between national actions and European action is a critical factor for success."
"This means better implementation of the objectives agreed in common, which, in turn, means more responsibility and more empowerment at national level to deliver the common objectives."
"In this vein, the Commission report will also highlight clearly the importance of ensuring ownership of the revised Lisbon Strategy by the Member States."
"All in all, I must stress that the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy is, first, an agenda for modernisation."
"Whether we will succeed depends on our ability to establish an effective partnership between our institutions and citizens to deliver this reform."
"I should now like to present to you our view of the financial perspectives."
"The Luxembourg Presidency has rightly decided to put everything into striving to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives before the end of June 2005."
"It is right to do so, because failure to reach an agreement in time will lead to significant difficulties for the preparation of the programmes concerned."
"It strikes me as important, however – at a time when a final negotiation might get underway – to point out certain salient facts."
"We cannot have more Europe with fewer financial resources."
"The Commission’s proposal has not fallen out of the sky; it is the result of commitments agreed by the EU during the European Councils."
"Nowadays, the Commission does not ask that the Union be granted funding for new projects, but usually that it be granted funding for commitments already made;"
"Member States must honour the commitments that they have already made."
"I should like, if I may, to point out certain issues on which I feel that the Union must not compromise."
"The first of these is cohesion. Ladies and gentlemen, without solidarity there is no Union."
"There might be something else, but not a Union."
"Enlargement has had a far-reaching impact on solidarity."
"The Union has new regions lagging behind in development, and some of the less prosperous old regions still need support."
"Financial solidarity is therefore all the more necessary given that regions lagging behind in development have the greatest scope for growth in competitiveness and job creation."
"We must not disappoint the new EU Members, which have the right to active solidarity from the entire Union."
"Secondly, we must not forget the question of competitiveness."
"With regard to the Lisbon Strategy, I said that massive investment in research and education was essential."
"Indeed, European level expenditure very often brings more reward than national level expenditure without coherence."
"I should also add trans-European networks to the list of priorities, given that the infrastructure that connects Europe is still in decline."
"The third crucial aspect of the financial perspectives is that of security."
"The action programme agreed at the European Council has major financial implications."
"The programme known as the ‘Hague Programme’ has financial implications."
"This means more action at European level so that the financial burden and collective security can be shared better among the Member States."
"The citizens of Europe expect us to have the ability to work together."
"One Member State on its own, even the most powerful, cannot guarantee the best possible security if it does not form part of a joint, European-level effort."
"The bottom line is that we cannot have more Europe with less money."
"I hear people from time to time calling for a freeze on Community budgets below the level of the 2006 budget."
"Let us be clear on this matter: that would be a Europe that reneges on its commitments."
"I wish to state clearly that the Commission would wish to have nothing to do with a Europe of backtracking, a Europe of mediocrity, a Europe of reduced aims."
"This is why I am delighted that the Luxembourg Presidency will do everything in its power to reach a compromise agreement this term."
"Some people will say that this will be difficult, even unlikely."
"I honestly believe that the longer we leave this, the more difficult it will be."
"We therefore support the Luxembourg Presidency in this difficult, yet extremely important, task."
"As for the Stability and Growth Pact, we welcome the fact that one of the Luxembourg Presidency’s priorities is to ensure that multilateral budgetary monitoring will make a greater contribution to a strong, healthy and successful economic and monetary Union."
"These principles underpin the Stability and Growth Pact and this Pact must be respected and must function properly."
"Let us not forget that the single currency is one of Europe’s great achievements."
"I remember before the euro came into force, certain experts, economists and professors, particularly on the other side of the Atlantic, were saying that Europe would never be able to have a strong currency because of its lack of solidarity and political cohesion."
"Nowadays, some are saying that our currency might be too strong, but not too weak."
"The single currency is therefore an historic European success story."
"We must not now jeopardise that great success."
"At the end of 2003, the Commission initiated a reflection process on the experience that has been gained, in order to identify possible changes and improvements that might help us to implement the Pact more efficiently."
"Convinced that the common interest commands that everybody comply with every rule, the Commission has been in contact with the various European bodies responsible for thinking together and for exploring together the most promising avenues, such as those tabled in our Communication of September 2004."
"The Presidency’s contribution will be instrumental in engendering a consensus of opinion."
"We are already expecting such a consensus at the Ecofin Council on 18 January."
"The Commission will thus be able to put forward practical proposals to improve the implementation of the Pact and this in time for the discussions at the European Council in March."
"In the next six months, the ability of the European Union to return to growth will be put to the test."
"It will have to provide the financial means necessary to match its political choices."
"It must work closer to citizens and regain their trust."
"It must strengthen its role on the international scene and relaunch its strategic partnerships."
"There is now a special opportunity for relaunching the Middle East peace process."
"The European Union can and should give a greater contribution in this field."
"I believe that the European Union will play a stronger role on the international scene."
"The Commission strongly supports the efforts of the Luxembourg presidency on this path."
"The Commission believes that this period is critical and that our institutions will need to work together even more closely to achieve results."
". Mr President, Mr President of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome to the House today the Presidents of the European Council and of the Commission, and I gather that the President of the European Council will also be present when the Commission unveils its programme in Brussels on 26 January."
"I see that as a splendid symbol for the ever-growing cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"Future presidencies should take that as an example to follow."
"Although we were very pleased to see the President of the Commission and the President of the Council in Asia, visiting Jakarta as an expression of the European Union’s solidarity, I would like to emphasise that, however necessary solidarity with the stricken areas might be, we must not overlook the great problems in Africa and in other parts of the world."
"We have to consider how we can, in so far as we are able, take preventive measures, in the shape of an early warning system, in Europe too, for example in the Mediterranean."
"We are very much behind you, Mr President of the Council, in what you had to say about the Community method."
"Luxembourg may well be small in geographical terms, but it is a Grand Duchy and hence a great country, and the Benelux states’ presidencies have always been excellent ones."
"We wish you great success; for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats too, the Constitution is of the utmost priority."
"In Brussels, we will have in-depth discussions on the Lisbon strategy, even though making the European economy competitive is not an end in itself, for the fact is that a strong economy is the best guarantee of good social policy."
"We see competitiveness as being about creating more jobs in Europe by way of growth and better conditions for European businesses."
"For us, that is social policy in the true sense of the word."
"Rather than setting ecology and the protection of the environment against the economy, we need a sensible balance between them."
"We also wish you and your presidency success in handling the financial perspective."
"To those ladies and gentlemen – in this instance, no doubt, only gentlemen – who wrote letters arguing in favour of the 1% limit, we would say that you cannot enlarge Europe and then refuse the EU’s new Member States the money that is an expression of our solidarity, and which they need in order to be brought up to our standards."
"To do that, we in the European Union need the necessary funding to be made available."
"You have mentioned the treaties that are to be signed, but how, in the absence of any agreement by June and of any success in medium-term financial planning, are we to cope with the accession of new states to the European Union?"
"We are very glad that it is Reimer Böge, a very competent member of our group, who will be writing the report for this House."
"You also made reference to the Stability Pact."
"I am very grateful to you for what you said, and I can agree with every word of it."
"What you said boils down, in essence, to the need for more flexibility."
"The thing about flexibility is that it is those states that have made provisions that have more of it."
"To come to the point, then, the less indebted a state is, the more flexible it can be when times are hard for the economy, which also means that we have to do what has to be done to reduce deficits when things are going well for the economy, for we know that today’s debts always end up being tomorrow’s taxes, and a burden on the public as a whole, particularly on the younger generation."
"Let me just say something briefly about foreign policy issues, a number of which you have addressed, and – as I understand it – the President of the Commission is in full agreement with what you said."
"Our support for Ukraine is only just beginning and will have to be an ongoing responsibility."
"If I may turn to Palestine, where elections have just taken place, we want a secure Israel and a secure Palestinian state."
"The European Union’s role must not – contrary to what we are told by not a few high-ranking representatives from the Middle East – be merely a matter of providing financial support, but should involve us, as an honest broker, making our contribution to bringing peace to the Middle East."
"Turning to trans-Atlantic relations, I wish you, and of course the President of the Commission, great success with President Bush’s visit, which will usher in a new era of good relations with the United States of America."
"We cannot have two groups of states in the European Union, each with its own way of maintaining relations with the USA."
"We Europeans must unite in taking up a position founded upon partnership with our American friends, and so, as you, Mr President of the Council, have said, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, bring determination and passion to supporting you, and wish you great success in your presidency."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the socialists are striving for a Europe of excellence."
"For us, the Lisbon policy constitutes the best route towards European competitiveness, the basis of a good life, indeed a better life, for our citizens."
"That is what is known as social cohesion."
"The EU must stop complaining that Europe is said to be falling behind other regions of the world."
"If Europe were no longer competitive, then how on earth could the Union account for the lion’s share of world trade?"
"In 2003, for example, the Union accounted for 40% of the trade in goods and 45% of the trade in services throughout the world, more than the United States, Japan and China put together."
"Of course some of our industries are suffering from competition from countries in which salaries are low, but we will not make better products by dismantling our social model."
"I should like to address the following remarks to some conservative and liberal Members of this House: protecting the right to work will provide workers with a sense of security and even well-being."
"There is no conflict, but complementarity."
"That is a quote from Mr Biltgen, the chairman of the Luxembourg Christian Social Party, an eminent member of the Group of the European People’s Party ..."
"President Juncker leads a coalition government of the Christian Social Party and the Socialists, which is a benchmark by which to reinvigorate the Union on the basis of broad political consensus."
"The European Socialists have high hopes for this Luxembourg Presidency, primarily from the point of view of relaunching the Lisbon Strategy and of turning it into a genuine instrument of progress, particularly at the level of the 25."
"To this end, the macroeconomic framework must be redirected towards a policy of growth and stability."
"Stability is a public good that must be defended in the interests of our poorest citizens."
"There will never be stability, however, without strong economic growth."
"The Stability and Growth Pact must become an instrument that provides a means of both combating public deficit and fashioning an economic policy in tune with the economic cycles."
"Fiscal discipline is required in times of strong economic growth and more flexibility during periods of recession."
"When it assesses each country’s public finances, the Commission must also assess the quality of spending."
"The practice of borrowing to finance running costs must be banned; borrowing must be confined to investment to prepare for the future."
"There cannot be more Europe with less money."
"A Union of 455 million inhabitants cannot develop with a budget in 2005 limited to 1.004% of Europe’s GNP."
"Relaunching Lisbon, the ‘intelligent’ Stability and Growth Pact, financial perspectives that actually offer new perspectives for Europe: these are the Herculean tasks facing the Luxembourg Presidency."
"At the same time, we ask the Union not to forget the neglected people of the world."
"If the international community is capable of offering debt relief to Iraq of some 80%, and if it wishes to offer debt relief to those countries hit by the tsunami, it must also be capable of cancelling the debt that wipes out any development in developing world countries."
". Mr President, this is the eleventh Luxembourg presidency."
"Mr President-in-Office, your presidency has high standards of its own to live up to and the high expectations of others to meet."
"Simultaneously President-in-Office of the European Council and of the Economic and Finance Council, you are in a unique position from which to reach agreement on one of your biggest and most delicate objectives – the financial perspectives for 2007-2013."
"Liberals and Democrats are pleased to note that in your presidency programme you say that 'all progress towards European construction requires adequate financial resources'."
"We hope you will not be limited by dogmatic demands to cap the Union's budget at 1% for the next decade."
"We are not profligate with European citizens' taxes and we insist that every euro be well spent and properly accounted for."
"Nonetheless, we, too, recognise that the European Union has justifiable ambitions, whether to run a coherent security strategy, generous development policy or an effective policy of regional aid and social cohesion."
"These all have a cost, and we should not limit our political ambitions by penny-pinching over what is, after all, a relatively modest budget."
"I wish you every success in securing agreement in June, for I fear the approach of your successors in this, as in other matters, is unlikely to command a consensus."
"My Group will call upon you to specify new arrangements for the Stability and Growth Pact, which underpins the single currency."
"As 'Mr Euro', it is your right and duty to speak out for the euro and the euro zone."
"If France and Germany are allowed to escape with a mild rebuke for exceeding the deficit limits for several consecutive years, if Greece is absolved from misrepresenting its true fiscal state to gain fast-track entry to the euro, and if Italy continues to be reckless with its budget while harbouring a public debt of over 100%, who will have confidence in those rules?"
"The Stability Pact needs adjusting but it also needs enforcing, with proper monitoring arrangements like those used by the IMF."
"We will look to you and your Council colleagues to be vigilant and true to your commitments."
"Your term in office will coincide with the mid-term review of the much vaunted and little respected Lisbon Agenda."
"It is in serious danger of stalling."
"Your commitment to a relaunch at this halfway mark will bear fruit if you succeed in completing the single market, in finding more funding for research and in promoting a favourable climate for entrepreneurship."
"But do not try to be all things to all people."
"Structural labour market reform is essential to Lisbon."
"Neither should you underestimate the challenge of enforcing existing directives."
"Your proposal to make national governments accountable to their peers, as well as to national parliaments and public opinion, is a good one and the Commission must be entrusted to monitor the measures needed and not be afraid to name and shame the laggards."
"My Group also welcomes your commitment to move to the Community method in matters of justice and home affairs so important to our citizens."
"We also share your ambitions for enlargement."
"New arrivals are on the horizon."
"Bulgaria and Romania will shortly be joining us."
"Croatia is a candidate country with which you must open negotiations. Let us be clear, as regards Croatia, that we expect General Gotovina to hand himself over or be turned over to The Hague to answer the case against him."
"Croatia cannot duck that issue."
"As Mr Poettering said, we cannot ignore the momentous events in Ukraine in the last two months."
"As a collective body of institutions, we must encourage the opening-up of that country and review bilateral relations in the light of new circumstances."
"That is a task for your presidency."
"In conclusion, as the Constitution enters its ratification phase, you may have three referenda on your watch, and you must do all in your power to make sure they succeed."
"If political forces in Spain are allowed to raise the ghost of regional autonomy, if, in France, the debate is muddied by Turkish membership, if, in Britain, EU financing becomes an issue in the Constitutional Treaty debate, the whole thing will come crashing down around Europe's ears."
"Leave those issues where they belong and make sure Europe gets the Constitution it needs."
". – Mr President, today I have just discovered once again that Christian Democrat in one country does not mean the same thing as Christian Democrat in another country, I congratulate you ..."
"The same goes for the Greens, but at the moment, I am addressing the President of the Union and not the President of the European Greens."
"That is the difference, Mr Poettering!"
"You said something very interesting."
"If you are actually setting up a working group with Mr Barroso to look at the Lisbon process, I shall be very interested in taking part, in order to try and have everybody singing from the same hymn-sheet."
"In fact, we agree with you and disagree with Mr Barroso; competitiveness must go hand in hand with sustainable growth, with social solidarity and environmental responsibility."
"Mr Barroso forgot three of these four elements and this is why we need a working group between the Commission and the Council to have everybody singing from the same hymn-sheet."
"We are on your side, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"As regards the financial perspectives, everybody is once again in agreement."
"Paraphrasing Victor Hugo, I should like to tell you that letting stingy countries govern Europe is tantamount to letting a hurricane govern the ocean."
"That is something we do not want."
"It is apparent that when the hurricane governs the ocean, everything collapses."
"If the stingy countries – by which I mean countries and governments that are very close to me – prevail with their 1%, Europe will be the loser."
"We are therefore on your side, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in the fight against any attempts at reducing the European budget."
"Reducing the European budget is in fact tantamount to letting Europe collapse."
"I should like to say one other thing – and this is very important – about education."
"I refer to the debate initiated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development with the Programme for International Student Assessment. When discussing education, it is important to have the courage to say what works and what does not work in the Member States."
"It is not enough to speak of the need to educate, one must also say that there are education systems, teaching systems in Europe that are counter-productive, reactionary and ideological."
"To conclude, I should like to say that the tenth anniversary of the Dayton agreement and of Srebrenica falls during your Presidency."
"I therefore ask Europe to take steps to revise the Dayton agreement, which might have been a necessary measure in its time, but which is unacceptable in view of the Constitution now in force in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Consequently, on the occasion of ten years since Srebrenica, I ask you, on Europe’s behalf, to take steps to revise the Dayton agreement."
". Mr Juncker, I should first of all like to thank you for your introduction."
"I would like to wish the Luxembourg Presidency success, and I wish it more wisdom than its Dutch predecessor had, although you have already made a little with your remark about the Constitution."
"I urge you to give the public the opportunity to make up their own minds in a fair-minded manner."
"My first question to you is a short one."
"It was six years ago that the euro was introduced."
"At the time, in 1999, European unemployment stood at 9%, and has remained at that level to this day, while economic growth has slowed down."
"My question to you is: do you not consider it high time we submitted the euro to a thorough overhaul, in which you, in fact, could take the lead?"
"I regret the absence from your agenda of the continuation of the debate, initiated under the Dutch Presidency, on the control of animal diseases."
"Had this slipped your mind?"
"According to your list of priorities, there are many misunderstandings surrounding the services directive."
"Exactly what kind of misunderstandings do you mean, and who, in your view, is labouring under them?"
"Is it the Commission, Parliament or the thousands of workers who have already voiced their disapproval of this services directive?"
"From your wish to reassess the proposal in a more objective light, as you describe it, can I deduce that you share my view that the services directive is an extremely vague document that my fellow-countryman, Commissioner Bolkestein, should never even have tabled?"
"Does the Luxembourg Presidency have concrete proposals for amending the Commission proposal on the services directive?"
"If not, I would invite you to travel with me through the Netherlands."
"You would be able to get to know those important public services, such as education and health care, that the directive puts in jeopardy."
"I could also introduce you to those commercial service providers, including the coffee shop 'De Tevreden Roker' [The Satisfied Smoker] and the 'Picobello Escort Service' club, which would certainly be keen to become active in Luxembourg, or elsewhere for that matter."
"To my mind, services of that kind are expressions of Dutch culture and thanks to the services directive, we will be able to inflict them on everyone."
"You will gather that these last words were meant as a provocation, but I should like to ask you in all seriousness to take me up on my invitation."
"We may then be able to have the desperately needed debate about the services directive, which seems to be absent in too many crucial places in Europe."
". Mr President, Mr Juncker's speech was made with all the passion that a civil servant is likely to raise."
"Mr Juncker, you say that the Stability and Growth Pact will be your top priority, but your past statements serve to illustrate only the inconsistencies."
"Whilst I acknowledge that you played a key role in negotiating the pact's original rules, you recently said that the credibility of the pact had been buried and that the pact was dead."
"Is that still your opinion?"
"You also said that you have a window of opportunity to cut a quick deal on the EU budget, including the British rebate of some EUR 4 billion a year."
"Is that so, Mr Juncker?"
"The rebate took to negotiate."
"If your comments are true and you can cut a deal by June, then Mr Blair must have agreed in principle to surrender the rebate."
"Is that the case?"
"With whom in the British Government precisely are you negotiating?"
"Will the British electorate know about this at the time of the British general election, probably in May?"
"Finally, the UK Independence Party, and in particular my colleague Mr Farage, has drawn attention to the criminal activities of more than one Commissioner."
"More details will follow shortly and regularly."
"Are you to be tainted by association with them, or will you be expressing your concerns and the pressing need for change?"
". – Mr President, the Luxembourg Presidency’s programme is packed with crucial issues for the future of Europe, including the priorities on the economic front: the Lisbon strategy, reform of the Stability Pact and approval of the financial perspective up to 2013."
"My first point is that it will soon be time for the mid-term review of the level of implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"To give it a greater chance of success, the programme needs to make the individual Member States responsible for achieving the targets that were set."
"To that end, I consider the proposal to specify an individual at national level to be responsible for putting the strategy into practice to be a very useful idea."
"Secondly, with regard to the review of the Stability Pact, it has also been emphasised this morning that a reform is needed which can propose a more flexible interpretation of the Pact during times of recession, without bypassing the Maastricht criteria and without giving up the commitment to reduce the debt."
"I am also convinced that steps could be taken to exclude certain specific types of investment from the calculation of the deficit in order to give a new boost to Europe’s growth and competitiveness."
"Thirdly, I hope that we can really succeed in approving the financial perspective up to 2013 by June, so that the resources can be used to the full from the very beginning of the period in question."
"I especially hope that the proposals – the Council’s and the Commission’s proposals on those important topics – are adequately discussed in advance by Parliament which, let us recall, is the only European institution that directly represents the sovereignty of the people."
"Lastly, I hope that a European civil protection agency will at last be set up during the Luxembourg Presidency so that natural disasters can be dealt with in an appropriate manner, with particular emphasis on prevention."
"Mr President-in-Office, there are many in this House who have, for some time, been keen to see you sitting opposite where you are now, and I am one of them."
"The work programme you have presented is enormous, but you also have a reputation for working wonders, and it is to the wonder-worker in you that I would like to appeal, asking you also to give attention to the Members’ statute."
"We urgently need a fair and credible statute of this kind."
"Somewhere between your country and mine is to be found not only the problem, but also the solution to it."
"We are told that the German Government does not want one before the next elections, but, at the same time, the German model – as regards Members’ remuneration rather than additional earnings and lobbyists – could serve as a basis for an agreement of this kind."
"We have to put a stop to the unworthy greed in this place."
"This House must cease to be a parliament of the insatiable, or else serious damage will be done to democracy, which is what this place is all about."
"If the President-in-Office of the Council does not wish to reply to the very specific and precise questions that have just been put to him, we shall continue with the debate."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Luxembourg’s Presidency of the Council in this first half of 2005 is very probably the last of its kind that we shall see."
"Under the European Constitution, by the time my country is next in line to take its turn in the presidency, the presidency of the Council of Heads of State or Government will have been permanently reformed."
"It follows that a last presidency – which is what this one is – must be a good one, and one whose successes will stand the test of time."
"The biggest and most difficult tasks for our 2005 presidency have to do with finance policy; its agenda is dominated by the determination of the financial framework for the period from 2007 to 2013 and by a more flexible interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The financial framework for the enlarged Union must be negotiated in such a way that an ambitious approach to the shaping of European policy is not obstructed by budgetary constraints at national level."
"Europe’s 450 million inhabitants expect the European Union to be able to take effective action, and we will not be meeting their expectations by disputing over tenths and hundredths of percentage points, so it is vital that the Luxembourg Presidency should make a success of the tricky feat of giving the EU’s financial planning a European dimension."
"In so doing, it will be acting in the interests of every European and of a Union that is not only enlarging itself but also, and at the same time, benefiting its citizens by putting its policies on an adequate and appropriate financial footing, failing which further rounds of enlargement will be quite beyond its capacities."
"During the coming six months, Europe’s Stability and Growth Pact is to be reinterpreted in line with the economic situation."
"It is in fact economic good sense, as well as the demands of a dynamic employment policy in Europe, that require that it be adapted to take account of the realities of the growth cycle."
"The fact is that the Pact is about growth as well as stability, and excessive rigidity must not be allowed to hamper growth rather than promote it."
"The Lisbon strategy faces its mid-term review on 22 March of this year, when what has been achieved so far will be assessed and new priorities set."
"The Luxembourg Presidency of the Council proposes that, by 2010, every Member State should have set in motion tangible and demonstrable reforms in every one of the areas in which the Lisbon strategy requires action."
"That having been said, the EU’s economic environment will also undergo changes over the next five years."
"Europe is not alone in the world in striving to improve its performance and become more competitive, and so the Lisbon reform agenda will have to be successfully implemented by 2010."
"The Luxembourg Presidency is well aware of that, and will endeavour to ensure that its announcement is followed up by a stage in which progress is actually made."
"Finally, it matters a great deal to me that something should be said, in this debate, on the epoch-making events in Ukraine, which is a European state, one that has, in the last month, demonstrated its desire to be one of us, and its ability to enrich the European family with its convictions and its experience."
"If it should be under Luxembourg’s Presidency that a start is made on completing the map of Europe, we should bear in mind that Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Romania have a neighbour whose people see their future as being alongside all of us in Europe."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me just start with a brief comment."
"I see the statute as too important an issue to be a plaything for demagogues, and so I would ask you to ignore the rabble-rousing utterances that have been made and go ahead with what you plan to do with all your strength and in earnest, addressing this issue and finding a solution to it."
"Your speech, Mr President-in-Office, was a very good one, and I would like to congratulate you on getting the right balance between the economy and society and particularly on giving priority to employment and growth."
"If I may be frank, that is an example to many, and not just to Christian Democrat Heads of Government."
"I would, though, also like to endorse what you said about the foreign policy aspects."
"Two countries in our vicinity – Ukraine and Palestine – have held important elections in recent weeks."
"In both instances, the European Union played a very active part in bringing about change through democratic, open and transparent elections, and Europe must, as you said, hang on in there."
"We must not disappoint the people whom we have, to some degree, motivated to summon up the courage to bring about changes, and whom we have helped to do so in a transparent manner."
"Do not let yourself be discouraged, Mr President-in-Office, for you are quite right to say that the development we are promoting and supporting in Ukraine is not a development in opposition to Russia, but we must nevertheless try to work together with Russia towards finding solutions."
"Ukraine must not become the ball in a game of power politics played by the European Union and Russia."
"Russia must of course acknowledge that there have been changes that it may find disagreeable, but which the people themselves have chosen."
"Were these changes now to be pursued to some degree in opposition to Russia, it would not be in Ukraine’s interests, for it is too varied and too diversified, and we know that it is those parts that are to some extent aligned with Russia that are Ukraine’s economic powerhouses."
"Similarly, in Palestine, we need to remain involved and to continue giving political moral and financial support, as we have done for years, whilst always taking a critical line when it could not be clearly shown where the money was flowing."
"We have brought about many changes and introduced a degree of transparency, including in the way Palestine is administered."
"That is what we have achieved, and we will continue to do so if we get stuck in and, as has been said, do not limit ourselves to supplying funds but also help the Palestinian people to gain a state of their own."
"The only way to guarantee security in the Middle East is for there to be both an Israel that is secure within its own borders and also a new Palestinian state."
"Even if foreign policy is not one of your presidency’s priorities from the word go, we cannot desert the people whom we have helped to bring about change; it is also in our own interest, in the interests of stability and our own continent, that we should help them towards the real political goal."
"Mr President, I welcome the presidency and congratulate it on its priorities."
"I have four questions."
"The EU faces very considerable challenges during the next six months."
"Naturally, the half-term reviewof theLisbon process is one of the overriding issues."
"It is time for European leaders to begin to act."
"I much appreciate the presidency’s statement that economic growth is important but that the other two pillars of stability are also needed, namely social and environmental development."
"What, nonetheless, needs to be explained is not merely the fact that you intend to improve the Lisbon process, but the way in which you intend to do this."
"The other issue concerns the energy area."
"A better environment and improved self-sufficiency are naturally very important and bring about economic growth."
"The production of biomass creates jobs in districts and regions with low economic growth and can contribute to a better environment and to more stable energy production."
"How do you intend to combine the half-term reform of agricultural policy with energy policy and industrial policy?"
"Mark Twain once said that ‘All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence, and then success is sure’."
"Obviously, that is not the case."
"Research policy needs to be strengthened, and we need a knowledge-based economy."
"What will the presidency do to ensure faster achievement of the 3% target where grants for research are concerned?"
"Finally, the fourth area."
"Nothing was mentioned about what is perhaps the most important legislative process under way, namely the Chemicals Directive, REACH."
"We have the opportunity to create a global standard if we combine the Commission’s proposal with better workability. Uncertainty is very expensive both for industry and the environment."
"How do you intend to work with REACH?"
"Finally, I should like to congratulate you on a very good presentation of the priorities and hope that, during the next six months, you will be able to achieve the objectives you have established."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am delighted at the clear and courageous statements that have been made by the Luxembourg Presidency with regard to sustainable development policy."
"The Luxembourg Presidency, to a greater extent than its predecessors, is attempting to maintain a balance between economic, social and environmental policies."
"It is calling for something quite simple, namely that social and environmental policies be a starting point and not an end goal as far as growth policy is concerned."
"I hope that this will be the line followed by the Luxembourg Presidency at the European Council and within the respective sectoral Councils, and I am sure that your proposals on the main areas of work, namely the Financial Perspectives, the reform of the Stability Pact and the review of the Lisbon process, will be guided by this spirit of sustainable development."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I also hope that you will find the energy to convince the European Council that Europe should continue to act as the driving force behind the Kyoto process."
"After the European Union’s success with Kyoto, it is essential that it now set out a long-term framework for climate change policy, with objectives for the period 2020-2050."
"This is what both our citizens and our economic players expect."
"What guidelines will economic players in Europe follow when investing in key sectors such as energy and transport, if we have not laid down a clear framework for future policies in this field?"
"Turning to the Lisbon strategy, you noted that it related to three areas, namely environmental, social and economic issues."
"It is the ambitious environmental policies of recent decades that have made Europe a global leader in environmental technologies and renewable energies."
"I hope that you will revise Chapter V of the Koch report to ensure that the European economy can benefit from these ambitious policies."
"The Lisbon agenda should also include an ambitious social policy."
"The Commission is pressing for extensive liberalisation, in particular as proposed in the Bolkenstein directive, and I am glad that you have expressed criticism of this directive, Mr Juncker."
"I hope that the Luxembourg Presidency will also take advantage of criticisms from within the Competitiveness Council to hold a debate on this directive, and, if necessary, to check its progress, as well as to force the Commission to table a directive on services of general interest."
"I believe that confusion will reign over the Bolkenstein directive until the issue of services of general interest has been clarified."
"I very much welcome the fact that this presidency aims to harmonise social, environmental and economic policies, as this is good news for Europe."
"– Mr President, the tsunami tragedy should be no less significant to the world’s leaders and to Europe than 11 September."
"The Asian tsunami should act as a turning point for the most pressing of the world’s priorities – that of preventing and combating hunger and disease."
"I therefore wish to ask four questions."
"Firstly, do you believe that the EUR 450 million announced for reconstruction might undermine programmes already planned for Asia (as is the case of EUR 150 million of the EUR 450 million announced)?"
"Secondly, do you intend to back the cancellation of the debt of countries affected by the tsunami or do you advocate just a moratorium?"
"Thirdly, will they be treated the same as Iraq, or worse than Iraq?"
"Lastly, Commissioner Michel proposed to the last Council a more ambitious target than 0.7% for development."
"Will you reconsider this proposal, or will it be jettisoned for good?"
"My dear Mr Juncker, Luxembourg’s presidencies of the EU are usually among the best, perhaps because a small country knows that it cannot monopolise the agenda but that it must be of service to everyone."
"I am sure that you will continue that tradition, and would also call upon you and the Council to treat supporters and opponents of the Constitution exactly the same."
"Our buildings here are full of expressions of commitment to a ‘yes’ vote: ‘yes’ signs, badges and balloons, their presence decided upon – and paid for out of our common budget – before Parliament has voted."
"It will not, however, be until this afternoon that we know the result, and it is certain that there will be votes both in favour of, and against, the Constitution."
"Those in favour cannot steal taxpayers’ contributions to promote a definite view."
"Referendums belong to us all, and voters are entitled to balanced information, not propaganda paid for through taxes."
"On Monday evening, Parliament’s Sessional Services decided to send some millions of euros to the supranational EU parties, which are all in favour of the EU Constitution."
"More than 150 Members of the European Parliament will not have a share of these resources."
"That is contrary to the principle of equality and thus illegal."
"I would call upon you to raise the matter in the Council so that the regulation relating to parties is either abolished or supplemented by arrangements for those who do not wish to belong to a supranational party but wish to engage in corresponding European information-providing activities, for example concerning the Constitution."
"How will you guarantee that EU resources used by the campaigners for a ‘yes’ vote can be used equally well by the campaigners for a ‘no’ vote?"
"May I finally call upon you to intimate that you will respect the outcome of the referendums, whether they be ‘yes’ or ‘no’."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that the most ambitious task facing the incoming Luxembourg Presidency will be the conclusion of negotiations on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013."
"This will unquestionably be an extremely challenging task, but I am in no doubt that everything in our power should be done to reach a compromise on the budget by June of this year at the latest."
"Otherwise we will risk major delays, for example in the drawing up of regional aid programmes, and this could mean EU funds not reaching the Member States in January 2007."
"It is of course not just the date by which we reach a compromise that is of crucial importance, but also the nature of the compromise. Mr Barroso rightly said that we cannot have more Europe for less money."
"The European Union will cease to exist without solidarity, and this is why we cannot consent to either the policy of solidarity or the need to support the new Member States being removed from the EU’s budget priorities."
"We must be aware that unless gaps in economic development within the enlarged EU are addressed, it will be impossible to achieve the goals of the Lisbon strategy."
"We must therefore ensure that funds are earmarked in the future EU budget for cohesion policy, as this is in the interests of the whole Community."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, there can be no doubt that President Bush’s visit to Brussels will be the most significant event to occur during the six-month Luxembourg Presidency."
"It will be the first time that a President of the United States has ever visited the European institutions."
"I hope that this symbolic visit will go some way to improving transatlantic relations, which have been somewhat strained recently."
"Unless we cooperate closely with the United States, we will struggle to respond to a great many global challenges."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I welcomed your comments on relations with Ukraine."
"The European Union must draw its own conclusions from events last year in one of its neighbouring countries."
"The Ukrainian people have proven that they share our European values, and that they desire integration with the EU."
"We should therefore offer them a partnership that could ultimately lead to membership."
"Mr President, as you know, the European institutions recently – and, I think, disastrously – cut the Gordian knot with regard to the possible accession of a non-European country, Turkey, to the European Union."
"An issue of that kind threatens to change the very nature of the Union as we know it and even puts the future of European cooperation as we know it fundamentally at risk."
"It is, above all, an issue in respect of which a large majority of our electorate, our citizens, are very alienated from the position adopted by the official European institutions."
"I regret, then, the Luxembourg Presidency’s failure to take the opportunity, first of all, of asking respect for the democratic will of the majority of our citizens and, secondly, as a small Member State, asking respect for that other small Member State, Cyprus, which is being ignored and misjudged by the Turkish leaders in the most arrogant and unacceptable manner."
"In my view, this is a missed opportunity, and one that can only widen the enormous chasm between our citizens on the one hand and European politics on the other."
"Mr Juncker has described a very ambitious agenda for these next six months; this agenda offers a great opportunity, but is also a great responsibility for Luxembourg and particularly for its Prime Minister, who has both experience and ability and whom we wish every success in this difficult task."
"I would like to make a few comments on the greatest challenge for this Presidency, which, in my opinion, will be the reform of the financial perspectives, which you, Mr Juncker, mentioned in passing."
"It will probably be the most essential element, on the basis of which these six months will be assessed."
"It is clear that success or failure depends not only upon the actions of the Presidency, but it is the case that during this time the Luxembourg Government will have to employ all its determination, and I am pleased that you have stated this morning that you will ensure that the general interest is put first, because, as you have said yourself, to reach July without an agreement would spell financial chaos for the European Union."
"In order to be successful, the Presidency will have to seek compromises;"
"I believe that these compromises will have to be based on two fundamentals: on the one hand, the validity of the principle of cohesion, as stated by the Council at the end of the Swedish Presidency, and, on the other, balance in the distribution of burdens."
"I hope that over the next six months this House can learn the cost of enlargement to the original fifteen Member States, because on the objective basis of figures it is possible to make proposals that the European citizens in each Member State can understand and accept."
"On the subject of the citizens, and going beyond what is laid down in the Treaties, I would like to ask the Presidency what role it intends the European Parliament, which is going to give its opinion in May, to play in this negotiation?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, you recently stated, Mr Juncker, and indeed you repeated just now, that competitiveness will be neither the Holy Grail nor the be all and end all as far as you are concerned, in particular with regard to the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy."
"You noted that social goals and sustainable development goals should not be placed in opposition to goals relating to competitiveness."
"My group welcomes this statement, as we believe the opposite to be true, namely that promotion of the European model is a major driving force behind competitiveness on our continent."
"In fact, we believe that what is needed is a Europe of excellence which attaches priority to investment in research, innovation, employee training, the quality of infrastructures, trans-European networks, public services, the quality of work and social relations."
"We agree with you on this issue, and we sometimes detected a slight difference of approach to that adopted by the President of the Commission. We hope that he will be equally clear in his statements, especially with regard to social issues."
"Yet the good intentions you have professed to hold will be put to a number of tests."
"I should like to mention three such tests, the first of which is the European budget."
"We share your view that this debate must not be allowed to get bogged down and that it must progress rapidly."
"You intend to act as a motivating and intermediary force, as well as one that accelerates the process, but we do not want the process of reaching a compromise on the Financial Perspectives to be accelerated if this would mean sacrificing a budget that meets the European Union’s needs."
"We agree with Mr Barroso on this issue; we need a budget that enables us to guarantee cohesion, solidarity, investment in the future and in research and investment in the trans-European networks."
"The process should not be accelerated at the expense of the final outcome."
"The second test will be the directive on services of general interest, which has already been mentioned today by a number of speakers, in particular Mr Turmes."
"I believe that you yourself are aware of a risk that is a cause of great concern to us, namely the extended scope of this directive, which poses a threat to a large number of services of general interest. We are also concerned by the country of origin principle, which poses a threat to the right to work in multiple countries;"
"I am thinking in particular of the application of collective bargaining agreements."
"The third test relates more generally to the European social agenda."
"We would particularly like to see a clear commitment on your part in relation to other Council members regarding a review of the Directive on Working Time and a removal of the opt-out clause, and, finally, regarding a proposed review of the Directive on European Works Councils."
"Mr President, on 1 January, Luxembourg began its eleventh EU presidency."
"The experience it has gained in this field, and the excellent preparations that have been made and which I have seen for myself, will be a great help in dealing with the various challenges that await you, starting with the terrible disaster in Asia. The latter showed that there is an urgent need for humanitarian aid to be coordinated on the ground, and should encourage us to set up the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps, as provided for by the Constitution, as soon as possible."
"There are other issues that you will have to deal with, of which I shall only mention three."
"Firstly, the Lisbon process has reached its halfway point. This process needs to be made clearer and it needs targeted priorities; in short, it will need to be made easier to understand."
"I am therefore fully in favour of the three aims you identified."
"The second issue will be the Financial Perspective."
"It is doubtless to be welcomed that it will be the Luxembourg Presidency that puts the finishing touches to it, but many people are still undecided between 1% and 1.24%, to say nothing of 1.14% – and I could go on – and much money is also hanging in the balance."
"Finally, the Stability Pact will need to be amended, and the necessary balance found between strictness and flexibility to ensure that stability is not compromised."
"Mr President, I very much hope that your success will be equal to the efforts that have been made by so many people."
"Mr President, I would like to wish Prime Minister Juncker a positive and productive presidency and am very pleased to see a small, successful, independent country leading the European Union."
"Luxembourg is one of the six Member States that is smaller than my own country, Wales, and an example of what an independent Wales could achieve."
"The priorities paper tries to maintain the essential balance between economic, social and environmental policies."
"I would like to mention the continuing campaign against discrimination, in the hope that real progress will be made on the European Gender Institute and on the recast equality directive."
"There is no better example of the failure of policies on equality than the pay gap between men and women."
"Thirty years after legislation was passed on this issue, a report published this week by the GMB trade union in the UK shows that, in Anglesey in my constituency, full-time pay for women is as low as 59% of that for men."
"This is a scandal which must be addressed and I hope equality issues will be given priority."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to express my condolences to Mr Juncker on account of the death of Grand Duchess Josephine-Charlotte."
"I wish you and the Luxembourg people strength to bear this loss, and may God be close to you."
"The Luxembourg Presidency is facing the weighty task of reforming the Stability Pact and implementing the conclusions of Wim Kok’s report."
"The Commission’s proposal to give due consideration to the economic climate in the Stability Pact offers, in my view, a basis for carrying out adequate reforms."
"The implementation of the Pact benefits from clear decision-making."
"Clear sanctions are still needed."
"It was in the autumn of 2004 that Mr Kok presented his report on the Lisbon strategy; his conclusion is as clear as it is predictable: the Member States must really get down to carrying out structural reforms."
"I would therefore like to ask Mr Juncker in what way we can expect your presidency to follow that up."
"Since Luxembourg has always been a great champion of necessary reforms, I have high hopes."
"Finally, with regard to the Members’ statute, can Parliament expect from the presidency that a decision will finally be made on this subject in the next six months?"
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I wish the Luxembourg presidency every success."
"It will be in the interests of us all."
"You are the second country to hold the presidency of the enlarged twenty-five."
"You are a founding state of the European Union and you are also an example of how a small country can set the tempo and dictate the conditions to the big countries."
"The President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, drew attention in his speech today to the increased financial pressure on the new Member States, referring to the backward regions."
"I should like to point out that these ten Member States also have great wealth."
"Many of these regions have been deprived of tens and hundreds of young ambitious people, scientists, doctors, who have left in the last fifteen years for the old Europe and they are contributing to their successful economies."
"I should like to point out to the Luxembourg presidency that we do not wish to be just the recipients of charity."
"I see this as an opportunity for you actively to involve the new ten."
"Following ratification of the Constitutional Treaty, Europe will build new institutions."
"I invite you to take steps to ensure that the east of the European Union is given the right to host an important European institution."
"I am convinced that this idea could be a success."
"Evidence of this faith is the fact that the Bush – Putin meeting is to take place in my little country, Slovakia."
"– Mr President, the reform of the Stability Pact and the reform of the financial perspective are two sides of the same coin."
"These reforms need to find a common philosophy and a common solution: more growth, more competitiveness and more resources for the Member States."
"That all means more affluence and more cohesion."
"Let me be frank with you, Mr Juncker."
"What you have said on the Stability and Growth Pact is thoroughly acceptable, but it is all provided for in the current system of regulation: the automatic stabilising mechanisms, their relationship with growth or recession, the relationship between greater deficit flexibility and the effectiveness of debt dynamics – all that is already provided for."
"What the European Union needs now is not that, but perhaps we should be more ambitious."
"I say more ambitious, but that does not mean less rigorous, just more mindful of the strategic needs of our Union."
"If we really have to re-establish an effective, Europe-wide strategy for investments, infrastructure, research and security – in short, to meet the targets set at the Lisbon Summit – then we have to reach agreement on the kinds of action needed: no hypocrisy, no dirty tricks and no opportunism."
"The Pact needs a European golden rule, as one might say, with the appropriate guarantees and controls attached."
"The financial perspective needs a stronger, not a weaker Union budget, one that focuses more on the investments required by the Lisbon objectives and less on handouts."
"Mr Juncker, Mr Barroso, will we be capable of that?"
"It depends on us."
"The responsibility rests with us all, but please let us not have any hypocrisy."
"Mr Juncker, I would like to focus my brief comments on the financial perspectives, which, of the challenges that have been mentioned today, are perhaps the most difficult facing this Presidency."
"In explaining your priorities, you say that you accept the reasons why it is necessary to reach a political agreement on the financial perspectives in June, so that the legislative procedures can be concluded under the British Presidency, reconciling national differences."
"We wish you luck, because, on the one hand, there is the enlargement we have just carried out, with ten new Member States whose economic situation mean that we are going to have to make an enormous financial effort with a view to social and economic cohesion, in order to protect the European social model, as you have stressed in your speech."
"On the other hand, there are the short-sighted accountants, whose sole aim is not to exceed a certain level of spending."
"We hope that, with your experience and with the cooperation of the European Parliament, your Presidency will persuade the Council to take a broader view, and make it see that it is irresponsible to try to create more Europe with less resources – to use once again that well-worn phrase."
"But it is also necessary to make the Council see that budgetary policy, Mr Juncker, is facing much more important challenges than keeping spending below a particular percentage of gross domestic product."
"Let us continue to build a Europe amongst all of us and with sufficient resources, as laid down in the Treaties, so that we do not disappoint the citizens."
"Mr President, the new presidency can be assured that hundreds and thousands of British citizens will fight the proposed European Constitution tooth and nail, and millions of us will vote against it when the time comes!"
"We have no quarrel with the people of Europe: our quarrel is only with the system of unitary government called the European Union."
"The EU is the of the accountable parliamentary democracy that the British invented over 700 years ago."
"This attempted reversal of the relationship between the State and the individual has been foisted on us over the last 30 years by deceit, denial and misrepresentation."
"But now we understand fully what the EU is really all about."
"We may not leave during your presidency, but be in no doubt – leave we shall!"
"Mr President, the tenor of my speech will be rather different from that of the previous speaker’s."
"Let me start by thanking the Luxembourg Presidency, not only for the excellent agenda it has presented, but also for the style, content and level of commitment evident in it."
"In the coming months, the Luxembourg Presidency will certainly have its work cut out, and we have high hopes."
"There are great challenges that require an answer and that Europe has to meet."
"I should like to bring up one of those challenges, namely more and better jobs, but also sustainability and social cohesion."
"I will therefore repeat to Mr Goebbels and Mr Cohn-Bendit that the Socialists and the Greens do not have sole exhibition rights in this respect."
"Social cohesion is very much one of the Christian Democrats’ principles, and I will always continue to dedicate myself, as I know will our group, to ensure that social cohesion is maintained."
"That is why I am pleased that not only the President of the Council, but also the President of the Commission and the chairman of my group mentioned it."
"I should like to say a few words about Lisbon, and I want to make a number of points."
"First of all, while the objective of what we did in Lisbon was sound, and the result we would like to achieve is excellent, we forgot that, when all those Heads of Government went home, nobody assumed any responsibility or liability for this process."
"What matters more than anything else at the moment is, in addition to all the new measures that have to be taken, for people to be made accountable."
"It will then be possible to verify national plans at European level."
"I should like to finish off with a cry from the heart."
"I have noticed that we have made a few agreements about the free market that were subsequently flouted by the Member States and also by the European Commission, as regards qualifications, mobility, and so on."
"Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy is so full of grand ideas that we often hear very little – and indeed we have heard very little today – about the simple things, such as improving the quality of our own legislation."
"The fact is that the European Union could add between two and six per cent to its productivity if its regulatory framework was matched by the best in the world."
"We should therefore be making it a priority of the Luxembourg presidency to encourage the Commission to put real resources into consultations at an early stage in its proposals and to test whether its competitiveness is appropriate."
"We also need to spend time looking at existing legislation and seeing whether it has achieved the effect that we asked for."
"Often we pass legislation, but do not look at what it has actually achieved."
"Is existing legislation being properly enforced and implemented?"
"It seems to me that, in the European Union of 25, implementation enforcement should get far higher priority than it has up until now."
"I am glad that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has taken up my suggestion that we should have an own-initiative report looking precisely at these issues."
"We have also heard considerable talk today about social Europe, but we have to ensure that social Europe applies to everybody and not simply to those who are in work."
"Far too many of our citizens are economically inactive, and therefore we should be putting investment into active labour market policies that enable people to get back to work and then policies that support people in order for them to be able to continue in work."
"If we fail to do that, then we will fail in our Lisbon Strategy."
"Finally, I urge the Luxembourg presidency to take fresh initiatives in relation to Northern Cyprus so that we can ensure we have effective economic regeneration in that part of the country."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by wishing Mr Juncker and his country a successful presidency."
"Mr President-in-Office, you assume the leadership of the Union at a crucial period."
"The ratification process for the Constitution is underway, the Lisbon process is not yet making enough progress and the future of transatlantic relations is a source of concern."
"In March, the European Council will conduct the mid-term review of the Lisbon process."
"It will do it against the backdrop of the Kok report, which was blunt in its assessment of the lack of progress."
"I urge the presidency not to be distracted by the siren calls of those who urge that the preservation of the 'European model' is the most important political priority."
"It is clearly not."
"It is precisely because so many governments have failed to grasp the nettle of radical reform that the Lisbon process is in such dire straits."
"The United States continues to out-perform us and the competitive challenges from Asia, particularly China and India, are increasing, with no apparent urgent response from national capitals in our Union."
"The presidency must be unequivocal in its support for economic reform, for greater labour market flexibility, for more competitive taxation policies, and for reducing barriers to employment growth, particularly the excessive regulation that pervades all our economies."
"With high unemployment a factor across Europe, people are waiting for practical ways of getting them back to work."
"Reform will be difficult and fraught with risk, but as the United Kingdom, under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s and Spain under Mr Aznar in the 1990s proved, a resolute approach to economic reform delivers results."
"Low taxation, flexible labour markets, less red tape and a determination to tip the balance firmly in favour of the wealth-creators offers the only way out of a relative economic decline."
"These things are naturally anathema to socialists but are good for all our citizens."
"We look to the spring Council in March to reverse the failures of recent times and put Europe firmly on a free market and enterprise-driven path."
"Mr President, the whole issue of children has been invisible in EU policies and programmes."
"However, children's rights are now mentioned in the Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It is important that progress is made towards a horizontal European policy on children."
"Children cannot defend themselves."
"Thus it is our obligation to do this."
"Every day we hear about children who are starving, dying or abused in all possible ways."
"However, there is no mention in your programme of a full-scale strategy on children's rights in accordance with the UN Convention on Children's Rights, which was ratified by most European countries."
"Children are vulnerable to trafficking."
"The recently published report on trafficking in human beings by the Experts Group has a strong human rights dimension."
"I urge the Luxembourg presidency to take this forward, including a specific legal instrument to promote and protect the rights of children who have been trafficked."
"The Luxembourg presidency has stated that a directive on the return of asylum seekers is a priority."
"It is important that there is a specific section to protect the rights of children and that unaccompanied children are not returned to their countries of origin without an assessment of what is in their best interests."
"The mainstreaming of children's rights in European Union development policy has not been achieved."
"I urge the Luxembourg presidency to address this failure without delay by calling for a communication on children's rights and new development cooperation and by supporting references to children's rights as a priority."
"I further urge it to revise the development policy statement."
"The implementation of new guidelines to safeguard children in conflict areas remains a concern."
"In order to ensure progress, it is essential that the Luxembourg presidency takes this process forward by completing and putting into practice a plan of action."
"In conclusion, it is vital that children's rights are made a priority of the Luxembourg presidency and that children's rights are included in the presidency conclusions."
"Mr President, I have noticed two shortcomings in the Luxembourg Presidency’s programme, and I should like to ask two questions with regard to these shortcomings."
"The document outlining the Luxembourg Presidency’s priorities mentions 27 countries and regions outside the EU by name, yet Eastern Europe and Ukraine are not mentioned once."
"To put it another way, the programme lacks an eastern dimension."
"It would be somewhat alarming if this reflected the Luxembourg Presidency’s views and intentions with regard to the new European democracy that has emerged before our very eyes and on our very doorstep."
"The comments made before this House on Ukraine have been very cautious."
"They do not imply that measures will be taken that are equal to the responsibility which Europe bears towards Ukraine, and which poses a moral and political imperative."
"If we were to content ourselves with the old Action Plan, which was based on the neighbourhood policy, we would be doing far too little, and we would be making a mistake."
"This plan was drawn up for a Ukraine from a different age, before the ‘Orange Revolution’ took place, offering hope and a model for peaceful political transformation."
"The events in Ukraine merit a reaction from Europe, not merely words and outdated instruments."
"Time passes more rapidly, and indeed differently, in Central and Eastern Europe."
"We must act now to ensure that democracy is not merely victorious, but that it is long-lasting and a source of hope to others."
"What should therefore be done?"
"The old Action Plan should be revised and extended beyond the neighbourhood policy, and a fresh offer should be made."
"The EU’s relations with Ukraine should be advanced to a new level, and the country should be offered an Association Agreement and the prospect of membership."
"We should not thwart Ukraine’s European hopes or trade in our fundamental values, such as freedom, democracy and solidarity, for oil and gas."
"By supporting Ukrainian democracy we will also support the democratic ambitions of the citizens of Belarus, Russia and the other countries of the post-Soviet space."
"It is an opportunity for political change that will benefit the European Union in every respect."
"The era of Yalta, of the Brezhnev Doctrine and of the Berlin Wall has ended."
"We need a courageous policy based on our values, not on our financial interests, and promoting democracy, human rights and the right of nations to self-determination."
"The forging of more open relations with a democratic Ukraine is both a great challenge and a great responsibility for the Luxembourg Presidency."
"I wish it every success."
". Mr President, I can take one of two approaches;"
"I can either answer the 30 Members who have spoken, and risk being very long-winded, or I can merely answer a few of them, and risk appearing extremely impolite to the others."
"I shall therefore try to be brief in order to be polite."
"Mr Goebbels, who has been following my progress closely for many years, believes me to be entirely incapable of such a thing, and on this point we agree."
"Mr President, several speakers have referred to the Lisbon agenda, in particular the group chairmen and other Members such as Mr Swoboda and Mrs Oomen."
"It would appear that we are more or less in agreement on the need to maintain the fundamental synergy on which the Lisbon strategy is based, and which was given a useful boost by the conclusions of the Gothenburg European Council."
"It has become a habit of Mr Cohn-Bendit’s to refer indiscriminately to authors from both sides of the Rhine, and today he quoted Victor Hugo."
"With regard to the Lisbon agenda, I should like to quote Pascal, who said that he liked things that go hand in hand."
"This holds true for a number of areas of life, and it also holds true for the Lisbon strategy."
"It is impossible to distinguish between the various elements that go towards making the Lisbon strategy so effective – and I am talking here of its theoretical effectiveness, not the enthusiasm with which it is implemented."
"A number of you have referred to the much-needed structural reforms that must be carried out in the framework of the Lisbon strategy."
"I have been a member of the Ecofin Council since 1989, I believe."
"Since then, I have been told week after week and month after month that structural reforms must be carried out, yet it is rare for me to come across anyone who is able to say exactly what these structural reforms should look like."
"As a general rule, it is my impression that those who say that structural reforms must be carried out actually mean that the social state must be dismantled."
"This is why it is frequently said with regard to structural reforms that labour markets must be reformed and that they need to be more flexible."
"I believe this to be true, but I also believe that European employers could be more flexible."
"I believe that it would be in the interests of decision-makers, who frequently also take decisions for others, to prove themselves more flexible in adapting the tools we have to modern needs."
"I myself do not believe that Europeans should be led to think that it will be enough to reform labour markets, to abolish existing social legislation and to eliminate the buffer zones provided by workers’ rights in order to become more competitive."
"This would be a very short-term approach, with obvious consequences; we would not gain competitiveness, but we would lose the support of a large number of Europeans, in particular workers."
"I should therefore like to warn you against such simplistic proposals, which will get us nowhere."
"Several of you stated that your groups would support the Stability Pact, and this made the debate extremely interesting."
"I shall explain what I mean by this."
"Mr Goebbels, no less, offered the support of his parliamentary group, the Socialists."
"If I understood him correctly, Mr Cohn-Bendit appears to be moving towards a clear meeting of interests and ideas on this issue."
"Mr Poettering promised the support of the Group of the European People’s Party."
"Five minutes of the Luxembourg Presidency were therefore all that were needed to see the Socialists, the Liberals, the Christian Democrats and all the others agree on the general shape to be taken by the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This is something I welcome greatly, and in this respect the Luxembourg Presidency will be straightforward; this was not something I was aware of before today’s sitting."
"I shall turn briefly to the Directive on the liberalisation of services, with regard to which I thought I had made my views clear."
"We will not reject this Directive, as it could in fact generate jobs if we draft it in a way that is appropriate to the situation."
"I would like us, however, to join forces to remove everything from this Directive which poses a risk of social dumping, and which has crept into the text if one reads between the lines."
"I am well aware that our discussion of this directive is bedevilled by confusion, because the potential risks posed by a number of its provisions are not obvious."
"I should therefore like to call on the Commission, the Council and Parliament to examine this draft directive line by line, searching for any risk of social dumping."
"After all, given that everyone, including Mr Bolkestein, tells me that the aim is not to violate the rules which protect our labour markets, we should be able to eliminate the risk of social dumping – a risk I believe to be very much present as far as this directive is concerned – by means of a common reading, if this is indeed our overall intention."
"That said, even if we had the opportunity to do so, the directive would not be adopted as it stands during the Luxembourg Presidency, as it requires amendment in several places."
"The Statute for Members will be adopted before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Mr Mote, you said that you would like to leave the European Union because it represents everything to which you are opposed and which you reject."
"I must say that I cannot agree with you on this point."
"The European Union represents everything I support, because I support understanding between peoples and European solidarity – a solidarity that must not be jeopardised by a flawed reform of the Financial Perspective that aims to destroy solidarity instruments."
"The European Union represents everything I support because I support peace."
"We have undergone untold suffering in Europe as a result of divisions between peoples."
"Even if you wish to leave the European Union, you cannot fail to support it."
". Mr President, I do not intend to return to issues we have already discussed during our debate."
"The Luxembourg Presidency has made its priorities quite clear."
"The Commission supports these priorities, and intends to work together with the presidency, all the Member States and the Council in a fair and constructive manner in order to achieve significant results during a six-month period that we regard as crucial."
"I would, however, like to turn to an issue which was not mentioned during our introductory speeches, but which has been raised by at least one Member, namely the issue of better lawmaking."
"We too support the fact that the Luxembourg Presidency intends to give priority to measures to improve the quality of legislation, and indeed this priority is specified in the presidency’s programme."
"The Cox report stresses that the quality of legislation is one of the key factors in improving the economic environment, but I should like to say that quite apart from the economic environment, better lawmaking is also a key factor in improving the European public’s understanding of and confidence in European integration."
"Better lawmaking relates not only to competitiveness, but also to citizenship."
"The public view of the European Union’s work is often marked by criticism of its bureaucratic and interventionist nature, and the fact that it is divorced from reality."
"Legislation should be simplified in a systematic and operational fashion, and the must be made easier to understand."
"Impact assessments are a key factor in ensuring that better preparations are made for crucial political decisions."
"Simpler and better prepared legislation is a prerequisite for greater understanding, and hence greater acceptance, of such legislation by our fellow citizens."
"I must also stress that implementation has become a critical aspect."
"If the EU and its Member States prove incapable of ensuring that directives are transposed rapidly and the respected, the credibility of EU action will be at stake."
"For its part, the Commission will focus renewed attention on violations of Community law and on the way in which infringements are dealt with."
"In conclusion, and turning to the review of the Lisbon strategy, I should like to say that divisions should not be seen where they do not exist."
"I believe that we all agree that economic competitiveness, the environment and social legislation are crucially important in this Europe of ours."
"The same cannot be said of competitiveness on a global scale, as this is an area where improvements could be made in relation to our partners."
"I do not honestly believe that we have a great deal to learn or to do to catch up with our partners as far as environment and social legislation is concerned, but much remains for us to do in the field of competitiveness, for example with regard to research and development."
"If one compares Europe – even the Europe of 15 before enlargement – to the United States and Japan with regard to investment in research into new technologies, for example, it can be seen that the investments made by the Europe of 15 only total one third of US investments, and are 30% less than Japanese investments."
"Yet investment in research and innovation for growth in Europe deserves to be a priority, and we are currently working with the Luxembourg Presidency and all the Member States to ensure that this is the case, namely that more targeted attention is paid to the most pressing issues."
"I am in no doubt that during this presidency we will all be able to adopt a revised Lisbon strategy, which will have greater force and be able to revive our European social model in a modernised form in order to guarantee the prosperity of our fellow citizens."
"The debate is closed."
"– This Presidency’s programme only manages not to be a complete disappointment because we did not expect much from its content anyway."
"We deplore the fact that it has overlooked some key issues."
"The programme says nothing about unemployment, even though it has worsened."
"It makes no commitment to take stock of the euro in the 12 Member States of the euro zone, despite increasing problems in most of those countries, not least in view of the currency’s overvaluation."
"It makes no commitment to demanding a review of the liberalisation of the textiles and clothing trade, or at least to using safeguard clauses for the most sensitive products."
"It makes no reference to the 60th anniversary of the defeat of fascism."
"As regards the Lisbon Strategy, it does not reach the right conclusions on the impact of the current situation; far from it."
"It pursues the same path of liberalisations and privatisations, of making jobs less secure and of attacks on public services."
"Similarly, it does not propose to repeal the Stability and Growth Pact and replace it with a Social Progress and Jobs Pact, in line with the objectives of full employment, sustainable economic development and economic and social cohesion."
"The next item is the Council and Commission Statements on the consequences of the tsunami disaster of 26 December 2004."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the unprecedented disaster that occurred on 26 December affected 12 countries and has claimed over 160 000 victims to date, without taking into account the thousands of missing persons, the large number of casualties and the many displaced or homeless persons, of whom there are estimated to be five million."
"Children who have been orphaned or separated from family members are particularly vulnerable in these circumstances."
"Sanitary conditions are a cause of great concern, and the extent of the material damage defies any attempt at calculation."
"Given the scale of the disaster, and in close cooperation with the Dutch Presidency, the Luxembourg Presidency reacted immediately after 26 December by visiting the area concerned on 1 January, along with the Commission."
"On the same day, the Luxembourg Minister for Health also contacted and met with officials from the WHO and the International Red Cross."
"On the basis of these first contacts with the United Nations and the countries affected, and following the extended emergency summit held in Jakarta, the presidency called a General Affairs and External Relations Council on 7 January, which brought together a great many ministers for foreign affairs, cooperation and health."
"The Council meeting of 7 January reiterated the European Union’s solidarity with the countries affected and with their citizens, whom it thanked – and this is a very important point – for the support they gave to European citizens present in those countries at the time of the disaster."
"The Council also paid tribute to the general spirit of solidarity that had been demonstrated by civil society and by the public."
"The Council meeting provided us with an opportunity to review both the many initiatives taken by the Commission and the Member States and the much-needed coordination of EU aid."
"We turned our joint attention to the best way of responding to the emergency in terms of financial, material and health aid, and the financial and operational resources which would be necessary and adequate for the subsequent stages of rehabilitation and reconstruction."
"Officials from UN agencies, namely the OCHA, the WHO and UNICEF, were invited to take part in this meeting."
"They provided the Council with additional information regarding the situation on the ground and the measures which had been taken, as well as an assessment of future needs."
"In this connection, it was stressed that the UN would play a central role in the coordination of aid."
"The main and most immediate outcomes of this Council meeting were as follows; with regard to financial issues, the Council announced that combined state aid from the European Union and the Member States for the victims of the tsunami currently stood at around EUR 1.5 billion, including both emergency aid and reconstruction aid."
"The Council noted, however, that this figure should not lead us to forget the general issue of development, humanitarian aid and the Millennium Development Goals, especially in Africa, nor to reduce the resources set aside for that purpose."
"With regard to health issues, the Member States were invited to combine their efforts under the auspices of the WHO, in order to prevent the risk of epidemics and to put in place health infrastructures by supplying appropriate materials and medical teams."
"The European Union and its Member States will act in support of the WHO."
"With regard to more long-term measures, the Council expressed its hope that the European Union’s capacity to deal with major disasters would be enhanced, and stated its intention to put in place the following instruments."
"The first of these instruments is a prevention strategy and an early-warning and rapid reaction system for disasters, particularly with a view to the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, which will be held in Kobe, in Japan, from 18 to 22 January."
"Secondly, improvements will be made to the civil protection mechanism and humanitarian aid, and analytical capacity enhanced."
"The Council hopes to build up rapid response capabilities for the European Union by putting in place appropriate structures for planning, coordination and resource mobilisation."
"The third such instrument is the stepping up of consular cooperation."
"Fourthly, there are other measures which the Council will need to examine, such as the development of an EU rapid response capability, or in other words an early-warning system."
"The setting up of a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps will also need to be assessed, and coordination within the European Union in the fields of rescue, evacuation and the transport of supplies and medical aid stepped up."
"Further measures include trade support and bilateral partnerships, such as the twinning of towns and hospitals, and, finally, the rescheduling of debt servicing for affected countries wishing to embark on such rescheduling."
"This should be an item on the agenda of the Ecofin Council to be held next week."
"The General Affairs Council of 31 January will return to all the measures and strategies envisaged by the EU and the Member States for the medium and long term, with a view to drawing up an operational action plan for the EU."
"On the evening of 7 January, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, the European Commissioner competent for such matters, myself and the ministers responsible for health and cooperation reported back to a large delegation from this House."
"This week, the presidency and the Commission will continue to hold an intensive dialogue with the relevant European Parliament bodies in order to implement the EU’s financial commitments, and I hope that during the General Affairs Council of 31 January we will be able to give concrete expression to some of the strategies sketched out during the General Affairs Council of 7 January."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the scale of the disaster in Asia leads us to reflect on the fragility of human life in the face of the force of nature and on how other matters pale in comparison with a human tragedy on this scale."
"It also makes us consider the nature of national- and European-level political action aimed at dealing with the impact of natural disasters such as this one."
"I feel that this is an appropriate time for us to think about our instruments and our policies and about the ways in which we coordinate our efforts and in which we share responsibilities among national authorities and European institutions."
"My trip to Jakarta last week gave me some sense of the actual scale of the tragedy caused by this earthquake and the tsunami that followed."
"The trip also confirmed to me that the international community, including the EU and the Commission, was capable of responding swiftly by raising substantial amounts of money and providing other forms of support."
"Commissioner Michel was shocked by what he saw when he was in the area."
"The giant wave completely swept away any human presence along 500 kilometres of coastline, destroying everything in its path and reaching places more than five kilometres inland."
"The biggest tragedy is that most of the population lived on the very coastal strip that was completely devastated."
"Similarly alarming stories have reached us from Sri Lanka, Thailand, India and the Maldives and the havoc caused in other, less accessible, countries, is only now coming to light. The tragedy also reached as far as the coast of Africa."
"This enormous natural disaster has left 150 000 dead in its wake, and more than 5 million people homeless and traumatised, who now have to face the challenge of picking up what remains of their devastated families, rebuilding their homes, restoring economic activities and, in short, trying to start their lives again."
"The scale of the disaster and the shocking images plastered on our televisions and newspapers sparked massive sympathy among our European citizens, who widely demanded a very quick and large-scale response."
"We should be proud of the European response."
"Europeans have provided a massive demonstration of solidarity, at the level of institutions and at the level of individual citizens."
"Overall European support for the victims and countries affected is by far the most important worldwide: Europe was the first donor to announce direct assistance;"
"European representatives were among the first on the ground."
"I want to praise all of those directly and indirectly involved in this enormous effort."
"As regards the management of the crisis, I want to highlight the excellent cooperation between the Commission and the Council presidency, in particular the cooperation of Prime Minister Juncker, and the European Parliament."
"We have shown how crucial it is to ensure sound and effective interinstitutional cooperation."
"In other emergency situations the Commission has had more time to discuss and prepare its response beforehand with Parliament and the Council, our budgetary authorities."
"In this case, we did not have that time."
"Within nine days of the waves striking the coastlines of Asia and Africa, the heads of government from the affected countries and the major donors were gathering in Jakarta to agree on how we would repair the damage and what funds we would make available."
"To prepare the ground within the limited time that we had, I discussed with President Borrell Fontelles and Prime Minister Juncker, before leaving for Jakarta, the Commission's proposal to pledge up to EUR 450 million."
"They were both very positive and supportive of the approach I proposed."
"Indeed, at the conference in Jakarta I mentioned a special message that President Borrell Fontelles sent me and asked me to transmit to the heads of state and government gathered there."
"Without having had an opportunity for detailed discussion in Parliament's plenary and the Council, I indicated to the pledging conference in Jakarta that the Commission's EUR 450 million pledge was conditional on its approval by the budgetary authorities and that includes you, the European Parliament."
"The Commission's priority today is to listen to your views, answer your questions and agree on how we can best tackle the two main tasks we now face, namely how to turn our conditional pledge rapidly into concrete money on the budget, and then to turn those funds into effective reconstruction programmes on the ground that will help people rebuild their shattered lives."
"While it is still early days, I should like to explain in more detail what I have in mind as to how best to use the Commission's pledge, if you and the Council agree to the funding that we have proposed."
"On the humanitarian side, the Commission has responded rapidly and very efficiently."
"Through our humanitarian assistance office, ECHO, we were one of the first organisations to respond to the disaster by making – EUR 23 million available – EUR 3 million of which were available on the day of the disaster itself – in humanitarian aid to the Red Cross and other partners for meeting essential needs."
"We reinforced ECHO staff on the ground, and our experts have been working closely with the United Nations and other donors to assess needs and ensure the coordination of the humanitarian aid effort on the ground."
"Commissioner Michel travelled to the most affected areas from 1 to 7 January to gather a first-hand impression and gauge needs for relief and rehabilitation."
"We have also been quick in mobilising civil protection."
"The European Civil Protection Mechanism, under the responsibility of Commissioner Dimas, has been active since the very first reports of the tsunami."
"Throughout the disaster, the European Commission's Monitoring and Information Centre has operated around the clock to mobilise and coordinate civil protection assistance from European Union Member States and neighbouring countries."
"The mechanism has proved to be a simple and efficient system that allows the targeting of assistance to the specific needs of each affected country."
"Within 24 hours of the disaster, the Centre sent assessment and coordination experts to Thailand and Sri Lanka."
"As Mr Kofi Annan has underlined, USD 1 billion will be needed immediately."
"In answer to this, I proposed, as part of the pledge, that another EUR 100 million be allocated from the emergency reserve to provide humanitarian assistance."
"I understand your committees have been discussing this proposal favourably and Commissioner Michel indicated our commitment at the United Nation's pledging conference held in Geneva yesterday."
"This also shows our full support for Parliament's approach of underlining the coordination role of the United Nations."
"On the reconstruction side, I proposed that EUR 350 million be made available."
"I envisage that part of this will come from fresh funds and part from a reprogramming of funds already planned for the affected countries."
"Although the reconstruction task will take several years, the financing of this reconstruction effort should be provided this year and next year."
"I understand that the word 'reprogramming' has caused some concern in Parliament."
"So why is the Commission proposing this?"
"The main reason is speed."
"The funds for projects planned for 2005 are already on the table and can be used for the urgent and immediate reconstruction work."
"Waiting for fresh funds to come on stream will take up to six months."
"We need to move with reconstruction funds now."
"All donors are responding in the same way, including the World Bank, to mobilise funds for the tsunami relief project as fast as possible."
"Moreover, I do not believe this approach will have any negative side effects."
"We may ask whether this will lead to a cancellation of projects already planned."
"The answer is no."
"If, like us, the governments decide that the tsunami-related project takes immediate priority, the originally-planned projects can be taken up in 2006 or 2007 under the new financial perspective; in some cases, the problem is that we cannot go on with the previous project for those regions because the tsunami has affected those regions, so we have to give priority to the tsunami-related projects."
"Will this lead to Asia robbing other regions of their funds?"
"The answer is no."
"Any projects that may be reprioritised and delayed in this way will be within the Asia envelope which, if necessary, will have to be readapted."
"I count on your support in this regard."
"Having seen the European Parliament's draft resolution, I can assure you that the 'poor across the world will not pay the price of this disaster'."
"Regarding cooperation development aid, the priority of the European Union clearly is, and will continue to be, Africa, on account of its structural needs, of which you are all aware."
"But this does not mean that we cannot proceed now by giving direct priority to the relief for this disaster."
"Let me give you some specific examples of how this reprogramming approach can be of immediate value."
"In Indonesia, the Commission has a EUR 35 million programme which aims to improve access and quality of healthcare at community level."
"If the government of Indonesia agrees, this can be extended quickly to help rebuild and strengthen healthcare facilities damaged by the tsunami."
"In Sri Lanka we are planning to cooperate with the World Bank on a housing programme to assist the resettlement of internally-displaced persons."
"Similarly, this programme could be broadened quickly to assist with the rehousing of families displaced by the tsunami."
"Whatever the level of new funding, I stress that the Commission needs to look at how planned projects can be reprogrammed in this way to ensure that we can respond to reconstruction within the critical first months."
"But the Commission's pledge was provisional and could be revisited once final costings have been made."
"We already know that needs are huge and there could be room for an even higher contribution of fresh funds if both Parliament and the Council agree to it."
"I fully support the line agreed in Jakarta that the countries must conduct assessments of need and create their own national tsunami reconstruction plans."
"That would identify the priority projects and the means to implement them."
"It is a matter of basic principle: allowing the countries to assume their own responsibility and ensuring that they coordinate all the generous commitments made."
"We should not flood the countries with hundreds of different facilities and instruments drawn up beforehand with donors or international financial institutions."
"Let us look at another principle that all donors and countries agreed in Jakarta: to deliver our support rapidly."
"I emphasised in Jakarta that the Commission would seek to explore all means at its disposal to turn its plans into effective programmes as quickly as possible."
"The General Affairs Council further lent its support to this commitment."
"This means accelerating our procedures as much as possible within the confines of the Financial Regulation so that unnecessarily heavy bureaucracy does not slow us down."
"I saw how rapidly and efficiently the countries have already moved in helping their citizens."
"It is impressive!"
"As such, we should provide the bulk of our aid as budget support, giving the countries the tools to rebuild their destroyed infrastructure and to restore the livelihoods of their shattered communities."
"This approach is the only way in which the affected countries can coordinate the aid efficiently."
"It would be an impossible task for them if the hundreds of donors gave their aid separately and all demanded that their own procedures be followed."
"However, budget support must be properly supervised if we are to have the comfort of sound financial management of our funds."
"To this end, I support the initiative of the World Bank and the other international financial institutions to develop trust funds with the countries concerned, effectively creating a common pot into which donors can put funds along with a common set of rules for implementing, monitoring and auditing, which will guide the management of the funds."
"The Commission will also need to address punctual and particular projects that will be better delivered by direct implementation rather than by passing through the national budgets."
"For example, some specific work may be started in the humanitarian phase that could usefully be continued under the initial reconstruction phase."
"Alternatively, there may be specific conditions that prevent easy access for the national budget to certain geographical regions or, indeed, to the poorest communities who must benefit from this reconstruction."
"Such cases would also warrant the continued channelling of part of our funds through NGOs."
"The European Commission has been active from day one on all fronts, from humanitarian aid to civil protection and, increasingly so, to rehabilitation and reconstruction."
"We will pursue our efforts relentlessly."
"However, we will also reflect on improvements, new ideas and solutions."
"We will reply to the Council's requests for proposals and put forward innovative tools."
"In doing so, our main concern will be to find solutions that provide effectiveness and good use of available capacities in the Member States and European institutions, optimising means and technologies at European level."
"Creating new structures for the sake of it is not an option; making better use of the vast existing European capacity in a coordinated and articulated manner is the way forward."
"We will also be particularly attentive to the European dimension of our initiatives and will be keen to make it more visible to the general public and to the beneficiaries."
"Solidarity is a trademark of the European Union."
"Let it be experienced also in times of crisis."
"I recognise the importance Parliament places on additional measures beyond aid that the European Union can provide further to help the countries affected by the tsunami."
"You can rest assured that all Commission departments are mobilised in their particular areas to investigate what can be done in this regard."
"This includes support for the G8 debt moratorium initiatives, the investigation of possible trade initiatives to ease trade access to the Union for the countries concerned and working with the governments to seek to facilitate the implementation of the European Investment Bank's Indian Ocean Tsunami Facility."
"The Member States and Commission agreed in the General Affairs Council to offer direct support to the countries in their efforts to develop early-warning systems so they will be better able to respond to future disasters."
"I noted with interest the ideas being floated on the possibility of supplying fishing vessels from the Commission, that is to say, European Union fleets to the fishing communities in the affected countries."
"The idea is very appealing."
"We have all seen pictures of boats wrecked by the tsunami, and our own fishing industry is about to destroy boats from its own fleet in line with fishery limits."
"My services are currently exploring whether vessels are available, what state of repair they are in, if they meet the need of the fishing communities in the tsunami-affected areas, and how they could be made available to these fishermen."
"I hope that this initiative will work and we will report back to you with the results of our work."
"The Commission is also considering proposals for a new European Union approach to reinforce capacity for disaster prevention and, as discussed in the extraordinary Council meeting last Friday, we intend to look at early-warning mechanisms and preparation for disaster management, the ways to further improve the Commission's humanitarian aid provision, and civil protection, with a view to developing our rapid response to crises in third countries in full respect of the specificity and principles of humanitarian aid."
"In this context, the Commission is preparing a proposal for the development of a rapid response capacity of the European Union, which will permit it to enhance its assistance in future humanitarian disasters and other crises."
"We expect to present that proposal at the Council meeting on 31 January 2005."
"In every successful emergency programme organised by the Commission, Parliament has played a pivotal role."
"In this regard, I think of Afghanistan or the Balkans."
"This role is not simply to agree on funding, but to follow the programme and to lend political weight where needed to ensure that the programme's political goals remain on track."
"Your attention could also focus on the administrative resources – in headquarters and in delegations – necessary for effective delivery."
"I am confident that you will play an important role in facilitating the Commission's programme of reconstruction after the tsunami."
"To this end, I will undertake that the Commission will report to you regularly on progress, both in plenary and in committees."
"The College had an extensive discussion yesterday on the Asian crisis and on how we should organise our follow-up to the work done so far."
"By the end of this month, I expect to present Commission proposals for an improved European crisis response capability."
"Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner will go to the region in the coming weeks to further assess needs and to put more flesh on this proposal."
"I will propose that she report to Parliament on her return."
"We have set high targets for the European Union's response to the South Asian crisis, both in Jakarta and in United Nations meetings in Geneva."
"The outpouring of support from our private citizens for this crisis further shows their support for the full commitment of all European Union institutions to deliver on the promises we have made."
"We must provide answers and I count on your support in helping the Commission to deliver."
"I give you my promise to work closely with you in the massive task ahead of us."
"I would like to thank both the Council and the Commission for the extensive information they have given us on this tragic event; in particular, I would like to expressly acknowledge the way in which the President of the Commission has coordinated his work perfectly with the Presidency of Parliament in the meetings that have taken place and I would also like to thank him, in particular, for including two Members of this Parliament in the delegation at the Geneva Conference, which will undoubtedly help us to carry out the work of each institution in a more coordinated and speedy manner."
"Mr President, I have just returned from Sri Lanka, where I witnessed many of the dreadful sights that we have all seen on television. As a Sri Lankan-born Member of this Parliament, I wish to express my gratitude to all those who have responded so generously to appeals, and especially for the help given by the peoples of Europe; my own country, Britain, in particular; and my constituents in the south-east of England."
"The EU and its Member States have together pledged almost EUR 1.5 billion so far."
"The amount continues to rise."
"The Commission and Parliament have sanctioned EUR 23 million and promised funds of EUR 350 million, although EUR 150 million of that is not new money, but will be taken from existing long-term developments."
"This must be reviewed."
"I also welcome the proposal for a lending facility of EUR 1 billion from the European Investment Bank."
"We must deliver the aid which we have promised."
"In the past the international community has not done so."
"A rapid reaction civilian corps for aid delivery, as proposed by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, is most welcome."
"Our aid must be visible."
"I was embarrassed in Sri Lanka because EU aid was immediately delivered, but was done so invisibly, despite Commissioner Michel being extremely visible and hands-on."
"The United Nations and NGOs only act as coordinators and do not pretend to be the donors."
"Our taxpayers demand visibility."
"Ownership matters."
"We must also ensure that aid is not stolen – yes, stolen!"
"Where the appropriate systems do not exist in the recipient countries, aid will be stolen unless we ensure that delivery mechanisms are totally transparent and accountable."
"There is currently an urgent need for small, suitable boats to be donated."
"I am glad that President Barroso mentioned that."
"Early warning procedures are also needed before the next disaster happens."
"An authenticated telephone call to CNN and the other broadcast networks could have saved thousands of lives in Sri Lanka, Somalia and Thailand."
"After all, the Americans evacuated Diego Garcia."
"However, that telephone call did not come."
"This does not only apply to Asia."
"How would people in Europe be warned if, let us say, volcanic activity in the Canary Islands caused a tsunami?"
"Will the Commission prepare an urgent report?"
"In Sri Lanka I hope that reconstruction will also mean reconciliation and that aid will be consistent with the December 2002 Oslo talks and the Tokyo Donor Conference expectations."
"We should expect no less for Indonesia, with its Aceh separatists."
"We must remember that it is trade and investment, not aid, which will sustain the people in the long term."
"The devastation is limited to the coastal areas and the countries of south Asia are still open for business."
"Let us all work together, not only to repair the destruction, but also to give the victims a hand up and not merely a hand-out."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not believe that there is anything substantial to be added to what has been said by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Asselborn, and by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso."
"Both the Commission and the Council have described the essential steps that have to be taken."
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament can say that we endorse all these initiatives, and that this House must grant all the financial and organisational support that is needed."
"I think everyone – including Mr Deva, who has just spoken – has made it clear that, as far as Parliament is concerned, both the economic resources and the organisational measures are guaranteed."
"I can therefore limit myself to making a few basic observations on this disaster, which has made it apparent that we live in a global village and that the solidarity that is self-evidently necessary in the world in which we live must be supranational in character."
"That is why it is important that we revisit, and establish in our own minds, the decisive importance of the role played by the EU itself alongside the Member States, for it is in the European Union that Europeans’ willingness to join in supranational action manifests itself, and that this international action organised under the European Union’s aegis results in action being taken across continents is a necessary consequence of the fact that a disaster of this kind knows no geographical limit to its impact, afflicting not only the people who live where it strikes, but also people from every country, including from the European Union."
"New forms of organisation are thus called for, and they are coming into being."
"One of them has been proposed by the Commission: the combination of a rapid-response unit, rapid-response forces, and technical expertise, organised under the leadership of the European Union."
"That is an intelligent proposal and one that is deserving of support."
"It has been proposed that financial instruments be organised alongside those of the nation states, and that is something we cannot do without, but it is equally clear that people like Europeans, from a highly mobile society, cannot do without consular help in such a situation."
"So it is that the development of a joint consular system, potentially paving the way for a shared diplomatic service, is something good to come out of this debate."
"By way of a concluding comment, let me say that, in amidst the flood of information I have received over the past few days, there is one outstanding piece of news."
"A few months ago, in this House, we commemorated the victims of the terrorist attack in Beslan."
"I learned this morning that the people of Beslan have collected a million roubles – amounting to EUR 30 000 – as an expression of solidarity with the tsunami’s victims."
"In a situation like theirs, there can be no greater example of humane conduct, of solidarity, indeed of human greatness."
"I think we should take this opportunity to express our utmost respect for the people of Beslan, who have themselves been victims."
". Mr President, this is a global tragedy requiring a global response."
"It provides an opportunity to reassert the role and the benefit of multilateral action through the United Nations, but also a challenge to the United Nations to prove itself up to the task."
"Thus far, its response has been promising."
"The response of the European Union, too, has put us on to a good start, and I salute the prompt action of Commissioner Michel and the support that his colleagues gave."
"European Union aid, both public and private, has been impressive in its generosity."
"ECHO funds were released rapidly in the aftermath of the disaster."
"Total pledges now amount to EUR 540 million, plus a EUR 1 billion lending facility."
"Though, to be honest, one-third of that grant aid is reprogrammed from existing development aid for the region."
"Let us make sure that these pledges are honoured – only two per cent of the USD 1 billion pledged to the reconstruction of the Iranian city of Bam after the earthquake there has been spent."
"Let us not be complacent, for the present ECHO can act as a financier."
"In the longer term we must have the potential to send troops, ships, floating hospitals and helicopters to assist in disaster relief."
"More than 150 000 people have lost their lives, whole communities have been wiped out."
"Five million more people are injured or have lost their homes, livelihoods or families."
"Many are children at risk of falling prey to child traffickers and others."
"Goodwill abroad notwithstanding, children from those devastated communities should not be removed from the societies and traditions that they know."
"Unicef and others must act swiftly to provide the shelter, protection and registration that those children need if they are to rebuild their lives and perhaps, eventually, be traced by relatives."
"This tragedy has called forth a major response in donations from individuals a world away, to families of victims they have never met, yet wish to help, reminding us how small our global community is."
"Let us build on this opportunity to set aside our differences."
"The stricken countries will pay more this year in trade tariffs than we will grant them in aid."
"That should give us cause for reflection on our trading policies."
"We need close monitoring of the aid to make sure it is not used to fuel regional conflicts and is not diverted by corrupt local officials."
"Let us have a scoreboard for EU reconstruction efforts, just as the United Nations must have a tracking system for aid channelled through its agencies."
"And let the Commission extend its lead in coordinating the Union's response."
"If each Member State contributed an expert in humanitarian aid to ECHO, a central resource would exist with expertise in the response capacity of different national facilities."
"Finally, one clear lesson from this is our frailty in the face of the forces of nature."
"We cannot tame them, but we can collectively mitigate their devastation."
"We have the technology to detect earthquakes in the world's danger spots."
"Providing it to regions at risk can be achieved at modest expense and perhaps save hundreds of thousands of lives."
". Ladies and gentlemen, holding debates in the aftermath of a disaster is always difficult, because on the one hand emotions are running high, and yet on the other political lessons must be learned from what has happened."
"Could you please either quieten down or go and have a coffee, and come back when we have finished discussing the important issues?"
"Would that be possible?"
"There is a bar outside, where you can go and get as drunk as you like."
"Thank you."
"I apologise, Mr President."
"I should like to say that my group supports the proposal presented by the Commission and the Council to enhance the European Union’s civilian intervention capacities."
"This disaster has shown us that, although much-needed, national interventions alone were unable to respond to a disaster of such magnitude. It also showed that civilian intervention capacities should cover not only humanitarian civilian intervention but also political civilian intervention, or in other words intervention in support of conflict prevention."
"We cannot intervene in Indonesia without intervening in the conflict which is taking place there, and we cannot help Sri Lanka without intervening in the military conflict which is going on there."
"Intervention in support of conflict prevention and humanitarian intervention are intimately linked, and we support the Commission’s views on this matter."
"I should like to suggest to other Members that the money they receive for this sitting should be donated to help the victims of the disaster."
". – Mr President, I have the impression that the media spotlight on the tragedy in the Far East has not yet been turned off and already the emphatic declarations of solidarity are giving way to more cynical economic and geopolitical interests."
"Mr Barroso has tried to carry out a sleight of hand, but he is not a good conjurer."
"The word ‘reprogramming’ means using funds that had already been allocated to aid, and so I call for all the EUR 350 million for the first stage of reconstruction to be a new appropriation and for the total of EUR 1.5 billion that is to be paid out by the European Union and the 25 Member States to be donated without any kind of interest."
"I have heard calls in this Chamber to take account of the foreign debt of the countries affected by the tsunami."
"I believe we should state clearly that the only practicable possibility is to cancel their foreign debt."
"We are talking about countries like Indonesia, which has more than USD 130 billion in debts and repaid USD 13 billion in 2002."
"Given figures like those, our donations cannot provide any practical aid unless we cancel the debt."
"I have not yet heard anybody mention an attempt to change the immigration rules, at least temporarily: I refer to the possibility for immigrants from the affected nations who are already living in Europe to be able to return home, see the situation for themselves, look for their loved ones and then be able to come back to the Union, without running the risk of losing their residence permit or job."
"I also refer to the possibility of offering residence permits, at least temporary ones, to all those who have been hurt during this tragedy."
". – Mr President, we have to deal with three issues in the wake of this disaster:"
"First, how this solidarity can be better expressed; in other words, how much money from European citizens will reach citizens in this devastated area, without being siphoned off by middlemen, para-governmental organisations and contractors."
"Secondly, we need to respond to certain complaints from newspapers in the Middle East to the effect that it was allegedly preceded by a nuclear test."
"We must not allow something like this to be raised, even as a ridiculous eventuality."
"We must first check if any such nuclear test was carried out."
"Thirdly, we must examine in depth what is happening in our area."
"Here, the Commission is cutting money from earthquake research and giving it to space research."
"However, if a similar earthquake occurred here, in the Mediterranean, the tsunami would reach the Alps and would flatten Greece, Italy, Malta, Cyprus, France, Spain and other countries."
"We therefore need to look at what we can do in this direction."
"Let the misfortune of south-east Asia be a lesson."
"As Hippocrates said 2 500 years ago, prevention is better than cure, and that makes sense."
"However, I do not know if there is any sense in the people at the Commission who are cutting money for earthquake research and giving it to space research."
"Let us do something in our own area, before it all ends in tears here too."
". – Mr President, the key lesson to be learnt from the Indian Ocean disaster is the crucial and urgent need to equip the European Union with civil protection."
"The events of recent days should make us give the matter serious consideration: Europe with its 25 Member States, its almost half a billion people and its single currency just looked on, stunned, dismayed and impotent, while the peoples that had been affected called out for immediate, practical and effective aid."
"Where was the European civil protection mentioned in the action plan drawn up in 1999?"
"What did the European Monitoring Centre achieve?"
"Where was the civil protection task force set up by the Council of the European Union in October 2001 precisely to guarantee rapid intervention even outside Europe?"
"Why did the Commission decide to leave the 300 experts in the European task force at home during the tsunami disaster after training and preparing them for years?"
"Perhaps now is not the time for polemics, but it should at least be put on record – as we have been demanding for the last three years – that what Europe needs is not coordination and pooling of resources, but a civil protection agency, an autonomous body that is versatile and thus able to anticipate needs and take action when and where it is required."
"That is what Parliament should be proposing, starting with tomorrow’s resolution, if we do not want to carry on pretending that nothing has happened or thinking that solidarity is just an empty promise."
"The debate is interrupted for voting time and will resume at 3 p.m."
"The next item is the vote."
". Mr President, on behalf of the 25 Heads of State or Government who signed the Constitutional Treaty on 29 October 2004, I should like to express my delight at the fact that the European Parliament has approved this Treaty by a very large majority."
"This is an important moment in the history of this House, and an important moment on Europe’s path towards the ratification of this new Constitution."
"I would like to call on the national parliaments and the public to make known their views on this ratification in referendums wherever possible."
"I say this in my name and in the name of the overwhelming majority of Europeans."
"Mr President, while the vote on Article 6 was being taken, I was addressed by a member of the Convention and mistakenly cast a ‘no’ vote."
"I would like to make it clear that I am in favour of Article 6, am voting in favour of it, and am happy to see the Constitutional Treaty adopted."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, we shall now proceed to the explanations of vote."
"– Mr President, thank you for allowing me to speak to explain my vote after the sitting was suspended by the President."
"I confirm that I voted for the report by Mr Manuel Medina Ortega on civil liability in motor vehicle accidents, which unfortunately occur all over Europe."
"I should like to request that, in his next reports on this topic, Mr Medina Ortega, a lawyer, should think of protecting the elderly. When the elderly are injured in road accidents, they do not receive compensation because they cannot earn an income on account of their age."
"I believe the fact that they are elderly does not mean they do not have a right to compensation for any injuries they sustain."
". The purpose of the proposal before us is to update the minimum amounts of compulsory cover, within the framework of Community harmonisation on this matter, in the directive in question on motor vehicle security."
"The main problem with this proposal is that of striking a balance between, on the one hand, the need to improve victim protection cover – cover for personal and material damage – in the event of a car accident involving a car of relatively low value and the fact, on the other hand, that improvement in cover of this nature will result in a rise in insurance premiums, when the ‘prices’ charged by insurers are not monitored."
"A further aspect of this issue is the general problem of harmonisation when economic situations vary from country to country. This must be taken into account, especially in southern countries, such as Portugal, which have always had reservations on this issue."
"Portugal has had a transitional period in which to adapt national legislation."
"The common position provides for a further transitional period of five years, which I believe strikes a better balance."
"Nevertheless, the proposals to raise minimum amounts to EUR 1 million per victim and EUR 5 million per event, regardless of the number of victims, is excessive, particularly the latter."
". I hope this proposal will be successful in its aims of modernising and improving the existing EU rules in the field of motor insurance."
"There are clear advantages for drivers in having a coherent framework for the recognition of their insurance policies and claims across frontiers."
"This report should also add clarity to what legal assistance drivers are entitled to following an accident."
"I hope the dispute over 'vehicle and trailer' issues does not stop this being adopted without need for conciliation."
". I voted in favour of the Recommendation for Second Reading by Mr Medina Ortega (A6-0073/2004) on civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles."
"The development of the internal market, and the increase in Community traffic have meant that for ten years we have needed to update the rules in force."
"It was therefore necessary to update and strengthen protection through compulsory cover for victims of accidents caused by one motor vehicle, and to ensure greater convergence in the way in which Member States interpret and implement the directive."
"With this fifth Directive it will be easier to obtain effective and valid civil liability insurance outside the country of residence, and to sell or buy a vehicle in another Member State."
"Furthermore, this text increases legal protection for the victims of accidents."
"I also feel that it is extremely important to highlight Parliament’s proposal as regards a transitional period of up to five years to enable Member States to adapt to the minimum cover amounts."
". Insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles is extremely important to European citizens either as the insured or as the victims of an accident."
"The draft legislative resolution updates and enhances protection for victims of road accidents through compulsory insurance; it plugs gaps and clarifies provisions in directives so as to ensure greater convergence in the way in which the Member States interpret and implement them; and it provides for solutions to problems that often arise, in order to ensure a more efficient internal market in the area of car insurance."
"In so doing, it contributes towards modernising and updating European insurance law and, at the same time, looks after the consumers’ interests and ensures that those consumers will enjoy a higher level of cover."
"The legislative resolution is thus in line with measures to strengthen protection for the victims of road accidents and seeks to ensure that the injured party is duly reimbursed."
"I hope, however, that some flexibility will ultimately prevent a sudden sharp rise in insurance premiums."
"I also feel it is extremely important that legislative efforts be made to prevent the use of delaying tactics to renege on the liability guaranteed in the transfer of risk contract."
"My vote is in line with the consensus that was reached yesterday in the trialogue."
"– Mr President, while I was voting for the Constitution for Europe – and I was pleased to vote in favour of it – I dozed off;"
"I do not know why: perhaps it was the calm way in which Mr Borrell Fontelles conducts voting."
"As I was dozing off I saw you, Mr Onesta, telling me that I must vote for the Constitution, and when I asked, ‘Why must I vote for it?’ you replied, ‘You represent the pensioners, after all!’"
"We have to realise that this Constitution, which incorporates the Charter of Fundamental Rights, gives the elderly the right to be seen as deserving the same rights as the young, the same rights as workers."
"While declaring that I voted for the Constitution, I would also express the hope there will not be any discrimination of any kind against the elderly in Europe."
"Mr President, the fact that we unequivocally reject this European Constitution does not mean that we are opposed to further European cooperation – the contrary is the case."
"We do, however, resist the European big brother state, which is the precise opposite of what is laid down in this Constitution, namely respect for the subsidiarity principle."
"Since we Flemings live within the Belgian federal state, we are experiencing first-hand how difficult, not to say impossible, it is to have good governance within a federal state."
"When we now notice that with this Constitution, the European Union will increasingly resemble a kind of enlarged Belgium with extensive intervention in competences that, in our view, are strictly national, including culture, language legislation, and social security – to name but a few – then that is more than a bridge too far for us."
"We are in favour of Europe but not of European uniformity."
"Needless to say, we have voted against this European Constitution for those reasons, as well as many others."
"Mr President, when I voted in favour of the Corbett report, it was not because I thought the Constitution was the end of the story. At the same time, however, I did not think it was the result of chance."
"What firstly crossed my mind were the lengthy struggles that preceded the 1949 European Convention on Human Rights and the 1961 European Social Charter, with the latter being backed by all the trade unions."
"These have now borne fruit in the shape of Part Two of the Constitutional Treaty, which contains the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Above all, however, my thoughts turned to the real father of the Constitution, Altiero Spinelli, whose name is not mentioned nearly enough. Spinelli, a member of the Communist Youth who was put under house arrest for ten years by Mussolini, anticipated today’s text right from the European Parliament’s first term as a directly-elected body."
"Another name to cross my mind was that of Mr Duhamel, who during the last parliamentary term prompted us to hold a public Convention in order to draft this Constitutional Treaty. I therefore came to the conclusion that, as a left-winger, I could lend my support to this draft Constitutional Treaty today without any qualms, as it will open a promising page in the history of the EU."
"Mr President, I voted to adopt the Constitution, but at the same time I wish to express my unhappiness that our Christian heritage is hardly mentioned."
"In the debate on the subject there has been a general misunderstanding of the nature of the mention it gets."
"This is not a matter of a declaration of faith, but an acknowledgement of the basis of our ethical infrastructure."
"God does not need the protection afforded by the articles in the Constitution – it is not a question of that – but human beings do."
"Defence of the weak cannot be justified in an Aristotelian way, with merely rational arguments."
"For that reason, I think we ought to have acknowledged the role of Christianity behind the concept of European humanity."
"The type of humanism we know today owes much to the Christian image of humanity that emphasises the value of the individual."
"We need a firm basis for our great dreams of a fair Europe."
"Hopefully we will be able to continue to help it develop."
"Mr President, it is, of course, impossible, within the space of one minute, to list all the reasons why I have voted against the report on the European Constitution."
"I will therefore confine myself to the essence, namely that it is nation states that have constitutions, and not a body such as the European Union, unless, of course, the intention is to turn the European Union into a federalist superstate, in which case they should not count on the support of the ."
"Not everything in the Constitutional Treaty is bad – on the contrary – but there is no doubt that a number of simplifications and clarifications could have been carried out by means of a new European treaty of the traditional kind."
"This Constitution, above all, leads to new transfers of competences to the EU and more European interference."
"Moreover, in view of the probable accession of Turkey, a country which will considerably shake up the functioning of all institutions, the text is already superseded before it is ratified in the Member States."
"Mr President, I would like to say that I think there is something very unusual about the way in which statements of vote are being dealt with in this instance."
"The report on which we have just voted states that: ‘the greatest advances brought by the Constitution are to be found in the specific area of common security policy’."
"That is the principal reason why I reject this Constitutional Treaty for the EU."
"Its Article I-41, paragraph 3 states that ‘the Member States are obliged to progressively improve their military capacities’, which means that the EU’s Member States are obliged to rearm."
"When we turn to foreign and military policy, we find that the Constitutional Treaty evidently aims to equip the European Union to wage global war."
"Article I-41, paragraph 1, states that the Treaty is intended to secure operational capacity drawing on military assets, so that the Treaty makes rearmament an obligation."
"An armaments agency is to be set up to monitor all this and to implement appropriate measures to strengthen the industrial and technological basis of the defence sector."
"I think there is a whole array of other points demonstrating why the Constitutional Treaty, which militarises the European Union, must be rejected."
"That is what I wanted this statement of vote to make clear."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Constitutional Treaty represents significant progress in the process of bringing Europe together, and that is why I voted in favour of it."
"At the same time, there are aspects of it that give me cause for concern, one of them being the open coordination method as cooperation – with non-binding legal status – between Member States in the fields of social and employment policy, research policy, health policy and industrial policy."
"The Commission is now, in these areas, empowered to take the initiative in enacting guidelines and action plans."
"What this means in practice is that policy initiatives – new ones – are taken first, and then the related powers and responsibilities may be created."
"The open coordination method represents the incipient transfer to the European level of what were formerly national areas of activity and blurs the demarcation of powers and responsibilities between Europe and the Member States."
"Competition between the Member States is necessary, but this process is likely, to say the least, to shut it down."
"Mr President, I wish to make a statement on the way I voted."
"I voted in favour of the Convention because, despite my misgivings about it, it represents an improvement on the present situation and the law as it stands."
"I am saddened, though, that this Constitution contains no reference to God."
"It is a disappointment to me, and to millions of European citizens, that the 25 Heads of Government and this Parliament did not have the will or the strength to get a reference to the Deity inserted."
"A European Constitution would have benefited from it being stated in the preamble that we are responsible for actions both to God and to man."
"Another reason, though, why I voted in favour of the Constitution, was that its Article 57 makes it possible for Turkey and other countries to be offered a long-term and privileged partnership in the context of special relationships."
"It is my hope that it will prove possible to incorporate the reference to the Deity in the Constitution at a later date."
". With the European Constitution, Europe wants to make Europe more democratic and more transparent."
"This is exemplified by Parliament’s reinforced role in the decision-making process, the confirmation and strengthening of the subsidiarity principle, the creation of one uniform legal framework and the simplification of the legislative instruments."
"The extension of Europe’s competences to include defence and asylum policy, and the definition of the European values are important new departures in the Constitution."
"The Constitution is a step forward."
"A timid one, yes, but it is still a step forward."
"That is why the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) supports this step because it stands for a more democratic and transparent Europe, a Europe with a strong public culture built from the bottom up and supported by its citizens."
"At the same time, the N-VA regards the Constitution as a missed opportunity."
"Although three-quarters of European regulations are implemented at local and regional level, the involvement of those regional authorities that implement them is minimal."
"The regions that make up Europe are not allocated a single (formal) role in the European decision-making process."
"Apart from a noncommittal paragraph concerning the recognition of the national identity of the Member States, in this Constitution, the Union completely overlooks the institutional reality in various Member States."
"The continuing denial of this regional dimension is at odds with the idea of subsidiarity."
". I welcome the progress made in the Constitutional Treaty with regard to development and international solidarity, the principle of which is enshrined as one of the EU’s fundamental values."
"For the first time, this Treaty includes a separate chapter on cooperation with third countries and on humanitarian aid."
"It emphasises objectives pertaining to this policy, namely the eradication of poverty, the promotion of health and the fight against infectious diseases."
"It gives priority to children’s rights, and makes a great deal of progress with regard to women’s rights and their key role in development."
"The European Union has therefore reached a significant milestone, by acknowledging in its Constitutional Treaty that solidarity cannot be limited to its own territory and its own citizens, but should extend beyond its borders."
"I have a number of concerns, of course, particularly with regard to the lack of any reference to ‘global public goods’, an issue upon which I put forward proposals."
"Together with my Socialist colleagues, however, I intend to continue the fight to put into action and practice that which we were unable to put in the text of the Treaty."
"This positive and balanced report gives the Treaty a favourable verdict. It is very disappointing, however, that it does not take account of the opinion of Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries, the only European body with specific powers in the area of fisheries which discussed the amendments introduced to the conservation of marine biological resources."
"As the Committee on Fisheries concluded, ‘within the context of the other exclusive competences of the EU which are detailed in the draft Constitution, the inclusion of the conservation of marine biological resources is anomalous and unjustified’."
"Unlike the other areas in which the Treaty has undergone substantial amendments, marine biological resources are not solely the institutional concern of politicians."
"They are the concern of the maritime communities, fishermen, scientists and environmentalists, whose opinions should never have been ignored."
"Indeed, an opinion poll in Portugal found that only 4% of the public supported this solution, as opposed to 86% in favour of shared or national power."
"The conservation of marine biological resources cannot be anybody’s specific competence."
"It is the duty of every citizen, and in particular of the citizens who depend on those resources for their livelihoods, people who cannot be ignored by the European institutions and by the representatives of the Member States."
"I trust that this ‘unjustified anomaly’ will soon be rectified."
"The Moderate delegation has today voted in favour of the report on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, A6-0070/2004."
"We believe that the Constitutional Treaty should respect the institutional balance."
"We therefore reject the proposals to introduce an elected President of the Council and to have the President of the Commission elected by the European Parliament."
"We are also opposed to the procedure laid down in Article IV-444 and generally known as the passerelle, because we consider it fundamental that changes to the Treaty be ratified by each Member State before they enter into force."
"The Constitutional Treaty makes the basic rules governing cooperation in the European Union easier to understand."
"We are in favour of the greater weight given to subsidiarity, and we support the wordings that re-confirm and further develop the national parliaments’ role in European cooperation."
"EU law, as it has been in force and been applied, is affirmed when it comes to the relationship between EU law and national law; that is to say, Community law takes precedence over national law, account always being taken however of the Member States’ constitutional traditions."
"The limits of the EU’s competence are also clarified, and the legislative procedure simplified."
"We therefore support the proposed Constitutional Treaty."
". I fully support this report and eventually support adoption of the draft Constitution."
"The Constitution was drafted in a uniquely democratic process and putting in place a Constitution for Europe by way of a binding treaty between sovereign states is the most important European decision citizens will make."
"Four European treaties in less than 15 years have resulted in many undoubted European successes: the single market, the euro, the accession of eastern European countries, rising environmental standards, greater equality between women and men, and anti-poverty and full employment strategies, to name but a few."
"But it had become increasingly obvious, particularly since the Nice European Summit in 2000, that the old intergovernmental method of revising European Treaties did not enable adequate European responses to the common challenges facing us to emerge, nor did it enable citizens to feel that the process belonged to them."
"Europe’s institutional framework still needed to be overhauled, decision-making had to be made more democratic and brought closer to the citizens and Europe had to meet its responsibilities to the rest of the world, especially the developing world if the project is to help in bringing the globalisation process under democratic control."
". I applaud the quality of the report on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"Whilst the Constitution falls short of what Parliament wanted and has enshrined controversial issues, such as the question – extremely important to Madeira and the Azores – of the Union’s exclusive competences in the area of the conservation of marine biological resources, against which a number of opposing views were raised at the Convention, and in the opinion on the Constitution issued by the Committee on Fisheries, I do acknowledge that it represents a welcome compromise and an improvement on the Treaties in force, as mentioned by the joint rapporteurs, and is a significant step towards achieving the European project, from the point of view of both the Member States and the citizens of Europe."
"I also wish to highlight the Constitution’s approach to the status of the outermost regions. Not only does the Constitution maintain and strengthen the possibility of modulating the implementation of all European policies to the outermost regions, but it is also confirmed that this article constitutes a valid legal basis that is sufficient to underpin the development of a genuine policy for the outermost regions."
"I shall be voting in favour of adopting the Constitution. I call for it to be ratified and I am committed to the campaign for it to be implemented."
". I abstained from voting on this report for several reasons."
"To begin with, I cannot vote in favour of this resolution because my criticisms of the Constitution outnumber by far the very few aspects of it which could be regarded as slight progress."
"In addition to my grave doubts regarding the construction of a social and political Europe, my most serious criticism relates to the fact that the task of a constitution is to allocate powers and to outline citizens’ rights and duties."
"The policies and ideological choices set out in the Constitutional Treaty have no place in a constitution, and they preclude any possibility of different policies being implemented."
"Furthermore, only one goal was pursued in the drafting of this report, namely that nothing but the positive and ‘progressive’ aspects of the Constitution be mentioned."
"This exclusion of all criticism, no matter how minor, stands in stark contrast to the reservations voiced by this House when the previous resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference was adopted."
"I am not convinced that either this resolution or this Treaty will make it possible to involve our fellow citizens more in European integration, or to respond to their calls for justice, equality and democracy."
". Today’s vote in Parliament on the draft of the new Constitution is part of the sad process of obfuscation and propaganda surrounding the so-called European Constitution; this is, in a word, manipulation."
"Parliament has no legitimacy whatsoever to ‘adopt’ Treaties, as Point 6 of this resolution would have us believe."
"Disingenuously and in collusion, most of Parliament’s right wing, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and social democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, are thus seeking to spread the false idea that the draft Treaty has been ‘adopted’ by Parliament – as some media organisations will erroneously report before, let us not forget, any national referendum on this draft has been held."
"The intention is clear: to use today’s vote as yet another means of exerting pressure and spreading propaganda in favour of the loathsome so-called European Constitution in the process of its ratification – or rejection! – by the Member States."
"It is disgraceful that this vote was accompanied by music being played, by balloons being let off and by banners and flags being unfurled ‘with the above-mentioned key words and ‘yes’ in various languages’, thereby silencing any criticism of this draft."
". The Corbett report, upon which the European Parliament gave its verdict today, acknowledges the indisputable progress made by the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"The Treaty provides us with a number of tools that are essential if we wish to make Europe more efficient, easier to understand and more democratic."
"It does so by clarifying the roles of the institutions, reducing the scope for blocking decisions and increasing the powers of the European Parliament and of its representatives, who have been elected by popular vote."
"At the same time, it fosters Community solidarity and helps ensure genuine cohesion within the EU."
"Firstly, it helps ensure social cohesion thanks to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which lays down rules relating to civic, political and social rights."
"The Treaty also declares Europe’s objectives to be a social market economy, sustainable development and the fight against discrimination."
"Secondly, it helps ensure territorial cohesion by means of a set of provisions that will help the EU’s regions to manage their own development."
"The Treaty reiterates the specific nature of the UPRs, and more particularly that of the French overseas territories. By consolidating the mechanisms under which derogations may be granted from Community rules, it provides real protection for the overseas territories, thus counteracting a destructive mindset that regards Europe as a uniform and homogenous territory."
". What we are voting upon today is not a report but an act of faith, and an act of bad faith at that."
"Contrary to what the rapporteurs have said, this text creates a centralised, omnipotent and totalitarian super-state that lacks an identity and a soul."
"It will be a centralised state because every decision will be taken in Brussels, whatever field it may apply to, and all these decisions, whether legislative or not, and whether they concern national or local issues, will have to comply with European legislation and the sole interest of the EU."
"The principle of subsidiarity will be held up to ridicule, as it has been for the past 12 years."
"It will be an omnipotent state because the European Union will have jurisdiction over every area, without exception, and all policies are or will be communitised."
"It will be a totalitarian state because the real power will reside with a handful of officials, namely the Commission technocrats, who hold a monopoly over legislative initiative, and the Luxembourg judges, who are the overzealous inspectors of pro-European orthodoxy."
"What they have in common is that they are not subject to any kind of democratic control after their appointment."
"Finally, it will be a state lacking a soul and an identity, as it will turn its back on its Helleno-Christian roots and agree to Turkey’s integration, despite the public’s opposition, and will believe only in globalisation, competition and the market."
"I shall therefore vote against, both today and in the referendum to be held in my country."
"We have voted against this report."
"Our definitions of ‘subsidiarity’ and ‘superstate’ clearly differ from those of the rapporteurs."
"We define subsidiarity in terms of political decisions having to be taken as close to the people as possible and in terms of its being the national parliaments and not the EU institutions that determine which issues are to be decided upon at which level."
"Our definition of a superstate is an EU state in which the Council as a rule takes decisions on a qualified majority basis, in which not all the Member States are represented in the Commission and in which the European Parliament has the right of codecision on all issues."
"The EU is thus no longer a federation of states, which is what we believe it should be, but a federal state."
"A common foreign and asylum policy, a rapid reaction force designed to intervene elsewhere in the world and an EU budget increased through the EU’s being given the right of taxation are among the factors that extend the exercise of political power by this ‘superstate’."
"This draft Constitution should be replaced by a new draft intergovernmental Treaty that gives central place to the national parliaments’ political responsibility."
"Religious issues must not be among those dealt with in texts of EU treaties."
"We protest about the fact that, in connection with the reading of this report, the majority in the European Parliament is to invest EUR 340 000 of taxpayers’ money in a spectacle to launch the ‘yes’ campaign for the adoption of the ‘EU Constitution’ by the Member States."
"I have chosen to differ from my political group and shall vote against the report on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"I believe that the draft Constitution entails the EU’s going from being a form of intergovernmental cooperation based on treaties to being a state based on a Constitution."
"I believe that it strengthens the precedence of EU law over national law, removes more power from the Member States and gives the larger countries more power than the small countries."
"These are things to which I object."
"I voted in favour of Sweden’s becoming a member of the EU in the 1994 referendum, and I am sincerely in favour of the idea of international cooperation in solving common problems."
"There are important tasks we must perform together, especially where the environment, human trafficking and social dumping are concerned."
"I am, however, opposed to the present trend towards increased supranationalism in the EU."
"I wish to see European cooperation at intergovernmental level."
". I voted against this report in the final vote."
"I did so principally because I believe that the inclusion of marine biological resource conservation as one of only five exclusive competences of the EU is not only unnecessary, but in fact anomalous and unjustified."
"The fact that this Parliament's Fisheries Committee almost unanimously supported that view in its opinion reflects a strongly held point of view in Scotland's fisheries dependent communities."
"This is yet another example of failure on the part of a Westminster Government to act in the best interests of fishing communities, and will undoubtedly motivate many voters in Scotland to vote for rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in a referendum."
".– If it were left to the Greens, the draft Constitution would be a good deal more ambitious than the one we have been presented with. It would enable us to give practical form to the political, social and ecological Europe that we advocate."
"Such a draft would be without ambiguities or uncertainties as to its objectives; it would not have this third part which, doing nothing more than recapitulating previous treaties, is in contradiction to a global and ambitious project for Europe."
"Despite its imperfections, I shall be voting in favour of the draft Constitution, and I urge others to do likewise, for it would be a great aberration and major political error to go over to the ‘no’ camp simply because the final document is not equal to the demands made of it."
"More than ever, we need Europe, imperfect though it may be."
"A Constitution will enable us to launch this peaceful Europe as the custodian of such shared values as human rights and democracy."
"This great act will enable the European public to feel themselves united in a truly common design."
"The ‘yes’ I shall say by voting in favour of the Corbett report is the ‘yes’ of a militant."
"To fail in this historic moment would be to negate our own labour as builders of Europe and would for a considerable time put the brakes on the ambitious development of the European project that we wish to see …"
"The EU could operate perfectly well with one Commissioner per country."
"Now that the European Council has, however, decided to reduce the number of Commissioners from 2014, it is important that we stick to the principle of fair rotation between the Member States."
". Mr President, this Constitution, which claims to be European, is in fact an anti-European document, destroying as it does the foundations of Europe: its nations, which will lose their sovereignty for good, and the values of its civilisation, both Graeco-Latin and Christian."
"There is nothing trivial about the omission of any reference to these: it was necessary in order to make the accession of Muslim Turkey acceptable."
"It is evident that there is a causal connection between the European Constitution and the entry of this Asian country, contrary to what President Chirac tells us."
"Once the Constitution is adopted, it will not only facilitate Turkey’s accession, but will also give it – the most populous state in the European Union – the most MEPs and the most votes in the Council, giving it pre-eminence and superiority over France and Germany."
"When President Chirac tells us that the French people will be able give their judgment on Turkish accession in 2014, he is lying; it will be too late."
"The referendum on the Constitution will be held in a few months’ time, just before negotiations on accession begin."
"If they vote ‘no’, the French people will also be saying ‘no’ to Turkish entry."
". This text, submitted to us as a Constitution for Europe, is the result of a misbegotten compromise in which all Europe’s social democrat governments have surrendered their peoples’ sovereignty to a supranational body."
"This Constitution organises a state with the appearance of unity, hiding the federalist mechanisms within it."
"It is a hybrid organisation which, by making its mind known on every subject, and interfering in every area, enforces political choices that have tragic consequences for the future of the European peoples."
"It also represents the culmination of a slow and progressive process of political and legal stratification and the institutionalisation of a new totalitarian organisation."
"The Europe that is coming into being distances itself further from its citizens by impoverishing their societies."
"These peoples are treated with contempt, and each consultation, be it parliamentary or in the form of a referendum, will ratify and confirm policies that are in fact already being implemented."
"By using the choice between Europe and chaos, itself a low form of extortion, and designed to force the hand of sovereign peoples, this Constitution’s supporters flout the basic rules of democracy."
"We will not fall into the trap that this Europe represents, and we intend to denounce it at the forthcoming referendum in France."
"We can have another Europe – the Europe of free peoples and sovereign nations."
". The report under discussion recommends that the EU Member States ratify the European Constitution."
"I had no hesitation in voting against this report, for a number of reasons."
"It is out of place for the European Parliament to recommend that the Member States ratify or reject the Treaty, as final decisions on this matter and completion of the ratification process fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the sovereign national authorities designated for this purpose."
"How one views this so-called European Constitution is an entirely separate issue."
"In my opinion, ratification of this Constitution would not further either Poland’s or Europe’s interests."
"I have repeatedly noted how inappropriate it is for there to be no reference to God or the Christian tradition in the preamble to the Treaty."
"The lack of any such reference means that the truth about our continent’s history is blatantly ignored."
"A further point of contention is the revision of the Treaty of Nice, which has not even been given the chance to prove itself in practice."
"The provisions of this Treaty on weighted voting within the European Council, which would have been to Poland’s benefit, have been watered down by the Constitutional Treaty, without their influence on the functioning of the Communities having been assessed in any way."
"Furthermore, I have concerns regarding a number of other provisions in the so-called European Constitution, for example increasing the unjust privileges granted to the eastern of the Federal Republic of Germany under previous treaties."
"While the European Parliament has not yet pronounced upon the draft Constitution, a festive party is already being thrown at the cost of EUR 375 000 to celebrate its approval, thereby illustrating yet again that the two prejudices about Europe – those being that it is undemocratic and wastes money – are wholly justified."
"My group is opposed to this Constitution for a number of reasons."
"We denounce the neo-Liberal and socio-economic component in it which, under the guise of ‘free trade’ undermines public services and denies national and local authorities the right to determine for themselves how they want to organise their public services."
"We are strongly opposed to the militarisation of Europe that is apparent in the Constitution, including in the paragraph obliging Member States to increase their defence budgets."
"We reject this Constitution, because it reinforces the Union’s undemocratic structure and does not do a great deal to improve it."
"Some of my fellow Members may be prepared to sell their souls to neo-Liberalism for a handful of extra parliamentary means of power, I do not intend to do so."
"Where democracy is concerned, only the best is good enough, and I therefore refuse to support this Constitution, which is for the benefit of the European elite, the multinationals, warmongers and bureaucrats."
".– The Constitutional Treaty or so-called Euro-constitution codifies the previous treaties, strengthening the privileges and profits of big business and further developing the culture of the arming and militarisation of Europe."
"These are measures to arm the plutocracy, which will exacerbate social and class antagonisms and bring new trials and tribulations to the people."
"That is why the peoples of Europe should throw out the 'Euro-constitution' and step up their fight against the reactionary policy of the ΕU."
"The guilt of the EU is also clear from the unilateral misleading propaganda and misinformation on which it is spending huge amounts in a bid to gain the vote and assent of the workers, while at the same time using its guidelines to impose cuts in wages, pensions and unemployment benefits."
"The presence in Parliament's motion of the highly reactionary Article 43 adopting the US doctrine of preventive war as civil protection from terrorist attack constitutes provocation."
"It is the pretext for big business to terrorise the peoples and plunder the wealth they produce."
"We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece shall vote against the so-called Euro-constitution and against any variation on it."
"There can be no progressive 'Euro-constitution' in the EU of big business and war and anyone cultivating such delusions is not helping to develop the fight against its exploitative policies and agencies."
". Although there is, both in the Member States and in this House, general approval for this text, there is also a critical public that regards it with concern."
"In criticising it, we are not arguing from the restricted vantage point of the nation state."
"What we criticise is that the treaty aims to further militarise the European Union to the point of enabling it to wage war on a global scale."
"It is intended to secure ‘operational capacity drawing on military assets’."
"The Constitution requires rearmament, in that ’the Member States are obliged to progressively improve their military capacities’, a process to be supervised by an ‘agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments’, which will also implement ’appropriate measures to strengthen the industrial and technological basis of the defence sector’."
"We are also critical of the way in which the principles of neo-liberalism are to be enshrined in the Constitution."
"The general ‘Objectives of the Union’ do admittedly gloss over matters by talking in terms of ‘a highly competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment and social progress, and a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment, but the part that actually deals with policy then speaks in plain language of a commitment to the ‘principle of an open market economy with free competition’."
"Far from reflecting this view, the draft report takes a completely uncritical view of the draft Constitution."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left cannot, therefore, endorse it."
". I should like to congratulate Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo on their excellent report on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"I should like to take this opportunity to highlight the important consolidation of the status of the outermost regions, which falls within the scope of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"Consequently, the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe guarantees the exceptional nature of the status of the outermost regions, in other words, their horizontal/transversal dimension and the derogatory nature and the adequacy of the legal basis in the adoption of all measures specifically geared towards the outermost regions."
"I was also very pleased to see that the Intergovernmental Conference included reference to European law and framework law between legislative instruments enabling the adoption of measures to support the outermost regions."
". I welcome this report by my good friends Richard Corbett and Íñigo Méndez de Vigo and their call for the Constitution to be adopted and ratified by all Member States."
"The Constitution will improve the transparency, effectiveness and efficiency of the Union."
"In my own field of trade it will improve significantly the role of the European Parliament and therefore bring greater clarity and democratic scrutiny to a vital area where the EU has exclusive competence."
"This should enable NGOs, trade unions, commercial organisations and others to follow in more detail and to influence the negotiations leading to international agreements."
". Today, the advocates of the Constitution are celebrating."
"The European Parliament cannot amend the document’s wording, any more than can national parliaments or the voters who will take part in the national referendums."
"We can only approve or reject it, and celebrate or mourn that choice accordingly."
"That makes it impossible to scrap the requirement for re-armament and for solidarity with NATO."
"It is equally impossible to make the free unhindered competition that the text glorifies subordinate to the environment, the provision of public services or the protection of labour."
"It is no longer possible to actually reward the collection of a million signatures of citizens, prescribed in Article 46, with a referendum."
"New social basic rights are lacking."
"The EU’s traditional authoritarian administrative model, boasting a strong role for the Council and the presidency, without any adequate means of correcting it by way of parliamentary democracy, is not up for discussion either."
"I do not want this Constitution."
"I do not want to be part of today’s festivities."
"In the Netherlands in the next couple of months, I shall be involved in the campaign of my party, the Socialist Party, to persuade a majority of voters to reject this flawed text."
". The Constitutional Treaty is a compromise text that should be assessed for what it actually contains and not for what some – on both the federalist and the euro-sceptic sides – would like it to contain."
"In view of the fact that in a globalised world Portugal has everything to gain from belonging to a regional bloc with the characteristics of the EU, there are aspects of this text, as in any compromise text, with which I agree and others with which I am not satisfied."
"On the positive side, I should like to highlight the simplification that the unification of the Treaties has achieved, the clearer distinction between national and European powers, the strengthening of the role of national parliaments and the guarantee that the Union only has at its disposal the powers attributed to it by the Member States."
"Furthermore, the fact that this Treaty represents a moment of stabilisation in the process of revising the Treaties brings security and stability."
"I do not agree, however, with the absence in the preamble of any reference to Europe’s Judeo-Christian heritage, the end of the rotating presidency among the Member States, the eventual reduction in the number of Commissioners and the creation of the potentially contentious post of European Minster of Foreign Affairs."
"On balance, I have decided to vote in favour."
". I have often criticised the break with the EU’s best practice, the source of its success: the ‘small steps policy’ of Schuman and the founding Member States, which is increasingly being trampled underfoot by a ferocious desire to stride forward, regardless of the feelings of the people."
"I should prefer to go down the European road of genuine unity in diversity, characterised by respect for the national democracies from which that road emerges, than to contribute towards the sham of a proto-continental State which few want to see, which the people did not ask for and which nobody has any real affection for."
"I have no qualms about applauding the broad outlook of a European constitutional text."
"Yet once the people have been consulted, let us draw it up using fully democratic, participatory and representative processes, interacting with the public, in an assembly specifically elected for this purpose, as suggested at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I am always dismayed by the climate of concealment and manipulation, the lack of loyalty to the public, the fact that often one thing is said and then something different is done and the blatant way in which the rule of law has been brushed aside – a sure sign that ‘anything goes’, so long as it goes in a particular direction."
"A glaring indication of this is the pompous declaration that Parliament ‘adopts the Constitutional Treaty’."
"This does not fall within our competences and to say it does puts us in a legally dubious position."
"I had hoped for better."
"I voted against the resolution."
". I do indeed endorse unreservedly the draft European Constitution, and it was with enthusiasm that I voted in favour of my colleagues’ excellent report."
"This draft is no doubt a compromise but it also represents a considerable advance."
"The Union of 25 will be stabilised by having a President appointed for two and a half years instead of a presidency that rotates every six months."
"A Minister of Foreign Affairs will be Europe’s voice in the world."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights has at last been incorporated into the institutional framework."
"The citizens enjoy the right of petition (capable of being translated into European law with the support of over 1 million signatures), and, in the social sphere, for the first time, the Union sets itself targets for shared progress in a social market economy."
"In short, the European Union is becoming more democratic, more transparent, clearer and more effective."
"It may be, though, that the hardest task awaits us yet: to complete ratification in all our Member States, and hence to explain it in such a way as to persuade Europe’s citizens."
"I am also delighted that, in this nervous time for Europe, a recent survey reveals that the Belgian public are ready to go into battle for a ‘yes’ to the Constitutional Treaty; 80% of them are in favour of it!"
". It is a rare occurrence in anyone’s lifetime to gain the impression of living through an historic moment, and this Constitutional Treaty, I believe, sees us participating in writing a page setting out the Europe that we want."
"This text sees us continuing the work of the founding fathers who wanted this Europe of 25 States – soon to be more – and dreamed of it."
"This Constitutional Treaty makes of Europe’s humanist, spiritual and social heritage a foundation for the governance of our daily lives."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights acquires legal force and becomes binding on citizens."
"Rules are made simpler, and increasingly resemble those with which we are familiar in our 25 democracies."
"The Union will have a greater political role in the world, will at last be able to carry weight, and, I hope, will exert greater influence in the comity of nations in spreading abroad the ideal of peace which presided over its birth."
"I voted in favour of the Corbett report, and will, in my own country, participate in the campaign in favour of the ratification of the text in a referendum."
"The train of history is pulling out of the station; let us take it together."
". The adoption of the Constitutional Treaty by this House is an historic moment given the role played by Parliament throughout the process."
"As a Member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I voted in favour, because I firmly believe that this represents a step forward towards consolidating the European social policy."
"The citizens’ social rights emerge clearly strengthened due to the fact that the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights has been incorporated into the Constitution – recognition of the public’s place at the heart of the European project."
"Economic and social cohesion has been reaffirmed as a key objective of the EU."
"New norms have been introduced as regards a high level of employment, the fight against social exclusion and discrimination, the promotion of social justice, social protection, equality between men and women and a high level of education and health, the promotion of sustainable development and respect for services of general interest."
"The EU’s role on the international stage has also been strengthened, in the fight to eradicate poverty and in the promotion of sustainable development and fair trade."
"Furthermore, new provisions will facilitate the participation of the citizens, social partners and representatives of civil society in EU discussions."
"Following over half a century of European integration and numerous Treaties, the European Constitution is the one that brings by far the most visible and most practical benefits to the citizens of Europe."
"The Corbett/Méndez de Vigo report does not give fair consideration to the pros and cons of the present Treaty, and can thus be classified as 'pure propaganda'."
"It fails to mention that too many areas of policy are still left to intergovernmental cooperation and that important areas are still subject to veto."
"The role of the constitutional regions in the European decision-making process remains precarious."
"Part III of the Treaty makes it clear that the Union lacks social order and confirms choices in favour of the neo-Liberal model."
"The European Union is still too little in the way of a security union and is at risk of emphasising the deployment of military means in favour of conflict prevention."
"Since these observations are not included in the report, I have voted against it."
"That does not prevent me from campaigning in the next few months with in favour of ratification of the Treaty in the federal, Flemish and Brussels parliaments."
"After all, the Constitution is an enormous step forward and in the event of non-ratification, we will fall back on the provisions of the Treaty of Nice, which are less efficient, transparent and democratic than the present Treaty establishing a European Constitution."
". Mr President, it was with much conviction that I voted in favour of the resolution, and hence of the Constitutional Treaty."
"I join with a large majority of the European Parliament in supporting the argument that we need to prompt the citizens of Europe, along with national and regional parliaments, into assuming a positive attitude."
"I, too, take a critical view of the untruths that are being spread about this Constitutional Treaty."
"The text, which is now to be ratified democratically, contains only steps in the right direction: it offers more scope in order to commit to those areas of policy in an open, transparent, democratic and effective manner where the Union can, and should, add value for the benefit of the public."
"It deserves all our support."
". We opposed the report by Richard Corbett and Íñigo Méndez de Vigo because we do not support the adoption of the European Constitution."
"The Constitution would essentially transfer decision-making power from the Member States to the European Union."
"The focus of the exercise of power within the framework of the Union would move from intergovernmental cooperation to a supranational level."
"A new treaty should be negotiated for the European Union, which should serve as a basis for its development as a federation of independent states."
".The new Europe means survival because it rejects all forms of totalitarianism."
"We paid with our blood for our commitment to the European ideal of achieving freedom of thought, religion and conscience."
"European integration, the way the 25 EU Member States function together and making the Community procedures work better must be improved and must progress, with care, little by little."
"Asking simple questions about this ‘Constitution’ should not lead to accusation of being anti democratic;"
"Understandable and credible answers are still needed."
"Under this Constitution, the uncontrolled European Court of Justice will apply judgements directly and unequivocally to all Community institutions and bodies and the Member States."
"No constitutional lawyer has been able to show me where it is guaranteed that the Court will not infringe the various national competencies and policies."
"Even if Parliament’s elected majority or the composition in the Council of Ministers changes, how can the EU major political orientation be changed when set out in a constitutional document requesting a double unanimity?"
"Finally, in refusing Christian heritage, the cultural short-sightedness of this Constitution is a worrying form of revisionism."
"Granted, the Treaty of Nice did not contain any reference to Europe’s Christian heritage; but it did not claim to be a Constitution either."
"Mr President, I have a serious complaint: about 15 minutes ago a peaceful protest was about to take place against the Constitution – a banner was to be unfurled."
"Two researchers belonging to the Independence and Democracy Group were physically assaulted – one was kicked and punched."
"The security staff who I believe were involved include Mr Zylka and Mr Dekhudt."
"I ask you to conduct a serious and immediate investigation into what happened."
"We have had a one-sided debate here about the Constitution."
"An enormous amount of money has been spent; banners are being unfurled for the 'yes' side, but the 'no' side is not allowed a say; and when a peaceful process takes place, people are physically assaulted."
"This is totally contrary to the purportedly democratic principles of this institution."
"I ask you to undertake an immediate investigation."
"You will receive a complaint in writing."
"All that will be forwarded to the relevant office of the House."
"That completes the explanations of votes."
"I declare the session resumed."
"The Minutes of yesterday’s sitting have been distributed, and I should like to ask whether there are any comments."
"Mr President, if the sitting is supposed to resume at 3 p.m. then would it not be a good idea to start at 3 p.m. and not have lunch until all hours of the afternoon?"
"However, there are more serious points which we should perhaps draw to your attention."
"You will be aware that your employees assaulted two of our employees – that is, employees of the United Kingdom Independence Party – this morning, causing bodily injury."
"I would like to ask whether this happened as a result of your instructions and whether or not you are prepared to take responsibility for this?"
"I appreciate that you are not the President of Parliament, who has always proved partial."
"At Westminster, the Speaker's job is to protect the rights of backbenchers."
"All that the President of this Parliament – who is totally inexperienced – seems to do is to want to preserve the status quo."
"This morning he has really blotted his copy book because, last month, he permitted all the signs saying 'Yes to Turkey' to remain up in this Chamber for a considerable period of time."
"He set a precedent then, so why were we not permitted this very day to hold up signs saying 'Say no'?"
"You made your point."
"Your question will be answered in due time."
"It is not a point of order."
"You have made your point and you will get your answer."
"Thank you."
"I understand that there are no objections as far as the Minutes are concerned."
"I am sorry, Mr Knapman, I will not give you the floor."
"It is not a point of order."
"You will get your explanation in due time."
"We can assume that the Minutes are approved."
"Mr President, the gentleman, his colleagues and his staff should be cleaning up the 'No to Europe' literature and mess that is strewn around the grounds of this Parliament."
"It is spread all over the place!"
"Perhaps he could clean up the litter."
"The matter is closed."
"Let us proceed with the sitting."
"Mr President, I should like to know who is responsible for security staff outside the Chamber."
"I cannot find anything about this in the Rules."
"Who authorised the security staff to interfere with free and peaceful expressions of political opinion outside this House, and on what authority was this done, having regard to the Rules of Procedure or any other relevant authority?"
"Secondly, why was violence used against women, and thirdly, what steps will the President take to bring to account those responsible?"
"This follows on from my previous complaint to the President, Mr Borrell Fontelles, asking for this matter to be investigated."
"As I told the previous speakers, you will get your answer in due course."
"Mr President, please would you look at Rule 166 and tell me whether you have applied this Rule in response to the points of order, following your decision to tell your staff to assault ours, causing them bodily injury."
"The Rule stipulates that 'A Member may be allowed to speak to draw the attention of the President to any failure to respect Parliament's Rules of Procedure'."
"We have done that."
"'A request to raise a point of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak'."
"We have done that – at least, for once, you got something right!"
"Paragraph 4 states that 'The President shall take an immediate decision on points of order'."
"We ask – although I know you are not important in the pecking order – to take a decision on these very important points of order; probably the most important points of order you will ever get in your life!"
"I am sorry, but you have already had the floor."
"You have now spoken for the second time."
"You may find it unsatisfactory, but that was my answer."
"Mr President, Rule 166 states very clearly that you are required to give us a response to complaints such as those already made by my colleagues, Mr Batten and Mr Knapman, concerning violence used against our members of staff by your members of staff."
"What steps are you taking or proposing to take to hold to account those who have used violence apparently in your name?"
"We want to know what steps you are going to take or have already taken – it says so in Rule 166 – and we need that answer now, not tomorrow."
"As I said, you will be given an answer in due course, not at this moment."
"I consider the whole issue closed."
"There will be no more points of order."
"We shall now resume the debate on the Council and Commission statements on EU aid for tsunami victims in Asia."
"... practices in this House if representatives from all groups – even the smallest group, that of Non-attached Members – are not given the floor before a vote."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of the EU Member States do not expect us to talk in soundbites, but to be honest."
"The simple truth about the political context of this disaster should finally be told."
"Local political interests are being played out in the shadow of the terrible tsunami tragedy."
"The UN’s crumbling authority is to be revived thanks to its aid measures in Asia."
"The USA and certain European countries wish to improve their image in this part of Asia and extend their influence over the continent by means of humanitarian measures."
"The victims of the disaster are being helped to some extent along the way, but it is abundantly clear that huge advantages are being gained from the whole affair."
"I would like to believe that the European Union’s charitable measures will serve aid-related purposes alone, and that we will not, as the EU, prey on human misfortune and promote our own narrow interests in the aftermath of such a major tragedy."
"The aid we provide should be rapid and based on solidarity, and it should not be held up by a bureaucratic obstacle course."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to start by saying that I agree with all the expressions of sympathy in response to the calamity in South-East Asia."
"Having said that, I will now concentrate on making a few rather sobering comments."
"The donations made by people in the European Union and throughout the world are a truly overpowering demonstration of goodwill."
"The evidence of how the whole of the globalised world has been touched by this terrible event also makes a deep impression."
"In Germany, though, we have a proverb to the effect that ‘good intentions do not always do any good’."
"We need to learn how to help."
"The banner headline on today’s issue of one of the major German newspapers is ‘Many disorganised aid workers make Indonesia’s work difficult’."
"It also has to be said that the way in which the European Union has gone about things there is hardly likely to call forth rapturous enthusiasm about the success of the work it does."
"Let me also quote this: ‘If it were not for the American and Australian armies, who are all over the place, flying their cargo planes back and forth on a regular basis, then things would be far worse still.’"
"There is a problem here."
"It is quite obvious that what we need is not just goodwill and the willingness to come up with plenty of money; we also need an organisation that can get this money, in a proper way, to the people who need it."
"Let me therefore endorse what has already been said this morning: above all else, the European Union needs a crisis management unit, in other words, something with transport capacity, leadership and communications resources, and units to provide sanitation and supplies; that is what is needed if we want to help in a really practical way and very quickly."
"Until such time as the European Union has an army of its own that can deal with that sort of thing, we do in fact also need – however much goodwill is there – practical ways of delivering help, and a crisis management unit would be the very thing."
"That is what the EU must concentrate on."
"Mr President, may I start by apologising for the behaviour of some of my compatriots."
"I am very embarrassed that they are behaving in this way and interrupting when we are having a very serious debate about such tragic matters."
"If we may continue – 26 December 2004 was not the same last year, nor will it ever be again."
"Disbelief turned into incomprehension, to grief, to sympathy; a plethora of emotions as we watched the tsunami tragedy unfold."
"The waves and quakes were a pervasive example of how our fates are shared with one another in a global theatre of environmental and natural risk."
"As President of the South Asia Delegation, I would like to give my sincere condolences to all those affected by this tragedy."
"I have been very moved by the heartfelt global response to this unprecedented disaster."
"In the face of the tsunami, European citizens have been amongst the most generous."
"Last week, I travelled to Chennai in South India to see at first hand the relief work by the European Commission and met with officials from UNDP, Unicef and NGOs."
"The EU's immediate response within 24 hours was highly commendable, as was the selfless Indian decision to ask that this aid should go to the worst affected areas, such as Sri Lanka and Indonesia."
"Therefore, I hope that the rumours of current funding to India being diverted to other areas are not true."
"Having seen the needs in India for myself, I hope they will not be ignored in the short term."
"I would demand that the Commission does not redeploy or reprogramme funds from any existing aid projects within this region."
"It would be criminal to take from the world's poorest to fund this tragedy."
"I welcome the Commission's promise of an extra EUR 350 million, but I was not convinced by President Barroso's explanation this morning, because for years humanitarian aid budgets for Asia have been in decline, from 70% in 1990 to 38% in 2000."
"Therefore, it is not acceptable that we divert money away from poverty eradication programmes; we should be adding more money."
"We need to approach this tragedy differently from any other and explore the use of new specialist teams in those countries."
"It is not just money that is needed: we also need to give technical expertise."
"I would ask the Commission to look at enduring changes."
"– Mr President, in view of the instruments currently at its disposal, I think the Commission reacted appropriately."
"There is, however, one aspect of the South-East Asian situation about which I feel there is considerable reticence on the part of all politicians, at least in their public speeches."
"I refer to the political troubles in many of these countries: from Sri Lanka to southern Thailand or Indonesia, particularly in the area of Banda Aceh."
"It is a question of intervening in areas where armed independence movements have been present and active for a long time."
"These are areas of very violent guerrilla warfare, where there is also infiltration by Islamic groups linked to Al Qaida or the Al-Gama’a al-Islamiyya organisation."
"Such elements make the whole reconstruction effort highly problematic, yet I have heard very little said about them, especially in public speeches."
"I am convinced that real, effective reconstruction is impossible without resolving the political problems: genuine political reconstruction needs to be set in motion throughout the region, to renew the currently stalled peace processes and also to strengthen the institutions and the rule of law, without which the forces of instability are likely to come to a head."
"This is a great opportunity."
"If it is well used, the whole reconstruction programme can provide the leverage needed to restart the peace processes, but if not – if intervention is badly managed – it may make the already obvious tensions explode."
"In this context, I believe the European Union should address the problem of its political presence during the reconstruction process, because at the moment it is not visible and it will be even less visible later."
"For instance, I find it disconcerting that the first meeting between the government in Jakarta and guerrillas of the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) took place in the presence of the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Japan, Singapore and Libya, while the European Union was clearly absent from the negotiating table."
"These are matters which, if ignored, will prevent you from properly managing the reconstruction process, which will be long and difficult but also potentially very worthwhile."
"Mr President, when the tsunami came, rich and poor alike were affected."
"Everyone ran for their lives, and it was the children who were hit hardest."
"The nightmare of not being able to protect their children befell thousands of people."
"We now all have a responsibility to give them our support and listen to their needs."
"I call upon you to send our heartfelt thanks to the people of Thailand and other affected countries who fulfilled our ideals of compassion, humanity and solidarity."
"Unselfishly and without discrimination, they helped all the victims, irrespective of their culture or religion or the colour of their skin."
"In particular, many of my own fellow countrymen received considerable support, a fact which shows that these concepts are universal rather than specifically Christian or European."
"We can begin to fulfil the same ideals by giving substantial aid to the countries affected, introducing fair trade, combating poverty and hunger and allowing our emergency services to help each other more effectively."
"– Mr President, the impressive mobilisation of global and European public opinion is inciting both governments and the European Union to act more effectively by strengthening international cooperation under the aegis of the UN."
"I should like to comment on four points: the first and most important at the present moment is to ensure that promises are kept and will not remain dead letter as on other occasions; in other words, that aid will reach the citizens who need it quickly and efficiently, without being squandered or stolen by corrupt intermediate links."
"Secondly, the European Parliament needs to ask creditor countries to write off the debts of the countries hit and not simply defer payment of a number of instalments."
"The announcement by the seven richest nations that they were simply deferring payment for the benefit of the countries hit would appear to be hypocritical in the light of the United States' insistence that the debt of Iraq, a country over which it exercises military control, be written off."
"Thirdly, I propose that the European Parliament support the proposal formulated at the United Nations back in September 2004, and already supported by about 100 countries, on a global tax on capital transactions, arms sales and the consumption of non-renewable energy, in order to finance emergencies from natural disasters."
"Fourthly, we need to strengthen the European civil protection programme more generously with resources and mechanisms."
"The relevant report, which I presented a month ago and which was approved by the European Parliament by an overwhelming majority, needs to be strengthened more generously over coming years."
"– Mr President, how many days went by before European Union intervention arrived in the countries hit by the tidal wave, even though it was known right from the very first hours after the disaster that the tsunami had affected thousands of tourists of European origin?"
"It may have been true that all the EU officials were on holiday, but not a sign of an official from the European Union was seen for days and days in those countries, for instance in Thailand."
"Their absence allowed people to be buried in mass graves, making it difficult, if not impossible, to identify the bodies of the missing Europeans."
"You are not giving any information on this, but I should like to know how many people were sent where and after how long a delay, because, I repeat, in many of those countries there is no record of their presence."
"Not a sign of a European official had been seen by the end of the year."
"I should also like to place on record a protest at the absolute lack of interest shown by many Arab countries in these peoples, a large part of them Muslim."
"While Europe and the West took action, those extremely wealthy nations, those multi-billionaire countries and regimes that profess Islam excelled in their parsimony."
"Mr President, I first wish to join with others in offering my sympathy to the people of South-East Asia who have been so badly affected by this awful tragedy."
"We are still seeing pictures and videos of what happened and it is still hard for us to comprehend the massive scale of destruction and the loss of human life."
"The reaction from the citizens of Europe and other parts of the world has been absolutely outstanding: people have really shown their humanity to the people affected."
"The amount of money that has been privately donated has been extraordinary."
"The response of the governments around the world has also been good."
"A number of things have been mentioned."
"One is that it is very important to use military and civil resources as soon as possible – as the United States has done – in this disaster."
"They can be first out there to address these awful problems."
"I also wish to say, as have other speakers, that, after the meeting on Monday night, I am not completely convinced by President Barroso's position on the resources."
"Resources should not come from existing budgets and from money that has been promised; there have to be new resources."
"We have to show the people that we are serious about this and we have to ensure that what happened in areas like Iran and Afghanistan does not reoccur in terms of how we ..."
"Mr President, the earth moved, tragedy struck and our world changed."
"The awesome pictures of that mighty sea consuming the land and crushing people, homes and landmarks were terrifying and terrible."
"The world was shocked by the fate of human beings, the suffering of survivors and the plight of orphans."
"In Europe we are mourning thousands of our own citizens, but with admiration for and gratitude to the local people who, despite their own loss and pain, found the courage and compassion to care for bewildered and frightened foreign tourists."
"The earth moved and the public were moved."
"The first to act were not governments, but people."
"People across the world opened their hearts and opened their purses, shaming governments into matching the monies their peoples had given."
"Now we demand real, lasting and effective action."
"Humanitarian and reconstruction aid must be given and used with transparency and accountability, and debt systems reformed."
"Our actions must help to bring peace, support good governance and human rights, involve local people and overcome poverty."
"Promises must be kept and we must develop the early warning systems which, as we now know, are already available in the form of the underground testing systems based in Vienna."
"Above all, Europe must now respond to the new public mood which demands that the divisions of our world must be healed through a determined combating of poverty and disease and the removal of barriers that have stopped poorer countries trading in our markets."
"The people of our world have never felt closer."
"Surely our governments – north and south – and our European Union, can build on that."
"Mr President, I would like to express our horror, our condolences, our solidarity and our commitment to contribute to alleviating the effects of this disaster."
"The suggestions of the Socialist Group appear in the joint resolution, which we will vote for with conviction and which can be summed up in seven points."
"Firstly, the positive assessment of the appropriate actions of the Council and the Commission, which reacted immediately to the disaster and committed the necessary resources and informed Parliament – although it is noted that there has been a lack of information and communication with society, which may have led some Members to conclude that there has been nobody on the ground, when in fact there has been admirable action."
"Secondly, the resources promised by everybody must be produced immediately and, in any event, according to a set timetable."
"Thirdly, all of the European Union’s resources must be fresh money, and in no event must they be taken from other programmes;"
"President Barroso’s arguments have not been convincing in this regard."
"Fourthly, the commitment to follow emergency actions with the essential reconstruction actions, in agreement with the main protagonists; the countries affected."
"Fifthly, the commitment to implement an early warning system capable of preventing similar disasters."
"Sixthly, the commitment also to implement a reaction mechanism for disasters of a permanent and professional nature, able to intervene in the event that prevention does not succeed."
"And there is an important point of reference in the Constitution in the form of the creation of a corps of humanitarian aid volunteers."
"Seventhly, these actions must not all be the result of impromptu actions, of coalitions made up of arbitrary groups of countries, but they must be the result of mobilisation within the framework of the United Nations, and with the active and visible participation of the European Union."
"The European Union, Mr President, must be a match for this disaster and for the mobilisation demonstrated by our societies."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that the huge number of deaths resulting from this disaster essentially reflect the enormous vulnerability of the peoples of the region."
"I therefore believe we have a responsibility, which at the same time is an opportunity."
"I am talking about dealing seriously with the issue of the debts of the countries affected."
"Furthermore, in some cases, this debt was taken on by corrupt and dictatorial governments, such as the Indonesia of Suharto, which were given money in an unscrupulous manner, leading to what to today is known as the debt of hate."
"Certain donors, therefore, have a responsibility that should firstly be investigated and then met."
"There is a twin opportunity here: while, on the one hand, it is extremely urgent that we cancel that debt immediately – not as an act of compassion, but as recognition of the fact that the people who have already suffered as a result of irresponsible regimes should not have to suffer all over again by having to pay off their debts – on other hand, international aid must be based fundamentally on donations and not on new loans which increase the burden of that debt even further."
"Mr President, the tragedy in Asia is still inconceivable for many of us."
"We are all in mourning, irrespective of nationality, and our sympathy grows out of this solidarity."
"Let us make use of this feeling of solidarity in order to choose better priorities in future."
"Environmental researchers maintain that the disaster could have been avoided, if not completely then in part – with far fewer casualties and material damage – if the coral reefs and mangrove forests had been left in place."
"If human safety, instead of military security, had been the main priority, we should probably not have been forced to see so much death and destruction as we have now."
"If governments had carried out some sort of objective analysis of what threatened not only their own countries but the planet and the whole of humanity and had prepared themselves for these threats, then warning systems would have been in place and the emergency work would have been better planned."
"Large and wealthy powers are prepared to conduct wars, including nuclear wars, at a couple of minutes’ notice."
"There is no notice or warning for poor people in Asia, however. In the meantime, the world spends grotesque sums on its war against terrorism – a small problem in terms of the number of lives lost – and on a war that, as matters now stand, merely produces more terrorism."
"Is no serious attention devoted to the problems of poverty and to ecological security?"
"Let us learn our lesson one day."
"Mr President, the tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean is in many ways a turning point in the history of the modern world."
"For the first time, we have had a genuine wave of sympathy for people from, in general, the whole world, and not just a part of it, who have been affected."
"Cynics point out that this has to do with the fact that the area around the Indian Ocean contained so many tourists from rich countries who were also affected when the disaster happened."
"That is true, but it must be remembered that this, at the same time, shows that tourism, like trade in goods and services, in actual fact brings the people of the world together and makes us realise that we belong together."
"I nonetheless feel uncomfortable about the fact that, in this case, the EU seems mainly to be interested in promoting its own stances in connection with this tragedy which, upon examination, reveals that what are needed are warning systems, not the EU."
"It is a global issue, and one that is principally for the UN."
"Money does not need to be channelled via the EU; it should come directly from the relevant countries and people."
"The issue is one of coordinating operational aid, and that is the main task of the UN."
"What task remains?"
"That of rapid intervention to evacuate citizens of EU countries."
"In this case, the problem was not that the EU had no policy but that some countries, such as Italy, implemented this very well while other countries, such as my own, implemented it badly."
"We must not try to use tragedies for EU purposes, but look to see what the EU in actual fact has to contribute, presumably in terms of consular services."
"Ladies and gentlemen, last week I had the opportunity of meeting with people from countries hit by the disaster and today I should like to voice those people's concerns."
"Firstly, they are concerned that the funds pledged will, in actual fact, not be made available."
"Secondly, they wish to rebuild through their own efforts the lives and natural resources that have been destroyed."
"Thirdly, people are afraid that assistance will disappear into the donors' bureaucracy."
"As a representative of a new Member State I can understand this, as aid that had been granted to us was sometimes diverted into the coffers of the donors' own consultants."
"What can we do to dispel these concerns?"
"Firstly, I should like to stress the difference between aid given to Africa, for example, where severe and long-term structural problems need to be resolved and where it is sometimes difficult to absorb resources, and the region now hit by the disaster, where people need rapid and immediate assistance, where ordinary economic life needs to be rebuilt, where people know how to work and know what needs to be done."
"Therefore, in the first instance, European aid must be unbureaucratic and should be awarded also in the form of small grants, for example, directly for the reconstruction of small fisheries, tourism and other types of activities."
"Secondly, given that the UN has the main coordinating role, Parliament should hear the UN's opinion at the next session, on both the situation and the use of aid."
"– Mr President, as Vice-Chairman of the delegation to ASEAN, I should like to express my sympathies with the families of the victims in South-East Asia, and also to the families of the victims who came from Europe."
"We can be proud of the substantial amount that the European Union is preparing to remit to the countries in South-East Asia, an amount decided on at the Geneva donors’ conference."
"Nevertheless, last week’s joint meeting in Brussels of the development, foreign affairs and budget committees gives us reason to fear that this is simply a matter of deploying funds allocated to development."
"Although the decision has been taken to mobilise EUR 100 million from the emergency aid reserve, we do not at present know what will be the actual share of reallocated credits and that of the funds that have just been raised."
"As it is obvious that Europe will not be able to increase its aid, it must therefore concentrate its efforts on making the best possible use of it, by directing it towards the coordination of its own responsibilities, namely sanitary and medical projects, the restoration of infrastructure and reconstruction."
"It is also important that such coordination of sanitary projects on the ground, alongside the UN’s agencies, should be accompanied by follow-up aid, especially in the countries riven by conflicts, and by the coordination of civil and military assets, particularly for the purposes of reconstruction."
"This is where, in order to deal with natural disasters, which are unfortunately becoming more and more frequent, it would be desirable to pool to some degree European capacities for civil protection, an option open to all the Member States and involving interoperable and rapidly-deployable joint teams."
"Moreover, alongside direct aid and the analysis of what has just occurred, we cannot do without careful consideration of how to prevent it occurring again."
"Europe could propose, at the Kobe conference, the use of the World Environment Fund to develop civil security units or even to set up a fund for voluntary contributions towards an early warning system, such as exists in the Indian Ocean."
"Let me conclude by saying that I think that the worldwide impetus generated by this unprecedented disaster makes it necessary for the developed countries, today, to give consideration to the rescheduling of these countries’ debts across the board."
"Mr President, the heavenly feeling I had on Sunday morning, while having breakfast on the Indian coast, later turned to horror when I set off for the hinterland and saw the images of violence and destruction that Sunday’s killer had left in its wake."
"Many days later, it turned out that 150 000 people had been killed and 2 million made homeless."
"The EUR 475 million from the EU is a serious contribution for Asia and for African countries, but as Mr Deva and Mrs Mathieu stated, we see it as unacceptable that some of those funds should be made available by reprogramming funds for Asia and funds from the European Development Fund (EDF)."
"I would add that that also applies to pledges from the EU Member States to the tune of EUR 1.5 billion."
"The Commission and the Council must therefore ensure that additional new funds are created."
"That is a tough demand by Parliament, and we will be discussing it again in due course."
"It is vitally important that the UN should play a coordinating role, and that the role of local organisations and local priorities should be respected."
"Together with our counterparts in the national parliaments of the Member States, we in this House must set up a kind of tsunami watch to monitor whether the pledges are delivered upon and to ensure that prompt transitional regulations are put in place."
"What action is the EU taking in terms of flexible reconstruction to prevent a recurrence of what we saw happening after hurricane Mitch – a yawning chasm emerging between emergency aid on the one hand and structural aid on the other?"
"Commissioner Michel has pledged a scoreboard of EUR 475 million in commitments/funds."
"That should be done on a quarterly basis, with us being informed as to what progress has been made with regard to the early warning system in Asia."
"We would like the same system in Africa, because that has so far been refused."
"What matters most in my view is that the poorest of the poor, those poor fishing communities, receive the pledged funds and that they can have a say in how they are spent."
"If not, the money will be caught again in intermediate layers, which would be a crying shame."
"I would therefore urge you to give clear instructions to your EU delegations on the ground and to include this quality requirement in your scoreboard."
"With regard to Europe, I should like to quote the words of Johan Cruyff: ‘’ – for every disadvantage there is an advantage."
"I hope that we can use this momentum together for the benefit of effective European solidarity."
"Mr President, I too would like to speak on behalf of the Group of the Greens in thanking all those who have made donations or pledged them, but I also want, in my capacity as chairman of the delegation for relations with Iran, to emphasise my concern that the events of a year ago may repeat themselves, for, on 26 December 2003, an Iranian village was destroyed by an earthquake."
"Massive amounts of aid were promised, but the money never arrived."
"Terrible anniversaries like these stick in our minds, and in everyone else’s."
"The credibility of this House and of the European Union depends on three things being done."
"Firstly, the other areas must not be neglected; secondly, when remitting debt or allocating donations, it must be ensured that they are not misappropriated and used for military purposes; and, thirdly, I want to take this opportunity to reiterate that we need – and as part of the European security strategy – the capacity for humanitarian and civilian intervention."
"We have already decided to set up the European Civilian Peace Corps, and it is in our Constitution."
"Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, we should take up Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner’s proposals by preventing deficits and doing away with those that occur."
"Mr President, I believe that the first thing we have to do – as I said in the joint meeting of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Development and Budgets – is to express our recognition of the reaction of the European institutions, and in particular the Commission, which we so often criticise and which on this occasion I believe has been a match for the serious circumstances and the example offered by civil society."
"I believe that the most urgent thing at the moment is to try to help the victims who still need water, food and hospitals and who need communications to be re-established."
"Furthermore, as Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner said in her speech, we must now produce a rehabilitation and reconstruction plan in which we should mobilise a whole series of budgetary resources, in particular additional resources, as Mr van den Berg quite rightly said a moment ago."
"I believe that the European Union has acted properly; now we have to establish an effective method for helping the victims."
"Mr President, I believe another particularly important point – and I would ask the Commissioner to communicate this comment to the Commissioner responsible for Transport – is that it is incredible that at European level there is still no common system for the prevention of tidal waves."
"This is a very cheap system and I believe that the European Union, in the field of aid to the developing countries, the ACP countries and the countries of the Mediterranean rim, could offer it in a genuinely significant manner in order to prevent that kind of disaster."
"One of the elements, Mr President, of the draft resolution Parliament is going to approve tomorrow that I believe to be correct is its reference to the solidarity demonstrated by the local populations and the solidarity and support they have offered to the families from the European Union who have fallen victim to this tragedy."
"Mr President, I too wish to begin by expressing my deep sympathy for all those who, across the world, have been affected by the Asian tsunami."
"What needs right now to be focused upon are the emergency efforts to relieve human suffering, take care of the injured, identify the dead, be available to the grieving, and facilitate and support the reconstruction."
"As decision makers, we must also accept our long-term responsibility."
"The earthquake disaster in South-East Asia is, without doubt, greater than that which struck Iran last year."
"Our unreadiness to respond practically to disasters is as obvious now as it was then."
"If emergency services are to operate effectively, there has to be an international organisation whose national components have taken part in frequent joint exercises and that operates in crises caused by, for example, earthquakes, floods or terrorist attacks."
"The EU should therefore have an emergency service that operates both within and outside European borders and that always sends help immediately, irrespective of whether it is Spaniards, Swedes or Somalis who have been affected."
"What, after all, can be more important in a form of international cooperation such as the EU than, specifically, the saving of human lives?"
"An EU emergency service should strengthen and supplement the Member States’ own emergency services and civil crisis management and, of course, cooperate closely with the UN."
"What is important is that it have a permanent structure and be given responsibility in the following areas: analysing – and making plans in response to – the need for future emergency efforts; planning and implementing common exercises; and coordinating and mobilising resources for evacuation, medical care and the transport of food, medicines, clothes and other aid materials in the crisis situation."
"I would call upon the Council actually to set up such an EU emergency service."
"I hope that the Commission will lose no time in extending the existing responsibility for crisis management in order that still greater responsibility might be accepted in the future disasters for which I unfortunately believe we must prepare ourselves."
"Mr President, I have just two points to make."
"The disaster in Asia may well have been natural, but it was also an ecological one."
"Enormous damage was done to wide stretches of beach, reefs were destroyed, their coral filled with sand and dirt, and machinery washed out to sea constitutes a ticking time-bomb."
"All this makes these regions less attractive to tourists."
"The first priority, along with the repair of the damage to the environment – in so far as this is possible – is the reconstruction of facilities for tourists."
"Although foreign tourists play an important part in the economy, unplanned mass tourism is not environmentally sound."
"Any reconstruction must be broader based and more sustainable."
"Lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the past. The disaster can also be seen as an opportunity."
"In this respect, the pilot project undertaken by the Thai Ministry of the Environment jointly with the UN and the World Bank to repair the environmental damage on the island of Koh Phi Phi strikes me as showing the way ahead."
"Mr President, the huge extent of the disaster and destruction caused the tsunami, as well as its emotional and physical impact, will be felt among the victims for years to come."
"I would congratulate the Commission and Council on their rapid and sufficient response immediately following the disaster and on the involvement they have displayed."
"Now, a few weeks down the line, we must prepare one of the most extensive reconstruction programmes ever."
"My main concern is that we should prevent past mistakes from being repeated."
"In any event, aid to Asia should not be at the expense of relief to other poverty-stricken areas such as Africa."
"The world’s attention is on Asia, with good reason, but tomorrow too, some 20 000 people will die again of poverty-related illnesses, such as HIV, aids, malaria and tuberculosis."
"Tomorrow too, many more people will die or be forced to flee their homes, for example in Darfur, Sudan and elsewhere."
"These people should not be the victims of the useful and generous campaigns for Asia."
"Another point is how we as Europe can ensure that aid ends up where it is intended, namely with the victims and not, therefore, with dubious or criminal organisations, or in the pockets of corrupt officials."
"Sound coordination is an absolute condition, and the UN has an important role to play in this."
"I am pleased that, in Jakarta, agreements to this effect have been reached, and they need to be observed."
"It is vital that we should pull out all the stops to prevent criminal organisations from being able to make an easy profit from the chaos by engaging in looting, child trafficking or whatever. This is where international cooperation is of huge importance."
"It is also important, as has been stated before, that an early warning system for seaquakes be put in place."
"In short, I hope that the disaster will be not only a unique example of financial solidarity, but also a unique example in terms of showing how aid programmes should be implemented."
"Not only should we give with a heart, as somebody said, but also with our brains."
"– Mr President, as others have said, those who have suffered so much in this disaster want more than just promises of support or the transfer of money from one disaster to another – from Africa to Aceh for example."
"After all, when USD 1.6 billion was raised for relief in Iraq it was largely at the expense of Africa."
"We need new, additional money, and the needs of victims of other crises, such as those in Sudan, Congo, Haiti, Liberia and northern Uganda, should not be forgotten."
"Our efforts should moreover not be at the expense of the eight million people who die every year from preventable diseases such as malaria."
"I would urge the Commission to look again very closely at the ACP's request to have their own disaster warning facility and would also urge that particular attention be paid to the needs of Somalia and the Seychelles, where thousands of people have been displaced and their livelihoods destroyed."
"One of the paragraphs in our resolution opposes the use of the EDF B envelope to support those countries in East Africa."
"Indeed, it is very unclear how funds can be made available for Somalia from an EDF envelope from which it does not even benefit."
"Mr President, the world was shocked by the massive undersea earthquake, which took place on 26 December 2004."
"I believe that the inability of the European Union to react to the tragedy with the same single-mindedness as the United States, which sent its Secretary of State, is a clear indication of the urgent need for an EU foreign minister."
"I do not share the view of some colleagues."
"The EU's delay in responding at an appropriate level was deeply shocking and is unacceptable; senior EU leaders were not visible."
"However, I welcome the response, as now set out by the Commission President."
"The current figure for loss of life is over 150 000, and it is feared that the effects of the tsunami, through diseases like cholera and malaria, will claim more victims."
"However, we must not take for granted the great outpouring of support from the public, who were way ahead of the politicians."
"We must now prepare for the time when donations turn from a flood to a trickle, once the glare of the media is turned away from Asia."
"I would like to make two suggestions."
"One is that we should somehow try to legislate, or to get Member States to legislate, for the 0.7% of GNP contribution, as required by our commitment to the United Nations."
"I do not think it satisfactory, even in the motion recently adopted by this House, to express the that this will happen by 2015."
"What happened in South-East Asia indicates how urgent this is, and the Commission should now be trying to work for some sort of a treaty base to compel Member States to meet this commitment of 0.7%."
"Secondly, implementing a coordinated and sustained effort by donor governments gives rise for concern."
"Some time ago, a EUR 2.5 billion commitment to Honduras for reconstruction after Hurricane Mitch was barely delivered on to the extent of one-third of that commitment: this is totally unacceptable."
"This House is not going to accept that once the glare of publicity leaves South-East Asia, the commitments we make now will not be met."
"– Mr President, the tsunami means that we must rethink our whole development policy."
"The fight against poverty must become a core commitment so that today’s interdependent world may be governed by criteria of equality and justice."
"With the tsunami, all of us, rich or poor, are in the same boat."
"I do not think it is enough to reprogramme what has already been allocated or even to buy fishing boats in Europe and give them to fishermen in the affected areas."
"We have to move on urgently from words to deeds, cancelling the debts of all poor countries, opening our markets to trade with those countries, allocating 0.39% of Europe’s GIP to development aid by 2006 – in line with the moral commitment we accepted at Monterey – and, lastly, establishing a levy on international transactions to finance development and thus to meet the Millennium Objectives."
"Mr President, I would like to add to Mr Martens’ words of appreciation for the Commission’s rapid and effective response to the request for aid."
"There are three points I should like to discuss."
"First of all, there is a point I should like to consider in my capacity as a member of the Subcommittee on Human Rights."
"One of the shadowy sides of tourism in that area, including large-scale tourism from Europe, is the trade in women and children and the violation of children’s rights."
"A situation such as this again makes evident how dark this shadow is."
"It would be right and proper for the European Union to make money and manpower available to tackle that very issue and to demonstrate, in that dark situation, that we too are on the side of the people, and to solve that great evil."
"My second point concerns the enormous damage suffered by fisheries."
"As we in Europe have a great deal of expertise in that area, it would be appropriate if the European Union, as well as concluding fisheries agreements across the world, were to assist those coastal areas at this particular time, ensuring that the necessary attention is given to equipping fishing vessels and safe fishing, that high levels of funds are invested in this area and that we focus on this accordingly."
"The third point concerns food aid."
"Very often in large-scale food aid, we notice that, due to enormous price rises on account of the enormous extra demand arising in those areas, the poor in nearby regions suffer as a result."
"In that respect, the European Union could play a leading role in ensuring that those markets are not disrupted, and that in terms of food purchasing, it is considered worldwide how that issue could be solved."
"It is then that the quality of aid can improve in the areas close to those affected, too."
"Mr President, I thank the presidency for briefing Parliament just after last week's Council."
"The occurrence of the catastrophe meant that global security had failed, and, this time, terrorists cannot be blamed."
"It was caused by nature and global unpreparedness."
"Both the UN and the EU are taking action but they must learn a lesson from this."
"We need to make global the early-warning system that could have saved lives; the EU's Galileo system could help."
"We need to invest in the Union's civil protection system, coordinating and strengthening prevention and the rapid-response capability for all Member States."
"We need to make use of the Union's military logistics – not just for Member States – to assist in the accessible areas affected and to invest in capacities and their rapid implementation in similar emergencies in the future."
"We need to follow closely and politically the reconstruction in Aceh and in Sri Lanka to prevent the resumption of war."
"Finally, the EU and its Member States need to honour commitments under the Millennium Declaration and engage all rich nations in fighting the tsunamis of poverty, which kill hundreds of thousands every month through hunger, disease and war, in particular in Africa."
"I should like to conclude by saying that we should not let the dead die in vain."
"This tragedy must be the turning point for global governance and for a just globalisation."
"– Mr President, the globalisation of solidarity is having a visible effect."
"On Monday, we had a meeting with the Commission to discuss what concrete financial aid the EU could provide, thus backing up its words with practical action."
"It is encouraging that sufficient funds have been made available, but it is doubtful whether it will reach those who need it."
"In the EU, people have donated billions; one television programme in Germany brought in EUR 40 million."
"Those who are often accused of being interested only in themselves did not look away; when reports were shown of the hell in paradise, they were watching them."
"It is to be hoped that the measures that have been planned will succeed;"
"I am thinking here of, for example, the installation of satellite-based early warning systems – to which Members have referred – to prevent disasters."
"There is also the need for the speedy reconstruction of villages, towns and the environment on which people depend for their livelihoods and for expert care for traumatised widows and orphans."
"What particularly concerns me now is the aftermath; if the survivors are to be helped in the long term, we need partners and allies in the shape of NGOs, many volunteers who can help people where they are, and we also need effective structures to develop partnerships between towns."
"Some of these have not yet come into being."
"Tourism must be revived there; these ASEAN and SAARC countries, some of which I know well, are waiting for us, their friends, to return to them."
"Let us hope that people will still be helped when the newspapers have found other things to write about and the cameras have been switched off."
"Mr President, the whole world is struck with horror at the extent of the catastrophe, and so I welcome all the more the great generosity on the part of the EU, the Member States and, above all, of the public."
"While there is an urgent need for emergency aid, we also need to ensure the long-term and sustainable reconstruction of the stricken regions, and it also appears to me that the donor nations need, as a matter of urgency, to discuss seriously the generous remission of the affected states’ debts, and, in addition, work towards a peaceful resolution of the conflicts in Sri Lanka and Aceh."
"It is a matter for shame, though, that a debate is now being set in motion as to whether Germany, among other countries, is even in a position to help."
"I am referring here to Mr Stoiber and Mr Wulff, who otherwise always parade the Christian aspect of their party around as if it were a monstrance."
"Fortunately, though, the overwhelming majority of people takes a different view, not only in Germany and the EU, but also around the world – something that the people of Beslan have shown by their outstanding example."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, none of us can get these images out of our minds – these images of suffering, death, destruction, mud and tears – and the cries for help, the cries of despair and lamentation, not to mention the stories told by the victims, are still echoing in our ears."
"We are witnesses to one of the greatest of natural disasters and know that it is not the only one in the world."
"We live in a global world, faced with global responsibilities, and we are in search of global solutions."
"We have to acknowledge our increasing dependence on one another and that we are closer to one another than day-to-day political polemics and debate would have us believe."
"First of all, I would like to thank those people who, even though affected by the disaster and with needs of their own, helped many citizens of our Member States."
"I would like to thank the millions of donors, who, rather than averting their gaze, are looking to see what they can do; who are not merely lamenting the disaster, but doing something about it."
"I would also like to thank the public services, the aid organisations and the volunteers, who set their hands to the task immediately."
"I do also have a request. I would ask the Commission to make haste to put the projects out to tender, so that the co-funding can be secured and all offers of help can be coordinated."
"Secondly, I would ask that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner’s request should not simply be filed away in a drawer, for we were all taken by surprise by the violence and extent of the catastrophe."
"Even at home, in our own states, we can do more in the way of crisis management, coordination and prevention."
"We still have to learn what could be done better."
"Thirdly, I would like to ask the Commission whether, in the interests of long-term support for its aid measures to the worst-hit countries, it is contemplating making use of the Regulation on a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from July 2005 to the end of 2008, and, if that is the case, by how much does it envisage the preferences for the benefit of the affected countries being extended?"
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there can be no one in this House who doubts that the countries affected by the tsunami tragedy need rapid, effective and coordinated aid."
"The European Union must do more than merely send funds, however."
"We cannot limit our role to that of a generous donor who believes that sending out money will solve the problem."
"We must plan a programme of long-term infrastructure and economic reconstruction in the countries of South-East Asia and Africa affected by the tsunami tragedy."
"In addition, a special early-warning system should be put in place to protect the international community from similar disasters in future, and special funds should be set aside for these measures."
"As a member of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of South Asia, I would ask that this Delegation become an active and natural point of reference for issues concerning aid for tsunami victims and measures to prevent any irregular use of funds, as the latter could occur if proper monitoring procedures are not put in place."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, concern is sometimes voiced that aid measures for victims are becoming a strange kind of competition between individual countries and organisations, and that all that matters is who gives the most."
"A belief that certain interests, and not always innocent ones, are trying to profit from this aid, or in other words that this aid is not in fact unselfish, but that it serves a particular purpose, is also occasionally behind these concerns."
"Yet I do not share such concerns in the face of an act of solidarity on such an unprecedented international scale."
"On the contrary, I would be more than happy to see nothing but solidarity in our conflict-filled world, and nothing but solidarity of this kind, not hostile or violent solidarity aimed at pitting the strongest against the weakest."
"There are at least two issues to which we must turn our attention, however."
"The first is the following question: why are the financial contributions of individual countries noted so scrupulously in lists of aid donated?"
"Why do we refer to the contributions made by Germany, France or Sweden, and not the to contribution made by the European Community?"
"We are Europeans, after all."
"We stress this fact at every given opportunity, yet unfortunately as soon as money is involved, nationalist sentiments come to the fore."
"The second question relates not to the principles according to which aid is granted, but to the way it is organised."
"The tragedy in Asia has made us painfully aware that, just as we need a central headquarters where military actions are coordinated in times of war, we need a central headquarters where aid can be coordinated whenever disasters occur on a scale such as that in Asia."
"We are all aware that we live in a divided world, and that we will not succeed in setting up such an institute at a global level, but we must set up a rapid reaction centre of this kind at EU level."
"Voltaire called for such a thing after the earthquake in Lisbon, an event he could not accept as he claimed it defied his reason."
"Today we know that such events do not defy rational thinking, and this is all the more reason why we must take rational steps to counter them."
"Mr President, there was a good response from the Commission, given the organisation for providing emergency aid that we have at present, but the disaster gives much cause for reflection."
"A lot could have been done differently, both at EU level and in those countries mainly affected."
"Historically, the problem is that, generally speaking, too little attention has been given to the readiness to respond to disasters."
"It is relatively simple to mobilise large amounts of money both from the general public and from governments in an emergency situation."
"It is difficult obtaining resources for preventing disasters and preparing to respond to them."
"It has, for example, been known for a long time that the countries around the Indian Ocean had no system of warnings against not only tsunamis but also other major disasters, especially cyclones."
"Nothing has been done by the governments concerned or by various donors."
"The only country in the area that has acted upon the risks and prepared itself effectively is, in actual fact, Bangladesh."
"In the same way, the EU civil crisis force that is now being discussed could already have been established."
"This is not the first time that the need for such a force has become apparent."
"EU activity should be more coordinated specifically in this area."
"Coordination and cooperation are required not only in order to set up this force but also in order to organise all the relief consignments in an emergency situation."
"There is a lack of coordination in this area."
"The UN has the main responsibility, but we know that the UN does not have the required capacity."
"A far better coordinated EU – and I am talking here about the Commission and the Member States – could have been of great help at the height of the disaster."
"That is something we must pin our hopes on for the future."
"Finally, the reconstruction."
"Just like a number of other speakers, I should like to see the EUR 350 million talked about by Mr Barroso this morning take the form of fresh money rather than be extracted from the ordinary budget."
"If rapidity of response requires the use of already appropriated resources, we should ensure that these are subsequently and appropriately replenished."
"Otherwise, Asia will, as a region, miss out on EUR 150 million in development aid."
"Finally, I would direct my last point to the Commission."
"Examine seriously all the reports that show how badly the ecology of the area had been damaged prior to the disaster through misdirected exploitation."
"In the reconstruction, it is vitally important to take account of the environment if the necessary conditions of life are not to be further eroded and if the risk of further disasters is to be reduced."
"Mr President, natural disasters cannot be prevented, but the political dimension of such an issue can be found in international cooperation in the development of emergency and early-warning systems."
"By investing in these we might be able to minimise the number of human casualties."
"I do not know if a certain organisation hit the nail on the head last week when it estimated that EUR 0.5 would have been enough to put observation buoys in the Indian Ocean to warn of danger, but the funding for this project had not been found."
"In any case, the example is a telling one in terms of the figure given."
"Preventive action is always many times cheaper than dealing with disasters after they have happened."
"It has now been decided to establish an early-warning system in the Indian Ocean region."
"Telecommunications companies will be able to be linked up to the system."
"They will be able to collect information on impending disasters from the monitoring system and send warning messages to people travelling in the region in their native language."
"This is excellent – in this way, we will be able to transform this immense loss and tragedy into an experience which in future may save human lives."
"It is good that EU Foreign Affairs Ministers and Ministers for Development Cooperation are responding quickly, agreeing on EU measures to help people in the crisis area and begin reconstruction."
"Nevertheless, we need to remember that the promise of new rapid deployment troops concentrating on civilian rescue operations was not a new and creative idea."
"It was a promise of troops that was not delivered on in time: according to the decisions taken at an EU summit in 2001, the troops were supposed to be ready by the end of 2003."
"Now a new deadline has been set for 2007; who knows what it would have been but for this disaster."
"We just have to hope that all the promises made will be kept."
"We all knew that natural disasters occur all the time."
"This incident alerted the Western world, as the presence of tourists made it seem so near."
"Hopefully, this awareness of human distress and mutual solidarity in the world will be permanent."
"This is about human dignity."
"Help is needed when the face of human suffering is a foreign one."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency, I would like to thank the European Parliament for this debate, which testifies to the great groundswell of solidarity shown by the peoples of Europe when this terrible calamity struck."
"The Council has listened carefully not only to your House’s suggestions, observations, and comments, but also to its criticisms."
"I would like to make it very clear that Europe has been neither inactive nor passive."
"It acted quickly – very quickly, indeed – and at every level, in providing humanitarian aid, organising consular cooperation, maintaining a state of alert, preventing the outbreak of epidemics, and, politically, confirming the UN in its coordinating role."
"There has also been very effective cooperation between Parliament and the Council."
"This very morning, in the context of the trialogue, which took only a few minutes, we managed to raise EUR 100 million, that being the first instalment of additional humanitarian aid."
"What this shows is that, in cases of urgency, our institutions work marvellously well."
"The measures decided on by the Council on 7 January are being monitored on a regular basis and the Council will ensure that any further action that proves to be necessary is taken."
"Close coordination with the UN, with the other donors, and with NGOs on the ground will continue, thereby guaranteeing the aid’s maximum effectiveness."
"I also commit the Presidency to a continuation of this dialogue with Parliament and to regular exchanges of views with it on the various measures that are decided on in order to address the problems faced by the countries affected by the disaster."
"Although I am unable to reply to all the questions that honourable Members have raised, there are some that I would like to revisit, starting with the question of the need to reinforce the European instrument for coordinating civil protection."
"To be sure, this instrument already exists, but its coordination needs to be improved and its means reinforced."
"The President of the Commission this morning announced that it would be submitting to the next General Affairs Council proposals for improving this instrument."
"This is quite definitely an important and core issue."
"Among the other issues that have been raised, I would refer in particular to that of the vulnerability of children, to which we must attach enormous importance, cooperating fully not only with UNICEF, but also with specialised NGOs in this field."
"Another question touched upon the internal conflicts raging in at least two of the countries affected by the disaster."
"These internal conflicts must not, of course, be allowed in any way to prevent humanitarian aid being given and getting through to the people who need it."
"No doubt the European Union will be able to involve itself further in helping these countries to find solutions to these conflicts, by which they have already been ravaged for some time, even for many years."
"The Council also undertakes to monitor the performance of its commitments, particularly the financial ones, to follow up its aid and to remain present on the ground, particularly during the reconstruction period, which will be crucial, in that it will follow the humanitarian aid stage, and Europe must very definitely be present and involved in it."
"I would also like to highlight the issue of debt relief, concerning which a meeting has been held today."
"I believe that the help countries need with this must indeed be given to those who ask for it."
"My final, and important, point has to do with preventing natural disasters and giving early warning of them."
"We need to invest more in this area."
"The fact is that we must make use of all the technological means at our disposal in order, in so far as possible, to prevent a repetition of such catastrophes as these or, at least, to limit the fallout from them."
". Mr President, your debate today on the issue of the earthquake and tsunami in South-East Asia shows the commitment of the European Parliament to see action by the European Union to help the countries and populations in need."
"I can assure you that the Commission will deliver the help that is needed and will do this in close cooperation with you."
"I thank you for a number of useful comments and suggestions in this respect."
"As regards the reaction of the Commission's Civil Protection Unit, it immediately organised the sending of Member State experts to the affected countries – the first experts arrived the day after the disaster."
"What are the concrete measures to be taken?"
"As the President of the Commission underlined, there are a number of proposals to be implemented, some of them in the short term, others in the mid- and long-term."
"On the humanitarian side, in addition to the support package already adopted, it is proposed that EUR 100 million from the Commission's Jakarta pledge be allocated from the emergency reserve."
"I understand that the budgetary authority has already agreed to this politically."
"On the reconstruction side, some EUR 350 million of partially new funds should be made available, and funds already programmed streamlined."
"I have noted your concerns about the reprogramming, but I should like to assure you that this improved streamlining of all the available funds is the quickest way to deliver aid and, in many cases, will be necessary, as some projects cannot be carried out in some of the affected areas."
"There is a proverb in my country: one who gives fast gives twice."
"It is important that we bear that in mind."
"Not only are the amounts of aid important; the quality and mechanisms for aid delivery are too."
"In this respect, the Commission should obtain the support of the Council and the European Parliament to use the derogations and accelerated procedures in full."
"Moreover, the coordination should be organised by the countries and the financing programmes approved by the governments themselves."
"Of course, budget support needs to be properly supervised to ensure sound financial management."
"Trust funds with the countries concerned, based either on UN and/or World Bank trust fund formulae, may be a good answer to this concern."
"My colleague, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, is currently visiting the US, meeting Mr Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, to discuss these issues."
"Besides humanitarian and reconstruction support, there are a number of flanking measures that need to be taken."
"The Commission has taken action in various fields: reinforcing EU coordination capabilities to respond to crises; debt relief for the countries in question; trade measures – one of the questions raised – such as the possibility of accelerating the entry into force of the new scheme for a generalised system of preferences; early warning systems; satellite monitoring and research and development; preparation for disaster management; fisheries; justice and home affairs; health and so on."
"Of particular importance here are the measures for early warning of disasters and preparation for crisis response."
"I also believe that prevention is crucial."
"The best help is to save lives."
"This tragic event needs to be seen by all of us as a kind of opportunity and commitment to organise ourselves better and coordinate action in the event of a disaster."
"We can agree that the European Union has a global responsibility."
"Such events can be addressed only in a global way, at a global level."
"Allow me to underline once again that the Commission counts on the support of the European Parliament in order to help the countries and populations in need."
"As I wind up the debate, I should like to state that I have received six motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on transatlantic relations."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Security Strategy confirms that our transatlantic relationship is unique and irreplaceable."
"By taking common action, the European Union and the United States can constitute a considerable force in the service of our shared values in the world."
"The conclusions of the November European Council refer to the responsibility shared by the European Union and the United States in the face of the major challenges such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the peace process in the Middle East, and the eradication of poverty from the world."
"The Luxembourg Presidency is firmly committed to implementing these conclusions."
"I am sure that today’s debate in this House will help us to accomplish this task."
"Relations between Europe and America are founded on shared interests and on the promotion of such shared values as freedom, democracy and human rights."
"They also benefit from the interdependence of their economies, something that is unique in the world."
"These factors, taken as a whole, explain why, even when the recent Iraq crisis was at its worst pitch, there was continuing trans-Atlantic cooperation on most of the major issues, whether the Balkans, the Middle East peace process, the fight against terrorism, or non-proliferation."
"Despite certain isolated differences, the economic relationship has continued to develop."
"The United States and the European Union share great responsibility for international economic and monetary stability."
"It is worth adding that the latest agreement on aircraft construction demonstrates our ability to resolve our differences in a spirit of cooperation and partnership."
"If the state of the relationship has been, and remains extremely positive, it is nonetheless true that it must adapt to change on three fronts."
"This morning, the President of the European Council stressed the fact that the status quo is not a credible option."
"For a start, the end of the Cold War has made for fundamental changes in the international order."
"Faced with the Soviet menace, trans-Atlantic unity was a necessity in terms of mere survival."
"Today, the more important element of choice and political will has been added."
"The tragedy of 11 September changed the way in which America perceives the world; it obliges us, too, to revise our definition of collective security."
"This obviously affects relations between the United States and the rest of the world, including the European Union."
"The internal transformation of the European Union into a more political union endowed with a common foreign and security policy, with a single currency and with an area of justice and freedom will inevitably be reflected in its relations with America, changing their quality and intensity."
"All these factors together means that, of the three major components of the relationship with the United States – NATO, bilateral relations and EU-US relations – it is the third that is growing in importance."
"In this context, President Bush’s visit to the European Union on 22 February acquires exceptional significance."
"The Presidency intends to take this opportunity to give the relationship fresh momentum."
"The President’s visit is a powerful political and symbolic act."
"We see it as communicating Washington’s acknowledgement of the shared interests and values that link America and the EU."
"This visit must be well prepared, and I will give close attention to honourable Members’ suggestions on the subject."
"We are, to be sure, advocating a pragmatic and constructive approach to the future, but it will also be an ambitious one."
"European unity is one of the conditions on which the establishment of a strong and balanced trans-Atlantic relationship depends."
"We have to work on it."
"It is also important that the EU should put forward its own initiatives in clear terms."
"Furthermore, as stated in the European security strategy, Europe must continue to develop its own capacities."
"There are few areas in which the EU and the United States do not cooperate."
"Time does not permit me today to look at all the policy areas concerned, but there are three that are particularly urgent."
"The first is the conflict in the Middle East, the resolution of which is a matter of vital importance not only to those involved in it, but also to Europe and the United States."
"We are working towards such a resolution within the framework of the Quartet, with the Americans, the United Nations and Russia."
"The latest developments in the region open a unique window of opportunity."
"Like the Americans, we Europeans must encourage the Israelis and Palestinians to seize this vital opportunity to relaunch the peace process and do everything possible to support the parties in their search for a just and lasting solution."
"I would add that Mr Poettering, speaking this morning, highlighted the political role that the European Union must play in the quest for the peace that is needed."
"The second issue has to do with Iraq and, over and above that, with the destiny of the region."
"Although the present situation there is extremely problematic, it is in the interest of all, and particularly in Europe’s interest, that Iraq should emerge from the present crisis."
"The elections at the end of this month will take place under difficult conditions, but we must hope that they will create the conditions needed for a democratic and sovereign Iraq to make a new start."
"Turning to Iran, the European Union and the United States, different though their methods and approaches may be, share the same objective, which is to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons."
"The European Union has embarked on more wide-ranging negotiations with Iran; we have high hopes of them, and that not only in the nuclear sphere."
"The outcomes that are emerging will be, or could be, a great success for the European foreign policy and for Europe’s approach."
"Finally, there is the disaster in Asia, which we have just been discussing, and which is a clear illustration of the need for good cooperation between the European Union and the United States when such calamities strike."
"The acknowledgement of the central role of the United Nations in coordinating aid, something to which many of you referred and which the European Union advocated from the outset, has been an encouraging sign in that the Americans very quickly came to accept it."
"There are very many areas in which Washington’s and Brussels’ views largely coincide, including the long-term stabilisation of the Balkans, Afghanistan, the main aspects of the fight against terrorism, which must reconcile the demands of freedom and security, and the relaunch of the Doha round, among others. In other fields, we have to accept that, although we have shared goals, we have different approaches, and Iran, as I have already stressed, is one of them."
"In short, there are areas on which we really do differ, including climate change, the International Criminal Court and capital punishment."
"Although we must try, by means of some sort of dialogue, to resolve our differences in so far as we are able to, we must also be realistic enough to admit that it will not always be possible."
"When that happens, let us, as friends and partners, be honest enough to acknowledge our differences, but also make sure that they do not affect our relationship as a whole."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to make one final comment."
"The best proof of the trans-Atlantic relationship’s maturity would be for us to talk less about this relationship in general than about the tasks we set ourselves towards the end of making the world a safer place and giving its economic, social and ecological development greater balance."
"It is true that this year’s second anniversary of the launch of the ‘New Transatlantic Agenda’ encourages us to reflect on the state of this relationship and of its institutional process."
"The Presidency is willing to listen to any suggestion towards improving it in a pragmatic way."
"It is by action and by the development of good policies through dialogue and cooperation that we will best be able to move the trans-Atlantic partnership forward."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to convey Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner's apologies."
"She very much regrets being unable to attend this debate."
"However, the reason she is not here is pertinent to this debate."
"She was due to participate in your debate as originally scheduled, but is now on her way to Washington for meetings with the present and future American Administration, including Secretary of State Colin Powell, future Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the future National Security Adviser, Stephen Hadley."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner will brief the Committee on Foreign Affairs on this visit on 25 January 2005."
"The Commission welcomes the opportunity to discuss transatlantic relations with you early on in this parliamentary term."
"Reviewing the state of our relations with the United States will be high on our political agenda over the next few months, and for good reason, since the outcome will have a major influence on developments in the transatlantic relationship over the coming years."
"This debate today is both timely and welcome."
"I would like to start by stating two simple and irrefutable facts."
"First, EU-US relations are truly unique and irreplaceable."
"Second, the balance sheet of the transatlantic relationship is fundamentally positive."
"On the economic front, we have the largest trade and investment relationship in the world, with figures like EUR 600 billion worth of trade in 2003, and an investment stock measured at EUR 1 500 billion in 2002."
"These investments have created, directly or indirectly, some 12 million jobs on both sides of the Atlantic."
"But our relations extend well beyond the domain of economics, even if some media reports continue to focus solely on past divisions over Iraq."
"We are working together with remarkable success in places such as the Balkans, Afghanistan and Ukraine."
"That being said, it is clear that the EU-US relationship must adapt to the changing security environment and to changing global priorities."
"It must also adapt to changes within the European Union."
"We are convinced that as the enlarged EU's foreign policy strengthens, so too will the scope and intensity of our relations with the United States."
"In essence, the European Union and the United States are both founded on the same principles and values: respect for the rule of law, democracy, human rights and of course free market economies."
"We also share many common interests, such as the fight against terrorism, promoting solutions to regional conflicts, dealing with third countries, improving transatlantic economic relations, concluding the WTO Doha round, and creating global prosperity."
"In many cases, we share the same strategy for implementing those goals."
"In others, although we share the same goals, we have different approaches to implementation."
"There are also issues on which our views fundamentally differ, such as how to tackle climate change, and on some aspects of human rights and international law."
"Looking at the key EU-US issues today, it is natural to begin with our multilateral efforts in the Indian Ocean."
"The recent human tragedy clearly demonstrated that in times of crisis, only effective international cooperation can prevail."
"EU and United States assistance has been vital, and together we have set a good example of effective multilateralism."
"We want to continue this preference for effective multilateralism by working closely with the United States on issues such as United Nations reform and climate change."
"Turning to one of the most significant areas of dispute between the European Union and the United States, my colleague Mr Mandelson announced yesterday that the EU and the United States have agreed terms for launching negotiations on subsidies affecting the civil aircraft sector."
"The objective of these negotiations, which will last three months, is to eliminate subsidies and to establish fair, market-based competition between Boeing and Airbus."
"With this agreement, the EU and US have confirmed their willingness to resolve the dispute that has arisen between them over trade in large civil aircraft, and to devote time and resources to doing so by negotiation, rather than pursuing the dispute through WTO channels."
"This is a significant move."
"However, it is the beginning of a process and not a conclusion."
"Much work remains to be done."
"The Commission intends to work closely with Member States and Airbus, as well as with the US trade representative, to achieve a final result that maintains Europe's competitiveness in this important sector."
"On regional issues I would like to highlight three areas of common priority."
"First, we should redouble our efforts to bring peace to the Middle East now that a new Palestinian leadership has been elected."
"It is crucial that we, through the Quartet, use the positive momentum among the parties to ensure full implementation of the roadmap without delay."
"Second, we must continue working together to help put Iraq on the road to democracy, peace, prosperity and stability."
"Third, we share the objective of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons capability and we should both do our best to ensure that Iran fully implements the Paris Agreement."
"Doubtless many of you have the feeling that we could do more and work better together."
"The Commission shares that feeling."
"In order for our cooperation with the US to continue developing successfully we must be united, consistent, effective and pragmatic."
"Important work is already being done to reinvigorate our ties."
"The Commission is assessing the contributions made to the discussion by the stakeholders on how to enhance the EU-US economic partnership and we will propose a strategy, with concrete steps, by the time of the next EU-US summit later this year."
"We are also reviewing the institutional framework of our relations."
"The Commission will submit a communication on both the framework for relations and economic partnership to Parliament and the Council in the spring, prior to the EU-US summit."
"The European Parliament has an important role to play in furthering EU-US ties."
"We have been listening carefully to your views within frameworks such as the transatlantic policy network, and we look forward to a general constructive dialogue with you on the future of the transatlantic partnership."
"You are an important ally for us in ensuring that this partnership flourishes and grows stronger in the coming years."
"We are convinced that further dialogue between you and the US Congress will be essential to cement a good basis for our bilateral relations."
"Finally, let me underline that the Commission attaches great importance to the visit of President Bush to Brussels on 22 February."
"We see this as a major opportunity to revitalise our partnership and define common priorities and missions."
"We will do everything in our power to ensure that the visit is a success and that it confirms what we already see as auspicious signs of an improving relationship."
". Mr President, I believe that this debate on transatlantic relations should leave aside all of its ideological waffle and focus, as the representative of the Presidency-in-Office has quite rightly said, on trying to replace the discord of the past with the harmony of the present."
"The European Union and the United States have a shared history, common values and the same passion for freedom, and this is because the transatlantic link is written into the genetic code of the European Union."
"It is clear – as both the Commission and the Council have pointed out – that we have differences separating us, such as the International Criminal Court, the Kyoto Protocol, extraterritorial laws and trade policy, which the Commissioner referred to a moment ago."
"But I believe that we must place much more emphasis on what unites us rather than what separates us."
"It is clear that the objectives we as the European Union pursue – as the President-in-Office of the Council said – with regard to peace, stability, the fight against terrorism, weapons of mass destruction etc. can be achieved much better in cooperation with the United States rather than by speaking out against them – as Commissioner Patten said in one of his recent speeches – just as the United States will be better able to achieve their objectives in cooperation with the European Union rather than in opposition to it."
"The United States are an admirable people; they represent 3% of the world’s population and are able to produce 30% of its goods and services, and they have been able to create a political, economic and military superpower that is unprecedented since the Roman Empire."
"I believe that the forthcoming visit by President Bush offers a wonderful opportunity to restore that strategic alliance, that harmonious partnership between the European Union and the United States, and to ensure that the values we both advocate – including human rights and fundamental freedoms – can be taken on in all regions of the world, be consolidated and be truly effective."
". Mr President, despite quite a few differences of opinion, we must, as a matter of urgency, improve relations between the USA and the European Union, which have, to a greater or lesser degree, gone sour."
"Paradoxically enough, it is the re-election of George W. Bush that offers the opportunity of making a new start in transatlantic relations."
"After all, President Bush, as he has already indicated himself, needs European involvement in order to be successful in the core task of his foreign policy during his second term in office: the fight against terrorism and, particularly, addressing the problems in the Middle East."
"In that respect, the interests of the United States and Europe still run parallel to a large extent, even if the gulf between us sometimes seems wider than ever."
"We have a few difficult years behind us, particularly where Iraq is concerned."
"President Bush has announced his wish to strengthen relations with his European partners, and in this light, we warmly welcome his visit to Europe next month."
"Both sides have to make an effort if there is to be a significant improvement in relations."
"The Americans will need to take greater account of their European partners’ views than they have done before, but Europe, in turn, will need to be prepared to let its own former differences of opinion become a thing of the past."
"We are therefore hopeful that the Americans will reassess their relationship with their European partners."
"We are also cautious and even somewhat sceptical, because for the time being, there are no concrete signs of real changes of direction on the part of the Americans."
"I am therefore convinced that in the near future, we will, in this House too, have even more extensive debates on transatlantic relations when the time comes to discuss an own-initiative report on the subject."
"We believe Europe must adopt a clear common position, on which basis it can conduct dialogue with the United States on how to tackle world problems together."
"The debate on transatlantic relations is therefore closely linked to the European debate about our own effective common foreign policy."
"In that respect, it is impossible to ignore the, at times, fundamental differences of opinion on how to tackle global problems."
"The fact that a number of issues, including Kyoto, the International Court of Justice, the disarmament issue and non-proliferation, will also be mentioned in the next few years is, to us, an important point in the discussion."
"These are all areas in which the differences are often still gigantic."
"Legitimacy of international action is one of those points we would actually like to mention, where the difference of opinion in the debate of the past few years has been crucial."
"The guiding principle of European external policy is multilateralism."
"We remain of the opinion that a decision to intervene should lie with the UN and cannot be taken by individual countries or coalitions of countries."
"Europe should defend that position, and we must make it an absolute priority to reform the United Nations and make it a truly effective and representative platform."
"It is preferable that this be done in tandem with the Americans, but we should not shy away from tabling our own proposals."
"Mr President, the EU and the United States have many values in common."
"We have a lot of historic links, and there is considerable gratitude towards the United States, which has helped us on many occasions."
"Together, we have a great responsibility to work for peace, democracy and human rights throughout the world and have a common interest in close and unreserved cooperation in the fight against terrorism and in the interests of global security, disarmament and effective international institutions."
"It is no secret that we have big differences when it comes to views of the International Criminal Court, Kyoto, multinational agreements, the treatment of the Guantánamo Bay prisoners, the death penalty and a number of trade issues."
"These are important issues for the EU and our citizens, and they are always on the agenda in discussions with the United States."
"Relations have also become extremely strained in connection with Iraq, and we can spend forever – as we have in fact done in this House – debating the whys and wherefores of what went wrong."
"We must put that behind us and together accept responsibility for the Iraqi people’s being able to enjoy peace, security and democracy."
"The opportunities for a fresh start in the Middle East peace process have also increased following the Palestinian election."
"This is a sphere in which the EU and the United States can together play an important role."
"We have a very important six months ahead of us."
"The two summits between the EU and the United States must lead to a new lease of life in our relations."
"Together, we can achieve a lot."
"It was good to hear of Luxembourg’s ambitions, even if the Presidency does not have its earphones on at the present moment."
"We hope that the Bush administration Mark Two will realise that there is much to gain from cooperation with Europe that is characterised by trust."
"The EU must also make great efforts, and I am therefore pleased about the constructive tone that exists in this House."
"We must formulate clear short- and long-term strategies for what we wish to accomplish, and how."
"A number of factual matters have been mentioned, as well as the matters of how we are to set up a free trade area and a Transatlantic Parliamentary Assembly."
"The EU has partnerships with most countries in the world."
"It is odd that we have such an insubstantial agreement with, in particular, the United States – our closest neighbour of all and our most important partner."
"That is why I look forward to what the Presidency and the Commission are shortly to present to Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the disastrous floods in South-East Asia have shown us how great is the world’s need for cooperation between Europeans and Americans, who, even though their abilities certainly differ, can, when they combine them, give the world the vital aid that it needs."
"The disaster has also shown, though, an urgent need for closer cooperation between us."
"A friendship must be able to cope with criticism and plain speaking."
"I am sure I will not be saying anything new if I list the critical issues that need to be put on the agenda again and again."
"From Kyoto to Guantanamo Bay by way of the International Criminal Court, there are problems that we must – and will – raise with our American friends, but we want to be fair too; we want to give President Bush a chance to mend the relationship in his second term of office."
"We very much welcome his statement that he attaches particular importance to Europe."
"Nor do we want to overlook the fact that, despite all the difficulties we have had and still have, cooperation is proving successful in many areas; whether between federal states, between think tanks or citizens’ initiatives, cooperation is working with extraordinary success in many areas, as well as in business and the economy."
"As for the future, many tasks await us; there is the conflict between Israel and Palestine, there is the mullahs’ regime in Iran to be brought to heel, but there is also hunger and disease to be combated."
"Here we must cooperate; the world cannot afford unilateralism."
". Mr President, on 22 and 23 February, the US President, George W. Bush, will visit Europe, where, after a visit to Brussels, he will be received in Mainz by the German Chancellor."
"I am delighted that protests will be held on the occasion of this war criminal’s visit, and I myself will be addressing the demonstration in Mainz."
"The fact that transatlantic relations are now so good surprises some people, but this is merely down to the fact that the EU’s policies do not differ in any fundamental way from the line followed by the US Government."
"The debate on the EU Constitutional Treaty made it apparent that EU Heads of State or Government want the EU, too, to become a global and even military player."
"Two examples of this are the militarisation of the EU, with the inclusion of an express commitment to rearmament in the new EU Treaty, and the fact that economic and monetary policy is based on neoliberal principles."
"As I see it, a form of transatlantic relations whereby the EU becomes a world power, mostly working together with the USA, but sometimes competing with it, is the stuff of nightmares."
"Mr President, at the start of President Bush’s second term in office, what transatlantic relations demand of the European institutions is a sense of realism and enlightened self-interest, which are valuable qualities, and they desperately need them."
"Indeed, it is the United States alone that can guarantee some sense of order in our complex and unpredictable world; the United Nations certainly cannot do it."
"Simply think of the recent mass killings in Darfur, Sudan."
"It is also Washington which guarantees NATO’s continued existence, thanks to which Europe need not fear conventional military threats today."
"Moreover, in terms of combating terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction, the European Union is really no match for the United States."
"Indeed, a sense of realism and enlightened self-interest on this side of the Atlantic Ocean require solid, open-handed, transatlantic relations."
"I truly hope that the need for this will come to be generally accepted throughout all the European institutions, including this House."
"Meanwhile, we now look forward to President Bush’s visit to Brussels being a fruitful one."
"I warmly wish the Council and Commission much strength and dedication for this visit."
". Mr President, I believe that transatlantic relations also include relations with Canada, as well as those with the United States."
"From listening to this debate, one would not think so."
"However, as Chairman of the European Parliament Delegation to Canada, I fully recognise the importance that the Canadian Government attaches to its relationship with the 25 Member States of the European Union."
"It is important that we continue to maintain a high level of dialogue at summit and ministerial level to address critical issues facing the European Community."
"The new EU-Canada Partnership Agenda was launched under the Irish presidency in Ottawa on 18 March 2004."
"It has established a coordination group to ensure the prompt and effective implementation at political level of decisions concerning all elements of the relationship between Canada and the European Union."
"This intensified dialogue will allow for a more strategic, sustained and coherent approach to all issues affecting Canada and the European Union in an increasingly wide range of sectors."
"These include: environmental issues, justice and security matters, migration and integration affairs, fisheries, education, culture, youth exchanges and transport security."
"We will work together to enhance the frequency and level of contact between the Canadian International Development Agency and EU agencies responsible for development assistance in order to bring forward common approaches."
"Global issues of maintaining peace and security are best addressed in an effective multilateral system within a European Union working together with the US Government, the Canadian Government and our partners at the United Nations to combat international terrorism, tackle global poverty and promote democratic values."
"We know what our collective challenges are in this regard, so let us go and meet them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, transatlantic relations are the foundation for the future of both Europe and America, especially given the increasing significance of China, India, or indeed of Asia as a whole, and also of Latin America, in particular Brazil."
"Rivalry between Europe and America is a dream come true for the enemies of Europe and the United States, and this is perhaps something that should be borne in mind by the participants in the demonstration in Mainz, referred to by Mr Pflüger."
"I say this as a representative of a country in which the overwhelming majority of citizens were opposed to the Iraq war, but are simultaneously in favour of close ties between Europe and the USA."
"The situation has now changed, as the outgoing/incoming President Bush is no longer vying for another term."
"He no longer needs to convince Americans and Europeans that he was right about Iraq, and will therefore be open to arguments put forward by the Old Continent, or in other words, by the EU."
"Furthermore, eight of the countries that recently joined the EU have traditionally had better and deeper relations with America than parts of the ‘old’ Europe."
"This means there is a new and improved outlook for the marriage of convenience between Europe and America, and indeed we know from experience that such marriages last a good deal longer than marriages for love."
"Europe is not Juliet Capulet, a compatriot of the President, and the USA is not Romeo."
"Cooperation and a strategic partnership between the USA and Europe are what is needed."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our relations with the United States of America are based on three factors; common interests, common values and competition."
"Competition must be organised sensibly, and economic competition is of primary importance."
"Our common interests are based on a desire to maximise security; this includes security in foreign policy, the fight against terrorism and other aspects, such as the major environmental issues, which need to be resolved."
"Moving on to competition, however, this also means that the major industrial nations of Europe and North America must unite, not at the expense of the poor, but by laying down a joint and fair framework, which is a key prerequisite for a peaceful world."
"In spite of the disputes which sometimes arise in connection with practical policies, our core values are the same."
"We have fared extremely well in Europe with a combination of these three factors, and it is because these relations were in place that this Europe of ours is, by and large, free today."
"We should make it quite plain that we are not building the European Union in opposition to the United States, but to make it strong and enable it to become a partner of the United States once again, as only those who are strong can become partners."
"There is, however, another aspect to which thought must be given."
"The EU has treaties, association agreements and suchlike with nearly every country in the world, and the Americans have NAFTA, APEC, and others, but apart from NATO no contractual agreements exist between the EU and America."
"For this reason, we should ensure the eventual creation of a transatlantic marketplace, which would help us in many ways; for example, in organising competition sensibly and in a way which does not violate multilateral frameworks, in jointly protecting our interests and in standing up for our core values."
"I believe this to be one of the main challenges facing us."
"Today we adopted the Constitution."
"Victor Hugo once said that he dreamed of a Common Assembly which would unite Europe in peace and maintain relations with the other great democracy on the far side of the Atlantic."
"I believe that this must be our goal, particularly on a day like today, when we have just voted in favour of the Constitution."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my speech will follow very similar lines to Mr Brok’s, although I will be focusing rather more on economic relations."
"The resolution includes a paragraph on the idea of a transatlantic marketplace, a proposal which has already been put forward in several of Parliament’s resolutions."
"It is an extremely simple idea, based on the premise that our economic integration is much deeper than we are aware and than we perceive it to be, as well as on the premise that this economic integration facilitates healthy growth and secures jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, and hence enables us to help the whole world participate in this prosperity."
"This applies to both the multilateral and bilateral agendas."
"What we lack, though, is a rational view of this economic and social reality in the political sphere."
"This means that we cannot continue with the existing New Transatlantic Agenda on its own, and especially not with the Positive Economic Agenda, which is far too technical and apolitical, as well as being impossible to explain to the public."
"Changes must therefore be made to these agendas, and we must develop some kind of plan, idea or strategy to form the basis of this transatlantic marketplace."
"What is needed is therefore not a free-trade zone, but a genuine harmonisation of the two economies, which in fact already exists in reality."
"The idea of the internal market must be adopted, realities acknowledged, geopolitical and geostrategic changes which have taken place in the world recognised and a model applied that already exists in the sectors of competition and trade, where experts work together across the Atlantic."
"One need only look at the current figures and the relevant Commission documents – for example the Quinlan and Hamilton report – to see that economic relations are currently very close."
"To give but one example;"
"US investment in the Netherlands in 2003 was at approximately the same level as total investment by US companies in the whole of Asia."
"I hope that this example will stir the Members of this House into action, and I hope that we can build on it and start to cooperate properly."
"Mr President, following the election of Mahmoud Abbas and the formation of a new Israeli government said to be in favour of withdrawal, there is renewed hope that progress can at last be made in the peace process."
"It is a fragile hope, and the window of opportunity of which you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, spoke is a narrow one."
"I would like to see our trans-Atlantic relations strengthened by the resolute commitment that the European Union and the United States must make, that this opportunity be not lost."
"The new Palestinian president must indeed be strongly encouraged in his self-confessed willingness to renounce violence and thereby relaunch dialogue."
"This courageous stance will, however, become untenable unless he soon – that is to say, between now and the summer – gets distinct indications that this attitude is in no sense a sort of capitulation."
"We have always known that this conflict, so long and painful, would, at its end, have neither victor nor vanquished."
"Whether rightly or wrongly, the Arab world regards the Americans as having taken Israel’s side."
"That is why there are such expectations, and not only in Palestine, that the European Union will balance perspectives and give its own guarantee."
"Here more than elsewhere, and now more than ever, our expectation of you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that this necessary complementarity of influences be reinforced and put to work for the sake of peace and in order to strengthen trans-Atlantic relations, which is indispensable."
"– Mr President, the course of transatlantic relations is characterised by the single imperialist policy of the United States and the European Union against the peoples."
"You have together unleashed three wars against the peoples."
"This is the first and major merit."
"Secondly, there is the common policy of serving and consolidating the interests of big business; division and competition for the sharing out of markets and spheres of influence."
"The decisions by the summit in Dublin set in motion the replacement of the NATO army in Bosnia by the euro-army, approved the aggressive plan for the Middle East, ratified and legalised the occupation of Iraq, promoted terrorist policy against the peoples and applied new anti-democratic measures, such as biometric data, global personal files and much more."
"A joint attack on pension systems and labour relations was likewise decided, together with the creation of better conditions for action by big business."
"The review of the transatlantic programme being debated expresses the demands of European and American big business to speed up anti-grass roots measures and the aggressive policy."
"That is why the workers, the peoples of Europe, have no delusions about the character of the European Union and the United States of America."
"Besides, you even accept here in the house that you have common values."
"To close, Mr Bush is coming, but he will have a macabre escort, the hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians murdered."
"The people of Europe will ..."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, leading EU politicians throughout the EU, and also in this House, have made certain statements and expressed certain opinions that underestimate the role played by the United States in the history of Europe."
"They also underestimate the importance of that role, both over the past few decades and at present."
"Such statements and opinions should be regarded as highly irresponsible, because transatlantic cooperation provides us with an opportunity to find common answers to the global threats facing humanity, such as poverty, natural disasters and environmental degradation."
"It also enables us to work together to combat AIDS and terrorist attacks."
"Unfortunately neither the European Union in its present guise nor the super-state outlined in the draft Constitution, with all its bureaucratic red tape, wastefulness and sluggishness, are capable of reacting in an appropriate manner to global challenges of a political or economic nature. The Americans take effective action and have a free market, whilst we have merely a caricature of such things in the shape of the Lisbon strategy."
"Relations between the European Union and the USA should be characterised not by stereotypes, an unjustified feeling of superiority and a desire to compete at any price, but by political realism, and we should engage in practical transatlantic cooperation instead of becoming mired in pseudo-platitudes."
"Mr President, it is of the utmost importance that we should, from time to time, deliberate about the state of transatlantic relations."
"The past few years have done nothing to improve our relationship with the United States."
"This is undoubtedly largely attributable to the US intervention in Iraq, but there are also other problems, and one that springs to mind is the unacceptable pressure brought to bear by the US administration, and the American President himself, in favour of Turkey being allowed to join the European Union."
"I do not think it does transatlantic dialogue any good if one party interferes in the other’s internal policy matters."
"Having said that, we should also admit that there is in this Parliament a certain kind of primary anti-Americanism, which certainly does not make things any easier."
"Europe and the United States share the same values, democracy, human rights, and the free market economy being among them. These are often referred to as universal values, but they are, in fact, Western, or rather European."
"We also share a number of common enemies."
"In the first place, there is the threat of Islamic terrorism, even though opinions differ as to how to address this problem."
"In this respect, we should not remain fixated too much on multilateralism versus unilateralism."
"In practice, multilateralism often means that we hide behind bodies such as the United Nations, so that, in practice, little or nothing ends up being done."
"We should not blame the Americans for our weaknesses in the military field and in the field of external policy; we have only ourselves to blame."
"We could take a leaf out of their book."
"Just think of the tsunami in South-East Asia."
"American military were very quickly on the ground to provide practical aid."
"The European Union was present in the form of Commissioner Michel who came to take stock of the damage and to share out a few bags of rice in front of the television cameras."
"The contrast was harrowing and spoke volumes."
"Mr President, I share the view of those, in particular our spokesman, Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, who have said that this issue of transatlantic relations should now be focused on what we have in common rather than on our differences, which we all know and which many speakers have mentioned."
"It is a time not to look back in anger but to look forward with hope."
"In this context, with the arrival of the President of the United States next month, is it not possible for the Commission, the Council and Parliament to think of three major areas where we could cooperate in the terms we have used in our joint resolution on a Community of action?"
"A Community of action that will seek to develop a peace initiative in the Middle East; a Community of action that will search for global security in the fight against international terrorism, cooperation in development assistance and in facing the new global challenges of the disasters in the Middle East which the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned."
"Last but not least, a Community of action that will pick up the ideas which, I hope, the Commission will come forward with on strengthening the economic partnership."
"That is the idea, which Parliament has endorsed on several occasions, of completing the transatlantic market and fixing a date of 2015, so that we can really mobilise the communities on both sides of the Atlantic to complete a barrier-free transatlantic market."
"Last but not least, the Commission will be coming forward with its review of the New Transatlantic Agenda, and we in this House have insisted on many occasions – and once again in the joint resolution – that we should take the opportunity to upgrade this relationship; show that it is visible to the peoples on both sides of the Atlantic, and not exclude, as the new transatlantic agenda does today, the political communities."
"We need to find a way to bring all the actors together in what we have called a partnership agreement, because I am certain that if, with the arrival of the US President, the opportunity is taken by the incoming administrations on both sides to shape a new strengthened transatlantic partnership, we all will be beneficiaries."
"Mr President, if you are to build a genuine partnership, there must at least be two parties to it, so can we expect from George Bush’s second term something different to the unilateral policy of his first?"
"The way the South-East Asian post-tsunami crisis has been handled would tend to lead one to answer in the negative."
"The Bush administration’s initial response was to propose the setting up of a coalition of donor countries around the United States, rather, of course, than place its intervention under the authority of the United Nations."
"The European view of this initiative is that it is a sign of ‘no change’ from the previous term."
"Europe must say to America, as one does to a dear friend, ‘you are cutting yourself off; your policies are isolating you.’"
"Not all the coalitions in the world will be able to do anything about it; they will not be able to paper over public opinion’s profound crisis of confidence in the United States."
"One French essayist summed up this widespread sentiment in these words: ‘The United States is in the process of becoming a problem for the world."
"We were more used to seeing them as a solution.’"
"Let the Americans defend their interests, let them resolutely defend their security; nobody will hold that against them."
"What causes doubts to arise, though, is the Messianic and ideological motivation that the US administration attaches to its intervention in Iraq."
"These doubts take root when human rights violations involve all the belligerent parties in Iraq, and doubts become grave concern when whole populations are infected with hatred of the West, as a reaction to an ill-thought-out military intervention which obviously underestimated how resistant the people of Iraq would be to the transition to democracy thought up by the Pentagon."
"The Americans did not always espouse this doctrine, though; in the past, they chose to focus their foreign policy on the search for consensus and a sort of general interest."
"They preferred agreement to coercion and acted within a multilateral framework."
"In so doing, the USA performed its duties as the world’s major power and strengthened its authority."
"The American intervention in Iraq put an end to that, but it is not too late to change, provided that the Americans themselves take the initiative in so doing."
"What must come first is the normalisation of their relationship with the United Nations."
"The UN is the sole authority competent to decide in favour of international military intervention, and we must invite the United States to join Europe in committing itself, on the one hand, to multilateralism and respect for international law and, on the other, to reform of the United Nations, particularly as regards the Security Council and the way it is made up."
"It is not only necessary to strengthen transatlantic relations now, but it is also possible."
"This relationship must not be based on rivalry of self-interest, but only on common interest and values."
"Coequal partnership is needed, but it requires a strong and united Europe capable of action."
"Without it, we are not able to enjoy the benefits of transatlantic relations."
"We need not deny that we have disagreements and conflicts of interest, but we must realise that we have a common interest in the most important issues, including the war against terrorism, the fight against nuclear proliferation, the Doha process and even the question of changes in climate."
"I believe that there is an opportunity to renew our relations now."
"President Bush’s upcoming visit can reaffirm this chance, and we must also do our best not to miss it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Bush’s approach to the major challenges of international policy in his second term is likely to differ somewhat from the approach he adopted in his first."
"It is likely to be less unilateral, more political, involve less use of force and be more open to dialogue with international organisations."
"This means that his visit to Brussels in February will be all the more important, and, as Mr Schmit has said, it ought to act as a major impetus towards more open transatlantic relations."
"It should also be an opportunity to familiarise ourselves with US plans for the next four years, and to set out our European expectations."
"In this respect, it would be useful if President Bush were to speak before this House."
"After all, he is a representative of Europe’s closest ally, so why should he not be invited to speak here?"
"At noon we voted on the resolution on the Constitutional Treaty."
"The Constitution is intended to help create a European identity, but there are those in Europe who would like to create this common European identity in opposition to America, by means of cheap anti-Americanism."
"This is not the right approach to take."
"Europe and America are linked by common values, as well as by their history, their Christian heritage and their common strategic interests."
"This is something that should not be forgotten when differences of opinion arise."
"It should not be forgotten either when we face new challenges, as our security also depends on coming up with a wise response to these challenges."
"I believe there are three key areas in which the United States and Europe should stand shoulder to shoulder in 2005."
"Reference has already been made to the Middle East and to the need for peaceful solutions, as well as to common security."
"I should like to note that attention must also be paid to Eastern Europe, or in other words Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, and to our common concerns regarding anti-democratic tendencies in the Russian Federation."
"The European Union and the United States should cooperate in order to set the process of democracy in motion in countries where this has not yet happened, such as Belarus, and to support pro-democratic trends in countries where the transition to democracy has already begun, such as Ukraine."
"– Mr President, we want Europe to be a friend of the United States."
"No global problem can be addressed without cooperation between the European Union and the United States."
"We therefore think it is right to take the opportunity offered by the new signals coming from the US administration to rebuild cooperation between the European Union and the United States and, in this context, President Bush’s visit will certainly be an important occasion."
"American decisions have certainly played a major part in the problems that have arisen in recent years, but the splits within Europe and our inability to put across our point of view have also been a factor."
"I therefore want to underline the fact that Mr Bush must find a Europe that is more united, true to its principles and proud of its identity."
"We must highlight what we have in common with the United States – freedom, freedom of the economy, democracy – but also what sets us apart, at least in relation to the current prevailing trends there – multilateralism, the primacy of law over force, and therefore the primacy of international institutions, which need to be reformed, the rejection of the death penalty and protection of the environment."
"Europe has to be able to influence the United States’ decisions, and it will be able to do so if it is united, if it is not split between a traditional, sterile anti-Americanism and the choice of those who rush to side with the coalition of the winners. Or the coalition of the willing, rather, because they are not winners, as the disaster in Iraq shows."
"Europe should therefore be itself, united and true to its principles."
"That will be the best basis for a more fruitful and constructive transatlantic relationship."
"Mr President, relations between the United States of America and Europe are going through a critical phase."
"Since the collapse of communism the main focus of attention for the United States and NATO has moved to Central Asia, and the EU is developing its own defence cooperation strategy."
"There are many issues that the United States and the EU disagree about: they must face up to the fact and discuss them."
"It is important that transatlantic relations in the future are built on dialogue, not confrontation."
"Whilst terrorist attacks might increase the feeling of solidarity between Europeans and Americans, they have also highlighted the difference between their ways of thinking and acting."
"The relationship is nevertheless unique and based not only on common interests and values, but also on competition."
"Regarding global issues, the EU and the United States need to act in a context of broader cooperation."
"Cooperation must be increased on environmental issues, natural disasters and humanitarian catastrophes."
"The EU and the United States should be involved together in the financing and building of effective early-warning systems in areas prone to risk."
"Finally, I wish to say that I appreciate the fact that President Bush will be visiting Brussels right at the start of his second term."
"Many thanks, Mr President."
"Poland has good reasons for attaching particular value to both the United States’ presence on the European continent and to cooperation between the EU and the USA."
"This is because of our geopolitical situation and historical experiences."
"Yet at the same time, Poland wishes to be a committed and entirely credible member of the European Community."
"We feel European, and we see our future as intimately bound up with that of the European Union."
"This places a clear duty on us to undertake efforts aimed at achieving the best possible relations between the EU and the USA, as we are aware of their particular value."
"The aim of such relations is security and stability, both inside and outside the Euro-Atlantic area."
"Another way to ensure this security and stability, and perhaps even the most important way, is through support for democracy wherever a chance presents itself of achieving such democracy."
"This results from a faith in our values and from the conviction that putting power in the hands of citizens is the best guarantee of stability and security."
"What requirements must be met to achieve democracy?"
"Firstly, societies must consent to the assistance they are offered."
"Secondly, the root causes of threats to stability, whether economic or social, must be eliminated."
"Finally, and this is an important point; extensive cooperation must take place within the Euro-Atlantic structure."
"Many examples can be found to demonstrate the importance of these three requirements for the attainment of our goals."
"The latter have not been attained in Iraq or in the Middle East, where it is difficult to talk of success, although the situation in Afghanistan has already improved somewhat."
"We can, however, celebrate a genuine triumph in Ukraine."
"We acted in line with the wishes of the people of Ukraine and eliminated the root causes of threats."
"In addition, extensive cooperation took place within the Euro-Atlantic structure."
"Yet we should not forget that long-term support and long-term cooperation, in particular between the European Union and the USA, are needed to ensure long-term success in Ukraine."
"The proposed common foreign policy, provided for in the Constitutional Treaty, may prove to be an important instrument, allowing Europeans to act appropriately."
"This policy leads us to hope that our support for a free and democratic Ukraine will have the desired effect."
"I thank you."
"Ladies and gentlemen, since the end of the Cold War transatlantic relations have undergone a transformation, and have become one of the pillars of a novel and newly emerging world order."
"There can be no doubt that these relations are no longer exceptional, as they were during the last century."
"They are, however, a reliable and stable point of reference for both the USA and the European Union in a new international context."
"Despite all the differences between American and European policies – differences which became even more pronounced during President Bush’s first term – the European Union and the USA are still each other’s closest partners with regard to both political and military matters and economic and cultural issues."
"The European Union cannot tolerate unilateral measures by the United States that take no account of the architecture of international relations."
"America should not exploit its military superiority to impose its political will on the rest of the world and to place itself above international law."
"It should not exploit such superiority to dominate the political situation throughout the world."
"The modern world does not need US domination."
"Instead, it needs intelligent cooperation between the European Union and the USA on the fight against terrorism and against the causes of terrorism, and on measures to extend democracy and ensure respect for human rights, respect for international law and the development of a global civil society."
"It also needs joint initiatives to promote economic growth in developing countries, sustainable development, the elimination of hunger and the reduction of poverty on Earth."
"As I have already said, at the beginning of the twenty-first century the world does not need US domination, but cooperation between the European Union and the USA."
"At the same time, we must also subject anti-American sentiments in the European Union today to a critical analysis, as we cannot allow a pan-European nationalism opposed to America to emerge in Europe."
"Europe does not need to create an enemy overseas in order to construct its own political identity."
"In other words, Europe does not need the new kind of ideology Hanna Arendt warned against in the 1950s. Quite the reverse is the case."
"The European Union needs to take measures to familiarise modern America and its citizens with the achievements of European integration in recent years."
"Mr President, this debate has rightly highlighted the need actively to rebuild relationships between the USA and Europe."
"That need has been recognised by almost all sides across the House."
"Certainly it is reflected within our Parliament's delegation for US relations."
"This is not only because we enjoy the most important global trading relationship, a trading volume of more than EUR 1 billion per day, but also because we share a common interest in finding solutions to major issues such as climate change, terrorism, security and peace in the Middle East."
"Since the re-election of President Bush, we have noted the many positive comments from the US Administration in support of better relations."
"Europe has seen visits last month from Secretary of State Colin Powell, today from Head of Homeland Security Tom Ridge and will see a visit tomorrow from Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist."
"I understand that President Chirac will visit Washington in the next few weeks."
"All this is welcome but these visits have almost all taken place within the context of bilateral relations rather than through visits to EU institutions."
"On the day when this Parliament has strongly supported the new EU Constitution, it is worth noting that the US still largely sees its European relations in these bilateral terms."
"I have high expectations that our new ambassador, Mr Bruton, will be able to raise the profile of the EU."
"I suggest that he be invited in future to attend debates of this nature."
"I also welcome President Bush's intention to visit the EU institutions next month, but I await further details of how widespread the US authorities consider EU institutions to be."
"For instance, I am not aware that he has any intention to address this Parliament."
"I believe that our Parliament also bears some responsibility here."
"In 1999 we gave our full support to the creation of a transatlantic legislative dialogue, major parts of which we and the US have never implemented."
"As Mrs Mann said previously, we gave our support to the creation of a single transatlantic market by 2015, but we have not seen many steps towards taking that forward."
"I believe we need a renewed sense of purpose to reforge the transatlantic relationship."
"I trust that we will take the very many positive ideas and words of this debate forward into practical and effective steps, which will be to the mutual advantage of both sides."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief, as I see that there is very wide agreement on the need not only to strengthen our trans-Atlantic relationships, but also to resolve the differences that have recently become apparent, and build a strong relationship across the Atlantic."
"The idea of setting out a sort of programme, a list of economic and political priorities, strikes me as a useful one, and one on which work needs to be done, particularly in view of President Bush’s visit to Brussels."
"The idea of creating a transatlantic market place is not an entirely new one, but it must be gone into more deeply and thought through in a mature way."
"It is important in its own way, provided, of course, that it fits in with our concept of multilateralism."
"Transatlantic dialogue therefore needs to be stepped up at every level, and the reason why I include your House in this is that, although power in America is in the hands of the administration, that is to say, the President, there is also an important centre of power within the Congress."
"I therefore think that it is very important to build up inter-parliamentary relations within the context of a renewed dialogue across the Atlantic."
"Someone pointed out that we had had nothing to say about Canada."
"I would remind you that the Prime Minister and President of the Council made reference to Canada during his speech this morning."
"It cannot be denied that our relations with Canada are of crucial importance in the context of this trans-Atlantic dialogue, and so we treat them with the importance that they deserve, but the fact is that, today, we have focussed primarily on trans-Atlantic relations in respect of the United States, in view of what has happened, and in view, not least, of President Bush’s visit."
". Mr President, listening carefully to the discussion and suggestions I detect a very positive spirit, which encourages me that we can take the debate, and our relations with the United States, still further."
"It is true that we have been through a turbulent period, but it is also true that we have now emerged from that period, showing that the transatlantic relationship is still strong and durable."
"The EU-US summit of June 2004 clearly demonstrated how much we have in common and the readiness of both sides to focus efforts on the key challenges ahead."
"It could be described as cooperation between partners with common interests and common values who are competing with one other in a fair way."
"I would like to touch on matters that have already been raised concerning the question of the transatlantic agenda."
"As you know, the relationship today is based on the Transatlantic declaration of 1990 and the new Transatlantic agenda declaration and action plan of 1995."
"Those are the instruments which guide the new relationship with the United States."
"However, following calls from the European Parliament, and most recently from the Foreign Affairs Committee Resolution of April 2004, we are reassessing the framework for our relations."
"We are launching an independent study, to be completed early this year, assessing the current cooperation framework."
"It will include an analysis of alternative preferences for cooperation."
"The contractor will also look into the advantages and disadvantages of the framework agreement."
"However, what we have always held to be important is the substance of the relationship."
"We believe that it is the substance that matters and try to focus on that."
"Concerning economic issues and economic cooperation, I would underline that the Commission strongly supports the aim of closer economic cooperation between the European Union and the United States."
"The last EU-US summit called for a forward-looking strategy to promote integration, drawing on ideas from both sides of the Atlantic."
"The consultation of stakeholders ended in December 2004, and we have recently been assessing the results."
"The aim is to identify and overcome the real obstacles facing economic cooperators, with the new strategy to be presented to the next EU-US summit in 2005."
"It is too early to commit to any option at this stage, but we should certainly continue to reinforce cooperation in the areas highlighted, especially in the European Parliament's recent resolutions on the transatlantic partnership."
"The European Parliament's input will be welcomed as we review our economic relations with our US partners."
"We are facing many common threats: international terrorism, Aids, poverty and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"We need to be constructive in engaging on issues where we have differences, such as climate change, the International Criminal Court and trade disputes."
"It is clear that EU-US agreement is a necessary condition for progress on global issues."
"The recent catastrophe which we all faced is a clear lesson to us all that we cannot do things in any other way."
"We need to lay the groundwork for an effective multilateral system, based on a revitalised United Nations in which the United States fully participates."
"Finally, I should also underline that relations with Canada – which have been mentioned – are truly flourishing."
"That may be why more has not been said about them."
"The transatlantic partnership with Canada has always been an extremely important relationship for us."
"Mr President, there is a simple reason for this."
"Canada has already been mentioned several times, but I believe that this report and the resolution should really concentrate on Europe and the USA."
"If the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission wish to make repeated references to Canada, however – and such references are indeed sensible and necessary – I would ask them not to forget Mexico."
"As Chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee, this is a matter of some importance to me."
"If we are going to discuss NAFTA, then we should discuss NAFTA as a whole."
"I would ask you to bear this in mind."
"– Mrs Mann, that was not exactly a point of order according to the Rules of Procedure."
"At the end of the debate I have received six motions for resolutions(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the Council and Commission statements on debt relief for developing countries."
". Mr President, this debate on debt relief is opportune."
"Discussions on debt relief for the countries seriously affected by the disaster in the Indian Ocean are going on in Paris."
"Relief of this sort must be on a substantial scale and be implemented rapidly."
"I might mention, incidentally, that the Paris Club is meeting today to discuss the possibility of a moratorium on the debts of the countries that want such relief."
"Let us acknowledge, though, that the situation of Iraq, which gave rise to this question and this debate, is quite specific and quite exceptional."
"The debt relief for the Republic of Iraq, and I would call it substantial debt relief, which was decided on by the Paris Club in November, is without doubt indispensable if the country’s economy is to be rebuilt, and also if a sovereign Iraq with democratic and legitimate institutions is to be reborn."
"Nevertheless, the question of the relief needed, as I have just said, for Iraq’s debts, also arises – and, let me say, with the same urgency – with reference to the least developed countries."
"It would be incomprehensible, not to say absurd, for debt relief to be granted only to a country that had fallen victim to a natural disaster or to conflict."
"Absolute poverty itself gives rise to real disasters on a daily basis, in the shape of malnutrition, chronic illiteracy, high rates of infant mortality, AIDS, and more besides. It stands in the way of development and promotes all sorts of conflicts causing thousands, indeed millions of deaths, which the media often ignore and pass over in silence."
"We see, then, that the relief of the poorest countries’ debts is at the heart of the fight against poverty as well as of support for a policy aimed at eradicating it and of the relaunch of a development process in line with the millennium objectives."
"A high level of debt and a debt burden no longer in proportion to a country’s economic capacity hamper any prospect of development and lead, paradoxically, not to the hoped-for economic upturn, but to the rampant destitution of the poorest countries’ populations."
"Faced with this state of affairs, the European Union has not been inactive, nor will it be so in the future."
"The Monterrey conference saw it make practical commitments, the potential revision of which will be debated at the April General Affairs and External Relations Council."
"Its efforts at relieving the debts of less developed countries took practical form in the HIPC (High Indebted Poor Countries) initiative, which was proposed by the World Bank and the IMF in 1996 and reinforced in 1999."
"This is a coordinated approach aimed at bringing the poorest countries’ debts down to a sustainable level, including not only public, bilateral and multilateral debt, but also trading debt."
"This initiative has the potential to help forty-two countries, thirty-eight of which are in sub-Saharan Africa."
"The results achieved to date are positive but, as yet, insufficient."
"Little impact has been had on trading debt."
"Around 60% of the HIPC initiative’s funding was provided by the European Union."
"A number of creditors have not yet done anything about relieving the debt."
"The United Kingdom’s forthcoming presidency of both G8 and the EU has made debt relief for the least developed countries a priority objective."
"We want to work closely with the United Kingdom, thus enabling the European Union to develop a coherent and ambitious approach in this area."
"Debt relief must continue to be one of the priority objectives of the EU’s cooperation and development policy."
"It cannot be addressed in isolation from other policies: trade policy, including the adoption of a new generalised preference system, positive conclusions from the Doha round that are favourable to developing countries, increased development aid concentrating on the eradication of poverty, support for good governance, and the settlement and prevention of conflicts."
". Mr President, we all agree that for some developing countries external indebtedness is a major obstacle for growth and development."
"We should acknowledge the merits of the debt relief initiative currently applied, the Highly Indebted Poor Countries – or HIPC –Initiative, which was launched in 1996."
"This is the most comprehensive debt relief initiative ever taken."
"It will reduce the debt burden of the highly indebted poor countries by approximately two-thirds, demonstrating a commitment to poverty reduction."
"The Commission and the Member States have gone beyond the HIPC requirements."
"Most Member States have committed themselves to cancelling 100% of the bilateral claims."
"The Commission has done the same for all special loans in least developed countries eligible for HIPC debt relief."
"However, it is now widely recognised that HIPC relief will fail to ensure long-term debt sustainability."
"It is clear that more needs to be done for the poor countries that benefit from the HIPC Initiative."
"Pressure is increasing to extend debt relief to the other developing countries."
"The World Bank and the IMF are developing a new framework for long-term debt sustainability in low-income countries."
"This should help to prevent the accumulation of new debt."
"The Commission is following this debate closely to ensure the transparency of the decision-making process."
"The Paris Club of creditor governments has developed the so-called Evian approach to deal with non-HIPC countries."
"It takes into account debt sustainability considerations, allowing the Paris Club to adopt its response to the financial situation of the debtor country and to make the resolution of crises more orderly, timely and predictable."
"One application of these new rules was the Iraqi case."
"The Commission is not against debt relief in favour of middle-income countries."
"It supports the Evian approach of the Paris Club, which looks at the financial situation of each country rather than defining standard terms as has been done in the case of Iraq."
"Iraq is not indebted to the Commission but, as a sign of solidarity with the Iraqi people, the Community pledged a contribution of EUR 200 million to the Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq at the Madrid Conference."
"However, the Commission does not want assistance for Iraq, whether through debt relief or other mechanisms, to be given at the expense of the poorest countries."
"More recently, the UK and the US have both called for 100% cancellation of multilateral debt for low-income countries, although with different approaches towards its financing."
"The proposal of full cancellation may appear attractive, but it entails risks in terms of aid allocation."
"The Commission's finance study demonstrates that the HIPC Initiative has already distorted the allocation of aid because the levels of debt relief are not related indicators of poverty, nor – and this is very important – do they reflect performance in tackling poverty."
"The countries benefiting most from the initiative are by no means the best performers or the poorest countries within the group."
"Some examples will illustrate my point."
"The country benefiting most on a per capita basis from HIPC debt relief is Guyana, with USD 769 per capita received."
"It ranks 92nd in the Human Development Index."
"However, Niger, which ranks 174th in that index, receives only USD 48 per capita relief."
"The total cancellation of debt for all African countries would lead to considerable inequalities in the distortion of aid among them, measured by their relative poverty levels."
"Eritrea – one of the poorest countries in Africa – would receive USD 56 per capita, while the Seychelles, one of the richest countries of the continent, would receive USD 2 572 per capita, which makes a huge difference."
"Further debt relief could lead to further distortions in aid allocation."
"In a world of limited resources, debt relief granted to middle-income countries should not detract from the amounts available to the neediest ones."
"So, debt relief is a bad aid allocation mechanism, but it can be a good way of delivering aid, as it provides a quick method of disbursement, ensuring a predictable flow of resources directly into the budget with limited transaction costs."
"It could also be used to protect vulnerable, low-income countries from the effect of exogenous shocks."
"In these cases, some sort of temporary relief of the debt could help mitigate the adverse effects of external shocks on the poverty-reduction strategies of beneficiary countries."
"That is also the case as regards the moratoriums, which, as already mentioned, were discussed today by the presidency in Paris in relation to the tsunami-affected countries."
"To sum up, debt relief is not a panacea which by itself creates new resources, nor does it automatically translate into services for poor people or economic growth."
"However, it may be an effective way to deliver support and a good way to provide swift assistance after shocks."
"To tackle poverty and to attain the Millennium Development Goals, the real challenge is to ensure appropriate levels of development financing."
"We need to reach agreement on new and sufficiently ambitious targets for official development assistance by 2009 for us to have a real prospect of attaining those goals."
"Debt relief can be a useful tool in that quest, but it can by no means offer a really full response."
". Mr President, the debt burden is a major problem and is once again receiving extra attention as a possible means of helping with reconstruction following the tsunami."
"I am glad to see the debt burden high on the agenda."
"Debt relief is one of the millennium objectives for development."
"Interest charges often weigh down heavily on the budgets of the developing countries, and, in some cases, cripple further development."
"Although we have to look into what can be done about this, the subject is a complex one and does not lend itself to impulsive action."
"I can imagine that for the countries affected by the tsunami, a freeze will be granted for payment of interest and redemption, but in general, debt relief should not be dependent on incidental tragic events."
"There is a difference between cancelling and relieving debt."
"Our group is not in favour of general cancellation of all debts, which some in this House advocate."
"We say ‘yes’ to debt relief, but only where it is necessary, only for the poorest countries and always subject to conditions."
"What we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have contributed to a resolution is a statement to which, indeed, the Commissioner has made reference: debt relief is not a panacea against poverty."
"We must realise that the amount that will possibly be written off will be deducted from the amounts available for development cooperation."
"Debt relief alone does not offer a country new sources of income, neither builds schools or hospitals nor reduces poverty in those countries; on its own, it provides no incentive for further development, the funds available for which will be considerably smaller after debt cancellation."
"Where the development of a country is concerned, an important part of the responsibility lies with the country itself."
"Debt relief makes sense only if it goes hand in hand with good governance, democracy, respect for human rights, and investment in the country’s own population; in short, if the money actually ends up with the poorest."
"Debt relief cannot, then, be a goal in itself; it is meaningful only if it is actually an incentive for development."
"Then we can be generous, but – as is the case in all forms of development aid – that generosity cannot be unconditional."
". – The European Union and the international community are preparing to write off some of Iraq’s debts and, at this moment, the debts of the countries ravaged by the tsunami."
"While I am glad to see this, these are reactions in the heat of the moment, associated with a pressing current situation, and it is the debt problem of the global south as a whole that must be treated with the same urgency and speed, for this disturbing reality with which we are faced is indeed urgent."
"The amount of debt repaid by the South in a year far exceeds the annual total of public development aid, and it is the South that is funding the North."
"Over twenty years, the countries of the South will have already repaid six euros for every euro borrowed and they will still be being asked for another four."
"If the South is to make progress, its debts must be cut back, and, today, practical responses are only slowly forthcoming."
"I welcome the United Kingdom’s initiative, it having announced its intention of cancelling its share in the debt incurred by the poorest countries to the World Bank, and I am impatient to see the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development as a whole do likewise."
"Were they all to follow the British example, 45 million more children would be able to go to school, 140 million people would be able to have access to clean drinking water – provided, of course, that the amount of cancelled debt was added to the current development aid, and provided that the North stopped taking with one hand what it gives with the other."
"Right now, it is imperative that a global, fair and sustainable solution be found to the problem of debt, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is persuaded that it is the European Union and its Member States that can take the initiative in this."
"They can do this by writing off all the poorest countries’ debts, by taking measures to alleviate the position of threshold countries, by no longer imposing ‘structural adjustments’ as conditions and, of course, as has been said, we have to make this part of an all-round aid policy and, with all haste, seek new sources of finance."
". Madam President, I am glad we are having this debate today on debt relief."
"It is vital that even as we pay necessary and proper attention to tsunami relief, we also remain focused on the wider and longer-term issue of poverty reduction and the millennium development goals."
"Debt relief is key to achieving the millennium development goals."
"In the past, the measure used to calculate whether debt was sustainable was a calculation of debt payment against export income, but the really crucial question is how much of the national budget is being used to repay debt."
"In many African countries, debt service payments still take up a larger share of the budget than health services."
"In Ghana, for example, 11% of government spending goes into repaying debt, while only 9% is spent on health."
"If we want debt relief to contribute to achieving the millennium development goals, then we need to acknowledge that debt is unsustainable wherever it prevents a country financing its poverty reduction programmes."
"It follows that international money to fund debt relief must be in addition to, and not instead of, aid."
"I am very concerned that the United States envisages a reduction in aid budgets to fund debt cancellation."
"In fact, debt cancellation needs to go hand-in-hand with an increase in aid and the ALDE resolution includes a renewed pledge that Member States give 0.7% of GDP as overseas development assistance."
"It also follows that debt reduction can only contribute to achieving the millennium development goals if it takes place under good governance."
"Nothing will be achieved if the money saved through debt relief is spent by a corrupt dictator on expensive palaces or, even worse, on attack helicopters to terrorise a section of the population."
"The governments of developing countries have a responsibility to invest in their own people, but we in the European institutions have a responsibility to make sure that flexible mechanisms for debt relief are available."
"."
"Madam President, the world finds itself in an extensive and continuing debt crisis, which continues to be one of the main obstacles preventing countries of the South, or at least a great many of them, from achieving independent and dynamic economic growth."
"This is made clear by two figures; firstly, a great many of the poorest countries are forced to spend over 40% of their GNP on debt servicing."
"In such circumstances, independent economic growth becomes all but impossible, and this is why we need a comprehensive debt relief initiative."
"Secondly, for every euro we now give in development aid to the countries of the South, an average of nearly EUR 1.50 is paid back to the countries of the North in interest payments."
"This is another reason why we need a comprehensive debt relief initiative; given that Indonesia, the country we are currently debating, would have to pay back EUR 4 billion this year, it is abundantly clear that this would immediately cancel out any kind of development or disaster aid."
"I was therefore delighted to hear the President-in-Office of the Council say today that he was in favour of full debt cancellation for Indonesia."
"We need an international conference on debt relief, but the Paris Club, being no more than a meeting of creditors, is incapable of staging one."
"We need an international conference in which participants include creditor countries and debtor countries, as well as civil societies which have been affected and which would act as monitoring bodies, with all participants having equal rights."
"Both the European Union and this House should lend their support to the holding of such a conference."
". Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, no one can have a good conscience about asking the developing countries to keep on repaying their debts, as they have already paid these debts back seven times over, and yet their liabilities are four times greater than they were to begin with."
"I should therefore like to contradict you on one point, Mr Potočnik; you quoted absolute per capita figures, yet such figures are not the decisive factor."
"Every inhabitant of Brandenburg, my home, is in debt to the tune of EUR 16 000, but our national economy is structured in such a way that we can cope with it."
"The national economies of the developing countries cannot cope with such debt, however."
"In my opinion, therefore, the main issue at stake is not whether we grant a debt deferment, debt reduction, debt moratorium or suchlike, but whether debts are cancelled, as these countries need the money that at present they spend almost exclusively on interest – not even on repayment – to tackle their economic, social and environmental problems."
"We would be helping them to help themselves."
"Anyone who thinks that this would cripple the rich industrial nations should take note of the fact that the Iraq war costs the USA USD 150 million every day."
"President Bush has asked Congress for a further USD 80 billion, and yet Pakistan’s debts run to a mere USD 11 billion."
"A comparison of these figures makes it obvious that the debt could be cancelled entirely, and this must be our goal."
"Furthermore, it is often said – and I have heard it said again in this House today – that debt is offset by development aid."
"I am sorry, but if the political will is there, and if we genuinely wish to help these countries, the poorest countries’ debt must be cancelled entirely."
"In addition, the rich countries must finally adhere to their voluntary commitment of spending 0.7% of GDP on development aid."
"Such an example should really be set for these countries and for the European Union."
". Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has undertaken to reach the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, which is both an ambitious and essential undertaking."
"The external debt burden of developing countries is an insurmountable problem. It makes it impossible to reduce the proportion of the population living in utter poverty."
"Having understood this, the European Union has already earmarked USD one million for debt relief."
"The HIPC Initiative encompassed 42 of the world's poorest countries."
"The amount of debt to be written off for 26 of these countries will be 50% or USD 25 billion."
"Other financial instruments will also be used."
"These and other measures, however, are still insufficient to decrease the external debt burden of poor countries."
"Therefore new opportunities and focused measures must be sought."
"A broader spectrum of countries should be given the opportunity of qualifying for debt relief, similar to Iraq."
"Debt Relief International should be more closely involved, and a real opportunity to escape from economic stagnation should be provided, moving purposefully towards reaching the Millennium Development Goals."
"– Madam President, on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party, I should like to express my great satisfaction and my appreciation of the European Union, the Member States’ governments, the international agencies, the humanitarian organisations and every individual European citizen for the colossal solidarity that they have shown in recent weeks."
"I welcome the decision made two hours ago by the members of the Paris Club to grant three countries affected by the tsunami a moratorium on their debt repayments."
"This comes after the agreement in November 2004 to cancel 80% of Iraq’s foreign debt, as a tangible sign of support for the reconstruction of that country."
"Furthermore, the examination by the Extraordinary General Affairs and External Relations Council, which met last week, of the follow-up measures for the affected countries – such as trade support and bilateral partnerships – had a positive outcome."
"My greatest hope, however, is to be able to see a similar commitment not only at times of war or natural disaster but on a continuous basis for those countries where conflict, epidemics and hunger are unfortunately on their daily agenda."
"According to the United Nations, in fact, there are at least 14 forgotten crises, most of them affecting African countries, for which the United Nations has requested support worth USD 1.7 billion."
"For the sake of those and other developing countries, we have to aim at fully achieving the Millennium Objectives, something that we are still far from doing, as well as reducing or cancelling their debt, if possible."
"That is an appropriate, necessary and urgent commitment."
"Madam President, I should like to join the previous speaker in thanking the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Schmit, for having placed our concerns regarding a new debt relief initiative in a broader context from the very start."
"I am somewhat disappointed at the Commission’s statements, however, which did not go anywhere near far enough."
"I agree with Mr Schmit that it should not only be the countries affected by the terrible natural disaster that are considered when talking of the implications of foreign debt."
"It is not only natural disasters which affect countries; it is also the devastating effects of poverty, which is on the rise throughout the world, as well as the fact that the amount spent by many countries on debt servicing is many times greater than that on social expenditure, and the fact that we are a very long way from meeting the Millennium Development Goals agreed on by all UN members."
"We are currently all very proud of our unprecedented readiness to make donations and provide assistance."
"I believe that we are entitled to be proud, but – and this is a point I should like to make to the Commission – we must not give a little with one hand and take away a lot with the other."
"The relevant figures have already been cited, and we must also ask ourselves whether it is morally justifiable, and compatible with good governance, for poor countries to have paid back the debts they incurred in the 1980s seven times over."
"Parliament’s resolution also states quite clearly that the HIPC Initiative, which has been described by Mr Potočnik as the most comprehensive debt relief initiative ever undertaken, is only a small step, and is of course by no means enough."
"I should like to know what the Council Presidency’s specific goals in this field are, both working alone and in cooperation with other international partners, as on the basis of your comments my impression is that the driving force on this issue will be the Council, not the Commission."
"Madam President, I believe we must beware of imagining that reducing or cancelling the debt is an end in itself."
"Instead, it is one of the many means at our disposal for aiding development and goes hand in hand with preferential loans, free funds and the system of generalised preferences we are implementing in Europe."
"Since this reduction in the debt is not an end in itself but a means, we must, I think, have the decency to bear in mind that it is a means made available through the efforts of our countries’ taxpayers and that it must therefore, of course, be made conditional upon the achievement of results."
"Our partners, and principally our African partners in NEPAD, have also understood perfectly well that they themselves have to make efforts, particularly in terms of good governance and respect for our common values, to put their countries on the road to development."
"Where this matter is concerned, let us therefore have the honesty to recognise that the best pupils must be rewarded."
"If it is agreed that reducing the debt is an operation in itself, consideration must also be given to the subsequent debt, since no country will, of course, be able to continue its development without getting into debt."
"We therefore need to have a forward-looking vision and not just appease our consciences by saying: the debt is reduced or cancelled; now let them get on with it."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for us, cancelling the poorest countries’ debts is, indeed, an absolute necessity if we wish seriously to tackle North-South inequalities and maldevelopment as much as underdevelopment."
"It must nonetheless go hand in hand with the more vigorous combating of corruption, tax havens and globalised financial crime."
"Nor can it involve absolving all those, including leaders of states, who have scandalously feathered their own nests out of disregard for their people and for sound budgetary management at even the most basic level."
"Cancelling the debt would also constitute a first stage in reforming our development aid policy in depth."
"A reconsidered policy of North-South cooperation should thus be based upon much more ambitious objectives, particularly regarding matters relating to energy, water, health and education, and should affirm and clarify the notion of the global public good."
"We urgently need a very strong commitment by the EU in this connection, accompanied by clarified objectives and backed by much greater resources – a plan equal in scope to the post-war Marshall Plan, but with a determinedly European name and structure."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, I shall first address the Council, because we have in fact just heard that the Paris Club decided a couple of hours ago to freeze the debt of certain countries affected by the tsunami."
"We believe this is a short-sighted decision, because we think those countries need not a moratorium but the cancellation of their debt, as had been proposed by almost all the humanitarian aid organisations – Oxfam, ActionAid, etc."
"You will know more about it than I do, Minister."
"In that respect I agree with the Commissioner: a different kind of trade policy is needed."
"Thailand was asking us to lower the cost of accessing international markets, but the West is unbending on that point: protectionist barriers cannot be touched."
"The last item on the agenda: it is not just Iraq’s debt and that of the countries affected by the tsunami that need to be cancelled urgently."
"Indeed, it would be a serious matter if the message being sent out to the international community were that it needs to be struck by a war or a natural disaster causing 200 000 deaths in order to be entitled to solidarity from the West."
"Madam President, there is nothing wrong with cancelling debts, certainly if it involves countries in desperate need, as is at present the case in South East Asia."
"As various speakers have said, though, one should not generalise."
"Some countries are governed well, and others badly, and we cannot promise all of them that we will write off their debts and solve their problems overnight."
"In practical terms, for example, it is unacceptable that Zimbabwe should be treated in the same way as Uganda."
"Every aspect, every country has to be considered on what is politically speaking the best solution, and debt cancellation is one of the ways of contributing to the country’s development."
"The resolution is extremely vague."
"What, for example, are the practical implications for the European budget?"
"I believe that only the European Investment Bank grants loans, and the European budget stands surety for those loans."
"What will happen if we cancel those loans?"
"How much will this cost?"
"Perhaps the Commission could elaborate on this."
"Madam President, the Council is able to concur with a good portion of what has been said."
"We have all understood the urgency and the exceptional nature of the situation confronted by a number of countries, particularly those affected by the natural disaster."
"Where Iraq is concerned, I do not believe that anyone doubts the necessity of helping with the reconstruction of that country."
"That being said, there does arise the issue of what is to be done for all the other developing countries."
"First of all – and I rather concur with what the Commissioner said – we cannot be content to proceed in the same way where everyone is concerned."
"Developing countries are not all alike."
"There are very different situations."
"I therefore believe that we must concentrate firstly, and crucially, upon the poorest and least advanced countries and ask what we can do specifically for them."
"In the first place, we can relieve, or indeed cancel, their debts."
"I believe that this is an initiative that must be supported and promoted."
"Within which frameworks are we to act?"
"There is the debate to be conducted within the framework of the forthcoming European Councils;"
"I mentioned in particular the April European Council which is to concentrate upon analysing and, if need be, revising the European Union’s undertakings when it comes to achieving the Millennium Objectives."
"There is the European Union’s support for the initiatives taken within the G8, particularly those of the G8 Presidency at the forthcoming summit in the United Kingdom."
"Europe must therefore promote this idea of debt relief or, indeed, cancellation."
"It cannot, however, do so indiscriminately as, by proceeding in that way, its action would lose credibility."
"Secondly, cancelling or relieving the debt only makes sense if the rich countries increase their development aid."
"The European Union has entered into undertakings in this regard, and they should be implemented."
"Thirdly and finally, the debt – large though it may be – must be placed within a broader political framework for development cooperation."
"There is no point in cancelling the debt if, at the same time, our borders are closed to certain imports from developing countries."
"There is no point in cancelling the debt if we then subsidise certain products in our own countries and thereby hinder the development of these same products in the developing countries."
"To summarise, I believe that cancellation is an important factor, though not the only one, in a development strategy, or genuine development partnership, which the European Union must buckle down to."
". Madam President, the Commission has taken careful note of this discussion on the important issue of debt relief."
"A number of important and useful suggestions and comments were made today."
